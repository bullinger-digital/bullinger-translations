      <p>S. We have summoned Johann Ehinger, as you instructed. He was one of the two who came here seeking a place for themselves. We therefore ordered him to come immediately or, if he did not wish to come, to write to you and inform us that he would not be coming.</p>
      <p>However, we fear that he will be poorly received because of the large number of his children; he has eight. Whatever happens, we will write to you without delay. From your letters, we have understood two things: one, that we must avoid envy due to excessive power, and the other, that Vergerius should be treated more civilly and honorably by me. From these, we can sufficiently infer what has been reported to you, even if you prudently disguise and conceal it with your circumspect words, speaking only as befits you, admonishing brothers and encouraging concord. Here, we deemed it necessary to respond, both to show you our innocence and to advise you not to believe everything from everyone. Most humane man, I beseech you, endure the tedium of this brief time for the sake of charity. So, to the first point: the brothers who preach Christ in our Confederation do not come to our assembly, who are of Chur, but whenever it seems fit to them, and to the place they themselves have appointed.</p>
      <p>Once gathered and present, they first choose one from among all to ask for opinions and carry out the other necessary tasks in that synod; two assistants (we call them assessors) are with him to advise him on what to do, so that everything may be completed more expediently and decently. When the synod is finished, another future one is announced, for which the gathered assign a place and day, very often outside our city, wherever it seems fit to them. Finally, when all are still gathered, they choose one of the brothers to carry out, in the name and authority of all, the more notable matters that may arise between synods, to write, if anything, I say, arises that cannot be postponed to the next synod. We call this person a minister, whom they have now more than once appointed as Father Comander, because he excels the others in prudence and authority; they have often appointed other ministers in other places. We have maintained this custom since the beginning of the reborn gospel among us. You may ask: why do I tell you this? So that from these decrees of our entire synod, your prudence may weave an apology for us, who are of Chur, against the slanderers who make us tyrants and the other brothers servants: does it sin if the minister appointed by all of Chur writes alone in the name of all, or if the one elected speaks more words in the assembly than others not elected to these, etc. Certainly, no brother has ever accused the ecclesiastics of Chur of aspiring to primacy, except for some excommunicated for their daily and manifest crimes, whose slanders this one now stirs up. "Why would he do this?" you ask. We did not want to appoint him as an inquisitor or visitor in our Confederation, which he has often dared to ask of us, and yet it is spread in printed books throughout Italy that Pietro Paolo Vergerio is a visitor in the jurisdiction of the Lords of the Three Leagues. If we had granted him the power, which he was not ashamed to ask for, then indeed we would have been distinguished men. But this leads to the other point, to which we now descend. Therefore, we have always received Vergerius honorably, even if his perpetual arrogance cannot please anyone, and he is little liked by many because of it. As for what is sought about me, I do not know, unless perhaps it is this, that I told him to his face that he is different from what he appears: outwardly he seems to be a tenacious adherent of pure Christian doctrine, which he always has on his lips, and a lover of brotherhood, but when considered more closely, he is not found to be the same.</p>
      <p>This word I may easily concede was not civil; but I will persist that it was true. Listen, I beg you, by your humanity and patience; the matter is serious for me: do not let me fall from your favor, whom I prefer to be approved by rather than by six hundred others. Therefore, a man who refused to confess the persons of the deity and the Trinity, who did not accept the perpetual virginity of the Lord's mother, who did not affirm the life of our souls after the death of the body, who praised Camillus Renato, a most pernicious Anabaptist, as orthodox (if you saw the book he wrote here against the baptism of infants and ours, which we received under the pope, in which he attacks you, the people of Zurich, by name): such a man, I say, carrying and expressing these things in his heart, Vergerius, so observant of pure doctrine and a pillar and support of the Christian faith in Italy, in Rhaetia, in Helvetia, wanted to be received into our fellowship and to be recommended as a preacher to be set over the church of Christ. Against another, who had said that in the celebration of the Lord's Supper it was not enough to preach the words of the Lord's institution from the pulpit, but that they should also be recited over the bread and wine placed on the table, this man, I say (otherwise a good man and most learned, cleared and praised to us by the most illustrious testimonies of the most Christian men of his church), Vergerius himself nevertheless abominated, clamoring, accusing, writing that he was a papist; that he was not a follower of pure doctrine who said such things; that he should be avoided, and many more such things. When he did not cease to urge and persuade that the former should be received, but the latter judged a papist and pestilent, then indeed I, when he did not stop persuading us, moved by the indignity of the preposterous judgment and because he continued to abuse our modesty, said that word to him, so that he might know that I understood the matter and finally cease to press us with his unjust request. Nor did I have this cause alone to object to him what I said, but many more besides, which I could recount, and what he attempted against the best brothers who did not want to supplicate to him. But I think this is enough of this; I know in whose presence I speak. Do not believe that I speak with a disturbed mind. I also praise the man, but not in all things.</p>
      <p>I have discovered more often than you how the man is. I am of the opinion that Vergerius will never love us unless we receive him as our lord and do whatever he pleases and shows us with a mere nod. We are less loved by our own people, among whom there is some authority, because we have Vergerius as a companion, not so much because of religion as because of his arrogance and pride. Nevertheless, we ecclesiastics receive him as always most honorably. Know this too: Celsus Martinengo, passing through here these days, defended both Vergerius and that Paravicino to me: that the word of the Trinity or persons cannot be proven from the canonical scriptures; that therefore, we who are disciples of Christ, not of the fathers, should not use external words; that the virginity of Mary after that first birth is not certain to us from the scriptures; that the baptistery should be removed from the temple.</p>
      <p>Comander wonders what they mean by these things; I think they carry more in their hearts, which they will soon pour out when they dare. From Italy, it is heard that there are those who do not fear to say that Christ was born of the seed of Joseph, and that what Matthew and Luke report about the conception of Christ by the Holy Spirit is otherwise inserted into the gospel. Ambitious minds cannot rest nor walk the same path with others.</p>
      <p>After this, I will never be so lengthy again. Now I wanted you to understand the whole matter and know that I am innocent; for what I did, I did not do unjustly. In the meantime, you can say with him: perhaps someday it will be pleasing to remember these things.</p>
      <p>Here there is a rumor that the King of France and many German princes are forming a friendly alliance. From Trent, we hear nothing at all, not even about the emperor. Comander and Pontisella send you many greetings, both of whom have read this letter of mine. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for us for a long time. Amen. If there is anything you wish us to know or do, write, command, most illustrious and most upright leader of the Christian army. From Chur in Rhaetia, the last day of February in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>In every way to the great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
