    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frey would have written long ago if he had not wanted to take into account Bullinger's great workload. However, since it is neither to be expected nor hoped that Bullinger would ever have nothing to do, and since a question has been troubling Frey, he asks Bullinger to take the time for it, especially since Bullinger would probably do this and devote even more time to him if they were to discuss it together.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Here is the matter in brief: As Frey was working on his "Loci communes" and went through Genesis, Chapter 29, he began to think about Jacob's marriages and to wonder whether Jacob was right (especially since the law later handed down by the Holy Scripture was already imprinted in the hearts of the [patriarchs, to whom Jacob also belonged]) to marry his cousins Leah and Rachel, the daughters of his uncle Laban, or not. So he referred to Leviticus 18 and Bullinger's treatise "Der christlich eestand." However, the hoped-for answer did not come, and he became even more uncertain. For both Leviticus and Bullinger, who refers to it, forbid marriage with a niece of the [deceased] wife, whereas Jacob's marriage (namely with a cousin) is not prohibited. Frey tried for a long time to find out whether such a marriage might be indirectly forbidden, but without success (even his colleagues could not help him further).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When he compared these degrees of kinship to explore whether perhaps the prohibition of marrying a niece could be explained by a closer blood relationship than is the case with a marriage to a cousin, he reached no solution, especially since in the first case [only] a kinship exists, but in the second case a blood relationship, which represents an even stronger connection. And when comparing the two degrees of kinship, they are equivalent: In the first case, the kinship runs 1. through the wife, 2. through her sister, and 3. through her daughter; in the second case, 1. through the mother or father, 2. through their brother [or sister], and 3. through their daughter [or son]. In the first case, the kinship relationship is descending, although not in a direct line; in the second case, it is a so-called collateral relationship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Since the Holy Spirit undoubtedly transmitted the necessary marriage laws through Moses (either explicitly or in such a way that they could be easily derived) and could not have forgotten anything important, Frey is only at a loss because he wants to find out how to solve this problem. However, he does not want to bother anyone with this perhaps trivial question nor do without an answer. Bullinger should occasionally share his opinion on this. For even though Frey knows very well that this question will seem ridiculous to Bullinger, he does not mind being laughed at as long as he is enlightened!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also from Frey's wife [...] and from all friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] Frey now has as a boarder the son [...] of Heinrich Kammerer, who was formerly the bailiff of Lenzburg and is now the bailiff in the neighboring Nidau. He still remembers that when he lived with Bullinger, the latter often invited the bailiff. The latter also sends his warm regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord. For a long time, my father, I intended to write to you what I am now writing, but the burden of your affairs always came before my eyes. Now, since I neither see nor hope for an end to them, and since the desire to know what I seek does not cease in the meantime, I pray that you will listen with a benevolent mind and distract yourself from your own affairs for a while, until you have taught me what I ask, since you would not do so unwillingly if I were present and perhaps speaking to you and others.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In brief: While I was reading and organizing the commonplaces of Genesis Chapter 29, I began to think about Jacob's marriages and whether he acted rightly or wrongly in marrying the daughters of his uncle, as the scriptures convey. I referred to Leviticus 18 and what you published in your booklet on marriage, and the more I hoped to be resolved, the more I became entangled. For Leviticus, as well as you from it, states: "A man should not marry or have the daughter of his wife's sister"; however, what Jacob did is not prohibited (namely, that a man should marry the daughter of his uncle or aunt or even his great-uncle). I searched for a long time to see if perhaps these things are implicitly prohibited, but neither I found it, nor could my brothers indicate it to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Hence, I wanted to consider these degrees of kinship in opposition to each other, whether perhaps the former ("A man should not marry the daughter of his wife's sister") touches consanguinity more closely than this: "A man should not marry the daughter of his uncle." However, I do not achieve this in any way, for the former is of affinity, but the latter is of consanguinity, which in my judgment binds more closely. Then, if you measure both, they surround the man equally: In the former, there is 1. the wife, 2. the wife's sister, 3. the daughter of that sister; in the latter, 1. the mother or father, 2. the brother of this one, 3. the daughter of that brother. Moreover, the first degree is in a descending line, though not direct, while the second is of a collateral line (as they say).</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now, since I do not doubt that the divine spirit fully delivered the necessary marriage laws through Moses (either in clear words or in such a way that the rest easily follow from one or more), and nothing necessary is forgotten, I am only at a loss and look around for how these things should be explained, not willingly bothering others with this perhaps trivial question nor willingly remaining ignorant of the solution. If you have time, communicate your opinion to me on this matter, and although I do not doubt that this little question will seem ridiculous to you, I will not mind being laughed at, as long as I am enlightened.</p>
