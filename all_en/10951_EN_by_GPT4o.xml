    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains about the absence of letters. Sends the Zurich opinion [on the Wittenberg Concord], which is to be presented at the upcoming Diet, and hopes that Basel, like Bern, will take the same stance. Wishes that Myconius and Grynaeus could have prevented Bucer's unwise "retraction." Zurich's response is not yet final and should therefore be treated confidentially.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>How is it, brothers, that you have not written even a letter for such a long time? Have you forgotten us? Where is that once very ardent love of yours for us?</p>
      <p>Here you have our response, which will be given to the Senate and our church at the next Diet regarding the articles presented by Luther. We send this to you, hoping that it will not displease you. If you can accept this with us or have not followed a different path, it suits everyone well. Certainly, it suits us with the people of Bern, whose response you have seen, I believe. It would not benefit the Swiss churches if we were divided, who have so far adhered with utmost harmony. Yet we hope for better things.</p>
      <p>Bucer has made the excellent cause of concord very suspect among our people with his (in my opinion) imprudent Retraction. He has indeed stirred up great envy among most of our people. How much courage he has given to the papists, how many opportunities for slander and blasphemy he has provided to both the weak and the malevolent, you know better yourselves. I wish this zeal for retraction had been hindered by you and begun with some more suitable reason. Now a different outcome has occurred.</p>
      <p>Consider this response of ours as communicated to you alone. We do not wish this to be presented to the people of Strasbourg before the Diet. For we are still awaiting the judgments of others. We will therefore perhaps add something or take something away. We will also stand by your judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 4, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius and Lord Simon Grynaeus, the most distinguished overseers of the church of Basel, dearest brothers.</p>
