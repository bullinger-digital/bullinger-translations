      <p>Greetings. On Tuesday morning, when the honorable and pious man was already prepared, the orator said: For the first time, everything has been clearly reported from Constantinople about the conflict between the two sons of the Turkish emperor. Thirty thousand men or more have fallen; Selim, whose side the father supports, has prevailed. Bayezid is in flight, considering either Persia or Egypt.</p>
      <p>The emperor has sent many thousands of horsemen to bring him back from flight and deliver his head to the father, though this is unlikely to happen unless the father himself pursues him; for they fear that if the father's anger subsides, he may easily regret it and the blame may fall back on them. It is reported to the legate that Heinrich, on his deathbed, bound his son by oath to preserve the old and ancestral religion and to respect Philipp, the king of Spain, and that his son Franz has given a written promise of this, which is believed to be in Philipp's possession. A fleet is being prepared against Tripoli.</p>
      <p>Nothing is more urgent than these matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his much-revered lord and patron.</p>
