      <p>Cracow, 27th October 1558.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. From Vienna, I wrote to your kindness, Bullinger, my dear friend and master, both about the debt of your sons and about Christoph Rotocher, my relative, whose attitude towards me is somewhat insincere and less than Christian. They owe me the remainder, which I certainly would not have demanded again unless extreme necessity drove me to it; he, contrary to the duty of a Christian, not to mention a preacher, seeks the art of withholding what is mine, which was given to him as a friendly loan by my wife, without my knowledge and in my absence, to assist his necessity. I beseech you to repay your sons' debt to my wife for your integrity, if necessity demands it, and to remind my relative Christoph of the duty of a Christian and a preacher; for if he does not return to my wife what he almost deceitfully extorted from her nearly a year ago, he should certainly know that I will reclaim my rights when I return. Until now, I have concealed this so as not to provoke everyone's talk against us and to avoid becoming a subject of gossip for all; and I did this all the more willingly because he himself had requested it and promised to deal with me candidly.</p>
      <p>However, when I desired it upon leaving, he almost refused to give an answer. Let him return those twenty florins, which he owes me, to my wife, from whom he extorted them; and for the debt of our relative John Billinger, I will not refuse to wait until the bows are sold. I pray that you will handle these matters with him for my sake.</p>
      <p>I forgot to write to you from Vienna about your son Christoph. He left for Venice shortly before I arrived there.</p>
      <p>The reason for his departure was that he could not be admitted to the Emperor's bakery. Uncertain rumors are spreading here about the Queen of Hungary, the widow left behind by Wida and the sister of the King of Poland. For two days ago, there was a consistent rumor that she had been sentenced to death by a noble Hungarian, whose relatives she had allegedly wanted to betray to Emperor Ferdinand and hand over to him. But now the rumor is that she has fled with her son to a very fortified castle and is besieged by the Hungarians. While I was signing this letter, a new rumor came; the Turks attempted to lift the siege but suffered a great defeat from the Hungarians.</p>
      <p>The Muscovites, having entered the borders of the Livonians, have captured five camps and several cities. Now they are besieging the city of Reval and its seaport.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland sent a delegation to help them. They were told that if they wanted the peace conditions, which they had agreed to uphold the previous year, to remain valid and inviolable, the king offered to free them from the enemy at his own expense. The delegates decided to report this to their prince.</p>
      <p>A certain Julius, an Italian who had first lived in Zurich with Master Frisius and then with Master Sebastian, because he could not be appointed to the royal books or sent to Paris for studies (although he could have been educated frugally, Christianly, and freely), returned to his monastic life like a dog to its vomit and the rogue hides in the hood... which I saw with my own eyes.</p>
      <p>The queen here is gravely ill with a dangerous disease, and there was almost no hope of life left; but she has recovered a little. The assemblies have been proclaimed, as is the custom of the Poles, for the day of Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>But they are postponed due to the queen's illness. For the king, who was otherwise in Petrokov, where the assemblies were to be held, is expected here daily. The papal legate was received kindly by his own, but mockingly by ours.</p>
      <p>For the city watchman played the melody of the song: "Preserve us, Lord, by Your Word" on his trumpet as he entered... Several nobles, through which he entered, bellowed with horns like herdsmen: others shouted in an unusual manner: so he could well understand how welcome his arrival was to the Poles. The Bishop of Cracow had summoned the preacher of the gospel to present himself to his judgment. He arrived here two days ago; and unexpectedly approached the bishop, who was emptying full cups with the papal legate, surrounded by a large crowd of nobles, and inquired about the reason for the summons. The bishop, stunned by the crowd of nobles, replied that he was completely unaware of the summons.</p>
      <p>Thus, advised by the nobles not to trouble or summon their preachers in any way in the future, they departed. I gave your book to Mr. John a Lasco, who expressed eternal thanks not only for the gift but also because it was dedicated to the Palatine of Vilnius. The Palatine is having the book elegantly bound, which, if the opportunity arises, I will offer to him myself; if not, I will send it: for the areas in which he is active are fifty miles from here. I found Mr. Lelio here, to whom I gave your letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and kindly greet the family and all learned friends in my name. Yours, Burcher, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>There is not much hope of gaining any benefit from this art. For the privilege is not sealed with the Polish seal, but with the Lithuanian one, which is only valid in Lithuania. To the esteemed, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
