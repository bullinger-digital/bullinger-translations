    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Addition to the previous letter (No. 2690), which Blarer had sent to Attikon through Gregor von Ulm:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer was now informed that the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] had his hair cut and washed just one day after being earnestly admonished to desist from his peace negotiations with the Emperor [Charles V]. When the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony] found him so well-groomed, he asked in surprise what this meant; whether he had nothing else to do. The Landgrave replied that it was like David with his sick child, who was full of anxiety during the child's illness, but cheerful after its death. He had been desperate lately because he was always occupied with the peace negotiations. But now that he realized nothing would come of it, he regained his courage, got himself ready, and would continue to do his best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] This news is to reassure Bullinger so that he does not despair of the Landgrave. In short: God takes away the courage of the princes and has also shown that the Landgrave is only human. All the other [Schmalkaldic Estates] advocated an attack against the Emperor. However, the Landgrave proved to be hesitant and opposed this plan so vehemently because he greatly feared the consequences of a possible defeat. Therefore, he commissioned (despite the dissuasion of the Elector and the other allies) the nobleman Adam von Trott to contact the [Emperor's ally] Margrave John [of Brandenburg-KÃ¼strin] regarding peace negotiations. The Margrave sent word to the Landgrave that he did not want to take up the matter; but that he could forward it to the Emperor if the Landgrave wished. The Margrave further stated that the Emperor would only engage in negotiations if the Elector and the Landgrave submitted to the Emperor with land and people. Despite everything, the Landgrave had another letter sent to the Margrave. The Margrave attached a handwritten note to his brief reply, which only stated: "1. Humiliation, 2. Release of prisoners, 3. Restitution, 4. Dissolution of the [Schmalkaldic] League."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] When the Emperor sensed the Landgrave's fear, he moved with some troops near the [Schmalkaldic], as if he wanted to attack them. But as soon as the Landgrave realized that nothing would come of his peace attempt, he dropped the matter, as already reported above. Due to the cold snap, the [Schmalkaldic] moved to Heidenheim [an der Brenz], which Blarer had already mentioned in his previous letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] From this, it can be well deduced that God punishes the [Protestants] because they trust Him so little. Therefore, He rightly lets them languish, whereby final death and ruin through the protracted war await them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] There is nothing else to report, especially since all the envoys from Konstanz have now returned. They want to see where the Emperor sets up his winter camp in order to take new measures accordingly, which, however, will not be better than the previous ones.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger should know that the French [King Francis I] is conducting strange negotiations with the [Schmalkaldic], which deeply distress Blarer. The King is making some hardly acceptable demands, which they hope to mitigate in the negotiations. For instance, the King demands that the Dauphin [Henry] becomes Roman King. However, Bullinger should not tell anyone about this or about the [despair] of the Landgrave, or at least not mention Blarer's name.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Furthermore, Francis I has arranged for [Sultan Suleiman I] to send a messenger [...] with letters of refusal to Venice. These are intended for the Emperor and the [Roman] King [Ferdinand I]. However, they are to be delivered only after consultation with Francis I. If Francis I decides to do so, it is hoped that this will have a paralyzing effect on the Emperor, as he would then believe that war and peace with the Turks depend on France. Suleiman himself (whose habit is not to officially declare war) sees this, of course, quite differently. He is willing to assist Francis I but would not be obligated to anything. As the hereditary enemy of Christendom (as is evident from his title "Enemy and Persecutor of all Christians"), he could still go to war. These are therefore only deceptive maneuvers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Blarer perceives these events as harbingers of Germany's certain downfall, for he cannot imagine where improvement could come from now. Nowhere is there seriousness, zeal, or a striving for improvement to be found. The world is completely obstinate! Bullinger should implore God for help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [P.S.:] Two of the Zurich pastors sent to Augsburg [Lorenz Meyer and Thoman Ruman] are accused of adultery, one [...] also of perjury, because he swore his innocence before the synod but was later proven guilty. If he could, Blarer would defend the accused. Bullinger should therefore report how it really stands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Furthermore, Blarer wants to understand why Bullinger recently [in letter No. 2606] mentioned that the pastors sent by the Baslers to Augsburg [Sebastian Lepusculus and Hieronymus Gunz] seemed unsuitable to him. Perhaps the Baslers sent those pastors to get rid of them? However, Blarer has never heard anything bad about these two.</p>

      <p>Regarding the previous letter, which I had sent to Attikon through Gregor von Ulm:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Dear sir and brother. As I wrote in the other recent letter, I have now thoroughly learned that the Landgrave, after being earnestly admonished to desist from such undertakings, as mentioned, has had his hair cut and washed with great care. Thus, he came to the Elector, who immediately noticed and asked him what this meant, whether he had so much time and leisure and whether the matters (the war affairs) were not more pressing for him than to present himself in such a way. To which the Landgrave replied: It is like David with his sick child. He was anxious during the child's illness, but cheerful after its death. So, he had anxiety and distress in the past days, and the treaty was always on his mind. But when he saw that nothing would come of it, he laid aside all discontent, regained his courage, and got himself ready anew. He intends to act henceforth as is proper, to the best of his ability.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I did not want to leave you uninformed about this, so that you would not be too alarmed by the previous news and completely despair of the Landgrave. But in short: God has shown that he is human and that He (God) takes away the courage of the princes. For all the others have recently unanimously advised that the matter be entrusted to God and that they should engage in battle. The Landgrave, however, opposed this with vehement words and a long explanation of what would come of it if it went wrong, so that one cannot be surprised at his faint-heartedness; there is much to write about it, but it is not necessary. Despite all the admonitions of the Elector and the others, he had the nobleman Adam von Trott negotiate with Margrave Hans about a treaty, who, however, sent word that he would not take it up and that it was not his business. But if he wanted, he would let it reach the Emperor. He thought, however, that the Emperor would not negotiate a treaty unless the Elector and the Landgrave presented themselves to the Emperor along with their land and people and submitted to his mercy and unmercy. Despite this, the Landgrave nevertheless approached him again. Margrave Hans replied briefly and enclosed a note in the letter, written in his own hand. There were only these four words: "1. Humiliation, 2. Release of prisoners, 3. Restitution, 4. Dissolution of the alliances." The treaty must stand on this, with extensive explanation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>And immediately upon this, when the Emperor noticed that the Landgrave had the hare in his bosom, he moved and made himself visible to our people at a small half-mile distance, to see if they would be inclined to attack. But when the Landgrave saw what the treaty must be, he dropped everything, as stated above. And in the meantime, the cold set in, so that they had to withdraw. However, our camp was the first to withdraw to Heidenheim, as I wrote to you previously.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Thus we see how God punishes and afflicts us and how there is no true heart and trust in God. Therefore, He rightly lets us languish and perish. And the long illness will certainly be death, and this protracted war will certainly be our ruin!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have nothing special to write to you further. Our envoys are now all at home, so we can no longer hear anything so certain daily. They are waiting to see where the Emperor will set up his winter camp, so that they can prepare accordingly. But they will act as they have done so far, as I fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>So I cannot hide from you in high confidence that the Frenchman has wonderful dealings with our people, which deeply frighten and trouble me. For they are now negotiating (God willing, that it may be thwarted) that he may enter into a defensive alliance with us, in which he has put forward and demanded some articles that are likely to be somewhat burdensome. However, they are still negotiating and hope for mitigation. Among other things, there is also an article that the Dauphin should be recognized as Roman King. But you should not tell anyone about this, or if you want to tell trusted people, do not say that you heard it from me, but from a good friend in general. So they also do in the aforementioned matters concerning the Landgrave.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Furthermore, the Frenchman has arranged for the Turk to send an excellent embassy with letters of refusal to the Emperor and King. The embassy arrived in Venice a few days ago. It has orders to first address the Frenchman about it, and if it pleases him, they should proceed with the letters; if not, they should withhold the letters. But this is a quick move, through which the Frenchman hopes to stretch the Emperor, if he sees that the Turk is so much concerned with the Frenchman, and peace or war depends on him (which is not the Turk's intention). For he has not said that he will not make the move if the letters of refusal do not go ahead, since it is not his custom to declare war in advance by letter; but he wants to be held as an enemy and pursuer of all Christians, as he always writes in his title. But nevertheless, they make such blue smoke! And the Turk does not care if he can help the Frenchman with this appearance to his plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Well! I know and can make no further calculation than that I fear these things are signs and harbingers of our certain ruin. I can see nothing anywhere in the whole wide world, wherever I turn, from which I can hope that it will be better in our Germany sometime, but it seems that we must go down completely. There is nowhere any true seriousness, zeal, or inquiry for true improvement. The world is completely astonished and hardened. Pray and beg as strongly as you can! For God must wonderfully convert us, or it is lost. Given on the first of December.</p>

    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>They affirm and slander that those sent by you to Augsburg are adulterers: especially two, one of whom has also combined perjury with adultery. For he, accused before the synod, devoted his head to dire curses and in every way most steadfastly denied having done anything of this; he prayed to God to be angry with him if he had done it. However, the crime was later uncovered and he was convicted of it. I would very much like to defend them if I could truly do so. Therefore, it seemed right to write to you about this, so that you may inform me how this matter stands, so that I do not believe it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>It also matters, besides other things, that you recently wrote to me about those ministers whom the Baslers sent to Augsburg, that they did not seem sufficiently approved by you. But perhaps the Baslers sent those whom they would gladly be rid of, although I hear neither Lepusculus nor Guntius have any stain of infamy.</p>
      <p>Observing to his friend and brother d. [Heinrich] Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
