    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes on the one hand about the Diet in Schmalkalden, where the instructed Ambrosius [Blarer] represents the prince [Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg] as well as the theologians of Konstanz, and requests an opinion on the confidentially communicated agenda items. On the other hand, he wants to know whether the Swiss would be willing to apply for admission to the Schmalkaldic League under the same conditions as the Tetrapolitan cities, should Luther not be satisfied with their stance on the Wittenberg Concord. He requests to discuss with others and respond quickly.</p>

      <p>Greetings and the peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>There are two matters, most honorable man, about which I write to you briefly. The first is that you should not be unaware that a meeting is now being held by those who stand by the word, and that theologians have also been called to Schmalkalden. The date, if I am not mistaken, is set for February 7th. I was compelled to approach Ambrosius in this regard, so that he might understand the mind of our church from me, which has been done. Now he has gone in the name of both the prince and us. The discussion will be about the cause of the council, whether it should be sought at the pope's institution or not, or rather at the emperor's calling, who is said to have added his vote. Then, since Satan seeks all opportunities to divide us through papal factions, by what means this can be conveniently avoided. For they think that it is not fitting for the papists that the cause of religion should be common to laypeople, whether princes or cities, but should be handled and defended by the ministers of the word alone. Finally, if the pope proceeds to some impious and intolerable conclusion for us (which nothing else is to be hoped for) and finds any sworn executors for himself, whether it be the emperor or some kings, what then should be done by us, whether we should obey their command or prepare a defense by sacred right. This is the summary of the Schmalkaldic discussion, which I wanted to entrust to your faith; for these things are not for everyone. I expect your judgment on these points, which you will not deny us due to your usual benevolence.</p>
      <p>The second matter, about which I write to your humanity, is concerning the cause of Lutheran concord. For I hear that the responses of some to the articles do not please Luther, and as far as our church is concerned, we have so far delayed the response and will not send it until we hear what the Schmalkalden meeting will produce. We hear very badly that we do not want to subscribe to the Wittenberg articles plainly without any exception of declaration. But as far as you Swiss are concerned, first we wonder whether Luther will accept your response. If he has accepted it, the matter is already settled. But what if not? Here, in a few words and not without great reasons, I would like to know from you whether you believe it would be pleasing to your people, not only the people of Zurich but also the other evangelicals, if they were received into the union of our princes and cities. Then, whether they could at some point address this desire to ours. Finally, whether you could agree to that form of concord or alliance, to which we once agreed with the other three cities. This form is such that we gave the Augsburg Confession, which you have read at some point. The Lutherans recognized it as sufficiently satisfying for concord. Shortly after, to make the concord firmer, ours also embraced the Saxon Confession, but not without a grain of salt, namely as far as the doctrine is concerned, but not the ceremonies. There were some things in that Saxon confession that at first glance offended ours. However, when they were more clearly explained in that apology, it seemed to ours to agree for the sake of the fruit of peace. And this concord has so far remained firm between both parties until this new kind of articulating and concording was invented. What then, to repeat this, if the Swiss churches would agree to this kind of concord, to which we agreed long ago? Concord could not be difficult to achieve if a way could be found. Now if the one that Bucer recently attempted is nothing and achieves nothing with Luther, another must be sought. I could hardly find a simpler (easier) and better one than if you all commonly said: "Well, how and in what manner the four cities have accepted the Augsburg Confessions and have thus been completely at peace with the princes and others, so we could also accept such." Who knows, if one could hear such from you, what the Lord would give.</p>
      <p>Therefore, respond to me to these letters as soon as you can, having also explored the minds of some others.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>The last of January.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
