      <p> Greetings. Today (reverend father in Christ) I returned from Pr채ttigau, where I first began preaching after our side finally won the votes. There is great hope; the community (or church, if you prefer) is very large, as large as any in all of Pr채ttigau. Some, when it came to voting, protested vehemently, which is not surprising. Certain respected old women came to me before the sermon, who begged by God that I should not be the author of the destruction of idols (which they count among the saints), otherwise they would be willing to listen to me. Before my arrival, there were those who threatened that if anyone ascended the pulpit; but by the singular grace of God, I was received very kindly, and even listened to very graciously by the opposing side. I explained the Lord's Prayer; you know how broad and popular a subject I had. But I also wanted to be entirely popular, so as not to aggravate those of the opposing side at the beginning. If only there were a good and modest man, whom our people greatly desire, who could continue the work. But I doubt where such a person could be found. That community has men, which in all my life I would never have believed, mountaineers, b채rgl체tt, of much reading and sufficiently practiced in sacred matters, and for rustics, sufficiently eloquent; however, I remember the proverb: a rustic orator should not be despised. The stipend amounts to 110 florins and more. They earnestly asked me to procure someone and indeed in a timely manner. </p>
      <p> It is through the goodness of our people, to avoid less unrest, that they agreed to leave the images in the church until St. George's Day and then remove them again, in the meantime appointing a preacher. If in the meantime there were a friendly, decent man, there would be no more need. But where can such a person be found? Many preachers do not seek Christ, but their own interests. What good work would that be! </p>
      <p> Perhaps I have written more than I should have, especially to you who are otherwise very busy. Your letters have been faithfully delivered to me. We have long since received from the people of Glarus the business concerning Glarus and those points which repeatedly emphasize the holy mass and that true faith of the ancients. Nevertheless, we give you great thanks, who leave nothing undone in diligence. I cannot send anything now; however, I know that Mr. Martinengo and Hercules will give timely warnings if there is anything worthy of knowledge. Stephan Heim has just arrived, having become a husband in the meantime, on the condition that he continues his studies. We eagerly await from France what is being done or in what state our affairs are. Please, reverend father, inform us and farewell most happily with all your people. </p>
      <p> Chur, June 21, 1563. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and always reverend father in Christ. Zurich. </p>
