      <p>Mr. Ulrich Hafner, who was appointed to Marthalen, Rheinau, and Benken, has informed my lords of his old age and poor health, and that he cannot fulfill such duties as required, with a humble request to remain with the honest people of Trüllikon as before.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Since then, my lords have been so moved by the aforementioned Mr. Hafner's request that they have graciously agreed to it. They have decided that the appointed lords will immediately return to Marthalen, Rheinau, and Benken to propose another candidate in place of the aforementioned Mr. Ulrich Hafner, from whom my lords, the council, and citizens may elect a preacher, so that the honest people everywhere may be served with sermons and the Lord's table during the upcoming Easter season.</p>
      <p>Done on Wednesday after Laetare, in the year, etc., 46, in the presence of Mr. Hab, the governor, and both councils.</p>
