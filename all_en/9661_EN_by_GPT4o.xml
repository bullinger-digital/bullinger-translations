      <p> Greetings. Regarding Ganthner, I expect nothing better than that he has caused some evil either through the discord of the citizens or through sedition. For I see that Satan uses his work, and that he is possessed by the devil. If indeed the magistrate allows such a disgrace to command him, well, let him have it, brother. Why does he not assert his authority against a man who is clearly factious, etc.? Our magistrate also prohibited all military service, especially Spanish, with penalties of body, life, and fortune on the past Sunday. But those who came to Zug yesterday report for certain that Spanish banners are being prepared in Zug, which are to set out for Belgium on the 11th of this month. They want to hold a meeting in Baden and nevertheless continue on their way. May they go to a bad end, never to return. Who has ever heard the like, that when misfortune arises, we rise up and people, whom we never knew, who have never done us harm or injury, want to strangle us for money's sake? We fill the measure; it will certainly overflow, if only upon their heads! It is said for certain that there have never been greater disturbances in France; the king has ordered his brother Alençon, the King of Navarre, Marshals Montmorency and Cossé to be guarded because of suspicion that they wanted to join with the Huguenots. </p>
      <p> It is certain, however, that Condé has escaped and came to Heidelberg in recent days. Meanwhile, there are those who say peace has been made. Namely, Christopher of the Palatinate and Louis of Nassau besieged Utrecht, Maastricht, and when they could not achieve anything, they wanted to go to Holland to Orange. When they came to Nijmegen, Mondragon, the Spanish prince, who has so far defended Middelburg to the point of surrender, clashed with them with the Spanish army and put them to flight, with about 500 scattered; others count far more. The princes themselves (who are said by others to have been killed) escaped safely to Dillenburg; Mondragon is also said to have been killed. But we will have all these things more clearly shortly. </p>
      <p> They clashed on the third day of Easter, etc. There are wonderful disturbances everywhere. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may preserve both our churches and us! </p>
      <p> Greet Lentulus, our brothers, and all our friends, whom you know, by name. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Zurich, in great haste, May 7, 1574. </p>
      <p> Yours, Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
