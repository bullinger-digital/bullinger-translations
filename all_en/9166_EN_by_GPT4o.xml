      <p>Most revered father, I will be brief with you now, partly because I have written more extensively to Mr. Haller, and partly because Kobler is leaving today unexpectedly and is urging me. I ask you to read with favor what I have given to Mr. Affinem. The people of Sondrio have been freed from the tyranny of the Beccaria family; beyond that, nothing has been concluded that is of any significance. Once the assembly is completed, I will diligently write to you about the proceedings. Now I ask you to have mercy on us and kindly take up our cause.</p>
      <p>There is much for me to do amidst the many traps set for me, in which I can barely take a step.</p>
      <p>Most urgently from Chur. Both Mr. Consuls and Campell, my inseparable colleague, send their greetings to you. 1573, January 19, Chur.</p>
      <p>Subscribed to your reverence, Th[obias] I[conius]. The church of Maienfeld sends 10 collected gold coins for the dispersed French; the rest from some others will be sent by Mr. Campell with letters until better times.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church, etc., his most esteemed and eternally revered.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
