      <p>Your letters have affected me in various ways, announcing various things, but more sad than joyful, except that it was pleasant to read about the concord of the people of Bern and Geneva, which the Lord may confirm and preserve. Yesterday, at nightfall, I received letters from Konrad Hubert, formerly the scribe of our Bucer, which I send for you to read and return with the next messenger. My son Johannes Gervicus writes that the King of Navarre, along with his brother, was captured by the French against the public faith given to them, as they had come to the assembly at the king's invitation, because the king was persuaded by the cardinals that faith should not be kept with heretics, just as Sigismund did not keep faith with Hus. Let us return to the path and turn with all our hearts to the Lord, urging, wherever we can, for mature repentance, so that Christ, having mercy on us, may cast back upon the heads and hard necks of the enemies of truth the loads of so many evils that they plan to impose on our shoulders, with His mighty hand, granting us lasting peace, by which we may glorify His name. But farewell. December 9, 1560.</p>
