      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, most esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>I openly acknowledge that I owe much to you, indeed to all the ministers of the Zürich church, but I do not see how I can repay such great kindness. One consolation remains, your singular humanity, which will consider a grateful spirit, when there is no ability to satisfy, as good and fair. If I cannot return the favor, I will nevertheless have and express the greatest gratitude as long as I live, and I will retain the memory of you with the greatest benevolence. I myself went to Crupecius and told him to his face what I thought about the letters he had written incautiously, which he accepted with a fair mind, as he acknowledged his error.</p>
      <p>I write to you briefly about the progress of the gospel and evangelical discipline in our churches, since you can communicate with Dr. Martyr about other matters and hear other things from Sebastian.</p>
      <p>When our elders recently convened a synod to deliberate on establishing order in the church, a certain person (whom I do not name out of respect, but Sebastian will tell you his name) presented his opinion, which many nobles supported, that the face of the church should be established in one place, namely, to handle church controversies and alone hold the administration's staff. To which some ministers cleverly remarked that the face is not far from the head.</p>
      <p>Therefore, according to their opinion, the face of the church will be in Poland, but the head in Rome, which are almost the same. Those who come to us from elsewhere deal with us in this way, namely, they consider the Poles to be foolish and stupid compared to their own outstanding wisdom. I therefore earnestly ask you, most esteemed teacher, not to hesitate to assign this task to someone who can describe to me exactly what the method is for convening and celebrating a synod in your churches, who are summoned to judge controversies, whether elders are chosen from the people, what the method of the superintendent is, whether one observes or, as they call it, visits the churches. I beseech you not to hesitate to write this to me for the glory of God, since I incautiously omitted this when I could have obtained it in person. I ask more diligently because there are some of those clever ones who deny that elders should be chosen from the order of ministers, but only from the class of laypeople, namely, the learned and the noble. Thus they philosophize and disturb the most beautiful order with horrendous errors.</p>
      <p>Add also, teacher, if it pleases you, that I may know what the method of inaugurating ministers is among you, what kind of examination. For even in this, our people do not have a certain way.</p>
      <p>Now for the first time I see how much more diligent I should have been in observing your pious customs, and yet I will not unjustly continue to trouble you until I obtain what was lost through negligence.</p>
      <p>Our Sebastian will speak about our polity, we hold the wolf by the ears. Farewell most happily in the same Christ Jesus for a long time, lest lights be lacking to our churches. I commend my Johannes Gosdius to you, do not let him leave without your letters.</p>
      <p>For you will have done a favor that is especially pleasing to many and useful to him. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given at Kraków, December 26, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Stanislaus Paclesius, the Pole. To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
