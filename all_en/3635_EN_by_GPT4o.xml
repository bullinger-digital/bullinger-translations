      <p>This messenger carries letters from our senate to yours in my name.</p>
      <p>I beseech you and all others to resist so that the injustice begun against me does not take effect. This messenger will tell you everything.</p>
      <p>Theodore Beza, whose interest is greatest, tells you all in his letters. What has been done by the Parisian senate will be told to you in the name of Calvin, from which you will all rejoice: he is so occupied with writing letters to our Frenchmen that he could not write to you. May the Lord Jesus be with your spirit.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 1, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your sincere friend and brother, R. Stephanus.</p>
      <p>A certain member of the ministers from last year was condemned to the fire six weeks ago in the month of September.</p>
      <p>The parliament had to subscribe to its (?). Many refused.</p>
      <p>However, the king, wanting to know, heard from the parliament not the least, who nevertheless adorned and defended the message in such a way that the king, having been rebuffed by complaints, finally said that he would think more diligently about this matter. A certain Barb√ºrinus from Geneva, if I hold the name correctly, takes care of the notes at his own expense.</p>
      <p>Beza.</p>
      <p>In the new testament, hear through our Gessner, for what reason he was detained in chains through the blockade (?)... released under the condition that he orders Gess. to stop.</p>
      <p>Regarding this matter, he made letters from the magistrate to the most honorable senate of mine.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
