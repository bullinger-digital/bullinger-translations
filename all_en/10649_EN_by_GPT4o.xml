      <p>Greetings. Oh, wretched me, who am forced to announce to you the death of our Lavater. Certainly, I could do this more easily with tears than with ink, so much did I love the young man with the most innocent character. I have no child among my three children whose death would have brought me so much sorrow, of which God and indeed my conscience are witnesses. The only thing that consoles me is that by the good will of God, and through no fault of mine, he perished in this manner of death. Otto wrote the entire story with the utmost fidelity to his father. I wanted to do the same for you, but grief did not allow it. I will write then after three days. Meanwhile, you, with your wisdom, console the excellent parent. For I cannot do it, as my grief is so renewed every time I take the pen in hand. From Otto's letters to the parent, you will understand the whole matter.</p>
      <p>But farewell. Through tears, I can add nothing now.</p>
      <p>8th of July. Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Your Bedrot.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his most sincere friend and brother. In Zurich.</p>
