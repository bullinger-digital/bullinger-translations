      <p>The distinguished kindness and piety of your consul, Habii, greatly refreshed me; he anticipated me in the duty which I ought to have performed and would have wished to, if the brevity of time had allowed. Please convey to him my thanks in the fullest measure with my words.</p>
      <p>He respects you and the other colleagues and loves religion and studies, as far as I could perceive, for which reason he is deservedly held in reverence by me, and I have encouraged him to continue doing so steadfastly.</p>
      <p>He narrated about the persecution instituted against the Waldensians, which some of my Bernese consider a mere fabrication concocted by the imperialists, so that by this means the Frenchman may become odious to the cities and, therefore, by recalling the soldiers, they may render him weaker. However, I greatly fear that it is a scheme of Satan himself to hinder the most holy mission once decreed and to provide instruments here, who do not declare themselves obscurely [in Greek]; for which reason it is all the more necessary that our Bernese colleagues be vigilant against this corruption, lest they fall into the same snare in which we are held here. You will have done rightly if you confer with this honorable consul about this matter of the afflicted, so that the decreed mission is not hindered. For I know that Farellus and Beza would not have proposed a vain matter to the Swiss cities and republics, and the copy of the royal edict sufficiently declares the danger. Then, even if these expenses are incurred without fruit, I do not see any greater loss, and this effort will serve even here, so that the king's mind, about which so many varied things are spread, may be more fully known and a fuller opportunity for deliberation in the future may be provided. Farewell well in Christ Jesus and continually assist us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, 23rd of May, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours as always in the Lord, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Please ensure that the enclosed letters are quickly delivered to Mr. Philipp by the boy.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
