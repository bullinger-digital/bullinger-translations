    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses bewilderment over the severe accusations in Pellikan's letter and rejects the allegations; although he became engaged to an honorable maiden [unlawfully] after separating from his adulterous wife, no one has yet asked about the - very honorable - reasons for this. He did not denounce the authorities, but on the contrary, defended them, and was loved in Hirzel as well as in the neighboring communities as a faithful servant of Christ; it would have been the duty of his fellow clergy to forgive and support him, instead of damaging the reputation of the clerical office through criticism of him - as Melanchthon also admonishes in his "Loci"; he bears heavily the burden of undeserved accusations. He asks for a postponement so that he can pay his debts and take care of the wine given to him by Christoph Froschauer, which is rightfully his; he does not want to have to sell his exquisite library to the Papists. He plans to travel to Strasbourg later to obtain a divorce decree; he hopes that his reputation will soon be restored. He asks Pellikan for forgiveness.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace from Christ, our Savior, are wished.</p>
      <p>On the tenth day before the Kalends of July, I received a letter from the most learned Konrad Pellikan, full of bitterness and gentian, so much so that for a while I suspected it was not from Pellikan. I do not admit to what he accuses me of.</p>
      <p>I am not the person he thinks; I have not done, do not do, and have not become what the good man dares to write about me, proclaiming me a liar, a scoundrel, a blasphemer, a fornicator, a detractor of the pious magistrate, a despiser of Christ, the gospel, the synod, and the brethren, in short, such a sinner who is unworthy of any pardon. Is the pen, which he wielded against me in the name of the brethren, to be an axe and the paper a slaughterhouse? If it is the duty of wise men, if it is the law of nature, if it is evangelical, if it is Christian to slander so impiously and wickedly, to tear apart so hostilely a fellow servant who has hitherto stood firm in the faith of Jesus Christ, the eternal king, who has always (as he knows) pursued honesty, who has cultivated true letters from childhood, who has cared for innocence and virtue (speaking without ambition) with the greatest zeal, conscious of no crime except that, as a private person, I pledged my faith to this chaste and most honorable maiden with a conjugal bond, not yet having celebrated the marriage, while having an unfaithful and most shameless wife. Is he worthy of such a millstone, who, urged by conscience, frees his faith? Why has no one inquired why this most honorable girl entered these lands or why she was betrothed to me? My first wife, most impious, is proscribed to me, a fierce enemy of the gospel and ministers of Christ; they want to force her upon me; the most honorable and virtuous one is being driven away. The first knows nothing but adultery and horrendous blasphemies (as many letters prove); the latter, ignorant of crimes, seeks nothing but Christ and his word. The former, having stripped me of everything two or three times, made me destitute and hungry; the latter serves faithfully with her own hands by weaving and spinning, obedient to all neighbors. But for testifying to these things, I am accused of venereal drunkenness and considered a despiser of Christ and the brethren. I did not introduce her into my house out of contempt, provoking anyone, but I wanted to rescue her from imminent dangers.</p>
      <p>Ah, fathers, do not be so severe, do not mock the complaints of a most troubled brother! I am not a detractor of the best magistrate, whom I faithfully defended in my last sermon before the whole church, reminding all listeners not to ever blame the magistrate for my departure; I alone am the author of this matter. If there is doubt, let the whole church be convened, and you will hear. I am not Barabbas nor Iscariot, but a servant of Jesus Christ, whom I love most ardently even under this pressure. Why do you reject Christ in his member? Why are you hostile to him, whom not only my former Hirzel church but also all neighboring churches receive and love, except for those envious ones who ought to protect? Affirm your piety towards me, most learned men, so that I may proclaim it to foreign nations about you. But perhaps you say: "Even fallen, he raises his crest against us." Far be it, most pious brothers; I implore your mercy, who have not yet forgiven me seven times a day. I was a glory to Christ, the church, and you; the all-knowing God is judge and witness between me and you. Ask the church I presided over and all the neighbors; according to their judgment, I was to be condemned. Let it be a stain that I have now committed with a sincere heart; yet it was your duty not to expose it, but to cover it with evangelical oil with Shem and Japheth, so that the entire reputation of the brother would not collapse with one evil and a pretext for madness would not be given to the public. The same Philipp Melanchthon advises in his "Loci" not to easily reject ministers of Christ because of some lapse, writing in these words: "But let the pious know that they owe this to the church's concord and the dignity of the ministry, not to depart from ministers because of their morals, if there is no impious doctrine. [...] For the honor of the divine name is harmed by the contempt of the ministry," etc. Thus he. None of all my comrades encourages me, an exile, to patience and constancy in Christ; the priest and the Levite pass me by, with only the Samaritan comforting me. Why do the most severe writings of my beloved Pellikan instill in me, undeserving, the tremor of torments? For after the horrendous letter (which I will carry with me from here), at anyone's approach, I am struck with stupor, at anyone's voice, fear confronts me, most crushed. Every day is considered my last.</p>
      <p>Give, oh brothers, my most beloved, for the love of Christ, a little time of respite, until I can pay those to whom I owe. The wine that is owed to me in Zürich is similarly forbidden out of hatred, which I had given to Christoph Froschauer. The matter of a friend must also be seen, to be placed in safety. Alas, why should I prostitute my sacred and most exquisite library to the Papists by selling it?</p>
      <p>But perhaps you say: "Go away from here, where you deserve." Where shall I go? To the papacy? I would rather wish to die. I beseech you, brothers, help a miserable and sincere brother. Are you so hard and inexorable in spirit that you cannot be softened by prayers?</p>
      <p>After the illness has passed, with the sky clearer and my purse fuller, I will soon return to Strasbourg to bring other letters of divorce, so that no window is opened for anyone to suspect anything about me or to twist anything against me. For when one mocks and throws a stone, many throw them. Ah, once a viper hangs from my hand; therefore, I am entirely considered a malefactor with Paul, and whatever I have ever done, even the best, is taken into the most bitter suspicion towards you. You had a servant in me (said without arrogance) most pleasing to all neighbors, who knew how to benefit all, to harm no one by word or example, for which you were dear to them. Still, all men wish me well from the heart, hoping for the return of the pastor. We are nourished by the best hope. Surrounded by the chain of infamy, I walk with Paul, hoping that it will be removed (once the matter is more accurately known). But if I have harmed anyone, I do not refuse to die. Oh brothers, oh dearest comrades, deal with me in such a way that you, who are whole towards the fallen natives, may also appear to be the same towards me, a proselyte.</p>
      <p>Farewell, all of you, praying to Christ, the eternal king, for me. From the little hut of bedbugs, on the 7th day before the Kalends of July, in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Valentin Telius of Rüebach. Consider my writings kindly, which have come from a contrite spirit. I beg Father Pellikan to forgive me from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and most learned brothers of Christ Jesus, professors of the most sacred evangelical militia of the city of Zürich, always to be honored and loved above all.</p>
