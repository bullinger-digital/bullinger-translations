      <p>Greetings. Although I have almost nothing new to write, most illustrious and excellent father Bullinger, the right of our friendship demands that I write something, especially since I have not sent you any letters for a long time, and now H., who is no less devoted to you than he is dear to us, is coming to you.</p>
      <p>But what should I write? I have much to say about the affairs of the disrupted or scattered and torn English Church; but you will receive this information better from Lord H. than you could learn from my letters. As for the Diet of Augsburg, I believe you know more than we do, namely what has been renewed by L. Z., men of holy memory like you and your kind, before... F.R.R. spoke about religion and the reformed churches in the public assemblies. I think you are not unaware of Italian affairs either, how cruelly all the princes there, incited by the example of that most impious Jezebel of England, rage against all the pious. In summary: princes and peoples are raging, plotting, and rising up against the Lord and against His Christ. We must pray to the heavenly Father to preserve His church, and as He laughs at His enemies from heaven, so may He also shatter them with the scepter of His kingdom and openly declare how vain their efforts are. You know all this, I believe. Therefore, regarding my own affairs, I only write that my wife has had a miscarriage and has been sick unto death, which has greatly disturbed my mind and my studies, but the Lord has had mercy not only on her but also on me (for she is now beginning to recover), and the rest of us are well. I commend her greatly to your prayers. In my next (?) disputation, I defended conclusions about restraining heretics, how well, it is for others to judge; but I know it was not useless or unsuccessful, and that is enough for the present. I send the conclusions, just to send something, and I wrote this only to take this opportunity to greet you. May the Lord keep you. Strasbourg, March 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Hieronymus Zanchus... swords: 1. It is permissible for Christians to hold civil magistracy and to bear its sword. 2. It is the duty of the civil magistrate to punish the innocent with the sword, as he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him who does evil. 3. Therefore, it is permissible for Christians in civil magistracy to punish transgressors of not only the second but also the first table with the sword. 4. And therefore to restrain heretics with many kinds of punishments, and even to condemn them to death according to the quality or gravity of the crime.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent pastor of the Church of Zürich, D. Bullinger, as to my most revered and esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
