      <p>Greetings. I received your news sent through Küngßfeld, most esteemed lord, father, and godfather, as well as the Wittenberg propositions and also recently the letters from Chur, for all of which I give you the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I have retained the propositions so far, because you have not yet given any indication to return them. I saw with pleasure in them how correctly they perceive the properties of Christ's natures and the locality of his body. If you also share your and Gwalther's writings on excommunication, it will be most welcome to me. Beza has not written to us for a long time; however, he was in Neuchâtel last week.</p>
      <p>It was reported from there that he was going to come to us; but from the letters of Christoph Faber, I have that he has set out for Montbéliard.</p>
      <p>I cannot estimate what he is doing there; I know otherwise that he does not get along well with Tossanus. Surely he has something he is planning; perhaps he descends to Heidelberg and pretends this. This suspicion is increased for me by the fact that Scriniger passed through here not long ago on his way to Heidelberg and seemed to want to conceal his passage, unless by chance he had run into me in the street in such a way that he could not avoid my conversation. However, he did not reveal to me any reasons for his journey, except that he complained with a sigh that there are those who dare to contradict holy discipline.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from France, except that peace is proceeding rightly. The king is entirely focused on scraping together money from everywhere to pay the soldiers of both parties; he also requested 100,000 crowns from our people; I think no less than 50,000 will have to be given to him. I am glad that the Chur matter has been so happily concluded. Steiger, Diesbach, Gravenriet, Manuel, and my father-in-law diligently greet you. The markets and sermons to be held tomorrow make me briefer; I will write more extensively next time.</p>
      <p>However, I am returning to you the letters from Chur. One memorable incident occurred, that the widow of Delsperger (about whom I wrote to you before), the sole heir and daughter of Wingartner, followed her husband six weeks after his death and also emigrated from here, leaving behind an heir, her father bereft, of whom she would have been the heir, if it had pleased the Lord. Thus, in one year, he was deprived of his office, son-in-law, daughter, and burdened with a sad inheritance, sitting on great wealth, he leads a miserable and sad life. May the Lord have mercy on him and finally open his eyes. Amen. I wanted to add this to the previous ones.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that you may live happily and be well with all yours. In Bern, November 11, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller, always.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
