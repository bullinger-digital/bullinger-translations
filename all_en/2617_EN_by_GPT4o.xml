      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write to you now, dear son, except my usual advice: fear God, walk in His commandments, believe in Christ, the Son of God, pray continually, study and exercise yourself in both good and sacred literature, just as I have given you the instruction written by my hand. May the Lord bless you.</p>
      <p>See that you are humble, faithful, and useful in your home. We are all well here by the grace of God, except that Brother Ottenbach is tormented by constant pains in his leg; there, too, the plague has taken some by untimely death. Many from Locarno are migrating to us and are being received very kindly; but there is hardly any room for them; for you know how great the population of Zürich is.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is difficult to find lodgings for them, nor are they convenient for so many people.</p>
      <p>You will learn from your master that Julius III, the pope, died on March 23, and another pope was created on April 10, a man who is a trickster and practiced in malice, and for that reason a true pope.</p>
      <p>I am expecting your treatise on Divinations. Please give my warmest regards to Dr. Peter Martyr, Dr. Hieronymus Zanchi, and your other teachers, especially Dr. Marbach and Valentinus Erythraeus, Dasypodius, Sturm, and the others.</p>
      <p>Tell Dr. Garnerius that I have received his letter written on March 22 and have nothing to reply at the moment, except that I pray for the Lord's blessing upon him.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dear son, and strive to meet my expectations someday. Pray to the Lord that you may be able to do so. Zürich, April 19, 1555.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the house of the excellent man Dr. Burcher, an Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
