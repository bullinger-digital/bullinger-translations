      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on February 25th.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I sent my booklet, in which I respond to 61 questions, to Bern without a letter; I hope you have received it. Now, as for responding to yours, I have nothing, nor is there anything in them that requires a significant response. We hear that the Saxons have written an apology, in which they justify their action of leaving their allies and departing from Worms; in it, they are said to condemn all who do not agree with their madness. The Emperor proposed matters to be consulted at the assembly on March 3rd.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now, I am called away.</p>
      <p>I would have more to write; but I return before the messenger departs.</p>
      <p>The main points of the proposal are: 1. the continuation of the colloquy begun at Worms, instituted for the purpose of composing the diverse religions, that is, to unite Christ with Belial, 2. the Turkish contribution, which threatens Hungary, having taken away over 10,000 men from Carniola, 3. the maintenance of the imperial chamber, 4. the correction of the currency, 5. public peace. The envoys of the princes are now consulting; there are few princes there.</p>
      <p>The French envoy has also been heard; what he proposed, I do not know. There are Staphylus, Wicelius, Jesuits, and the rest of the unfortunate company; they are bold and confident as if certain of victory. Illyricus has published a booklet on the sects and dissensions of the papists in Germany, which he opposes to Staphylus's Topics. It is said that the Emperor is considering recovering the Duchy of Swabia and for that reason wants to redeem the Margraviate of Burgau from the possession of the Bishop of Augsburg. In Poland, the assembly is not yet finished, nor is the king, as was said, dead, but he suffers from a serious illness. The matter of the successor to the kingdom is being discussed; the cause and person of the bishops become more odious every day; the true religion does not progress commonly. I hear that hope for peace between the French and the Spanish is lost, and now attempts are being made to see if a truce can be obtained. From London, we received the latest written on February 24th and a coin of the crowned queen; it is being diligently discussed in parliament, which we hope will be concluded now by Easter. There is good hope that the true religion can be restored; the queen burns with zeal; the nobility urges; the people thirst for the truth.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant grace.</p>
      <p>Again, I am forced to break off writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours and especially Fuchs. March 20, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, minister of the church in Biel/Bienne, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Biel/Bienne.</p>
