      <p>Greetings. Letters from Italy have been brought to me, in which it is certainly indicated to me by our people that a great defeat has been inflicted on the Spanish army in the Duchy of Ferrara. And although I have not yet understood in detail how the event took place, nevertheless, because it is certain that a little less than two thousand Spaniards fell without any losses on our side, I wanted to inform you of this. If you have any new information from elsewhere, it would be most welcome if you would write to me.</p>
      <p>Our army has set out in France to attack Calais; but the severity of the cold, which is even more intense in that region, prevents me from hoping for anything significant from that expedition. Whatever happens, you will soon be informed.</p>
      <p>Farewell. January 9, 1558, according to our reckoning.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
