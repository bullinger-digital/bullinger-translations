      <p>Greetings. If there were not so few who travel to you at this time, I would write to you more frequently. Now, since these boys have unexpectedly presented themselves to me, I cannot refrain from writing at least about what has been done with Gentilis these days. He was supposed to appear before the capital judgment on the third of this month; but due to other concurrent matters, his case was suspended, with the hope that, if he saw what awaited him, he would return to the right path. From that time, some have worked so hard for his life that all hope of removing him has been taken from me. But the Lord, who wished to free His churches from such a wolf, caused him to persist stubbornly in his errors, thereby newly provoking the spirits of the leading men, so that when it was again to be decided about him on the tenth of this month, he was unanimously sentenced to the sword by the lesser council, which sentence also prevailed in the greater part of the greater council. Thus it happened that on that day he put an end to his blasphemies by the punishment of death. While being led out, he gravely insulted us, calling us Sabellians, who have only a trinitarian God, shouting that he recognized no God as substance or tripersonal or trinitarian, but one highest God the Father and one Son of God not of the Trinity, the Logos, God from God, etc., and many such things: making us partners in all the crimes of the Genevans; suffering for the glory and eminence of the highest and only God the Father, praying for us that God may free us from the errors in which we are held, forgiving even the Genevans and Beza, being in a good state, not having disturbed the churches. We had more work to do in ensuring that he did not drive some of the people who understood Latin mad than in consoling him, so stubborn was he. However, when it came to the punishment, he was already beginning to... and perhaps would have recanted some things, if the punishment had not been hastened by those who were in charge of his execution. Thus that wretched man died. How much this displeased many, you will hear from what I wrote to my brother. But the matter turned out rightly; the magistrates acted manfully, as they should have. He repeatedly appealed to the church of Basel; he said he suspected the church of Zurich. He complained that he had not been sufficiently heard, as no place had been given for a public disputation. In the deceased's boots, ten gold crowns were still found. What was done with him has been carefully recorded and will be preserved until its time. Otherwise, I have nothing of any importance, except that Johannes Fedminger, one of our deacons, has been appointed in these days to replace our colleague Mauritius, who has been rendered useless for ministry due to apoplexy, although he still resists somewhat; but I think he will perform the duty when asked.</p>
      <p>The plague is spreading somewhat among us; however, all my family are well and send their greetings to you. The same do Steiger, Diesbach, Grafenried, Manuel, and many others.</p>
      <p>Bern, 13th of September 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, lord, father, and compatriot, to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
      <p>Valentin Gentilis was beheaded in Bern on the 10th of September 1566.</p>
