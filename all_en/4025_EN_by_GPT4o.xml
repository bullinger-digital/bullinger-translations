      <p>Greetings. I wrote to your kindness a few days ago, indeed in German, about what is being said and held here regarding King Henry of France. Now I add to those things that we have learned from certain messengers in recent days that the king has died from that wound on July 10... his son will succeed him in the kingdom; I pray to the Lord that the son, through the mournful death of his father, may become wiser, so that he does not lend his ears to those bloodthirsty carnal and apostate men and continues to persecute the church, the bride of Christ, from which he himself may perish, both unhappy and accursed.</p>
      <p>For no one has ever persecuted the church of Christ without punishment since the world was founded; it is that stone of burden, of which Zechariah prophesies, which no one has ever touched without being harmed by it. But all the suffering and pain are the true causes of spiritual hope in God, who will repay them in Augsburg... as Christians, the gospel and pr... with the Emperor... it is about the famous... Princes... they oppose. May the Lord our God restrain his untamed enemies, so that they willingly obey his word or do not harm his word, but themselves! The one who offers you this letter is a servant of Heinrich Gessner, our merchant and citizen, a very good man; he is the cousin of our distinguished man, Mr. Conrad Gessner. Sebastian Drichschinawet is indebted to him with you, as he himself can tell you. The procrastinator has long delayed the due payment; now, having heard that I am in some favor with you, he has asked me to commend his case to you, which I now do, beseeching you to assist him in obtaining his money, whom I otherwise know to be very observant of the law.</p>
      <p>Make sure he understands that my recommendation to you has had some weight. Greet Mr. Travers, your relative Mr. Rodolph, our son Johann, the preachers of Cleves, brothers, and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 26, in the year of our Lord 1559. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, commissioner in Chiavenna, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. To young lord Friedrich von Salis, commissioner in Chiavenna.</p>
