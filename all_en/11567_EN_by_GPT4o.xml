    <p xml:id="regest1">Was pleased with Bullinger's letter and received the admonitions of the Zurich pastors attentively; their concern prompts him to the following report. Emperor Charles [V.] rejected the continuation of the Worms discussion desired by the Augsburg Confession allies and proposed that delegates selected by him should conduct the negotiations without prejudicing the decisions of the princes. The parity committee included Julius Pflug, Johannes Eck, Johannes Gropper, Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Pistorius himself; Palatine Count Friedrich and [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle were appointed as presidents, with Count [Dietrich IV.] of Manderscheid, Eberhard Rüdt [von Collenberg], the chancellors of the Palatinate, Saxony, and Hesse [Heinrich Hase, Franz Burchart, and Johann Feige] as well as Jakob Sturm as assessors. On behalf of the Emperor, Palatine Count Friedrich presented a book that was to form the basis of the negotiations; despite its shortcomings, the Protestant colloquents could not refuse the discussion about it, even though they would have preferred to start from the Augsburg Confession. There was no dispute over the doctrine of man and sin, but the article on justification was based on questionable patristic citations and was contradictory, which is why they turned away from the presented text; finally, they were able to agree on a formula about justification by faith. The discussion of the book had to continue; the next article, which claimed the infallibility of councils, led to a dispute over the authority of the church and councils, whereupon the Protestants submitted a counter-vote and the discussion was postponed. There was little dispute over the doctrine of the sacraments in general, such as their number of seven and different necessity, but much over the transformation of the Lord's Supper bread and its veneration; this question was also postponed. There was a heated dispute over the enumeration of sins in confession and the penances, which is why the Protestants submitted a detailed counter-vote. Regarding confirmation and anointing of the sick, reference was made to the Apology [of the Augsburg Confession]. The Protestants also drafted counter-articles on the Pope, bishops, saints, mass, priestly marriage, and church orders; when there was no longer any hope of agreement, they discussed the article on church discipline and are now preparing a report to the Emperor; the discussion ended on May 28. How the matter will turn out is in God's hands; the mediation attempts of worldly wise men, who rely on the human commandments of the fathers and councils instead of God's word, harm the purity of religion. The Emperor is again turning more strongly to papist superstition; Pistorius wants to hold fast to God's word and asks for guidance through the Holy Spirit. Welcomes Bullinger's decision to comment on the Gospels, thanks for his gift, and now wants to take even more care of Gwalther. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from God our Father through Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>With great pleasure, I read your letters written to me. With attentive ears and the utmost reverence, I received the admonition both friendly and Christian, by which our most esteemed lords and brothers, the ministers of the Zurich church, together with you, exhorted us all to conduct the cause of the supreme King Christ at Regensburg in a holy, honest, true, clear, integral, free, and prudent manner, and, since we are ministers of Christ, to have regard for the Lord above all, and in all our counsels and deeds to look to the word of the Lord. Since I understand that you are piously concerned for us and wish for the common cause to be promoted and pray for us who are already contending, I could not but inform you of all those things which have been done here so far in the cause of religion.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the assembly, after Emperor Charles explained that he wanted deliberations to be held to resolve ecclesiastical controversies, those united with the Augsburg Confession requested that the Worms discussion be continued, so that from that explanation the Emperor and the princes could know both what matters are in controversy and what the sources are. For how can the true opinions be chosen by the princes unless matters are presented to them in this way, collated and clearly explained? But with this plan rejected, the Emperor showed that he would select a few, not to defend conflicting opinions among themselves, but to seek which doctrines could be reconciled. And lest there be any danger from this deliberation to the parties, he prefaced that he wished no one to be bound by these deliberations nor for them to have the force of prejudice, but that all should again be referred to the counsel of the princes. He also requested that it be permitted to him, according to his judgment, to choose whom he wished. [...]</p>
      <p>And the Emperor testified that he wished to seek the truth, and in the selection, he used this fairness: From the papists, he chose three, Julius Pflug, a canon of Mainz, Johannes Eck, Johannes Gropper of Cologne; to these, he added from our side Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and myself. It was requested that princes be added as governors of the colloquy and some auditors or witnesses, so that the acts could be more faithfully recited both to the Emperor and to other princes. The governors chosen were Duke Friedrich of the Palatinate and Granvelle, and also added as auditors were Count of Manderscheid, Eberhard Rüdt of Mainz, the chancellor of the Elector Palatine, the chancellor of Saxony, the chancellor of Hesse, Jakob Sturm of Strasbourg. At the beginning of the colloquy, Duke Friedrich exhorted us chosen ones to bring calm and pious minds to the deliberation of such a great cause and to strive to resolve the controversies, narrating that the Emperor himself had been greatly concerned with this matter for so many years and had therefore explored the opinions of many learned and good men.</p>
      <p>Since some had presented to him a document, which he preferred due to the moderation of others' harsher counsels, the Emperor wished that this book be proposed to us chosen ones, which would show the way to resolve the controversies. The book was presented with the fairest condition, that we could say and add our judgment on what was not approved by us. And although it seemed safer to us three, namely Philipp, Bucer, and myself, to go through the Augsburg Confession, yet, since others preferred the book and it seemed uncivil to refuse to inspect a document however flexible and deceitful (for that book deviates too much from the simplicity of Scripture to human moderations and obscure compositions), but proposed by the Emperor without unjust conditions, it was agreed that the book should be read and opinions stated in order.</p>
      <p>The beginnings did not have controversies about the creation and fall of man, the cause of sin, free will, original sin, and concupiscence in the reborn. There were indeed no quarrels about these topics now. The next topic was about reconciliation or justification of man, about which that mixture satisfied neither side and most things were obscure, improper, and flexible (for the authors of this writing continually used the sayings of the fathers, who, as you know, not only very often have bad opinions due to the customs of the times, defending present traditions and opinions more harshly, but also often could not say clearly enough what they wanted). Therefore, at times it seemed to say rightly: "we are justified by faith because of Christ," at other times contrary: "we are justified because of the virtues given," as Thomas or Plato is accustomed to speak. Therefore, with the book set aside, the essence of the matter was freely disputed and finally, a formula was reached, in which the opinion was received and explained: "we are justified by faith because of Christ freely, not because of our virtues."</p>
      <p>When this topic was agreed upon, we were ordered to return to the book. The next topic read was about the church. To more easily obtain the following, a hypothesis was insidiously added that the common consensus of the church and legitimate synods cannot err. Here a great contest arose about the authority of the church and councils. And when we had diligently disputed this topic for several days, we three wrote a contrary opinion. With this writing presented, we were ordered to defer this part to another time.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the topic of the sacraments was read, in which the authors of that book insidiously and silently introduced the number of sacraments as seven, with a certain distinction added, namely that some are necessary, some not necessary, and since this topic contained only generalities, it was not much contested. However, when it came to the Lord's Supper, very serious quarrels arose about the conversion of the substance of the bread, about reposition or reservation, about adoration, about carrying around, and whether the sacraments are sacraments outside of action or use. Finally, this dispute was also deferred by the governors of the colloquy to another time.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, a very sharp contention followed about a matter not great, namely, whether in confession, as they call it, the enumeration of sins is necessary, also about punitive satisfaction, whether it is necessary even in secret sins. The kingdom of both confessions and satisfactions was defended by the adversaries either because of the authority of the order of priests or because of the kitchens of the monks.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a contrary opinion was presented by us, explained in detail. Mention was also made in that book of chrism in confirmation and oil of the sick; however, in these topics, we peacefully stated our opinion and referred to our Apology.</p>
      <p>We came to the topics of the primacy of the Pope, the power of bishops, the invocation and merits of saints, the sacrifice of the mass or the offering in the Lord's Supper to be applied for others, private masses, the true form, the marriage of priests, the statutes and rites of the church. Since it was not possible for us six chosen ones to agree on these matters, contrary opinions were again presented by us three. Finally, therefore, with the hope of reconciliation abandoned, we went through the rest of the book, namely about church discipline, and a document is being prepared in which our acts will be reported to the Emperor. And so our colloquy ended on the 28th day of May.</p>
      <p>What will happen, however, is known to God, the best and greatest, to whom we commend the cause not so much ours as His, together with ourselves, daily with diligent prayers through Christ, praying that He may completely free us from those impure reconciliations. For I see that it is impossible for something not to depart from the purity of religion whenever the wise of the world, who are never not led away from the divine word and apostolic ordinance to the inextricable thicket of human laws, attempt to remove the dissension of religion in such reconciliations, being fixed, namely, on the sayings of the fathers and the statutes of councils, by which they perpetually try to drive the world mad. You have what has been done so far in these assemblies.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, addicted to superstition and therefore somewhat offended by our freedom, begins to look at us and our states with oblique eyes and to visit papal rites more frequently again. But God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, still lives, and Christ, sitting at the right hand of the Father, reigns perpetually, even in the midst of His enemies. I have firmly decided to insist, adhere, and die in His word. May the Lord grant me His Spirit, who may so establish my steps that I may not fall vacillating anywhere, but proceeding rightly, I may adhere purely and piously to the confession of Christ to the end. Amen.</p>
      <p>You have affected me with the greatest joy, that you have decided to illustrate the evangelical history with your commentaries; for you do not know with how many sighs the ministers of our churches have hitherto desired it, who will also pray with me to the Lord diligently, that He may deign to assist you with His Spirit as you labor so faithfully in the vineyard of the Lord. You only continue to adorn and illustrate the church of Christ with your excellent gifts. I received your little gift, a token of our friendship, with the most grateful mind, intending also to return immortal thanks, wherever it may be possible. Gwalther, previously sufficiently commended to me, will now be most commended, nor do you doubt that I have received him with the same love and place as before.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus most happily, most beloved Bullinger, together with your whole household, and greet Leo Jud, Caspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Conrad Pellican, Theodor Bibliander, and the other ministers of the Zurich church, my most esteemed lords and brothers, in my name most diligently.</p>
      <p>From Regensburg, hastily, on the 30th day of May in the year 1541. All my brothers and lords, Draconites, Dionysius Melander, and Anthony Corvinus, greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pistorius Niddanus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man both in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
