    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's commentary on the Acts of the Apostles is well-received by the people of Frankfurt. Christoph Froschauer has reported why the monetary gift to Bullinger was distributed among the needy. Melander has conveyed Bullinger's thanks for this. He should continue with his work. His comments on the letters to the Corinthians are eagerly awaited. Luther will once again incite Erasmus against the Reformers. The Anabaptists have led the church in M端nster astray. Warning against Hoffman, Campanus, Servetus, B端nderlin, and others. An admonition to continue fighting the enemies. Greetings, especially to Rudolf Collin and Theodor Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Your most learned commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles, most learned Bullinger, have pleased our senate and all the pious, and to acknowledge their gratitude, they have sent a small gift. Christoph Froschauer has explained the reason why it was distributed among the needy. As I hear, the senate is very pleased, provided you are grateful in return. To assure them of this, I presented your letters, witnesses of your gratitude, and they commended your gratitude, and you are most commendable to our senate for your piety and outstanding learning. Your writings are also approved by the pious and learned. Therefore, continue as you have begun, with the spirit of Christ inspiring you. For I see that those books written with a contentious spirit are now exposed to contempt everywhere. They disturb the churches, harm charity, and offend the weak. But those that build up the church are now finally appreciated. Therefore, assist the church, continue writing. Christ will be with you with His spirit as He has been until now. We all eagerly await with fervent prayers what you are now contemplating on the Corinthians. For they are letters that deal with various topics, notable commonplaces, most necessary and to be observed in our age. We will pray to Christ that He may complete what He has begun in you and through you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the churches of Hesse and Saxony, I have nothing to write, except that Luther, in his usual manner, will once again provoke Erasmus with bitter insults, indeed more truly against us all. This matter greatly displeases the best men - except for a few who depend on Luther's mask. Christ must be earnestly prayed to, that He may help us. For I see that everything is fermenting. The Anabaptists have miserably led the church in M端nster astray. The most pernicious pamphlets of Melchior Hoffman, a certain Campanus, Michael Servetus, B端nderlin, and the like are being circulated by some. Therefore, let us be vigilant. Moreover, the Lutherans, far more stubborn than the Papists, do not cease to rage against us. Let us therefore continue to ward off the ravenous wolves from the fold with the sword of the spirit, and in the end, we will conquer in Christ. Amen. With these words, my most humane Bullinger, farewell and consider this little letter, poured out rather than written amidst occupations, kindly, and commend me and our church to Christ in your prayers. And you will diligently greet all your fellow ministers in my name, especially those I know, Rudolf Collin in Marburg and Theodor Bibliander in Frankfurt. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, April 3, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Dionysius Melander.</p>
