      <p>Greetings. I write nothing at present, except that I see the Lutherans have conspired to overwhelm us with a mass of books. For Snepf has already attacked me, and if his book had come a little earlier, it would have been joined with his associate Westphal. But while they attack us from afar, you see the straits we are pressed with internally. You have no doubt understood how courteously the envoys of the three cities were received, or rather with what disdain their plea was rejected. Our people certainly report that they were treated contemptuously. Although I have long since hardened myself to such injuries, I fear, however, that spirits more embittered than is reasonable may break out in a way I would not wish. But since there is no place for remedy among men, I will turn to prayers, and I will also encourage others to do so. Nevertheless, I will not cease to calm our people, as far as possible, so that they may overcome by enduring. In a few words, in the greatest haste, I preferred to greet you rather than send an empty message. Farewell, most distinguished and venerable brother. May the Lord always be with you, protect you, and strengthen you. Greet the fellow ministers and the family.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and esteemed fellow minister.</p>
