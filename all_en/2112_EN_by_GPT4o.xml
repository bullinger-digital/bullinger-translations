      <p>Greetings. Your letter was sent to me by Mr. Baionensis on the morning of December 18th. You advise wisely; we hold the matter. Believe me, the people of Caereani will achieve nothing in our Confederation. As for me, I have ceased to act as his interpreter and refused to visit his letters sent to me, because I sensed that I was not recommended by many in such matters; I am not speaking of Mr. Baionensis, but I imply others. Our Johannes Traversius, awakened from sleep, is working on abolishing the mass in Zuoz, where he lives, and for this reason, he sent letters to me these days asking me to go there for a few weeks to preach; for they have no one to publicly preach Christ. I promised to do so with the consent of my church. He, however, will be able to do much; for many depend on him. I thank you for my son; I will send him after the Feast of the Three Kings around the middle of January at my own expense. If anything happens, thanks be to God; if not, he will nevertheless live there at my expense as long as I can. All friends are well. I will read your letters to them, to those indeed whom you know and always greet.</p>
      <p>Be careful not to believe that I am less discreet with secrets. Farewell, most esteemed man, and do not cease to love your Philipp.</p>
      <p>If there is anything, you can always command. From Chur, early morning of December 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
