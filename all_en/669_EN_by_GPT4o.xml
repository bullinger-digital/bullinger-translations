      <p>Greetings. I recently recommended to you a nobleman from Ghent, most kind Bullinger, who is worthy of both my recommendation and your friendship for many reasons. Now I commend to you this noble Englishman: in no way inferior to the other, he is a man of calm and quiet manners, agreeing with the faith of your church. He lived with me for some time, and I found nothing in the man that I could accuse. He is in poor health due to a long-standing illness he suffers from. If your air suits him, I ask that you do not withhold your assistance in finding a host where he may live somewhat according to his own custom. He would like to stay with Mr. Gesner: I therefore ask that you recommend him to him. I wrote to you about the news eight days ago; he will inform you of everything else. Business does not allow me to write more: I therefore commend you and your family to God.</p>
      <p>Yours, BURCHER, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dear to me in many ways. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
