    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian has learned with interest from Bullinger's letter [18000 from January 3, 1548] that the Bannerlord Andreas Schmid [is being sent to France for the baptism of Claude, the daughter of King Henry II]. He initially expected Mayor Johannes Haab, but then learned of Schmid's dispatch, provided that the former was prevented from going due to many official duties or health problems. Schmid, who is blood-related to Vadian's wife [Martha, née Grebel], is extremely educated and is said to be knowledgeable in the French language. Vadian met him when he was the governor in Baden. Schmid is very suitable for this task.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The St. Gallen council has appreciated that the Great Council of Zurich would have liked to include a St. Gallen representative in the embassy. Since only a few could be included in the selection of the [four] envoys among the Thirteen Cantons, it seems wise that none of the allied cantons were considered. Moreover, unnecessary costs are saved, as the St. Gallen [interests] are excellently represented by the Zurichers anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">What Bullinger writes about Ägidius Tschudi is regrettable to Vadian. He had hoped that Tschudi, when he sees the truth, would prove more favorable not only to the [Evangelicals] but also to Christ and his main teachings. If nothing better can be expected from this highly talented man, it is at least important that, upon his objection, he is not given the impression that one is willing to give up one's own standpoint, especially since it was defended by great church patrons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Similar to Tschudi are, among the Lucerners, the highly esteemed Jost von Meggen, who, as Vadian hears, stands opposed to the [Evangelicals], as well as among the Urners, the learned Amandus von Niderhofen. No one will believe how much Vadian secretly suffers because of them whenever he is greeted in their name. However, he does not give up hope and believes that in the future they will not only be somewhat more inclined towards the [Evangelicals] but also, in the event of a dispute over their clear doctrinal points, can be counted on for support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">There is no more news from Nuremberg, Augsburg, Memmingen, Lindau, or Munich about war plans [of Emperor Charles V.] against the Swiss, as the Emperor, princes, and estates at the Diet of Augsburg cannot agree. Since Charles V. blocks everything he dislikes, his supporters are now as dissatisfied as his opponents. They are meanwhile only incurring great expenses, and it seems as if the Emperor and his brother, King Ferdinand I, are holding the Diet alone among themselves! It is certain that the Emperor has moved many cavalry and infantry to Württemberg. No one doubts that he is plotting against the Confederation. It is also certain that if the Emperor could count on Pope Paul III and expect help from him, he would reinstate Duke Charles III of Savoy without regard for the Swiss and French. However, he trusts neither the Pope nor the truce with Sultan Suleiman I. One must be on guard because he will implement his plans at the first opportunity. God protect His own! This is only for Bullinger and his confidants.</p>

      <p>S. I was informed by your letter about the envoy from your city sent to France, and I received it gladly. I was thinking about Mayor Johannes Haab. In the meantime, I gathered that Mr. Schmid, the Bannerlord, would be sent if public affairs, the duties of the consulship, or any adverse health conditions had delayed him. Mr. Schmid is a very courteous man and, if I am not mistaken, knowledgeable in the French language. He has been known to me since the time he was the governor at Baden, due to my wife, who is very closely related to him by blood, and he is indeed such a person who can perform this embassy with praise.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, what you previously mentioned, that your most honorable council was pleased to have someone from our side sent there, was very gratifying to our council. However, this could not be pursued unless the same permission had been granted to other cities or districts of the allies. But it seems to me wisely decided that, since it was not allowed for everyone to go due to the selection made among the few districts, no one from the allies was admitted to avoid envy, not to mention the unnecessary burden of expenses and the fact that what could have been achieved by the presence of all will be accomplished by a few on behalf of all. We do not doubt that we are excellently recommended to your embassy through the intercession of your most honorable council.</p>

      <p>What you write about Mr. Tschudi is regrettable. I had hoped that he would become more favorable to our cause, indeed to Christ and even to his own head, if he had seen the truth so clearly placed before his eyes. But if nothing better can be hoped for from a man otherwise so useful and endowed with such great gifts, it will still be worthwhile to yield less to the tumult, as it would be more disgraceful if we were to give any suspicion of abandoning our cause, which is nevertheless defended by great patrons of its cause and party.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Of similar nature, as I hear, among the Lucerners is the most distinguished and adorned man Mr. Jost von Meggen, whom I also hear is not very favorable to our religion, as well as Amandus von Niderhofen among the Urners, a learned and wonderfully courteous man. No one believes how much I grieve within myself and under the cloak, as it is said, whenever I am addressed and greeted in their name, nor do I so abandon hope, but for my great love for them, I do not cease to console myself and promise myself with great confidence that we will not only have them somewhat more favorable in the future if any dissension arises, but also as supporters in such clear and evident articles (although all our matters are wonderfully clear). But the day itself will make us more certain of all these things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Nuremberg, Augsburg, Memmingen, Lindau, and Munich, it is written that our people no longer hear such terrible things from the Swiss about waging war; for the matters cannot be entirely reconciled among the princes and estates, and those who have been with the Emperor must complain about many things no less than the others who have acted against him. This is largely because no counsel that is not agreeable to him has its course, and one lies in great expenses in vain, and the imperial majesty with his brother can well hold a diet for themselves and alone, etc. Finally, it is said that he is to place a strong, strong force of cavalry and infantry in the land of Württemberg. It seems indeed as if he bears no thought of the Confederation, as no one doubts. And it should be certain: If he could trust the Pope and could expect support from him, he would certainly undertake to reinstate the Duke of Savoy, regardless of the Swiss and French, and thus more than one hare in a hunt would be set on fire. But he does not trust the Pope and the Turk with his stance. Therefore, one now wants to be assured that he will make some arrangement for his plans until the complication stands better at hand. Therefore, one should have good care. For if one could, one would, and the will is powerfully present. May God faithfully protect us. These things to you and a few of yours. Farewell. St. Gallen, January 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the City of Zurich, most esteemed.</p>
