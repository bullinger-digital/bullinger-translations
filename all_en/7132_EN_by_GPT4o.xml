      <p>Revered Father, Greetings. After the synod was concluded, I intended to write to you as diligently as possible before departing; but the Italian brothers and my relatives almost forcibly put me on a horse and took me with them, so that I could hardly say goodbye to friends. I therefore asked our Tobias to perform this duty in my name and to excuse me; he promised to do so and later wrote that he had accomplished it. Therefore, there will be no need for me to say any more about that synod and the outcome of our affairs, except that I have never seen anything more unjust, add also more ignorant and foolish. Certainly, in papal councils, although nothing is sincere, nothing just, nothing Christian, at least some form of equity or hypocrisy is maintained: they appoint some who pretend to support and defend us, and with these, they debate for a while; then they pass a judgment and approve it, if not by scriptures, at least by the canons of other councils and the authorities of the fathers, or the scholastics, so that they do not seem to act without reason and thus tyrannically in their councils. But in ours, I am ashamed even to recall, there was neither any equity nor any form or simulation of equity. No one responded to my arguments; the testimonies of others are recited, not refuted; the adversaries offer no reason, authority, or testimony to defend themselves. I protest, unless my arguments are answered, that I am superior in the cause and that I have rightly accused them of schism and of violating the liberty of the church, and that they unjustly forbade me from preaching, and much more unjustly deposed me from the ministry while absent, unheard, with no reasons given, despite the protest of Hercules from Salice and some other brothers before the time of the synod, to which the controversy was committed.</p>
      <p>Nothing is answered to this, and in the meantime, a judgment is passed, confirmed by no reasons or testimonies of the scriptures, indeed not even of any men, and what kind of judgment? Certainly tolerable; for there at least it was acknowledged that the schism in the church was a fact, although not very harmful from the beginning, and that I was forbidden from preaching, and later deprived of the ministry, that this was done unjustly and unfairly; but later a written judgment is given, quite different. What is this matter, what equity? Where are we? These things I pour into your bosom not without great fear of God's wrath against us.</p>
      <p>I now come to new matters: Albanus is ill in Alexandria. The rumor continues that a war against Geneva is imminent.</p>
      <p>However, many chests of arms have passed through here, which are being transported to Flanders. A certain Spanish Cardinal, bound, was brought from Spain and is to be taken to Rome by Duke Albanus as a Lutheran. A certain Genoese reported to me yesterday evening and asserted that he had seen him bound with his own eyes when he was about to leave Genoa. In Rome, indeed, large prisons are being built, and there is cruel persecution against all the pious, even great and illustrious men.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of this church at present, I do not write, except that those things which I had predicted would happen are now gradually being seen, unless that unjust decree is removed; a small spark produces a great fire. I, who am familiar with the temperaments of our people, who know how to dissimulate for a time, had foreseen this. May the Lord be present with His spirit; but certainly, He punishes our ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent father, and love me. Good and simple women weep because I am leaving, others rejoice; but I fear that joy may be turned into mourning.</p>
      <p>I greet the brothers.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, June 23, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Zanchi.</p>
      <p>I commend this young Dane, pious, noble, learned, a friend; he is traveling to Geneva.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father of the Zurich church and my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
