      <p>Greetings. May it go badly for the Antichrist, on whose account not only is Christ expelled, but other commendable pursuits are also forbidden. Here, the Antichrist is prohibited, and at the same time, it is prohibited by common law that no books at all may be printed here in any language other than Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and German, nor do I quite know whether my books are also included in this edict; for previously I was permitted by the senate to print everything I wanted, provided it did not pertain to religion, since I had previously been convinced that they would more easily and willingly admit sacred writings than profane ones. But these things must be endured by us. However the matter falls, I will not be moved from my purpose, nor will my labor or industry be delayed by such judgments, by the grace of God; for the world is not contained in one city of Basel. If the printer were present, I would quickly decide what should be done; I expect him this week, as he promised to come. If it would not trouble you, I would like you to ensure he is urged. If anything new arises afterward, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my words. Farewell. Basel, April 22, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
