      <p>S. I am sending what Schertlinus and our treasurer Arnold gave me in Basel yesterday, and I can do nothing more. However, I wanted to please you by describing these things somewhat.</p>
      <p>What you recently wrote about my calling and why you so strongly advised against it, I have taken in a completely good part; for you spoke the very truth when you indicated what M[atthias] Hirs[garter] fears for himself. But it is far different than what he told you, which you will truly hear from me at another time. He himself performs the duties of an antistes (church leader), and it would not have been my place to make any changes in the church; but indeed, it was not the church's renewal, of which I barely touched on anything and not of great importance, but rather his own, which I diligently admonished him about with Mr. Heinrich, that he shuddered at. It pains me greatly that the good old man could not conceal his lack of self-control in this matter even among his own people and thus incurred such ill favor among many good people by this name. What I admonished both him and Mr. Heinrich, a man of holy memory, were entirely such things that he, who surpassed him in piety, learning, and judgment, thanked me not in ordinary terms. "You have not contradicted me in all this (says the good, pious man); for it is all the truth," and he asked that I grant him the power to describe all the articles. I was advising both in secret with good and pious counsel; but Hirs[garter] later blurted everything out in front of some brothers and friends, while I was still there, and turned it into slander, which I, however, bravely ignored and did not want to argue with him as I was about to leave. May the Lord forgive him, and may He also give him the strength to perform his duty with greater diligence, vigilance, zeal, and enthusiasm. The senate there is more negligent and the people more ignorant than worse, but both could easily be corrected by the diligence and dutifulness of a better pastor. He speaks more than freely in his sermons and seems to himself to be quite outspoken and bold, which he often shouts out insolently and untimely; by which he promotes nothing, so that he falls more and more into contempt. But about this more than I wanted; more in person sometime, if it seems appropriate. You commend me to the Lord with all your sacred prayers as diligently as possible. My dearest wife greets you and yours. Greetings to all friends and brothers who love us in Christ. Farewell.</p>
      <p>March 26, 1552.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Highly trusted, dear lord and friend, I have now for the second time received your heartfelt, confidential, Christian writing and admonition well and with great thanks and will keep both for a long time and read them often. Mr. Musculus and Mecardus, who are again with me in military discipline, have also heard it read aloud, etc.</p>
      <p>You should...</p>
