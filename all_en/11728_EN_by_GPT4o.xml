    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Schlatter gratefully returns Bullinger's notes on Deuteronomy, unfortunately a bit later than agreed, as he has to preach four to six times a week, occasionally also before the catechumens.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Everything is going well in Biel. They have a new city clerk [Johannes des Bois], who differs from his predecessor [Ulrich Fischer] in his manner and the contacts he maintains. He comes from the court of the Basel Bishop, Philipp von Gundelsheim, who, as is customary, recommended him for this position. It is not yet known how he will prove himself. This will soon become apparent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] What is happening in Bern would be too long and too dangerous to be communicated here. The good Erasmus Ritter is having the greatest difficulties there and is forced to defend himself in court if he does not want to lose his good reputation! The matter seems to be leading to Ritter's expulsion and the triumph of his opponents. The consequences of this are clear. Bullinger will probably also lament the deplorable state of the once exemplary and peaceful church of Bern. Schlatter shares this truly without any malicious intent. May God lead His own with His Spirit and protect them from human errors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The harmony of the people of Zurich gives Schlatter hope that the currently divided churches will one day come to peace through the good example of the people of Zurich. If they do not do so and instead head straight towards their end, may at least the unity of the people of Zurich thwart the reckless actions of the divided churches and keep the damage within limits.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] So much for now. Schlatter will write more extensively on another occasion. In the meantime, he recommends the people of Biel. He and Johann Leopold Frey send greetings to all the Zurich professors and pastoral colleagues as well as to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], their children, and household. Schlatter's pious colleague Jakob Würben also sends his regards. Heinrich's brother Johannes is also warmly greeted!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I am returning your annotations on Deuteronomy, most illustrious man, not indeed by the day you prescribed, but by the one my duties allowed. Each week, I must deliver four to six sermons, sometimes even for the catechumens. Therefore, I give you the greatest thanks for this singular benefit of yours, and for your other countless benefits towards me, and I pray to God that, since I cannot, He may abundantly repay you.</p>

      <p>There is nothing new to write about now. Everything is well with us. We have a new city clerk, but unlike the previous one, as can be judged from his manners and the company he frequently keeps. He was indeed received from the court of the Bishop of Basel, whose recommendation he used to obtain this position with us. What we can expect from him, we do not know yet, but soon time will reveal.</p>

      <p>As for what is happening in Bern, it would be too long to write and also not very safe. Our good Erasmus is being tormented by the gravest vexations there. He is compelled to defend his reputation in court. The matter seems to be leading to his expulsion and the triumph of the opposing party. What will happen after this is not unclear. I certainly wish you could see and hear in person what is happening there. Undoubtedly, you would lament the unfortunate state of the Bernese church, once so celebrated and harmonious, now torn apart. Believe me, I write this not from ill will, but I wish you could see my heart. I pray to God that He may always lead His chosen ones with His Holy Spirit and not allow them to be entangled and absorbed by human errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your harmony gives me great hope that eventually the other currently troubled churches, provoked by your example, will calm their spirits and return to the pursuit of peace and sincere charity. But if, hastening to their fate, they do not do this, your unanimity will at least break their reckless attempts, so they do not harm the healthy ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>This is what I had to write to you at present, most excellent man, and I will write more extensively in the future when the occasion permits. Meanwhile, always commend us to your paternal love. Farewell and live most happily. Greet on behalf of myself and our Leopold all our fathers and brothers in the Lord, as well as your wife and children and your entire household. The very pious Jakob Würben, my colleague and dearest brother in the Lord, also sends his greetings. Given in Biel, October 28. Also, please convey my warmest greetings to your brother Johannes Bullinger. Michael Schlatter, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord. Gen Zürich.</p>
