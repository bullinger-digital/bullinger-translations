    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses gratitude for Bullinger's goodwill. Will go [with Johannes Wolf and Johann Jakob Wick] [to study] to Leipzig and intends to stay with Wolf for a year unless he receives other instructions; Wick was recalled to Zurich and will return for the [spring] fair. Haller is focusing his studies entirely on his future role as a pastor, a calling for which he is very grateful. Bullinger will receive further news from others; apologizes for his imprudent behavior and for the brevity and style of his letter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings from our Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Often deliberating with myself, by what means, dearest father Bullinger, I might be able to reconcile with you, all my thoughts and plans were surpassed by your humanity, kindness, and clemency, for which humanity I give you as many thanks as I can, and I have them, and in return, I promise to be the kind of person towards you that you expect me to be.</p>
      <p>We will set out for Leipzig, where we have been ordered to go, expecting your other decrees at the next fair. However, we ask, dear father, that you allow Wolf and me to stay in Leipzig for a whole year. For Wick, due to certain reasons, has been called back by you and intends to return at the next fair. If you permit, we will return afterwards. But these things are for you to decide and for us to execute.</p>
      <p>Regarding my studies, I write only this one thing, that everything is aimed at fulfilling the function to which I am destined. I know it is a holy and divine office, and I give thanks to my God, who has regarded the humility of His servant (as the prophet says) and has called me to that most sacred ministry of His word, and I rejoice in God, my savior, that He has wished me to be a herald of His word and name. But more on this another time.</p>
      <p>As for other news, others (I believe) are writing. You, forgive, I ask, the imprudence I committed before; for a certain pious simplicity, I swear to God, was the cause of my error. Forgive also, I ask, dear father, that I write so hastily; I will provide better shortly.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt, 15th of September, 1541.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and father, to be honored perpetually. Zurich.</p>
