      <p>My father, even now, with the Occitan envoys still absent, we have not been able to decide on the conditions of that peace, which I wish I could hope for as much as I see it, as is fitting, being sought with the utmost zeal by all good people.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since the most illustrious prince has learned from the envoy that he is now being urged to do what he recently rejected, and rightly so, he has clearly indicated to me that he greatly desires that your envoys do not arrive before it is decided here under what conditions peace can be conveniently made. This would have been done long ago if the Occitans, whose delay we bear more grievously because we cannot guess its causes, had arrived in time. And yet it will happen within a few days, even if they have not arrived.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, know that there is something in which our dear Lochmann can greatly assist us; if you encourage him to accomplish this, you will greatly gratify the most illustrious prince and all of us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, and continue to love us. Basel, February 22, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, my most revered lord and father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
