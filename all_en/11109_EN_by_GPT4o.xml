      <p>Greetings. I truly say, I thought you had conceived some ill of me, because you remained silent for so long after my letters to you. However, your recent letters have abundantly satisfied me. It pleases me that you hope well for common concord; for you indicate the spirit which I have always known to be in you. Preserve it along with the opinion that Vadianus once wrote to himself, which approves that there should be no place given to quarrels and the dissensions born from them among the ministers of Christ, and rightly so, everything will be well in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Regarding Konrad, know that I love him, his character pleases me, his studies please me, his diligence and its constancy please me; for he does not exceed the hours appointed for certain lessons. I know the fear of the Lord dwells in his heart. Not a day passes in which he does not devote himself to sacred reading, and there is an innate integrity in the young man. As for what you complain about his extravagance, he himself will answer. Indeed, I do not see him spending anything beyond measure.</p>
      <p>Since he returned to me, he has lived and acted most piously and, as befits a studious young man, most studiously. Therefore, I think he is worthy that you do not withhold your helping hands; for I hope Zurich will one day gain uncommon praise and benefit from him. Therefore, I commend him to you as mine and all of ours. It does not please me that he should act as a tutor; for I think such a character should be learning as long as teachers are present at this age of man. After this has passed, do with him whatever you please. Thus far about Konrad.</p>
      <p>If you had heard our Grynaeus about that Nuremberger, you would partly have laughed, partly been amazed. No one can sufficiently praise the man's talent in literary studies, but no one can sufficiently detest his self-centeredness. May the Lord mercifully remove such things in men endowed with much happiness today; for they have not greatly benefited the churches thus far. I say nothing about the wife he took.</p>
      <p>Capito writes that the Emperor will be in Germany in the coming spring with a Spanish army, and that Vicenza has been chosen by the Roman pontiff to hold a council. A weapon certainly prepared against us. Our princes are by no means negligent here. May the Lord protect his church.</p>
      <p>More about the Bernese another time. For now, I cannot deal with more due to business.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family most happily.</p>
      <p>Basel, 11th of November, year 37.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>Bucer had asked me, while we were still together, that Vadianus be informed by you about the Bernese actions. Therefore, I ask, if you have sent nothing, that you send, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned bishop of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
