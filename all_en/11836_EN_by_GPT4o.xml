    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends money for a good cause, such as for the poor exiles. His wife [Anna Hilles] is expecting a child in three weeks and asks for prayers for her. At the last fair, he sent Bullinger 4 guilders for books through Heinrich Falkner [see HBBW XII, No. 1704]; Bullinger should remind Falkner that he owes him almost 124 crowns in gold and has so far only paid four in another currency to Christoph [Froschauer]. The background is this: Hilles initially agreed with Falkner on a payment of 175 guilders at the Strasbourg fair, but Falkner then requested to pay at the Frankfurt fair, and then in gold crowns, to invest the money elsewhere beforehand; this delay is a great loss for Hilles, as he could not buy cloth in England and had to accept a worse exchange rate. As he already wrote to John Burcher, King [Henry VIII] had three people [Anthony Pierson (Persons), Robert Testwood, and Harry Filmer] burned two months ago [on July 28, 1543]; in the same month, he also married [Catherine Parr,] the widow of the nobleman [John Neville, Lord] Latimer - with such atrocities [Henry] is known to celebrate his weddings. Greetings. Please forward letters to some Germans as well as money and a letter to Burcher.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, my most esteemed teacher and brother in Christ, our hope! I am sending here to your piety ten Italian crowns, which I wish to be distributed to the poor (rich in Christ) exiles at your discretion and opportunity, especially if there are any among you who are in need. My wife is expecting to give birth to a child in three weeks, and she earnestly asks you and your wife to commend her to the Lord in your prayers, whose strength is made perfect in weakness. At the last fair, I gave your 4 guilders for books to Heinrich Falkner, whom I pray you to commend me to: and please tell him that although he most solemnly promised me that he would ensure all the money (the sum was almost one hundred and twenty-four crowns), which he owed me at this Frankfurt fair, would be paid in gold crowns; yet I have received no more than four from Lord Christoph, but he paid me the other money, as usual, most honorably. But the matter stands thus: Heinrich Falkner first agreed with me to pay 175 guilders at our Strasbourg fair. Then he asked me to defer the payment to this Frankfurt fair, when he would pay the entire sum in gold crowns, as appears from his own note, written in his hand. I granted this to him, on the condition, however, that he would keep his promise, as befits a merchant: for he said he could make a profit with those 175 guilders by buying tapestries and such goods. However, I suffer this inconvenience from this, that before this day (if I had sent those crowns from the Strasbourg fair with my other money at that time) new cloths would have been bought in England with that money: moreover, since in this city of Strasbourg among friends with those 175 guilders, which Falkner should have given me as ready money, I could have quickly obtained gold crowns for 23 batzen, I was forced to give a Jew in Frankfurt 23 batzen and 1/4. Thus I lost two guilders, besides the use of the money. But I hope he will fulfill what he promised another time. I do not have the leisure to write more, except that our king, two months ago, as I wrote to John Burcher, burned three pious men in one day. For in the month of July, he married a widow named [Catherine Parr,] of a certain nobleman [John Neville, Lord] Latimer; and with such crimes, he is accustomed to always make his weddings famous. Farewell in Christ. Strasbourg, 26 September, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>I pray you, together with these letters addressed to the German men, to deliver another 10 French crowns and my other letters to John Burcher.</p>
