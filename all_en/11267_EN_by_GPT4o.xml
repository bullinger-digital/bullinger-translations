    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses satisfaction with the omission of his preface [to Sebastian Meyer's commentary] on the Apocalypse. However, Meyer is upset that the original preface, with its criticism of Luther, was reprinted unchanged. Since he did not negotiate any free copies for Meyer and is therefore suspected by him, he is willing to bear the costs himself if necessary. The printing of two communion sermons, which Erasmus [Ritter] presented to him as a member of the censorship authority, failed mainly due to the resistance of [Peter] Kunz, who pointed out the multitude of already existing writings and spoke of Zurich's publication intentions; should the [First Helvetic] Confession actually be published, Rümlang wishes for Bern's inclusion. Kunz places Luther above all and has even criticized the [Bernese] Disputation, while he wanted to accept Luther's [Smalcald Articles]. Greetings. Offers Froschauer a "Dialectic" still to be revised for printing. Cannot excerpt the chronicle ["Catalogus annorum"] by Valerius [Anshelm] now, but will send the entire work after it is printed. Capito, contrary to a rumor, has not traveled to Bern and would not be welcome there.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is nothing, most learned and faithful Bullinger, that is more pleasing among the many things, which, although they have been most gratifying, have been immense and innumerable from you to me, than that you suppressed my letter, so it would not be published with the Apocalypse. I admit that I wrote and pushed it forward hastily and not with full consideration. But my rashness turned out well under your protection, for which reason I must always rightfully acknowledge you as my patron and I promise to do so diligently.</p>
      <p>Sebastian (Meyer) is indignant that neither your vote nor mine, as he had demanded, was specifically included, and he accuses us of neglect, as if we conspired not to let our votes support his writings. He asserts that he can infer nothing good from this, suspecting that we wanted to protect ourselves from any risk on his behalf, especially because he believes he refuted Luther's arguments more harshly in the preface than he thought necessary; for he claims this book was conceived in those years and at that time when he still had little agreement with Luther.</p>
      <p>Now, since the matter of concord is still pending and many renowned men are diligently working to mend it, he fears that Luther might be too provoked by this refutation; therefore, we should have either softened or corrected it, so that no danger would be feared from it. But why say more? The old man, who is not easily satisfied, fears more to offend Luther than to endanger the truth, understanding that we do not wish to deviate from the sacramental doctrine we have professed and proven, even though some may offer soothing remedies in the meantime. This is the only thing that troubles him; otherwise, there would be nothing to move him even a little. But he wastes his effort, with God's help, who believes that we have not taken deeper root in Christ than to still depend on man, etc. However he interprets my actions, you know I acted candidly, as I dealt with you alone about the Apocalypse, although I also shared some things about it with Pellican (Konrad Pellikan).</p>
      <p>Additionally, I did not agree with Christoph Froschauer on the price for a copy and some copies to be sent to Sebastian, and since he sent not a pile of copies but only one, he suspects (as it seems to me) that I am gaining something from it and seeking profit from his work, which is entirely foreign to me. And unless Christoph will relieve me of this accusation, even though I have said nothing to him about these matters, it will be over for me, and I will not allow my name to be endangered, and I will spend 12 pounds of Bernese currency from my own funds and purchase 10 copies from my own resources to hand over to him, so that he may be satisfied, since he is so attentive to the matter, and I will pay for my forgetfulness, as he seeks nothing else than to be able to bring me down; but he wastes his effort. He wishes me ill because I am freer and not easily moved and because I have considerable influence in the magistracy. You act as a patron in this, as in all things, and if Christoph agrees and consents, I will pay Sebastian 12 pounds; for I am still among the names of debtors to Christoph.</p>
      <p>If he refuses, I will provide from my own resources, etc. Thus, I learn only at my own peril to foresee what is unfavorable to me, etc. But enough of these matters, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding private matters, know that Erasmus (Ritter) showed me and offered me a copy of two sermons on the sacrament of the Eucharist held here and asked that they be printed; for I am appointed by the senate with three others to ensure that nothing is published by the printer here unless it is approved and reviewed by us. When I informed my colleagues, they did not want anything on the sacramental matter to be published here, and I could not obtain anything because Kunz (Peter Kunz) most gravely opposed me in publishing these sermons under the pretext that many things on this matter had already been published by Zwingli, Oecolampadius of blessed memory, and others, from which one could seek what pertains to this matter; therefore, we should not be the cause of offense to anyone, as most people's minds would seize upon anything in a harsher manner and bind themselves with almost solemn words rather than leave evangelical freedom. Therefore, nothing on this matter should be published here at this time, especially since what is being done in Zurich regarding the confession and other things conducive to it, from which everyone can be abundantly supplied on this matter, so that we do not need such sermons. Thus, these sermons are prevented from being published.</p>
      <p>But if you wish the confession to be published, which would greatly please me, I ask you to do this with our consent, so that we do not feel neglected or despised; you will find us ready, and although Kunz wishes nothing less, yet, whether he wants it or not, he will not be able to oppose it, since Luther has published so much in our silence.</p>
      <p>Kunz is a man who favors no one more than Luther; he is so infatuated with his writings that he did not hesitate to criticize our recent disputation before the senate. But when he was referred to the deacons, he did not dare to appear. He would have gladly supported Luther's booklet, and in whatever way he could have done so, so that Luther's name would become almost an idol to us. Whatever he promises you, whatever he writes, there is no reason to think he can dissent from Luther unless he is forced to fear the people and stones.</p>
      <p>I have been more lengthy than I intended; thus, I have digressed. I ask you to always keep me recommended, as you do and I trust you will. Greet in my name Pellican (Konrad Pellikan), Theodor (Theodor Bibliander), Leo (Leo Jud), Megander (Kaspar Megander), Rhellican (Johannes Rhellicanus), Binder (Johannes Binder), Collin (Rudolf Collin), Amman (Johannes Amman), and especially the not uncheerful Steyner (Johannes Steyner), also Frisius (Johannes Frisius), my former student.</p>
      <p>If Froschauer (Christoph Froschauer) wishes to print the Dialectic, I would have it ready, as I think, completed, but still needing to be reviewed by me, not as small as I would like.</p>
      <p>As for Valerius's (Valerius Anshelm) chronicle: it will be printed next summer and at the next upcoming Frankfurt fair. Therefore, it is not in my power to excerpt anything from it; but I will send you the complete work once it is finished. I do have a copy to review, but it has been entrusted to me with the promise not to intercept anything, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, pillar and sweet glory of my homeland and mine. Given on February 13, 1539.</p>
      <p>A rumor had spread among us that Capito (Wolfgang Capito) was coming; but it has subsided. Certainly, if he came, he would not be well received; for we would think he only wanted to deceive us with fraud, etc.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
