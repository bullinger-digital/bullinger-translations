      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed man, and those of the elders of the Polish church, my most revered lords and brothers, written in Krakau on December 13th, quite promptly and understood from them that you suspect we lend our ears to informers and that perhaps even Mr. Martin Czechowicz has reported certain things to us.</p>
      <p>But I assure you here to be at ease.</p>
      <p>That Martin, a good man, as far as I could understand, did not criticize anyone among you with even the slightest word; he commended the Polish churches. It is also true that I received letters at that time signed by you yourself, dear Cruciger. In these, there is nothing that could be accused by anyone; indeed, to make it clear to all what they were like, and so that no one suspects that other things were written to me than they really were, I had the letter transcribed by a certain Pole and I send it here, so that all may openly see that there is nothing in that letter of which anyone should be ashamed. And I am very surprised by what counsel the good men urge so much in the latest letters about those previously written to me by the circumvented, since there is nothing false in those letters.</p>
      <p>If you truly and sincerely, as I believe, approve the confession made in the latter letters, you cannot disapprove the one made in the former letters; and if the mind of both is one and the same, I do not see why you should have written to me so anxiously. Beware, brothers, beware, lest suspicions stir up dissensions among you; but be united in sincere faith and love. May the Lord Jesus bless you and keep you all! If I can serve you all in any way, I am entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Pray for us to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich, March 16, 1562.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
