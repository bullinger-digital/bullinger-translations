      <p>Grace from God above. I have received your fourth letter, sent to me by Abel Mülhofer, along with Bl[aureri]'s sermons and your notes on matrimonial matters. I am sending them back to you with this letter, thanking you kindly for all the good; whatever I have and can do shall always be at your service without reservation.</p>
      <p>I would have liked to write back to you sooner; however, I had no messenger until now. Therefore, do not mind that Calvin's letter has been delayed; I have had it with me for about 8 or 9 days, without being able to send it due to the lack of a messenger. He writes to you and sends some booklets, as you will see, and also writes to Dr. Hoperus, sending him your booklet on the Interim; note well, he sent it before either your or my letter reached him.</p>
      <p>As you wrote to me, I have arranged it, sent him your letter, and also wrote myself about the booklet, dissimulato tuo nomine (without mentioning your name), but a few days after I had sent ours, he brought the booklet to me. Since he is sending it back, I see well that he does not want it printed; what the reason is, I do not know; he might write to you or Hoperus about it. It is a pity if it is not printed, for the sake of many troubled hearts. If it pleases you, I would like to try again with Apiarius, to see if he would print it secretly. I am also willing, with your advice, to translate it into German and perhaps have one or two copies written and sent to Augsburg; for many pious people are always writing to me, desiring some clarification. I know nothing better, purer, or simpler to send them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, please arrange for a copy to be returned to me soon; I would have kept it if I had not thought that Hoperus would need it.</p>
      <p>The Lausanne affair has once again been brought up. On January 28th, they all appeared here: Lodovicus Corbelius on one side, Viretus, Jacobus Valerius, Ribittus, Franciscus de S. Paulo, Corderius, and Mörlinus on the other.</p>
      <p>Corbelius complained vehemently about how they wanted to exclude him because he had revealed all their dealings and disputes, etc. They responded to him. My gracious lords have shown it to us, to hear it at length and report to their graces what we think should be done. So they have submitted their case in writing on both sides, entire booklets, which kept us busy for two days. Therefore, we asked our gracious lords, as the matter concerns us, that it is more a quarrel of words, envy, and spite than a serious matter concerning doctrine, asking them to send them home and let both sides be content; then we would sit over it and read the proceedings with good diligence and report further to their graces what we find. So it was decided at home. When we came to it, it was nothing but a sea of calumnies on both sides and nothing righteous. Corbelius is a runaway monk, accepted here for three years and having taken off his habit, receiving a stipend as a student in Lausanne. They wanted to censure him for his disorderly conduct according to their office; he ran away and claimed that they wanted to exclude him from the Lord's Supper. When we brought the whole matter before my lords, they appointed my treasurer Steiger and me to visit the school, settle the matter, and earnestly reform whatever was lacking. We intend to ride there next week.</p>
      <p>Since Xystus declined his vocation, as you know, we proposed Sebastian Guldibeck to my lords; but he was declined because my gracious lords of Zurich cannot always be burdened, so they accepted M. Benedict Martin, who is still in Marburg in Caspar Rudolf's place; he asked me well if he would not bring his Lutheran spirit with him; one must keep him in check.</p>
      <p>Today, Musculus's matter was before my lords; I wanted to try it last. By God's grace, it has gone so that he is accepted; however, we servants are to give our common counsel on it. Now, Mr. Jos is well with me; Waeber and Nicolaus are strongly opposed; Eberhard would like to promote it; but since he understood that he should be called to the theological profession, he is against it. However, I will work to arrange the lecture as in Zurich and that Eberhard is not used any less; we must have his support, otherwise, he would soon be pushed out by the council. How it will go in the council, I do not know yet; if it happens before the messenger leaves, I will write it. If I do not write it and no letter comes in a few days, then it is nothing; yet I do not think it will be delayed any longer, since it has been decided by the council. Musculus may well win the bread of prayer.</p>
      <p>Regarding the synod, a form has been established by us on how it should be held, both the German and the French; it has been confirmed and accepted by my gracious lords, and the German one will be summoned for Tuesday after Invocavit at night here at the inn, the French one about eight days later, on Tuesday after Reminiscere.</p>
      <p>I am very concerned about unrest; but it is so unresolved among the wicked priests (I cannot call them otherwise), that I fear if we do not begin to punish ourselves, God must judge us. Regarding the sacramental dispute, we have arranged for some examiners to be appointed by my lords to us; all those who are suspect and let themselves be noticed will be shown to them. Note well, there will be much unrest, so that we will have enough to examine until Easter.</p>
      <p>Regarding my own affairs, I commend them to God and the recognition of my lords, and will conduct myself, God willing, as is proper. I know well that whatever I do, I will not please everyone.</p>
      <p>Apiarius is glad that the Dogmata ecclesiastica of Naogeorgus can be found again, and will print it as nicely as he can. Thomas tells me here himself that he would like the preface to be changed; I will see how it happens, so that no harm comes from it. There is no lack of copies, even if he should otherwise make a contribution to it.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Waeber's letter back here; you will sense his temptation well. He let me read your letter at my request; but he is still the same.</p>
      <p>I only ask you, if Musculus comes to you, to take him for yourselves and speak with him as needed, so that the churches of Zurich and Bern draw together, that he therefore lets Strasbourg and Basel go, holds firmly to us, and seriously confronts those who attack him or his writings, does not associate or attach himself to them, and thereby destroys the unity that God has now granted us. He will be much attacked, so that he holds himself bravely, etc., as you well know; so I hope the church will be helped. As I also wrote recently, as soon as he arrives here, send us a boy or two; it will serve him and all of us well with my lords. I would like to see your Decades from the heart; for they will be well received by me, since I still always preach alone on the themes that are assigned to me each week; therefore, I will not mind if you write to me less until you are ready.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of Savoy, I cannot write to you; it will be hard to let go. Now they are writing down all the old dealings that were had with the dukes, all the processes; all the scribes have enough to do. A copy will be sent to each place.</p>
      <p>This week, a servant of the imperial messenger was arrested here for some bad words he uttered, now stretched several times; I do not know what he confessed; it is suspected that strange practices are behind him.</p>
      <p>What the bishop intends for the city of Basel, I think you know; I can well imagine all bishops will seek the rhyme. May God give us grace and strength to overcome all evil.</p>
      <p>Zwingli invites me to Basel for his magisterium; but I cannot go anywhere due to the consideration of the affairs; for above all others, I must go to Lausanne at this time. For now, I know nothing further than to commend you, your wife, and children to God faithfully; they send their sincere greetings from me and my wife, along with Musculus and his household, to whom I do not want to write at this time, but let you be his evangelist until everything is settled.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>One more thing comes to mind: Dear friend, if you know any good, honest, pious brothers who are not provided for, send them here, instructed with your recommendations; we might well accept one or two.</p>
      <p>Regarding Musculus, the matter stands well. My lord mayor has sent all three of us, Mr. Jos, Waeber, and me, at this hour, informing us of my lords' will and counsel; they wanted to inform us all, so that we would also communicate our opinion to them; thus, you have said nothing. However, we will deliberate further. If he is written to, it would be honorable for my lords of Zurich to give him a companion, also instructing my lords through a letter, so that it is seen that he is not unworthy of Zurich and that he is also more esteemed here. Understand it as best as possible. God be with you. (God be with me) Given as above at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To his beloved dear lord and godfather M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
