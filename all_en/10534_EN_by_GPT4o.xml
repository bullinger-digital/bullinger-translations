    <p xml:id="regest1">Has received Bullinger's letter and the enclosed writing from the governor of Lenzburg [Sulpitius Haller]. He will adhere to the date that Bullinger sets for a meeting with him. Doubts the accuracy of the report about the machinations against the pastors in the district of Grüningen. Is pleased that [Peter Simler], Bullinger's brother Johannes, Heini Jos, and others from the Freiamt want to visit him. Pastor Morandus [Schmid] could bring peace to Rüti, although he is also needed in Thurgau.</p>

      <p>May Almighty God grant you and all your people, as well as those dear to you, a good and prosperous year, etc.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, my particularly trusted, gracious, and dear lord, etc. I received your letter, along with the enclosed writing from the governor of Lenzburg, on Christmas Eve and I am writing to inform you that you can arrange a meeting with the governor of Lenzburg at your convenience. However, if possible, please inform me eight days in advance, and I will adjust accordingly, better than if I had set the date myself. Some wish to know the best intentions, so that you can adjust accordingly.</p>
      <p>Regarding the other matter, I have instructed someone to return to Rapperswil and investigate the matter thoroughly, if possible. However, I have not yet received any further information. I do not give much credence to the matter, as it seems to be an exaggerated scheme or rumor.</p>
      <p>Also know that the farmer from Oetwil has informed me that the prior of Kappel, your brother Johannes, Heini Jos, and other good gentlemen and companions from the Freiamt have a plan to visit me around Carnival, which would truly be a great service and joy to me, and now to the detriment of the lazy crowd. It must be ensured that the governor of Lenzburg does not arrive at the same time.</p>
      <p>Regarding Pastor Morandus, I would know well, if he is not particularly amiable to the monks, that he would have a simple service; but they desire him. So I assure him with all loyalty and truth, and it seems to me he would be more likely to bring peace, than if there were someone whom the monks would find unfavorable or hostile. Nevertheless, he also regrets going to Frauenfeld; as he has a large kinship there, he is likely to be more prominent against the governor, etc.</p>
      <p>Understand my writing in the best way and commend us to our gracious and merciful Lord and God.</p>
      <p>Given in the year of our Lord 1535, on the feast of St. John the Evangelist.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant at all times, Hans Rudolf Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the foundation of Zurich, my particularly trusted and dear lord.</p>
