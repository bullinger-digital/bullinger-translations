      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Montbéliard, etc. Our greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear, especially, we have written to Johann Vogler the Elder at your request and given him other instructions to report to you verbally; for we know and can write nothing certain or good to you, which is why we send this writing and evil quite weary and tired. May the gracious God grant better times and more upright hearts in the Lord; for we unfortunately still see, among all estates. What four newspapers in Röden stand with Strasbourg, Vogler can report to you. Be entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Given by our hand. Basel, the 6th of December, year 48.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, our dear, special one.</p>
