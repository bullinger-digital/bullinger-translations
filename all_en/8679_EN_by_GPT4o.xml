      <p>S. I have again received everything you sent, most esteemed lord and godfather, and indeed I am returning the earlier writings on discipline through this person, who conveniently offered himself to us. However, what you have now sent through Küngßfeld, since I have not yet been able to share it with anyone, I will return through the next available person. I thank you for all these things; Aretius also thanks you, whom I believe will also write to you. It is truly a remarkable reversal of events that Wittenberg, where Luther seemed to have established his unchangeable and eternal seat of doctrine, now stands for us against the remaining Lutherans, and conversely in Basel, where Oecolampadius himself defended the doctrine of truth against Luther, the Lutherans now universally reign.</p>
      <p>These things greatly comfort us, but they also frighten and teach us to be vigilant. We also wish to see the writing of the Wittenbergers, about which you write, as soon as it can be made available to us. We have nothing new, nor do I yet know what has been done or concluded at Baden. Steiger has not yet returned from his grape harvest in Rotul. The wine yield was also less here than expected; only in the upper parts of this region, namely in Thun and around Lake Thun, the yield has miraculously exceeded all expectations, so that in many years there has not been such an abundance of good wine as this year. Thus, the Lord's goodness dispenses his gifts wonderfully, as it pleases him. Grain is sold for eight pounds, and although there is much of it and the poor are heavily burdened, we still consider ourselves fortunate in these parts if our situation is compared with yours or with foreigners. May the Lord have mercy on us and look upon his poor everywhere again with a serene and merciful countenance. Amen.</p>
      <p>The consul of Mülinen, both treasurers, and all friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>The father-in-law is in Küngßfeld.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 12, 1571.</p>
      <p>May all your people be well. Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
