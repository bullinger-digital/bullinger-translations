      <p>Greetings. I know, most reverend teacher, what I promised in the final salutation of your magnificence; therefore, I write now and indeed would have written earlier if it had been possible in any way. I hope you are all safe and sound, just as I left you; as for me, I completed my journey happily and came to Paris, experiencing almost no adverse fortune, except that we were examined twice, once in Lyon, and again between Orl√©ans and Paris; from which I escaped by the kindness of my ignorance, as I did not know the French language.</p>
      <p>When I came to Paris and had seen many things, and heard many things narrated by others, I certainly found the republic very disturbed; for the main parts of it, the parliament and the university, are not only harmed but also gravely afflicted. The author of this evil and many others is the Lorrainer, who burns with a certain hostile hatred against this republic, which he seems to aim to destroy. Hence, he has established a new academy in his duchy, and a new parliament in his domain, which are like the nerves, or rather the feet, on which this city of destitute Paris no longer has the right to call itself a city. But I omit these things.</p>
      <p>I believe the teacher has heard about the death of that brother, I mean the cardinal, who was the prefect of the sea. He had ordered a certain nobleman to be killed, whose brother then killed him.</p>
      <p>If others do not experience such fortune, it is because they give the highest thanks to God. We have nothing about the king, except that he is a boy and sickly, who does everything at the cardinal's nod, even to the extent of conceding his own wife to him; for it is certainly affirmed that he sleeps with her. Duke Guise has a war with the constable, which at first seemed quite fierce, but now is more subdued. The origin of the war is this: the constable has a very beautiful castle nearby, which he bought long ago, and to which this duke, having set his mind on many things, tried to secretly capture by sending soldiers; but the constable, having immediately sent some to defend the castle, implored the help of the King of Navarre, at the same time donating the castle to him, so that he might defend it as his own. The king, therefore, having immediately understood the matter, wrote to Guise to abstain from his goods, for the castle was his, otherwise, he would avenge the injury with arms and would come shortly, not without danger to him. Meanwhile, Guise, caring little for these threats, plots against this castle.</p>
      <p>The king is indeed said to be coming here, but when, is unknown. Finally, dearest teacher, I want you to know that a book is being printed here by Andreas Echelo or has already been printed, titled Against the Doctrine of Calvin; this was written by a Frenchman of the German order, and for this reason, that, being suspected by the king of Lutheranism, he might show that he was by no means of that religion, he published this writing. Farewell, dearest father in Christ and reverend teacher, and take care of this little letter of mine, full indeed of love and zeal towards you all, but lacking in learning and elegance of writing. I commend myself to you all as the most obedient disciple and at the same time thank you for the immortal benefits bestowed upon me when I was with you, which if either I or any of mine can repay, there will be nothing prior. Again, farewell, dearest teacher, and greet your most esteemed brother for me, along with your wife, and finally the whole family, always most beloved.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Rando Schatter. 1560. September 8.</p>
