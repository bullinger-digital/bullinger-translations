      <p>They were standing... [in] readiness, they did not want to wait for the lady to write. Therefore, she greets you and Gwalther along with the brothers. These are the news: they say the Emperor is dead and Philip of Spain is approaching Germany with a large army. The church in Richenweiler is expecting a new visitor, Doctor Jakob Andreae Schmidli. O holy visitation! Farewell.</p>
      <p>The second of September, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>Farewell all in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, etc.</p>
