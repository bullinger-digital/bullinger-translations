      <p>S. I give and express the greatest and utmost thanks to you, most illustrious man, for your kindness towards me, which ensures that you do not deny what I request to be copied, undoubtedly reasoning that it is very important for such things to be readily available in our churches. Therefore, I am now returning what you recently sent, having copied it, and I wish I also had Mr. Musculus's writing on the Servetus case, which you mentioned in your letters. I would also like to have the responses of the Bernese and the Baselers regarding the Geneva Consistory or ecclesiastical excommunication; for I am eager to collect such things (especially if they concern religion and ministry).</p>
      <p>A rumor has reached us about the English tumult, that some Spaniards have been slaughtered there, the queen is nowhere safe, the English absolutely refuse to recognize Philip, the son of the Emperor, as king, and they want the pure and unblemished evangelical religion, etc., about all of which I think you will have certain information, and I ask that, if you have it, you would be so kind as to share it with me; I have nothing.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am compelled to retract what I recently wrote about the purchase, payment, and debt of your nephew, which was done out of excessive haste and poor understanding; he bought 400 pelts, white and black throats, 50 fox bellies; he paid 8 crowns, 16 florins remain to be paid at the Zurzach fair.</p>
      <p>This is the true state of affairs, which you undoubtedly understood from your nephew; indeed, he would have counted more crowns, but they were lighter. Farewell, therefore, most humane man, and do not take anything amiss, and always keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peyer has returned from France; if there is any news, we assume you will receive it from the Frenchman himself.</p>
      <p>Christians are being burned daily in France. Farewell again. Winzürnius extorted letters of recommendation from Father Ittingen to our magistrate; he chooses such patrons and advocates for himself, from which he is to be judged, what kind of person he is, etc.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, February 21, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger. To the honorable and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zurich, his friendly, dear lord and brother, to hand.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
