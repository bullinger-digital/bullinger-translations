      <p>To Calvin, 13th August 1557.</p>
      <p>I would never have thought that our Beza would leave such a confession in the hands of the princes, as I now have no doubt he has left. He, along with Mr. Farel, urged us strongly to insist with our people that a colloquium (discussion) be established; however, they kept silent about having offered a confession without our knowledge, and indeed one that sides with our adversaries against us. For we do not recognize that either we or our predecessors have taught about the Lord's Supper in our churches in the manner they confess; however, we confess that our opinion and that of our people is contained in our Consensus (agreement).</p>
      <p>If they wanted to offer our confession to the princes, why did they not offer the Consensus? etc. We do not think such expressions should be used in a matter that has been controversial for so long, which might offend the simpler-minded. In my opinion, we ought to simply confess the truth and use plain words and clear statements, so that we do not appear to be deceiving our adversaries or fearing for our cause. And now see, my brother and esteemed lord Calvin, if we are to come to a colloquium, what a bind these people have entangled us in. For I cannot acknowledge such a confession before God and the church.</p>
      <p>If therefore (not) only I, but also many others, have contradicted, Westphal will shout: Did I not say that they disagree among themselves? etc. But what was the necessity of leaving such a confession in the hands of the princes, and indeed without us, and without our knowledge or consultation: meanwhile, not without us and in our name, as if we also teach in this way. If they had professed this about themselves, everything would be more tolerable.</p>
      <p>Therefore, that confession torments me, especially since I know how it has been received by the adversaries and how it will be used against us, and if it ever comes to light, how it will offend the pious, how it will be detrimental to the common cause of truth. To me, it indeed does not seem to agree with those things which are in the Consensus and in the books published against Westphal. etc.</p>
      <p>I freely profess these things to you, and I pray to the Lord that He may turn everything to the glory of His name. Farewell with all the fellow ministers and brothers.</p>
      <p>If you share this with Mr. Beza, it will not be unwelcome.</p>
