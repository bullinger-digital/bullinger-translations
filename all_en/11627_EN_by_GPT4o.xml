    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the received letter [No. 1578]; in these dangerous times, one must rely on God and His Word and disregard the advice of the unbelievers; Bullinger often silently laments the ingratitude and neglect of duty of this time, for there are people who confess the Gospel with their mouths but prove the opposite with their deeds; others, in turn, strive day and night for a reform of the Church, but with their zeal, they actually play into the hands of the Papists; such behavior leads the weak to adopt a waiting attitude towards the truth; in these dire times, we should make it our concern to convince many people through the Gospel, to raise our voices for instruction, strengthening, and support, and to pray to God, who always hears the prayers of His own. Greetings, also from Leo Jud and Kaspar Megander.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter was most welcome to me, most learned Erb, not only because all your letters are very dear to me, but also because they seemed to reflect a singular love and most holy zeal for piety. This present age nurtures a monster and will eventually bring forth a basilisk; yet the Lord has said through His prophet about anyone who is zealous for piety: "You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent" [Ps 91:13]. Therefore, let us rely on the true, living, and eternal God in these most perilous times, let us rely on the word of truth, never departing from it even a hair's breadth, as the saying goes, and we will certainly be delivered from the counsels of the wicked. I often silently lament the ingratitude and neglect of duty of our age. There are those who want to appear as if they are carrying the wagons of the Gospel, but if their goods are examined, it is more accurately hypocrisy. They proclaim the Gospel with their mouths, but express the devil with their deeds. When you remove their mask, they surpass the cobra and the basilisk in anger, fury, and venom. There are others, in turn, who think day and night about reforming the Church, reforming it in such a way that the Papists now have greater hope than ever that they will come closer to them of their own accord, not forced by arms, but by the advice given by the evangelicals. The simple stumble over their works and unfaithful diligence, the weak suspend their judgment and think it better to remain in weakness and await the outcome of the matter than to fully learn the truth now and soon unlearn it. These are indeed our times, as I subscribe to you, that the present age is giving birth to a great monster. Let it give birth to whatever it will; let us take care to generate many through the Gospel. If those whose duty it was do not contribute their efforts or contribute grudgingly or sluggishly, let us ensure that nothing can be seen as neglected on our part, let us teach, rebuke in season and out of season, strengthen, support, establish, and pray sincerely to the Lord, who never fails to hear the prayers of His own. He will be present in time to those who call upon His name. To Him be the glory!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, and pray to the Lord for us. Zurich, 13th of November, 1541.</p>
      <p>Leo Jud, Kaspar Megander, etc., greet you. Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the Lord Matthias Erb, most pious and vigilant pastor of Reichenweiler, his most esteemed friend and brother. To the pastor in Reichenweiler.</p>
