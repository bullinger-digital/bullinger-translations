      <p>Be safe in Christ, most illustrious Bullinger! You accuse my fellow countrymen, the English, of ingratitude, for not sending you any letters. And I fear that you might charge me with the same crime, because I did not write to you during the previous fairs. My dear Bullinger, accuse me of anything rather than ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Believe me, I would rather not exist than be ungrateful. If I did not write, attribute it to illness, and a very dangerous one at that, not to me.</p>
      <p>Can I forget my Zurichers? I cannot, as long as I am mindful of myself, as long as breath governs these limbs.</p>
      <p>And lest you think I have forgotten you, (because I could not write due to my health,) I sent something to you, etc.</p>
      <p>If I ever pay my first fruits and extricate myself from debt, you will know who and what kind of person your Parkhurst is. I will address my brother bishops and others whom you accuse of ingratitude, and not without reason, quite sharply and imperiously in person (even if they have said enough by command). In the meantime, my letters will not cease to them: for I have a scribe who writes in English, but not in Latin.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, dear Bullinger, speak well of my fellow countrymen, even if they deserve to hear ill. I thank you for the book, which you say you sent to me, written this winter against Brentius. But I have not yet received it: I hope to receive it shortly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord open the eyes of Brentius and all the Lutherans, so that they are not overwhelmed by darkness in such great light! I have not yet seen Fabricius, the son of your standard-bearer. Within three days I will summon him to Norwich; for perhaps he refuses to come to me voluntarily.</p>
      <p>He will be most welcome, and he will not leave entirely without a gift. If a Zurich dog were to visit me, (though I know none except Gwalther's Wartlaeum,) I would value it greatly, and would not treat it in a dog-like manner, etc.</p>
      <p>These briefly in response to your two letters.</p>
      <p>Religion among us is in the same state as before, a state, I say, not entirely to be despised.</p>
      <p>But I hope for some better things in the next assemblies. There are many good men in England and fervent in spirit; there are many who are too cold; and there are not a few lukewarm ones, whom the Lord will spew out of his mouth. But to conceal nothing from you, I fear that many evils threaten our heads. For almost all are devoted to avarice, all love gifts.</p>
      <p>No truth, no benevolence, no knowledge of God.</p>
      <p>They have broken out in cursing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery, etc.</p>
      <p>And what Empedocles said of his Agrigentines, I will say of my English: The English indulge in pleasures as if they were to die tomorrow; they build as if they were to live forever. But may God grant that we repent from the heart!</p>
      <p>Farewell, most delightful Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your excellent wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, all the learned, magistrates, and all my friends. For your republic, I pour out prayers to God night and day.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>All mine to you.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>At Ludham, April 28, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich. 446a... b: To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
