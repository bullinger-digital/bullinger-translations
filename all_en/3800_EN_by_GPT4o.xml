      <p>Greetings. It has indeed been a very long time since I last wrote to you, most honorable and esteemed lord and godfather, but there is one reason for this: by writing more frequently to my brother, I have always reminded him of the matters he should communicate with you. I do not doubt that he has done so.</p>
      <p>Another reason is that I wanted to spare you, so as not to add more to the countless troubles you already endure. For I did not have much or more necessary matters to write about than our Lausanne issues and the controversy that exists between us and them.</p>
      <p>I know how unpleasant and troublesome it is to hear and learn about this: therefore, I would have gladly waited until the matter had reached some conclusion, with which I could have simultaneously refreshed your spirit. But we have not yet achieved that, and the whole matter still hangs in quite a significant balance. The business is as follows.</p>
      <p>After our most honorable senate had long and persistently requested the restoration of church discipline through frequent letters and delegations, they finally obtained that the senate should ask them what form of this they were seeking.</p>
      <p>Then, without consulting us and other churches, those residing in Lausanne composed a lengthy document in which they depicted a very remarkable hierarchy. I once wrote the summary of it to my brother, and I believe you have understood it from him.</p>
      <p>The entire form aimed to abolish the consistories that have been customary among us until now, to which church discipline was entrusted, because they seemed to them too civil and to have power not purely ecclesiastical, but too mixed with civil authority.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in their place, they requested that a new ecclesiastical senate be established, in which all ecclesiastical matters and church goods would have authority, and in which (as they explicitly stated) ministers would preside. From which also the stewards of church goods and deacons would be appointed, who would be obliged to render accounts of their administration to the same senate. And that such senates should also be established in each church.</p>
      <p>Much then about excommunication and the private examination of individuals before the use of the Lord's Supper, etc.</p>
      <p>This document, not previously offered to us, was directly transmitted to the senate. However, they also provided us with a copy to inspect.</p>
      <p>The senate, considering where their proposal was leading, was very offended and referred the whole matter to the diocese. Thus, it happened that those who seemed inclined to grant them some further discipline than they had previously had, completely withdrew their support, and compelled those summoned here to promise that they would henceforth remain quiet.</p>
      <p>For if they did not do this, the penalty of proscription was decreed against them. Having returned home, they were far from remaining quiet, so that what the ministers and professors of Lausanne had previously done alone, they now did with the entire class joined to them with combined forces. However, since they had seen how odious the chapters they proposed in their document were, they began to repeat only two, namely excommunication and private examination. The senate kindly warned them again through letters, and especially Viret, not to cause any disturbance, but to be content with the response previously given to them by the diocese.</p>
      <p>We also asked them, and privately dealt with Viret on many occasions. But he, adhering to his opinion, has now finally written to the senate with his colleague Valerio and deacon Arnulph that they cannot, with a good conscience, administer the Lord's Supper on the upcoming feast of the Nativity unless they are granted the examination through which they can know to whom they should worthily offer it. The matter has again reached the diocese.</p>
      <p>They are summoned again, and now we await their arrival.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Our people cannot be persuaded otherwise than that they are seeking dominion over consciences again, and also over church goods, and if one thing is granted to them, they will obtain all the other things they requested in their previous document. Therefore, there is no one who wants to grant them anything, and there is a danger that if they persist, as they will, they will not only be simply removed from their offices but also proscribed, that is, banished with an oath, as they call it.</p>
      <p>This grieves us greatly because of Viret: for he is a native, a learned man, of great renown, and who has labored long and much in these regions. Therefore, we intercede for him as much as we can.</p>
      <p>We fear that he may lead many others after him by his example, and thus introduce some schism into our churches. For there are many who would also leave at his departure.</p>
      <p>Those who remain will condemn all who stay, and thus the church will already be divided into factions, and it is to be feared that more serious contentions and disputes will follow.</p>
      <p>By the grace of the Lord, we are united in all these matters, which alone greatly comforts me, and we all strive to keep our church peaceful, no matter what they do. Beza, in the meantime, returned here after the first summons and obtained an amicable dismissal from the senate. He is now in Geneva, where he lectures in Greek and theology on alternate days, as I hear. Our people would have gladly had German professors in Lausanne, but since they cannot conveniently be had, and our people also fear greater expenses, I think this plan will be abandoned. I wanted to share this with you because you urge me to write in your letters.</p>
      <p>I do not willingly elaborate on these matters and would gladly spare you, but since I also know that the people of Lausanne fill the whole world with complaints, I wanted to briefly inform you of the essence of what is happening and what has been done. They complain about us, as if it were our fault that they did not obtain discipline, but the Lord knows that they themselves were hindered by their own importunity.</p>
      <p>We do not oppose discipline, but we consider what is useful for the church and what can be achieved at the same time. We cannot approve of daily innovations, as they tear apart our church, which is scarcely healed from an old wound, and especially such as they bring in large part. We find neither command nor example of the private examination, which they so insistently urge, in the evangelical writings, and since we see what occasion of tyranny it once was in the church, we gladly abstain from it, striving with pious diligence to achieve what they attempt to accomplish with that forced confession. I have nothing else to write.</p>
      <p>There were many rumors about peace.</p>
      <p>They say it was interrupted by the death of the Queen of England; but whether these things are also certain, I do not dare to affirm. Therefore, I await more certain information from you.</p>
      <p>You know better than I what is happening in Baden.</p>
      <p>Our people will never swear nor consent to a form contrary to our religion.</p>
      <p>We will hear from the delegates how the rest can be settled after they have returned. Musculus writes himself; therefore, nothing about him.</p>
      <p>Consider my words kindly and always keep us commended to you. All of ours greet you, especially my father-in-law, Haller, Diesbach, etc., and my mother.</p>
      <p>May your entire family be safe in the name of all of us. Bern, December 16, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and godfather, to be greatly honored. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
