    <p xml:id="regest1">Wishes that Bullinger, now that the commentary on the New Testament letters is completed, would oversee the printing of the [First Helvetic Confession]. Asks for news about the Solothurn "bandits," the siege of the castle [Chillon], etc. Abbot [Diethelm] has met with the captain and the steward on the way to Wil; the monk who supposedly insulted the participants of the Basel meeting is back in St. Gallen. Vogler hopes that Bullinger has received the copy that Kaspar [Megander] sent; the man who does not cease to scold the Bernese has arrived. Greetings. When [Heinrich] Rahn's house is ready, Vogler will come with his family. The people of Egnach should pursue their matter further, as they can now expect support from Bern.</p>

      <p>May God's grace preserve us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, my lord Vadian has informed me about the little book on the epistle that you made, which was printed in Frankfurt at the fair, etc. Now that you are finished with it, I earnestly ask you, for God's sake, on behalf of myself and others, to assist in having the sermon that took place in Basel printed by you. Once again, our earnest request is that you promote it as you are trusted, etc. Praise be to God for the Basel day, etc.</p>
      <p>What you hear from Baden on that day, also about the Solothurn bandits who are in Bern, or any news, please share with us. Also, how things stand with the castle before which the Bernese are laying siege, etc.</p>
      <p>Here, things are well. The abbot rode out of the city towards Wil the day before yesterday. On the way, he met the captain and the steward. And the pious monk who, as the story goes, is supposed to have preached: "The heretics could gather again in Basel," is also back here. The story was that he would not return, as he wanted to go to Lucerne, etc.</p>
      <p>I wonder if you have sent the copy to Bern to Caspar, as you know well. For the man has come, which is right, as he gives little credit to the pious Bernese with his talk on the street, etc.</p>
      <p>We both desire that you greet our wife, mother, boy, maiden, and everyone.</p>
      <p>When Heinrich Rahn's house is ready, we might come soon.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, Monday after Laetare in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>As I last spoke with you, on behalf of the honest people from Egnach, who belong to Arbon, or also Arbon, etc., whether they might not achieve, according to the decision, to proceed, since I see that the Bernese are now also taking it more seriously, etc. Your willing.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and friend Heinrich Bullinger, to his hands.</p>
