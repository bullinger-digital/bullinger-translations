      <p>I took great pleasure, most excellent Bullinger, when I heard from good Abel that you are well and alive; but when he gave me your letters, then I most certainly knew that this was the case and that you have not yet forgotten our friendship formed through a few months of conversations, which I always attribute to your singular humanity. If only I were given the opportunity at some point to be able to gratify either you or any of your friends in some way! I would indeed ensure that mutual trust and goodwill would never be lacking in me. As for the images, I will indeed make an effort to ensure that no offense arises from this matter, and not only in this matter but also in all other respects, I will defend, as much as I can, the reputation and esteem of all of you, for I know that it is most alien to all those things that could in any way diminish the glory and praise of God.</p>
      <p>This summer, I think my elder brother, Johannes Halesius, the one who was the author of my swift and sudden departure from you, will come to you in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>If he wishes to use your most prudent advice in any matter, make sure he knows that my recommendation has brought some weight to this matter; and what you do for him will be much more pleasing and acceptable to me than if you had bestowed it upon myself. Although this may seem great to you, my love for him makes it so that, when I have said everything, I seem to have said too little. Farewell, most illustrious man, and be assured that I am yours. Greet in my name all the most worthy ministers of that church and school, to whom I wish all happiness in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell. London, June 12.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Christopher Hales.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>[In] ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>"Christopher Hales, Englishman."</p>
