    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer confidentially shares that Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] unexpectedly proved to be completely timid and discouraged, thereby unsettling and distressing all the estates [of the Schmalkaldic League]. He advocated for a peace treaty with Emperor [Charles V] and therefore initiated a letter to an important figure [Margrave John of Brandenburg-Küstrin] at the imperial court, despite everyone earnestly pleading with him to refrain from doing so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Especially Elector [John Frederick of Saxony] tried to encourage the Landgrave, pointing to his own steadfastness. For although he faced the loss of his land and the enemy had already occupied large parts of it, he still saw his task in [Southern Germany] and entrusted everything else to God. However, it was in vain. Philipp remained despondent and said that everyone spoke so beautifully of God, but he [did not feel God's support]. The Landgrave also said that he did not want to march against his brother-in-law, Duke Maurice [of Saxony], even though he and all the estates had previously promised not to separate until the Elector had regained his land.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Meanwhile, this great cold set in, so that on Tuesday evening [November 23] the camp had to be dissolved. Thus, the [Schmalkaldic army] withdrew first. The imperial forces pursued and attacked. The [Schmalkaldic forces] immediately struck back and, thanks to the artillery deployed by the Landgrave, were able to push back the enemy. Many of the attackers were killed, while the [Schmalkaldic forces] suffered no casualties (only one rider lost his horse). Now they are moving to Heidenheim, which belongs to Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] How true it is that one cannot trust princes [Ps 146, 3]! Man is as unstable as water!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should keep this to himself. Even though it will soon be talked about, people should be kept in the dark.</p>

      <p>In the highest confidence, I inform you that God the Lord has allowed a terribly frightening weakness to befall the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], taking away his heart and courage, so that he acted completely despondently, which has been very burdensome and a great heartache for all the other estates [of the Schmalkaldic League]. For he has come to the point where he seriously considered making a treaty with the Emperor [Charles V] and therefore wrote to a distinguished nobleman [Margrave John of Brandenburg-Küstrin] at the Emperor's court, letting him know of some conditions, despite being earnestly and urgently requested by everyone else not to do so.</p>

      <p>Especially the pious, Christian Elector [John Frederick of Saxony] earnestly and diligently pleaded with him, reminding him of many and great reasons; and that it would be much more necessary for him to consider such ways, since his land and people were now in danger of being lost, and he did not know if he would lose everything, as the enemy had already invaded and taken much of it and was still advancing, so that he feared he would have to abandon his land entirely. Nevertheless, since he recognized a proper calling to help here above, and it was desired of him, he entrusted everything to God, with many such words and admonitions, which need not be recounted here. For they were wonderfully comforting and Christian, godly words in this matter, but the Landgrave, on the other hand, was completely frightened, despondent, and entirely discouraged. When God's and His assistance were mentioned, he said: "Nonsense, you speak well of God! The other must also be there!" He also said he would not march against his brother-in-law (Duke Maurice of Saxony), no matter what was done to him, despite the fact that all our estates and he with them had agreed and promised not to separate until the Elector was restored, etc.</p>

      <p>Thus, in the midst of this, the cold set in, so that on Tuesday night [November 23], the camp had to be dissolved due to the cold. However, our troops were the first to break camp. The imperial forces pursued them, hoping to inflict damage on them as they withdrew. But our forces quickly turned back and drove the enemy back with shooting (since the Landgrave had directed the artillery he had with him against them) and with stabbing, and killed many of the enemy. Our forces suffered no harm, except that one horse was shot. Our forces are now moving to Heidenheim, which belongs to Ulm.</p>

      <p>Oh God, how true it is: "Do not trust in princes!" [Ps 146, 3], etc. There is nothing in the human heart, which wavers like water!</p>

      <p>I beg you for God's sake, let it remain with you, for it is not good if it comes out and becomes public. Even if it will soon be whispered, one will not know (in such a license of lies) if it is true.</p>
