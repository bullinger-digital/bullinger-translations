    <p xml:id="regest1">Hilles received Bullinger's letter of April 1 [not received] from Ludwig [Lavater] after his return from Frankfurt. He apologizes for not having thanked Bullinger for his letter of February 6 [not received] with the advice contained therein for a businessman like him. Bullinger should continue to pray for him so that despite his many businesses, he finds time for study and devotion and remains aware that death not only means the end of human misery but also being with Christ, as [Paul] says [Phil 1, 23].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger will receive more detailed information about the situation in England through the letter bearer [...]. Under the current rule, a sincere acceptance of the Gospel is not to be expected. King [Henry VIII], the nobility, and the bishops are bent on war. They are all courting the favor of the Emperor. They see the frankness of the [German] Protestants as folly and do not seek their friendship out of confessional inclination, but to gain support from them in their war against [Francis I]. [The Bishop] of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] has once again published a disgraceful book against Bucer [Ad Martinum Bucerum epistola, Ingolstadt, Alexander Weißenhorn, 1546 (VD16 G403)], in which he fiercely attacks his teachings and also those of the Zurichers. The letter bearer can report more about this, as he read the book in Hilles' house.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Nothing else is to be expected from the [Council of] Trent than what Bullinger wrote. May the already wounded Antichrist be destroyed by the return of the Lord!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger should continue to admonish Hilles as often as possible to stay on the right path.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Hilles has not yet had to spend any money for Ludwig [Lavater], but he is still ready to carry out any orders from his father [Hans Rudolf] or from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [John] Hooper is currently in England, where he is trying to raise money. He wants to settle far away from Babylon, namely in Strasbourg or Zurich, forever.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Hilles' wife [Anna, née Lacey] sends her regards and conveys that she is sending a [gift] to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] through [Christoph] Froschauer. Hilles and his wife thank in advance for the cheese that Bullinger wrote about.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Rudolf] Gwalther. Hilles is saddened by the death of Erasmus [Schmid]. Froschauer has informed him about it.</p>

      <p>Praise be to God! Strasbourg, the last day of April 1546. Greetings and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding! I received your letter, teacher and beloved in the Lord, dated the first of this month, today from your Ludwig; for he kept it with him until my return from Frankfurt. That I have not yet responded to your letter dated February 6, I cannot fully excuse myself from the fault of ingratitude or laziness. For, as you kindly write to excuse me, those letters of yours were not such that perhaps a response was unnecessary; I confess that they were so filled with holy and pious admonitions, so necessary for me in my calling (if it can be called that, as the world now uses it, commerce) so perilous, that if nothing else in them seemed to require a response, I should at least long ago have given thanks to your piety or Christian charity, which deserves it, through letters. But oh, wretched me, who am so overwhelmed by secular affairs that I forget my duty towards my spiritual and holy father and physician! I therefore beseech you, my lord in God, to continue to pray to our Lord Jesus Christ for me (as I gather from all your latest letters you do), that the thorns of riches may not prick me so that they distract my mind from the pursuit of good or the meditation on heavenly things. Certainly, as you say, our life on earth is short, and we die daily. I always have this before my eyes, whether idle or busy, eating and drinking, indeed even when sleeping in a dream. May the best and greatest God grant (which I hope He will grant sooner through your prayers), that I do not remember these things, or desire death as if because it is said to put an end to the miseries and cares of this life, in which we are miserably afflicted in scraping together and preserving riches, rather than because I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, as the apostle says. Thus my flesh often seeks itself, and not only the glory and life of Christ. But I do not have the leisure now to write to you more fully about these things, as I wish to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You will learn more and more conveniently about the state of England from the bearer of this letter than I can conveniently write. In the meantime, however, I inform you that in our age, at least those who are now in positions of power and magistracy, holding the reins of government while living, it is not likely that the Gospel will be received purely and seriously there. For they are all intent on war, the king, the princes, and almost all the bishops of that region. They also desire to keep the favor of the Emperor with all their efforts, they almost consider the simplicity of the Protestants as inert foolishness, they seek their friendship (for I certainly believe they abhor their alliance because of the freer confession of truth they make), provided they are not forced to admit religion in the main points, not because they love them, but so that they may have them as participants in their wars and hatred, with which they are afflicted by the French. But God, who knows all things, knows whether I am mistaken in this, and I wish I were mistaken. Furthermore, the Bishop of Winchester has very recently published a new book, indeed quite biting and full of insults, against Bucer, in which he despises him in every way, insults his doctrine, and considers yours most impious of all. The bearer of this letter can tell you more about what kind of book it is; for he read it in my house.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nothing else is to be expected from those impure birds now gathered in Trent than what you immediately prayed for there. May God grant and give, that the Antichrist, who is already wounded by the sword of the spirit of the mouth of God, may soon be completely destroyed by the coming of our Lord. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In the meantime, I beg you, do not cease, as you are accustomed, to admonish me more frequently, when you have time for your necessary studies, and (as you know me to deserve) to rebuke and reprove me, so that I may remain sound in faith by the grace of God until the end and have firm confidence in that glorious and dreadful coming.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have not yet spent anything for Ludwig, but I am always ready to obey your and his father's orders in this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Master Hooper, who is very devoted to you, is now in England; if God wills, he will soon return to us and then to you. Let us pray to our God to bring him back safely; for he desires, and now in his absence from us he is trying to procure some money, if possible, so that he may always live here or with you in holiness and with a good conscience, far from the impurity of Babylon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>My wife sends you and your wife all happiness and says that she has sent something frivolous through Master Froschauer for your most chaste wife. We both also thank you so much for that cheese you wrote about, as if you had certainly sent it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Greet, I pray, Master Bibliander, Master Pellikan, Master Gwalther, and all the rest of yours in the Lord, who are most dear to me, and I grieve, if God had not so willed, that I can no longer use commendations or recommendations to Master Erasmus; for Master Froschauer told me he has passed away. Farewell in Christ, our only hope, and live always most happily in Him. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours, R. Hilles.</p>
