    <p xml:id="regest1">There are no good news from the [Imperial Diet at] Speyer, they are trying to enslave the cities, which are allowing this to happen. From the Imperial Diet, the arrival of the Confederates' letter is reported, which was partly received positively, partly laughed at. Religious questions are being omitted. Currently, peace and justice are being negotiated.</p>

      <p>From Speyer, we hear nothing good. They intend to bring the cities into servitude, to which they are then quite faithfully helping themselves.</p>
      <p>Two good men, who are also envoys from the cities, one from Memmingen, the other from Augsburg, write, one: "The Confederates have sent a good letter to the estates, not made by children, as it was not entirely formally composed by the writer, which the wise find no fault with, but some others have laughed"; he worries, however, that laughter should be followed by weeping. The other writes thus: "The Swiss have indeed sent a letter to the estates, in which I find much more understanding than has been dealt with here. We have declared ourselves against France without being heard, which is against all fairness and right, which also makes me think that all support we might have in the empire will be withheld from us. Religion is not considered, and just as one deals with God, so is he with us here in the Imperial Council. Peace and justice are now in negotiation; one cannot sharpen enough to give in such a way that one might break a hole in it again when the opportunity arises."</p>
      <p>HÄ™c ille with many words.</p>
