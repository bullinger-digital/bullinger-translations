    <p xml:id="regest1">Upon receiving the letter delivered by the [Biel] schoolmaster [Johann Leopold Frey], the appointed officials for education were convened. They deliberated, taking into account the results of the last examination and the opinion of Johannes Fries regarding the two [Biel scholarship holders Abraham and Beat Steinegger]. Their judgment has not changed since the last report: there is no reason to believe that the two scholarship holders, especially Abraham, will develop into outstanding scholars. For Beat, there is hope that he will one day be capable of leading a congregation, provided he makes an effort and his behavior does not deteriorate. [Frey], who was present at all the deliberations, will report in more detail. The Zurich pastors ask the people of Biel to continue their efforts to promote the word of God and Christian teaching.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings along with the offer of willing services and all good things to the pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, gracious, dear gentlemen. I have understood the contents of your letter, delivered to me by your schoolmaster, and have convened the appointed officials for education to discuss it diligently according to your request. They have recalled the examination held just after the recent Easter and the aptitude of your two boys. They have earnestly inquired of Master Johannes Fries, and after all the investigation, questioning, recalling, and considering, we cannot find otherwise than what we have partly written to you before. Namely, that we do not think or hope that particularly learned people, learned in languages, practiced in arts, and well-informed, will emerge from them, especially from Abraham. Regarding Beat, we have some hope; he already has a good beginning and may, with time, provided he does not worsen (deteriorate), as he strives for improvement and diligently applies himself, study and comprehend enough to lead a congregation, as your schoolmaster, our particularly dear brother, who we have also kept here to remind and advise on everything and to hear everything, will be able to report to you in more detail.</p>
      <p>We earnestly ask and admonish you to continue your diligence in the divine word and all good things, as well as in the planting of Christian teaching, as you have been well reputed for so far. Whatever we, who serve the church, can do here to please and serve you, we would not spare and have hereby offered our willing services. May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 13, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your always very willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise gentlemen mayors and council of the city of Biel, his particularly favorable and gracious lords.</p>
