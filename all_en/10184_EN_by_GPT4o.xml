    <p xml:id="regest1">Opinion on the question of whether the mandate issued by Zurich violates the provisions of the Landfrieden. The Reformers have the right to take measures to strengthen their faith within their domain, just as the Catholic places do. The mandate should not be seen as an insult to the Old Believers. Reference to the conditions in the Common Lordships. Decisive rejection of the proposal by the Five Places to submit the mandate issue to arbitration.</p>

      <p>The article of the peace treaty concerning faith cannot do otherwise than to let our dear confederates from the five places remain in their old, true, undoubted Christian faith, etc. They have it, which is dear to us. Yes, they have it in twelve articles, as we have all been taught from youth and we also have and hold it; therefore, we are not inclined to drive anyone out of it. And since we have always offered to have our faith tested with the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, we are not inclined in this established peace to give any faith good or bad (since faith must be given good or bad not from these places, but with other reasons and from other places), but for the sake of peace and tranquility; since it has happened that disputes and discord have arisen between us concerning faith, we would gladly leave it, let them, our dear confederates, remain in their faith undisputed and unargued, and especially in their old, true, undoubted Christian faith, with the clear reservation that we should likewise remain unchallenged in our faith. But if they, our dear confederates of the five places, with the form and intention of the above-mentioned article, have the opinion that they can make their faith good for themselves, as they have it with all circumstances before them, etc., and have undertaken to hinder or seize us, we would give all honor to consider and think about with what intention, cunning, and suspicion this is done by them; which we, however, cannot at all suspect against them, as we have promised to make and keep a pious, upright, steadfast peace.</p>
      <p>Moreover, anyone, even of simple understanding, can well perceive and notice, if the approach of our dear confederates from the five places, which they intend to have against and over our mandates, in our own territories and only to ours, should be considered significant and legitimate, as they are thereby insulted or disgraced, etc., how poorly we would be at peace, yes, how we would not be able to hold on to our reservation of our faith. For if we were to act in our lands, courts, and territories against and with ours according to the requirement of our faith, whether it be with mandates, missives, with commands, with prohibitions, with warnings, punishments against our bailiffs, under-bailiffs, preachers, or others who are obliged to us, and if such our administration were to be taken up by our confederates of the five places because of the dispute over faith between them and us, as they (as mentioned) would be insulted and thus want to accuse and burden us as peace-breakers, as is now happening to us because of our recently issued mandate, it would indeed come to that (if we were to keep peace according to their desire and opinion), that we would have to completely and entirely cease or abstain from the confession of our faith and all administration of the same against ours, and would not be able to hold on to the reservation, which the peace treaty determines and grants to us no less than to them, nor could we be protected by the said peace treaty in this matter.</p>
      <p>For we confess, hold, and let preach nothing else concerning our faith than that the sacrificial mass, as it is used daily, is a true misuse of the institution of the Lord's Supper and an abomination before God, which is to the detriment and diminution of the death of Christ. Also, that the use of the sacraments, as the Pope practices it, is not founded on scripture nor in accordance with the teaching of Christ. Also, that we are not saved by the merit of our works, but are justified before God by faith alone, etc., with such and similar points and articles more, in which our faith cannot and will not be reconciled with their faith. And we, however, do all that we have in these matters, act and confess, not to the detriment of anyone's intention, much less to disgrace, insult, or contempt, but out of good, informed, Christian conscience, that is, out of administration and fundamental intention of our faith, as is daily handled and used by us through our mandates and ordinances against those over whom we have power and authority, without omission.</p>
      <p>And so it is now, that our dear confederates of the five places intend concerning faith and our understanding and confession of the same, which stands and strives directly against and contrary to each other, it is evident what has caused us to both parties in the negotiation of peace, each party to retain its faith, and that we come to peace and tranquility through such means, also concerning the alliances and other rights, as we have them in our own courts, territories, dominions, people, and lands, so that we may remain and persist in unity all the more, regardless of what each party uses or handles or not concerning its faith in its own properties.</p>
      <p>We will remain silent, that the content of the article concerning our common dominions clearly indicates that in them alone, and not in their own dominions and courts, each party's faith should be allowed to be free and unchallenged and that there no party should violate, insult, or touch the other's intention, and if that happens by someone, that they may be punished and fined by a bailiff for it; from all of which it is evident that we cannot and should not be challenged by the places and dominions, which are outside our common dominions and are included in the said peace treaty, concerning the administration of faith, in the manner as allowed in common dominions. Or else the articles, which are stipulated for both parties, would be vain and futile concerning faith, and all discord would have its origin and continue as well as before, which, however, the clear and explicit understanding of the peace treaty in all its articles cannot bear or tolerate; with the desire that our confederates of the five places will take this to heart and consider it well, etc.</p>
      <p>It does not unjustly surprise us, since our sworn alliances have clearly reserved the peace treaty for us and granted us complete power against ours with dominions, freedoms, rights, and other praiseworthy heritage of our administration, that our dear confederates of the five places, regardless of the same, first (as if we were ruled) want to restrict and assume in what manner we should act and proceed with and against ours in our own lands, courts, and territories, which we would reluctantly impose on them out of consideration of the above-mentioned articles of peace.</p>
      <p>But if in our recently issued mandate or other our commands or prohibitions against ours it should be found that we have named, depicted, or let it be known to them, to urge them in their lands and dominions from their faith and not to tolerate that they undertake or act against our faith with theirs, etc., or that we have sent such mandate, command, or prohibition to our common dominions and instructed them to hold or adopt it according to the made peace (which is not found), then our dear confederates would indeed have reason to complain, just as we have reason to complain about the mandates of the Rhine Valley, in which the evangelical preachers are encouraged to act outside and against the power of the said established peace treaty because of their teaching, which we have rightly not tolerated and accepted for their offer and by virtue of the peace.</p>
      <p>It is known to no one that our dear confederates of the five places stubbornly persist in not allowing anyone to speak or act against any ceremony or practice of their faith, whether it be eating meat, tonsures, the mass, or other church customs, without punishment, but punishing them in body, goods, or otherwise, as much as that is also against and contrary to our faith, about which we would have reason to complain in the same way, no less than they. Yes, if this were not allowed to them with explicit reservation of peace and as well as us against theirs according to their good pleasure. And we should release the complaints of our dear confederates and as those who have broken the peace, stand to justice or else change or abolish our rightful, legitimate mandates, when we alone for the promotion of that which we are inclined against God and informed from His word, for and for thorough information and testing of the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments against them and mankind, are eager and willing to confirm ours with truth and still are, etc., acting against ours with unoffending mandates, writings, commands, and prohibitions, without any intention to insult or despise anyone? And what is right and fair to them in their own dominions against our faith, that should be improper to us in our dominions and for that reason, that it is not similar to their faith, denied and forbidden and we obliged and bound to stand to justice with them?</p>
      <p>Whether that is fair, lawful, or founded and whether it is in the same view, if one wants to keep peace and tranquility and let everyone remain by their rights and that which is fitting and proper to them, yes, the clear peace treaty grants, etc., we want to leave to the judgment of all understanding honor and those who are truly read and knowledgeable of the peace treaty, in trust.</p>
      <p>Therefore, and since we have nothing else before us than that we want to let our dear confederates of the five places, as mentioned before, remain in their faith unhindered and unchallenged, also (since they want it so) undisputed and unargued, it would indeed require all fairness that they let us remain unchallenged by the peace treaty in our faith and in the administration of the same against ours according to our will and pleasure, as we allow and grant them in their own dominions and territories, in the same way and measure.</p>
      <p>For we are determined to remain steadfast and unshaken by the fact that our Christian faith may stand, promote, and protect against and with ours, and that we do not want to change or diminish our open confession of faith, which we have opened and confessed in many public conversations, not to insult or disgrace anyone, but for the sake of maintaining the honor of God, unless someone shows us another report from God's word, according to our offer. But we are of good and confident hope that our dear confederates will be satisfied with such our so rightfully presented and with the clear, well-founded reservation of our faith and will calm themselves and us concerning their supposed complaint, which they want to draw from our mandates, as if we had thought of them or let them go out for any reason, and will do what can lead to peace and unity according to their initial offer. For if this does not happen according to our so manifold offer, and we should be vexed and burdened with such and similar interventions and approaches in this way, and be pressed with such grasping and suspicious circumstances from the clear and bright power of our common peace treaty, we would indeed be caused to seek means and ways by which we and ours may be protected and maintained by that which they have confirmed, granted, and conceded to us with letters and seals, and which we have clearly reserved at the beginning of the peace.</p>
      <p>Thus far concerning the essence of the controversy and with what arguments the intention of the adversaries can be refuted and confuted. What follows is advice on the quality of the case; for this must also be well considered.</p>
      <p>Since our confederates of the five places want to consider their supposed advantage, to break the law with us according to the alliances and to finally settle such an important, great matter (for which one is advised to convene councils) on the judgment and decision of one man, perhaps in the hope that it will fall to them and we would thus have to give a significant blow to our founded faith with noticeable offense and injury to our honor and step away from what we have grasped in our conscience and learned from the truth, etc., which reason is, in my opinion, the main cause of all the approach (for that fox in a mitre, in the name of the Pope, rolls that stone). It is to be considered that one is not obliged to grant them justice on all requests according to the letter and word of the alliances. For if such a practice, especially in these times and circumstances, were to be allowed and every claim, however frivolous and unfounded it may be, were to be immediately set on the decision or judgment of one man after the rejection of amicability, it is easy for all understanding to consider to what abuse, cunning, and intention the simple, pious, and faithful view of the alliances could be used, and that it would be easier to be without alliances in this way than to be in alliances. Especially if one were to insist on the letter of the peace without a lawful and proper understanding and not want to take, grasp, and allow the sense from the preceding and following articles and chapters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, above all, to address the places of arbitration and their embassies for this matter and to turn to them with all seriousness and bring it to them: if it should happen that the five places do not want to stand still or be at peace with such their requests, that one should kindly and amicably dissuade them from it and remind them, so that they will live according to the clear and bright peace and let go of such unfounded approach. For if they do not trust to obtain that from them and we, however, are of no other will than to persist firmly, etc., one would be caused by necessity to initially demand a clear explanation of the articles, etc. But if they should ever conquer that with the hanging of the places of arbitration, as I do not think, that one can give them leniency for the above-mentioned reasons, then the first legal principle must be this: whether the peace treaty compels to accept such a claim of the five places, and whether one is obliged to grant them an answer and justice for such a demand, as they are insulted, or not. After which this legal principle would take place: whether the recently issued mandate from Zurich and similar mandates are against the peace treaty or not, etc. In this way, the matter could be extended and delayed for a long time, and in the meantime, one would learn about all sorts of developments. Although I do not doubt that one is not obliged to let them go because of this approach, and if one were to sit together with heart and will, to promote the honor and word of God, etc., their intention would not succeed at all. May God give them better guidance. Amen. Therefore, we must be vigilant and watchful, lest we admit anything that might in any way harm professed piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider our suggestion favorably. For it is, unless I am mistaken, a common cause for us, as reason seems to demand, and common counsel should be, although we pray to God without ceasing, that He may change their minds for the better with His grace and so affect their vengeful spirits that, having set aside their passions, they may at least not fail their ancestral freedom and the honor of their homeland, if they do not want to assist piety in the end. Perhaps the Lord will grant them this in time. May it happen that, by His grace, the last become first and the first last, provided that none are completely left out!</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
