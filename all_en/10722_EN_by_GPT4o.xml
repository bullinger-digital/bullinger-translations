Reports on the march of the Bernese free shooters, who, under the leadership of Jakob Wildermut from Neuchâtel and Erhard Burger from Nidau, wanted to assist the beleaguered Genevans, but [near Gingins], close to Nyon, fell into a Savoyard ambush and - after they had victoriously withstood the battle - were sent back home by the Bernese envoys Ludwig von Diesbach and Hans Rudolf Nägeli as well as by the Savoyard bailiff in the Vaud [Aymon de Genève-Lullin]. The Genevans undertook a sortie to retrieve stolen cattle, killing about a dozen [Savoyards] in the process.</p>

      <p>My friendly, good-willed service before, especially gracious lord.</p>
      <p>I have received your letter along with the books belonging to Berchtold. They shall also be returned with good security.</p>
      <p>Regarding the events in Savoy, it is known that Jakob Wildermut from Neuchâtel and Erhard Burger from Nidau, two captains, have gathered and assembled 415 men to support the Genevans. Those who were present and involved say that they found neither more nor less than this number. These men gathered from within themselves, mostly from the territory of my lords of Bern, including from the city, the four land courts, Büren, Erlach, and elsewhere, as well as some from Biel and Neuchâtel. The reason for this was some messengers from Geneva, who were in Neuchâtel, who brought about such a plan with the aforementioned leaders. Thus, these 415 men, along with others, moved through the mountains, not on a proper path, some carrying nothing but their swords, and no more than four in armor. They also led four who were supposed to be Genevans. However, their betrayers, one of whom was cut down before the attack, and the other three escaped to the enemy's ranks. As they approached Geneva, having not eaten for three days, on a Sunday morning, and the Genevans having forgiven them on Saturday night, thinking they would now come to them and accompany them, they descended from the mountains onto the road through a passage. The enemy was well-prepared and armed with 3000 men in two groups, with their shooters behind a strong green hedge, and they had good stones in their hands, shot and threw at them, and did not intend for any to escape. Erhard Burger, who led the shooters, about 100 of them, shot, threw, and felled them, leading his soldiers under the hedge and coming close to them, aiming their shots well, as few among them could shoot more than once. The others broke through the hedge and came together, yet these people were found in such a fortification and defense, especially the noble ones, who were ready to fight on foot and horseback, that the deed was attributed to none but God alone, who indeed did it. Thus, they pressed into them and overpowered them, killing 440 men on the battlefield; it is said that altogether, including those who later died and were found, about 600 men perished. As God gave them this fortune, they did not pursue them for long, but gathered again intending to complete their journey to Geneva, and took nothing from the enemy, but prepared themselves again, and almost all their guns, shafts, and defenses were broken. As they moved towards Geneva, our gracious lords' envoys, Junker Ludwig von Diesbach and Junker Hans Rudolf Nägeli, along with the bailiff in the Vaud, unexpectedly came to them, persuading them to return home, providing them with good food and drink, and safely escorting them through the land. The reason that my lords were prompted to do this is that a group of Savoyards was still between them and Geneva, and the storm in the land had caused the local people to gather everywhere across the lake, fearing they would not be strong enough against them, as they were now entirely exhausted and weary. Thus, a truce was established, and it went no other way, with 7 men, 2 boys, and a woman lost on our side; among them were 2 men from Büren and the woman, who, before she died, had laid down three men.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Genevans have once again fallen out, having taken cattle, and in return, killed about a dozen of them, with one of theirs perishing; however, they did not want to stay, but took flight in time. Nothing further now, but may God always be with us all.</p>
      <p>Given on Sunday before Catherine.</p>
      <p>Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of Lenzburg, your always good-willed.</p>
