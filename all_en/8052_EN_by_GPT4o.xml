      <p>Greetings. I received your letter full of sadness, most esteemed lord, and indeed our papists have already triumphed greatly and gloriously over it; for like wolves they rush among our sheep, reproaching: "Where is your God, where is your Admiral?"</p>
      <p>There will finally be those who will restrain you Lutherans." They speak of victory no differently, as if not a single one of their own had fallen. But, as you write, time is the most certain daughter of truth, and our people do not think of themselves as the playthings of kings, according to the saying: When France is pressed by war, Iberia rejoices, the Italians smile, the German plunders, and the bold Swiss falls, the playful toy of kings.</p>
      <p>[D.] Ruinella is not at home, but often at this time in his homeland Tumiliasca. I will write more and wondrous things soon; for there are certain things that have happened in Venice. It is very true what I recently wrote about the inquisitor killed in the crowd.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their regards to you, the honorable consuls, Mr. Karl, Mr. Bonett, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Pontisella, etc. October 18, 1569, Chur.</p>
      <p>I bid Mr. Haller many greetings.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
