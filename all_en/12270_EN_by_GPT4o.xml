    <p xml:id="regest1">A Lasco has been waiting for a long time for the letters from Bullinger and his colleagues, which Gerhard [thom Camph] left in Deventer for further forwarding to Emden, because he traveled from there to Brabant. Since [Samuel] Pellikan can no longer stay in Emden because he must arrive in Frankfurt [before the end] of the [book] fair, a Lasco is now writing a letter anyway. - Samuel Pellikan will report on the divisions in the church [of East Frisia]. With patience and prayer, they are trying to persuade the [opponents], which is gradually succeeding. However, due to the negligence of the magistrate, some are turning to the sects. Additionally, the [imperial] Burgundian court almost achieved a Lasco's expulsion when he returned from [Worms and Cologne] to [East Frisia]. The court acts badly against the godly, who therefore move from Brabant to [East Frisia] to a Lasco. Also, [old-believing] priests from Groningen and West Friesland are turning away from superstition and fleeing to a Lasco, from where they admonish their congregations by letter to turn their backs on idolatry and godlessness. For all these reasons, the court applied for a Lasco's expulsion. However, thanks to the steadfastness shown by [Anna, Countess of East Frisia], everything has calmed down again. - A Lasco could only skim through the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”]. He regrets that there are some too harsh statements about Luther. Certainly, he did not treat the [Confederates] with Christian love, but he should have been forgiven because he did so much for the Church of Christ, so that one does not make oneself guilty like him, even if to a lesser extent, and does not fall into disrepute with the [old believers]. For example, one could have said that Luther errs or attacks unjustly, without being carried away by invectives. - Bullinger should allow this openness, as a Lasco is inclined to no other church more than that of [Zurich]. Certainly, the people of Zurich proved to be more moderate than Luther, but they were not moderate enough. This is also the opinion of others who otherwise share the view of the [Confederates]. A Lasco also knows princes who are well-disposed towards the [Confederates] and intend to invite them to a conversation [about the Lord's Supper]. If an invitation were to come, the [Confederates] should not decline. - Greetings. - Bullinger will learn more from Bibliander's [letter].</p>

      <p>For a long time, I have been eagerly awaiting letters from both you and your fellow ministers, most learned man, which our Gerard, who was with you there, left in Deventer with his belongings, thinking that (since he himself had set out for Brabant) they would arrive here before he himself did. Since I have not yet received them, I cannot yet respond to yours, and yet I did not want to send the son of our Mr. Pellikan to you without my letters, as he could no longer delay his journey due to the Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>He has seen the still disordered state of our churches and heard the intemperance of some who are still trying to disturb the consensus of our doctrine.</p>
      <p>I think they are mixed among us to exercise us and make us more diligent in defending the true doctrine. We overcome them as much as we can with gentleness and patience and pray for them to have a better mind.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, many are daily joining the consensus of our doctrine, but again, due to the negligence of the magistrate, not a few are defecting from us to the sects. I was again almost driven out from here by the instigation of the Burgundian court when I returned from Upper Germany. But now everything has settled down again.</p>
      <p>The theologians of Brabant are very upset because many are daily coming to us from there, and they use my name as a pretext for their plan. They are doing everything they can to drive me out from here. They fear that the Groningen region and West Friesland will be drawn into our heresy by my presence here. For the best pastors of both these regions, having left their idolatry, flee to me and are appointed by my work here in our churches, bringing not a few others with them and also revealing in constant letters to the churches they left the magnitude of idolatry and impiety, which they ought to abandon.</p>
      <p>Thus, I am guilty of everything, and they think that with my expulsion, all these things will cease. But our princess is of a strong and constant mind in this matter, even though she is a woman. Therefore, she has already quelled this latest storm stirred up against me. Meanwhile, however, brothers who are refugees are daily flocking in, whom we receive and support as much as we can.</p>
      <p>I have skimmed through your confession rather than read it, intending to read it more diligently once the booklet is bound. But in that cursory reading, I found some things said a bit too harshly against Luther, which I truly wish had not been.</p>
      <p>For so often he is attributed with an unbridled passion for speaking, impudence, arrogance, vanity, that not only in this sacramental controversy but in almost his entire doctrine, the man's credibility is called into question. I do not deny that Luther indulged himself too much in hurling insults at you by name and leaped far beyond the bounds of Christian charity. But this should have been forgiven him because of his otherwise outstanding merits for the Church of Christ, and care should have been taken not to stumble over the same stone - which we criticize in Luther - ourselves. For even if we seem to stumble lightly, we are not without fault if we stumble even lightly. It would have been better to point out the errors (which you seem to have done beautifully to me), but without insult, by which we achieve nothing else in truth than to defame both the doctrine itself and the ministry of the gospel in our churches among adversaries. It would have been enough to say: In my opinion, Luther is mistaken here; here he attacks us beyond our merit; and many such things that can defend our innocence if they are approved. Meanwhile, however, they do not undermine anyone else's name and reputation.</p>
      <p>But you will forgive me, most Christian man, for writing to you in this way according to my freedom. I am so affected towards your church as towards almost no other, and therefore I would wish that nothing could be held against you that anyone could rightfully desire. You have surpassed Luther in modesty, I admit, but yet you seem to me to have somewhat exceeded his bounds. And this is not only my judgment but also that of many others who meanwhile follow your doctrine and otherwise wish you well. I know some of the leading men who wish you and your cause well, and they seem to be taking care that your people are also invited to the planned colloquium of the learned, as you know, I think.</p>
      <p>If that happens, I would wish that you would not refuse either to come or to send someone. I know what it is to establish human councils about divine matters; but after they are established, it is better for as many pious people as possible to be present, lest tyranny be exchanged for tyranny - which I greatly fear.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most upright man, and greet our common brothers with my words. Hastily, in Emden, August 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>You will learn more from Bibliander. Farewell again. Yours sincerely, Johannes a Lasco, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and faithful doctor of the Church of Christ in Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
