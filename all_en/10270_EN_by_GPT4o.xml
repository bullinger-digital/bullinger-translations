    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller would write to Bullinger more frequently if as many people from Zurich visited him as Megander. He cannot yet report anything about the negotiations of the Bern Council. He thanks Bullinger for the loaned commentary notes on the Gospels and praises their comprehensibility even for the less learned, like himself. In Bern, people were shocked by the Zurichers' reluctance to address the plight of the Reformed in Bremgarten and their willingness to pay war reparations to the Five Places. Megander plans to publish a commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians; he reports many good things about the Zurichers but hardly speaks about Bullinger. People are looking forward to Bullinger's and Vadian's commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would write to you much more often, dearest Heinrich, if I had as many messengers as Megander has without my knowledge. People from Zurich flock to his house daily, and I only find out after they have already left. Therefore, if my letters are less frequent than I would like, please do not think ill of it.</p>
      <p>The matters discussed in the council are being concluded today by the senate and citizens. Hence, I have nothing certain to report about them that I could write.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I received your book, truly a treasure and a chest of heavenly wisdom, with such joy that if you had sent me as much gold or silver, given the choice, I would have preferred this alone, no matter how much all desires might torment me. I have already completed reading word for word with my own hand everything you noted on John, certainly no less certain and explaining the genuine sense most learnedly than clearly. I see, whenever I read your works, how poorly I have spent not only my youth but also my old age. Although, after the reformation of religion was undertaken among us, so many external affairs have overwhelmed me that I have scarcely been able to satisfy the sermons, I attribute this plainly to the Lord, that from the time you began to write to me and apply your efforts and advice in all things, I feel I have made much more progress in many things than in several years before. There is a selection of studies, authors, and indeed teachers. I knew Zwingli was a most learned man. He wrote to me often. He also wrote his commentaries, which certainly surpass my intellect so much that I could grasp very few, especially from those he noted on Isaiah and Jeremiah. This is due to my ignorance of languages. However, I embrace you, the disciple of such a great teacher, in such a way that I understand everything. Therefore, may you never regret your labor or your faithfulness, with which you share with me the dearest things. Since one should hope for a reward from the Lord, who would offer a cup of water in the name of a disciple to an orphan, how much reward will you gather, who pour out all your gifts, all your labors, sleepless nights, and vigils on me alone. Today I begin to see the notes on Matthew, and then others, yet in such a way that I do not exceed the deadline you set. If there is no certain messenger, I will send it to you through my own.</p>
      <p>It displeased and terrified many, indeed disheartened them, that your people only wanted to support the people of Bremgarten amicably and offered to pay reparations to the Five Places. I will write little about this. I will discuss more when I may enjoy your presence.</p>
      <p>Megander, as I hear from others, is preparing annotations on the Ephesians. He reported many good things about you, but he is so sparing in speaking about Bullinger that I always desire more. All our brothers rejoice about what you are preparing with Vadian on the Acts. For a long time, many have desired it, because apart from Justus Jonas, no one has noted anything on it. Therefore, write when it may be expected from the press, or if any have been printed, send them.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children, my dearest soul.</p>
      <p>July 13, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind lord and brother.</p>
