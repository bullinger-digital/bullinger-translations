      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The controversy over excommunication in Heidelberg is escalating. Mr. Erastus sent us a response here to his theses against the arguments of his opponents. I have encouraged him not to publish or release anything because of our common adversaries. He seems inclined to do so unless compelled by the opposing side. If they prevail, we will have a new Spanish Inquisition. It is astonishing, astonishing, how Satan plots against the purity of doctrine and the moderate governance of the church. We must pray to the Lord to place him under our feet. It is affirmed that Condé has been slain, his forces scattered, and the cause of the Huguenots utterly proclaimed as lost. This matter troubles me greatly, knowing how brutally the faithful and exiles are treated throughout all of France. I know, however, that our affairs are not placed upon Condé, but upon the rock against which even the gates of hell shall not prevail.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you and yours.</p>
