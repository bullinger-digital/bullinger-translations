      <p>Grace, peace, and innocence of life from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ be with you. I give you immortal thanks, most dear Bullinger, for in all the letters you have written to the brothers in Chur, you have kept me in your memory. I should have written to you more often; the only hindrance is, I say, the dullness of my mind and the weakness of my right hand, which is so broken by a gouty flux that I can hardly write anymore, as the example of this letter shows. Yet, I am not moved by this condition of nature nor by the various accidents of old age, but I take it well, since it pleases the Lord to burden my age of a little more than 71 years with such inconveniences, to whom be glory forever. We can rejoice little about religion in our Rhaetia; the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few and mostly sluggish and inactive. The ministers in Chur, Comander and Philipp, labor faithfully to the best of their ability; they have very few helpers in their efforts. If the Lord does not send more laborers into His vineyard, it will truly become barren. I sense this in many churches with the death of their ministers, who established them in orthodoxy; however, their successors allow what was built to be demolished rather than diligently cultivate the good seeds. I urge you, most humane Bullinger, to encourage our brothers and fellow ministers with your Christian admonitions, so that they may faithfully preside over their ministry, mindful of their duty and the talent entrusted to them, by word and example of life. I know how great your esteem and majesty is among all our people. Furthermore, if there is anything new among you worth knowing in matters of religion or civil affairs, I beg and beseech you to make me a participant; this curious old age is very eager for such things. Farewell. Greet all the brothers and fellow ministers in Zurich along with your entire family in my name. From Zuoz, November 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours with all my heart, Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant shepherd of Christ's flock, Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, minister among the people of Zurich, and my most beloved lord and brother.</p>
