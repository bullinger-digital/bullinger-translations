      <p>Greetings. Just as my respect for you, most excellent father Bullinger, is constant, firm, and perpetual, so I have never doubted your benevolence towards me since the time you first embraced me and received me into your friendship. Nevertheless, it was pleasing to hear from you in your letters, namely that you never forget me, and it was most gratifying that you write that I am commended to God by you. I urge you, father Bullinger, to continue doing this, and not only for me but especially for this entire church and school, and such a great people, that both you and your entire holy church commend to the Lord with the most frequent and fervent prayers. Our calamity, because it is spiritual, is all the more pestilent. You know what I mean. Here, papism, anabaptism, Schwenckfeldianism, and what evils not, have a place. What remains of Christianity and pure doctrine is not lacking those who, to the best of their ability, would explode and proscribe it. Certainly, God must be entreated to have mercy on this church and school, with errors driven away and the pure doctrine of the gospel restored through Jesus Christ. I write this not without the greatest pain of my soul, nor is there anyone truly pious who can see and hear these things without tears. This good remains, that both in the magistracy and among the rest of the people, there are still very many who sincerely favor pure doctrine and resist Satan and his angels.</p>
      <p>There also remain some remnants of the holy seed among the ministers, who defend the cause of Christ to the best of their abilities. Therefore, all these must be commended to God. I have received no news from Mr. Peter Martyr, indeed I have had letters; but it may be that either the letters have not been delivered, or he has not had the leisure to write due to more serious occupations.</p>
      <p>My son is most commendable to me; but he rarely visits me and never asks anything of me, although I desire nothing more than to benefit him, so that I may also gratify you; you have my spirit most eager to gratify you and to deserve well of your son. It remains that you command me with authority and that he, in his duty, signifies in what matter I can benefit him. Farewell and continue to love as you have begun. Greet, father, your wife, the most honorable matron, with all your family and daughters and sons-in-law, then all the pious and learned men there.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Of your holiness, Hieronymus Zanchus.</p>
      <p>You will hear about Beatus from Mr. Peter.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most revered father. Zürich.</p>
