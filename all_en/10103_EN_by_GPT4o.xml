      <p>To Lord Leo Jud, Pastor of the Church of St. Peter, H. Bullinger. Greetings.</p>
      <p>The entire focus of this letter, most learned Leo, is that no ecclesiastical matters should be entrusted to the magistrate, regardless of their nature. You add the reason: "For the magistrate and the church are entirely different entities. One governs over things and bodies, the other over souls." Indeed, we are dealing with a slippery matter if anyone prefers to contend with force rather than approach the simplest matter with an uncurious mind, since nothing can be said so well to the contentious that it does not provide some opportunity for criticism, and since individual words can be used in different ways. This has always been the most fertile seedbed of the greatest contentions, even among the highest men. For I do not see how this proposition ("the magistrate and the church are entirely different entities") can be universally true. If you bring up the magistracy of Pilate, Caiaphas, Herod, and the Jewish synagogue, you have already brought up tyrants, not magistrates. An impious magistrate is a lame and mutilated magistrate. 1. But if you do not estimate the magistrate so much by function as by those who hold the magistracy, then if two or three agree on earth, even if they hold the magistracy, they certainly constitute the church, if we believe Christ. Again, if to hold the magistracy is to be a minister of God, if a Christian can be a minister of God, which we have maintained against the Anabaptists, 2. then even if pagans can in some way be ministers of God like Nebuchadnezzar and Sennacherib, no one knows better how to serve God than a Christian. 3. The church is also a collection of Christians. Now I do not see what your words mean: "The magistrate and the church are entirely different entities. No ecclesiastical matters should be entrusted to the magistrate, regardless of their nature." 4. But if you also consider the function of the magistrate and refer it to the separation of church and magistrate, Paul says: "Rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad." Also: "He is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer" [Romans 13:3-4]. And nowhere will you find a more exact distinction between good and evil than in the church, which is governed by the word of truth. And unbelievers and pagans are a terror to those who do good, but Christians are a terror to those who do evil. 5. And the Holy Spirit on choosing a magistrate says: "Select from all the people able men, who fear God, men of truth, who hate dishonest gain, and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens" [Exodus 18:21-22]. This is the rule for those who hold and truly hold the magistracy. But who would not entrust the holy matters of the church to prudent, strong, and God-fearing men? Therefore, again, I do not see how your proposition holds: "No ecclesiastical matters should be entrusted to the magistrate, regardless of their nature," and likewise: "The magistrate and the church are entirely different entities." 6. Furthermore, I do not know if any magistrate is appointed over souls in the church. I do not deny that the power to bind and loose was given to the apostles and their successors. But we learned from Zwingli, our teacher, that the power of the keys is the preaching of the gospel, which threatens death to some and promises life to others.</p>
      <p>As for excommunication, which perhaps could be seen as a spiritual authority imposed over souls, it is certain that sin is forgiven to a person when they return to the Lord through faith. Witnesses stand as the prodigal son, the publican, Peter, and the thief, etc. Hence it follows that excommunication is not of the soul and internal, but an external penalty inflicted for scandal. This is also most significantly expressed by Paul when he said of the fornicator: "Hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh" [1 Corinthians 5:5]. But what is handing over to Satan other than casting into adversity and afflicting? For thus Job was handed over to Satan. And what else is the destruction of the flesh than an external penalty or suppression, chastisement, or mortification of the flesh? Whether it is done through contempt, neglect, or some other way, as long as it is done and public decency is defended. To this is added that in 2 Corinthians 2 [6] he wrote the same: "Sufficient for such a one is this punishment," that is, penalty and correction. You should consult G. Budé on the force of the words τιμάν and τιμάσθαι, and a very clear light will appear. What then prevents, since excommunication is an external penalty, it from being entrusted to a pious magistrate, not only in the name of the magistrate but because it is entrusted to him by the church? Just as Zwingli and you, indeed the whole church, entrusted this office to the senate, if what is written in the "Subsidy" is true.</p>
      <p>However, I do not contend that this office should be entrusted solely to the magistrate or that it can be entrusted to no one but him, nor did I wish to assert this in my previous letter to Berchtold; but I argued against the Anabaptists, who attribute to their mixed crowd and faction, which they call the church, what you would not have needed. For after much discussion, you finally conclude that excommunication belongs to the church or the elders to whom the church has entrusted it. I say and feel the same, indeed I gather from this that if it is entrusted to the magistrate, then excommunication is with him, that is, the public and external penalty for public crimes. But here you think nothing should be entrusted to the magistrate, regardless of their nature. About which I spoke above. Because, you say, the magistrate is impious. Was he then pious and different from what he is now when matters of diaconate and matrimonial causes were entrusted to him? Indeed, he was much more pestilent then.</p>
      <p>Our situation will never return to the point where the church, which we can imagine more truly than see, is gathered from such prefects as we want or desire to be holy, unpolluted, and blessed in every part. This was indeed proven to us long ago in the two greatest orders of the church. For among the very few apostles there was a traitor, among the seven deacons Nicholas the heretic. But the rest are not to be immediately rejected by the name of some or deprived of their function. Finally, it is one thing where we are overcome by the votes of the wicked, and another where even the wicked are subject to laws. Among the pagans, not every magistrate punished usury, fornication, drunkenness, etc., nor had every magistrate proscribed these. But among us, these are so joined with civil constitutions in a Christian city that if some wicked people protest, they are still liable for the violated law and cannot compel others, who are more just, to their opinion with any equity. For a public edict, a public constitution, which can now be urged by both the good and the bishops, always stands in the way. Add to this that we would not have avoided that danger even if we had taken away the penalty for crimes from the magistrate and entrusted it to certain men from the church, as if those men could not be and could not express the example of Ananias, Demas, and many others. For the illustrious man Zwingli did not write in vain against the Anabaptists that our calamity is so great that we have not yet found such absolute perfection among men, nor is it ever to be hoped that all who confess Christ will be blessed in every part as long as this dwelling of the body is carried around.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since we must act as we can (unless we prefer to mix everything with confusion), when it is not allowed as we wish, I now focus solely on having a peaceful church that does not sin shamelessly, peaceful indeed not without tribulations - for all who desire to live godly in Christ must be afflicted - but peaceful as far as those who are in the church are concerned; nor sinning shamelessly. For we are human as long as we live; therefore, nothing human will be alien to us. Even the greatest minds are often seduced by sins. The best fail, but they return in their time. What more? We are human. And here we are dealing with the external church, not the internal one, which after charity does not need other laws, but still rejoices in public edicts as they are set for the affliction of the wicked. The good hate to sin out of love for virtue, the wicked hate to sin out of fear of punishment. The pious execute what is just out of love for justice, the law is set for the impious. Therefore, in the external church, which Christ depicted in Matthew 13 [24ff], an external penalty is needed, which is excommunication. In this, the goats must be restrained with severity.</p>
      <p>What need is there for many words? I too can entrust the authority of excommunication to certain men, if only this method introduced to our city would promote the glory of God or if we would have done something better with this innovation or if by this method we could oppose the impious and impiety more strongly than hitherto. For everything must be done by us for edification and done circumspectly, lest we cast the church into the greatest danger. Baltazar Pacimontanus wanted to introduce a new form of church to his city and dispersed the entire church. And what did Oecolampadius, a holy and most learned man, promote among the people of Basel? Is there less impiety among them? What did some promote long ago in St. Gallen, against whom our most prudent, pious, and learned teacher Zwingli so strongly opposed? Or what could we safely attempt in these otherwise turbulent times? Perhaps give some impious people the opportunity to bring forth what they have long been laboring over, now more quickly with our help? For take away from the senate what you desire; entrust it to certain men. But who will truly fear them? If some ash-covered person is called by them, he will despise them. If excommunicated, he will stir up trouble and thus the church will be divided. But you say, I do not want the ejected and excommunicated to be despised. But he is most abjectly despised who is ejected from the company of the saints. Moreover, you say, let him have his own, and leave ours untouched. He will not do it. Therefore, you will say, it will be a holy persecution. But it is not necessarily taken up by us, nor sent to us by God. For we can freely preach the truth, freely confess Christ, and enjoy all the things the church rejoices in. One thing is missing: you want to bring the ash-covered and lice-ridden into order with excommunication. But we must see that by this very means we do not restore all the impious to freedom, by which we wanted to bring them into order, so that henceforth they take away from us all freedom of speaking, acting, and confessing. Rather, let us preach Christ holy, prophetically blame crimes, urge the magistrate to remember his duty wisely. Let us threaten sometimes that unless they more severely punish crimes, we will soon entrust excommunication to others. Let us admonish the pious to live piously, and in the reception of the sacraments, let each one examine themselves, especially when we see that Judas received the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ; indeed, why do I say Judas, when I know that all the apostles received it, who within an hour or two defected from Christ, so that even Peter solemnly swore that he did not know the man. Let us therefore admonish the pious, again and again, let us gather our church in faith and doctrine. Whoever is of God has his seal. The perverse are carried to worse by the day. The impious are excommunicated by God, and all who believe the preached gospel avoid and shun our impious ones. What does it matter to the pious and the apostles that Judas communicates with them? He takes judgment upon himself. The pious approach in faith.</p>
      <p>I wanted to note these few things, Leo, most learned teacher and dearest brother to me. For I did not want to respond to each point, lest we brothers and colleagues contend more odiously. Nor should you think that I interpret anything in a worse part, nor do I take anything badly. No interjections are needed with me. I love you and revere the learning and age full of authority in you. I see and perceive your mind, indeed holy and sincere. Hence I wanted to treat this matter more extensively, as I certainly believe you wanted to be informed by these things, what I could accomplish in sacred matters: certainly, as you see and hear daily, little or certainly nothing. For what is clearer? If we simply consider what excommunication is, namely the public custody of public decency, and why it was instituted, namely, so that they do not sin more shamelessly in the church of Christ, and that it is given primarily to the external church, again, if we consider what the flesh is, and that we are and remain human at all times of life, so that the spirit is willing, finally that we can hope for an unpolluted church sooner than have it, now the matter will be easy: We will not be able to make the world other than it was from the beginning. We would sooner establish a Novatian church than one perfect in all respects. The Lord has advanced the church of Zürich through Zwingli and you to the point that I believe I have shown myself a faithful worker to God if I can retain it by his grace and your help as you have established it.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>March 15, 1532.</p>
