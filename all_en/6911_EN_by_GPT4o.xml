      <p>Greetings. Indeed, many reports of the prosperous success of the Germans are brought to us daily; however, I look to the end, not the beginnings; for it is rare that anyone is brought to the highest degree of misery who has not experienced the flatteries of fortune. I wish all good things for the Germans and pray, and at the same time, I would like them not to neglect themselves, their enemies, or their friends. Those returning from the Frankfurt fair tell amazing stories about the affairs in Flanders, statues being overthrown everywhere, and no human blood being spilled. If only they would learn wisdom from our misfortunes. The envoy from Granrieus reminded me of those things which you wanted me to know; for that, we owe you great thanks. I am diligently working to ensure that we suffer no harm; how successfully, God will see, who has the plans, thoughts, and very courses of events numbered from eternity. I wrote this to you, not because there was enough material to write about; but I did not want this messenger of mine to depart for Zürich without letters from us to you. Many greetings to Lords Gwalther and Wolphius, which I pray to the Lord for you, reverend friend, to be eternal.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 27th of September, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Pomponne Bellièvre.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
