      <p>I received the most friendly letters of your piety, most illustrious prince, and indeed with the greatest joy. For I congratulate myself and give thanks to our Lord God and to your kindness, that I am counted among the friends of such a great man, with whom I would consider it enough to be among the familiars and servants. With God's help, I will ensure that you will never regret your remarkable benevolence towards me. And if now, most excellent prince, I can do anything for your favor, you will find me eager. I ask one thing of your piety: that you direct all your strength to promoting the cause of evangelical piety and truth. He will not fail, who has promised to be with us in our pious endeavors until the end of the age. Nor indeed did he light the lamp of his word in you to be covered with a bushel. Therefore, do diligently what you do, illustrious hero, and support the cause of the reborn gospel. I wrote this in great haste and therefore ask you to consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent prince, and I pray that you always keep me commended to your piety and clemency. In Zürich, the principal city of the Swiss, November 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince, Lord Spithek Jordan of Zaliczin and heir in Melstin, Palatine of Sandomierz and Captain of Przemyśl and Ramion, his most esteemed lord.</p>
