    <p xml:id="regest1">They express their gratitude from London, where they have met, for the services rendered to them. In England, in order to avoid unrest, [Catholic] ceremonies are still tolerated but interpreted as symbols: holy water, bread, and the pax board remind of the salvation event; nothing has yet been decided about the marriage of priests, the mass is understood as a representation of the suffering of Christ, and all images that were venerated have been removed. The Papists [Henry Courtenay], [Henry Pole], and Edward Neville were executed, as was Nicholas Carew, the king's master of the horse, who, however, confessed to the Gospel before his death. It is said that the French, Italians, Spaniards, and Scots wanted to go to war against England simultaneously, but their secret plans are said to have spurred King [Henry VIII] to further promote the Reformation. Pope [Paul III] instigated the burning of English merchants in Spain and offered indulgences for the killing of English heretics; yet England has a king of noble disposition and military prowess, as well as a loyal people. The war news prevented John Butler from traveling to Zurich and Nicholas Partridge from attending the Frankfurt Fair. The former could take a position with the king but shuns court life, Nicholas Eliott is dealing with English law, Bartholomew Traheron is in the service of [Thomas] Cromwell, Partridge is in the service of the Bishop of St Davids [William Barlow]; they are all still unmarried. Archbishop [Thomas Cranmer], currently engaged in instructing the people and composing English prayers, has promised to write to Bullinger. [Theodor] Bibliander's letter was forwarded to Bishop [Hugh Latimer]. They request a good reception of their letter and send greetings.</p>

      <p>To the most excellent and learned men, their esteemed teachers in Christ, Konrad Pellikan, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, John Butler, Nicholas Eliott, Nicholas Partridge, Bartholomew Trehern, wish health through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>The reason we all write to you in one letter, most distinguished men, is partly because we all met together in London, but mainly so that you may know we are united in one spirit and one mind, as if many have become one. The reasons that compelled us to write are these: to declare that we hold the memory of your rare kindness as we ought, and so that you may not be unaware of either our private or our kingdom's state. However, in giving thanks to you for your singular merits towards us, neither the magnitude of the matter nor your kindness allows us to be many. Let this only be said, that we will repay your favor as much as our abilities will allow (if you should perhaps require it). We come now to the state of our kingdom, which is as follows. Ceremonies are tolerated, but meanings have been added, so that now the so-called holy water does nothing but remind us of the sprinkling of Christ's blood; that bread signifies the breaking of the same body; the peace, which is usually passed around, sets before our eyes the reconciliation of God and men. These things are done to avoid sedition and are ordered to be tolerated until the king himself either abolishes or changes them. Nothing has yet succeeded regarding the marriage of priests, although there are those who have spoken freely to the king on this matter. The Mass is not asserted as a sacrifice for the living and the dead, but as a representation of the passion of Christ. Statues that are worshipped are removed. We do not doubt that you have heard that those who most favored the papacy among us have been cut down, namely the Marquess of Exeter, the Earl of Salisbury Montague, a most distinguished knight but a most wicked man, Edward Neville. Recently, Nicholas Carew, who was in charge of the king's horses, was also punished. He, about to undergo execution by the king's order, exhorted all to diligent reading of evangelical books; for he had come to such a foul death because he had abhorred (for he was most devoted to papist religion) the gospel. There is a rumor that we will have war with the French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Scots all at the same time. When the secret machinations of these were reported to our king, he said he would sleep no worse; the next day he also affirmed to his counselors that he was more than ever before incited by certain silent goads to propagate the word of God. Indeed, the Pope arranged for three English merchants in Spain to be burned and granted remission of sins to all who kill an English heretic. You will pray to God for us, that He may not allow madmen to insult His servants. We have a king of the greatest and most ample spirit, skilled in military matters to the point of wonder. We have a people, as we hope, sufficiently obedient to their king, after the very heads of treason (as you know) have been cut off. If your prayers are added, we do not doubt that all will be well. Now receive a few words about our state. John Butler would have come to you if he had not been held back by these war reports. The same cause kept Nicholas Partridge from the Frankfurt fair. John, indeed, if he wished, could be in an honorable position with the king; but, delighted by the love of the Muses, he seems to abhor the court. Nicholas Eliott applies himself to our municipal law, aided not a little by the king's munificence. Bartholomew Trehern is a servant of Mr. Cromwell; Nicholas Partridge is with the learned and pious bishop of St. David's in Wales. He will be in charge of sacred lectures until he can be better provided for. We are all still free from wives. These are about our state. To you, most excellent Bullinger, the Archbishop of Canterbury has promised to write, who is now wholly engaged in teaching the people and in devising certain English orations, which our priests will use in place of the Latin ones they have hitherto mumbled in the temples like parrots.</p>
      <p>The letters of our Bibliander have been delivered to the Bishop of Worcester, whom we think will reply. Esteem well, most learned men, these hastily written things, and farewell. You will convey our many greetings to your wives and all our friends in our name. March 8 (1539, London.) JOHN BUTLER, Yours entirely.</p>
      <p>NICHOLAS ELIOTT, Yours.</p>
      <p>NICHOLAS PARTRIDGE, Yours.</p>
      <p>BARTHOLOMEW TREHERN, to the best of his ability.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in the name of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, their most esteemed teacher, these letters are given. Zurich.</p>
      <p>May it prosper indeed.</p>
