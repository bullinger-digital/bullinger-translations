    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler sent with the last messenger, [Johannes] Haller, the theses of [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld, which Bullinger should return with the current messenger [Johannes Reinbold Funk]. - Schuler has not heard anything reliable about the [Second] Regensburg Religious Discussion. Emperor [Charles V] is supposedly going to hold the Diet in Regensburg; however, it is not known when or if it will happen at all, as [Francis I] is planning hostile actions against him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Nothing is happening at the Council of Trent that brings honor to Christ. [The Catholics] are proving to be corrupt and frivolous in this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Schmalkaldic League allies will meet on April 1, [1546] in Worms. The Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] gives hope for a reformation of the church. Elector [Frederick II of the] Palatinate has joined the [Protestants]. The Emperor, who is surrounded by Papists, is very annoyed about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should share his opinion on Schwenckfeld's theses with Schuler. Schuler himself will not approve of them in any way, as they are full of errors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The letter carrier [Johannes Reinbold] Funk will report on the flax. - Greetings from Mayor [Balthasar] Funck, the doctor [Ulrich] Wolfhart, and [Pastor] Bartholomäus Bertlin. Schuler's wife [..., née Lübegger] sends greetings to Bullinger and his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, our Savior. I sent with the last messenger, Haller, certain writings to you, especially the propositions of Schwenckfeld, which I wish to be returned to me with the present messenger. I have nothing reliable to write about the Regensburg Colloquy. Perhaps in due time, it will emerge more fully with the glory of Christ. They say the Emperor is going to hold a Diet in Regensburg; when, it is not yet certain, perhaps never.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2">
      <p>For the French are planning certain hostile actions against the Emperor, as they are never consistent among themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nothing is happening at the Council of Trent that could be a monument to the glory of Christ. They are so openly wicked and mock the cause, that no one can fail to see that they are completely insane.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our allies in the Schmalkaldic League will meet on the first of April in Worms, there to put the finishing touch on their cause. The Archbishop of Mainz gives us considerable hope for the reformation of the church. The Elector of the Palatinate has joined our side; which greatly annoys the Emperor, as he, surrounded by a throng of Papists, cannot discern what is true. May the Lord protect His church through Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Do not hesitate to briefly express your judgment on the Schwenckfeldian propositions I sent to you. I certainly do not approve of them at all, but reject them as full of errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Funck will respond about the flax, the bearer of the present letter. Mayor Funck, Doctor Ulrich Wolfhart, Bartholomäus Bertlin, and all the brothers in the Lord greet you. Especially my wife, who is physically weak, wishes you and your dear wife well. May the Lord Jesus Christ advance you by His Spirit in every good work for His glory and the benefit of the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7">
      <p>Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>Date: February 17, 1546.</p>
      <p>Gervasius Schuler, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord and brother in Christ, to be revered.</p>
