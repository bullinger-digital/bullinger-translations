      <p>Greetings. I received those various news along with your letters, most esteemed lord, and because they were brought later than expected, I decided to delay my response until now. However, I ask your excellence not to interpret this less favorably if I am more reserved in writing back about the news; for anyone can easily judge, without any trouble, how little the difficulty of my position allows me to pursue rumors of people, especially those who are less familiar with the burdens of this church, which I still bear alone.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I will not hesitate to briefly convey what I have gathered at home these days. Mr. Bonettus reported to me from the bookseller Peter in Bern: It is written from Mainz that exiles driven out by Alba, along with the Prince of Orange, who has over 4000 horsemen with him, have taken Deventer, having killed 500 Spanish garrison soldiers there. - Selio, the minister of the Upper Engadine church, an Italian man, reliably informed me that he learned from Captain Baptista of Salices, a tormented papist, who received written information from Italy, that he had certainly understood: Before the earth trembled, the inquisitor of Ferrara had imprisoned 15 monks suspected of Lutheranism in some narrow places and suffocated them by raising a great smoke. Later, as the earthquake intensified, he accused the duke of causing all the damage and misery, whatever it may be, arising here and there, because they did not treat the heretics more harshly and did not conduct a more diligent inquisition. The duke replied: it is true; he indeed provided the cause of such calamity, but not because they acted more leniently or remissively until now, but because they spared so little or nothing of the innocent blood; hence it is necessary for their blood to be shed now, so that the innocent may be required from their hands. From this, a great suspicion arose for the duke himself, so much so that when asked and admonished by the pope, he must declare which religion he is a lover and professor of, etc. Here, the rumor is spread among the other Swiss that the Zurichers also promised aid to the Venetians against the Turks, which I cannot believe. However, you surely understood what happened to the Rhaetian envoys today. They recently convened in Davos and, having granted the right of citizenship, accepted a certain Conrad RÃ¶tli or Erythraeus from Augsburg as a citizen or native Rhaetian, who claimed that a large sum of money was owed to him by the Spaniard, which he has not yet been able to demand and obtain by any means; therefore, he wishes to become a Rhaetian and be admitted as a citizen of this nation, so that with letters of recommendation and friendly intercessions from the allied league, he may more effectively obtain and recover his right and due money. He was accepted (as the most honorable Mr. Consul Willius, whom I particularly addressed on this matter, especially amidst the many malicious voices, told me), but with open and certain laws, that he confirms and certifies with letters and witnesses or trustworthy sureties that no other reason underlies this petition, except that he wishes to use their friendly and allied assistance to extort money from the Spaniard. Now the peasants interpret this very differently and say that a treacherous matter is being pursued: that Rhaetian aid was promised to this foreigner to intercept Italian goods, the retention of which would force the Spaniard to pay, from which cruel wars would undoubtedly follow; it was also granted to this Conrad that he may build a fortress and stronghold at his own expense wherever he wishes in Rhaetia; forgetting the ancestors, who once demolished fortifications of this kind not without serious reasons and dangers, they now think of rebuilding them to the great detriment of the fatherland, overcome by gold and gifts, with which almost all the envoys were excessively corrupted and attacked. Hence you see the peasants raging and reasonably going mad. They deposed the Davosian bailiff from his throne and, as rumor has it, sentenced him to prison. Elsewhere, some had to risk their lives, who barely escaped with prayers, having been redeemed with difficulty from the spears presented and brandished. Some threw themselves at the feet of the peasants and begged by God and all justice not to perpetrate anything more fiercely against them without a cause being declared and the truth being known. There is also various talk about our consuls, who performed the duty of the legation. But Mr. Willius will excuse himself, whom I believe to be free of blame, as well as the other. God protect us from uprisings; for it would be no wonder if the earth opened up; thus everything goes in a disorderly manner. Everything is for sale for gold; gold follows justice. I wanted to write these things briefly to you, lest anything more serious harm you. The peasants are seized with dizziness. If anything more serious is underlying, it will not cool down so briefly and easily; for many things need to be washed away and cleansed, hopefully with peaceful means in the right order! However, I hope many things are traditional.</p>
      <p>The most honorable Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Bonettus, and others greet you, etc. I wish that Mr. R. Gwalther's book had been sent neatly bound to both consuls; there is no one here who practices this art. Mr. Willius will soon be in office, and if the Lord favors, I will present myself in person.</p>
      <p>Most quickly from our museum, January 22, 1571, in Chur of the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>May our Ernius be safe.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your lordship, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished and vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his lord to be honored with singular respect.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
