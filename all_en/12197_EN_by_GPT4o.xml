    <p xml:id="regest1">The Five Cantons request from the [Small and Great] Council of Zurich that Zurich, which holds the chair [in the Diet] and consequently must administer the oath, should also receive this oath from the Five Cantons, albeit under the [invocation] of the saints, which Zurich is to recite to them. Zurich promised a response. However, the Zurich councils regret that the Five Cantons, to whom they leave their faith, do not grant them the same and want to force them to contribute to being able to swear by the saints. - Bullinger recommends the bearer Christian Krämer [the Younger], son of Christian Krämer [the Elder], citizen of Bremgarten. Christian the Younger attended school in Beromünster and, like his father, has no interest in the papacy. Myconius should provide him with accommodation for his studies, as in [Zurich] there is already a need to support around 80 scholarship holders. - Johannes Caesarius from Cologne and Johannes Pistorius from Hesse write similarly about the persecutions instigated by [Charles V]. Myconius should read Book 8, Chapter 1 of Eusebius' "Church History" and see how different those times were from the present! - From Bonn, Albert Hardenberg reports that [Hermann von Wied] remains steadfast. - Johannes a Lasco has sent Bullinger his [“Defense of True Doctrine”] against Menno Simons and other unpublished writings. What he writes about the Eucharist is excellent. Bullinger is very glad to have gained such a friend. He wrote him a first letter a year ago [HBBW XIV, No. 1871]. - So much for Myconius’ last letter [No. 2144]. - Bullinger has returned the theses "Schalkendeckers" [Eligius Pruystincks] (a new Valentinus or Marcion!) copied by Myconius to [Johannes] Gast. Before Christmas [1544], he also received them from Augsburg. They are already refuted in the 12th book of his commentary on Matthew. - [Kaspar] Megander, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther send their regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The Five Cantons have appeared before the councils and citizens and have requested with many words that, since my lords are the foremost canton and administer the oath in all places, they should also administer it to the Five Cantons, albeit under the invocation of the saints, etc. In response, they have been dismissed with the promise that they will be given an answer in due time. My lords complain about this matter because, while they allow the Five Cantons to remain in their faith, the Five Cantons want to force them to swear by the saints or as they wish, believing that they should also be allowed to remain in their own faith. Just as one among us should not honor images, invoke saints, or observe masses for himself, so he should not help or promote anyone else in doing so. For what would be the point if someone said: "I do not want to honor images, but if someone else wants to honor them, I will always present them," etc. The answer that will be given to them has not yet been drafted, etc.</p>
      <p>I entrust the bearer of this letter to you and yours faithfully. His father is named like him, the son, Christian Krämer; he is a citizen of Bremgarten. The son attended school in Beromünster for a time; he has no interest in the papacy, just like his father. If you can and may somehow, I ask for God's sake that you help him so that he can study; if I can, I will repay it. I cannot accommodate him with us at all, as at this time we are supporting around 80 scholarship holders; there are very high costs at the door, etc. Dear friend, if possible, help him with alms for food and bread and try it for half a year. Johannes Caesarius from Cologne and Johannes Pistorius from Hesse write similarly about the cruel persecution instigated by Charles V. But these are only the beginnings of sorrows; our ingratitude deserves greater things. Please read, if you have time, the 8th book of Eusebius' "Church History" and especially chapter 1, and judge how different those times are from ours. May the Lord have mercy on us. I have always foreseen and expected these and worse things to come.</p>
      <p>From Bonn, Albert Hardenberg writes that the bishop remains steadfast; but great dangers threaten the pious. He sent me the book that Johannes a Lasco wrote against Menno Simons, along with some other unpublished writings. He is as prudent and eloquent as he is pious and learned. He has written many things about the Eucharist that are exceedingly learned, religious, clear, and invincible. I am very glad to have gained such a friend and brother. He wrote me his first letter a year ago.</p>
      <p>I wanted to respond to your last letter with this. Now I commend you to the grace of God along with all the pious.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have returned the articles of Schalkendecker to Johannes Gast, from whom I received them. However, I recognized your hand. I received them from Augsburg before Christmas. I responded to their delusions in the 12th book of my commentary on Matthew. In this monster, Valentinus and Marcion, the firstborn of Satan, have been revived. But these are the last times. Christ the victor will soon overthrow all heresies, to whom be glory.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the first of May, 1545.</p>
      <p>Megander, Pellikan, Bibliander, Gwalther, and all the others greet you.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, his esteemed and beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
