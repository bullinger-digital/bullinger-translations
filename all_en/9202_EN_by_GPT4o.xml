      <p>S. When the most illustrious Mr. Dathenus wished to return to you, who was here without any honor due to the miserable state of these times and people, I did not want to let him go without my letters to you. I am surprised that I receive letters from you so rarely, and I greatly fear that mine have been lost. Gantner, the most restless, is so bold that he now publicly associates with Frell and the other Anabaptists, who were expelled from the city in previous years and have now not only returned but have also greatly increased and confirmed their errors. Mr. Pontisella shows himself to be so friendly to both of these impostors that there is a rumor of some kind of agreement between them, etc. Therefore, that impostor has excellent advisors, who indeed are the ones advising him to summon me to court, which he clearly demonstrated today when he demanded a pledge from me. It is not enough that he has been convicted of error, but now he denies and denies again and seeks to prove that an injustice has been done to him by law, and he strives to subject and renew this cause of the church to the civil scepter. He thinks his honor has been diminished because I publicly declared Gantner to be certainly caught in errors, similar to a thief. Therefore, John and Peter called Christ a thief because they recorded that he would come to judgment like a thief.</p>
      <p>I have often said that these are heretics who tear apart the peace of the church and persistently introduce heterodoxy; hence, he will injure me by law, as if I had called him a heretic, although I have discussed false prophets and false teachers according to the order of 2... 2. The matter has come to this, that if any text compels me to speak against any kind of seducers, the Gantnerians immediately slander that it was said against their leader. May God be with me; for I see what they are doing and with what snares they are trying to undermine me. I see what they are plotting, I say, who want to promote their fellow citizens by any means, having expelled those proud Zurichers, among whom Mr. Fab[ricius] is especially considered by Gantner.</p>
      <p>Look upon me, I beg you, most revered father, and deign to consider with favor how I remain in Rhaetia with no more benefit. I think you have learned from the hand of that impostor and from the strengthened letters to whom the injury is done. Now he tries to wash away his filth by law, indeed by injustice, which he tries to inflict on us with the work of conspirators, whom he has as intimate and powerful for the tribunal. I must persevere well; but I know what will happen afterward, and that from past experiences. I have not yet forgotten by what arts certain Gynopedians and their leader once surrounded and accused me. Now I must expect the same and the same fate will also occur, namely expulsion, desertion, no help, utmost contempt, derision, and if there are any other things, which indeed happen to the most enduring, if possible, as a reward. But I will leave this unfortunate business and prepare myself for other things. - Our affairs in this region are in a most dangerous place. Indeed, the Praettigovian prefect Mr. D[ietegius] said to your or your friends, as I perceive, that there is good hope that everything will be peaceful. But in the meantime, I understand quite different things: certain things are done secretly, lest some escape; I understand that many have joined their efforts and have composed certain articles, which they want to bring into action: 1. that the envoy be driven away; 2. that the treaty be annulled again; 3. that certain punished ones should not preside over offices and public duties; 4. that brother Rhaetian Conrad should not be tolerated; 5. they want the agreement of the Rhaetian heirs to be null; 6. our coiners should be punished by Imperial law, who are certainly the instigators of all evil in our republic and church. These, these are, I say, who support Gantner, so that they themselves may be safer in their most corrupt corruptions, by which they have long exposed this noble city to the mockery and insults of all. The senate is so divided and torn that they have not yet been able to obtain the exchange of that most corrupt currency, which has branded this nation with an indelible stain throughout the world.</p>
      <p>Briefly, I fear you will experience the most miserable outcome of this evil. - About Turkish affairs, it is written to us from Italy that Cardinal Vesinus, the pope's legate to the French, did not obtain from the king to enter into an alliance with others against the Turk; indeed, the king even asked the pope to recall his legate to him.</p>
      <p>John of Austria has sent many centurions to Spain to enlist soldiers, and it is said that he will soon send many others. The Venetians are entirely engaged in enlisting soldiers for the fleet from here and there, that is, from the gates of Italy and central Italy; but they suffer from a great shortage of both soldiers and rowers. About the Turkish military preparations, it is said by almost everyone that they seem utterly incredible. There are those who affirm that they already have five hundred very well-armed triremes and twenty-five quinqueremes, besides many transport ships and almost innumerable smaller vessels. There is also a rumor that the Turkish emperor himself will lead a huge cavalry and infantry; but it is also true that the Turkish legate was driven away from the French court because the king did not carry out the Belgian expedition. It is also said that the Albanian has returned to the Tartar seats from where he came. But enough of this. I have hardly ever written anything faster; thus sleep invites me in the middle of the night, who will nevertheless preach twice tomorrow, but with what love, with what benevolence, with what zeal, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Please convey my most dutiful greetings to Mr. Haller and all the others. Tomorrow there will be a meeting at the House of God only because of the dispute between the Zuziens and the Samadens about the stick and gallows. May God be with us; there is no hope of peace, everything is most disturbed, and never have things been worse.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man. Forgive me, I beg you, for wasting paper with such tedium and pain.</p>
      <p>Most quickly, February 14, 1573, at night.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>Our consuls and Mr. Victor send their most dutiful greetings to you and Mr. Rodolph Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious Antistes of the Zurich church, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
