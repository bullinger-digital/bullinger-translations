      <p> Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed sir, and I thank you for your fatherly inclination towards me. However, there is no need to fear that our people will act rashly; they are too cold to wage war for the truth. They handle matters with words, and I cannot believe in any way that the monks will be expelled from Morben; these spies have taken such deep roots. The people of Milan also display all the courtesies that can be expected from peaceful neighbors, and unless a snake lies hidden in the grass, they seem to be well-disposed towards us! </p>
      <p> The doctor from Morben sang a recantation to us and was forced to admit that we brought the truth in our name and in the name of others. </p>
      <p> Ascanius, whom you write you do not know, is the one whom Count Hannibal tried to destroy tyrannically and kill in prison, and whom he pursued so much that his fate stood at the brink in our court. Pompeius Romanus, through our envoy, requested the entire course and process of the action, as they call it, from our magistrate; but it was denied to him, although it was granted to Hannibal himself. What kind of action it was, I sent to you earlier in a German writing, and I do not think you are unaware of it. </p>
      <p> Regarding that Albanian robbery, it was also reported to us from Basel, but only about 15 killed, not 50. </p>
      <p> Surely he will stir up hornets; may it be to his and his followers' ruin, as he deserves! </p>
      <p> I will send your letters to Davos today; from there they will be conveniently carried to Susa. May the Lord Jesus keep you and all yours for as long as possible and eternally. I wish Mr. Erni well. All of ours diligently send their regards to you. </p>
      <p> June 29, Chur, 1568. </p>
      <p> Entirely devoted to your greatness, Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church of Zurich, his most merciful lord. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
