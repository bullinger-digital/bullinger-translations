      <p>S. Although these of ours could inform you about all matters, yet because you so greatly urge me to write, behold, I add these private notes to their report. First, for that most holy work of yours, which you sent to me written by the hand of a brother, I give you great and immense thanks. It will indeed be of great help to me in these controversies, especially if I have to attend the French classes. I could not read these days, due to the presence of those brothers of mine, but now this will be the first thing I do. Calvin seems to be very keen on this matter. He was here these days together with a certain consul from Geneva to discuss with us the diversity of ecclesiastical observations between the church of Geneva and our churches. For it greatly pains the magistrate that the Genevans make frequent changes concerning external matters beyond necessity.</p>
      <p>Therefore, some conformity will have to be discussed. But this matter is suspended until the classes are visited. One would be quite at peace.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we celebrated our synod here. I can respond nothing more to Count Georg of Württemberg, except that it seems to me it would be worthwhile, if he wanted to have a minister from our region, to write about this matter to our senate, whose authority will overcome all other obstacles.</p>
      <p>Musculus says he has expressed his judgment on ecclesiastical discipline in the 18th chapter of Matthew. But since you insist, perhaps he will write something more about this to you shortly. My judgment, since it is none, I would not dare to propose to anyone. I am satisfied with what we have here. For everything is so corrupted that unless a tolerable form of church was established by our ancestors, I could not hope for a better one at this time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will be in vain to dispute about what cannot be obtained and brings with it many dangers. Would that we could preserve the discipline we have. However, in our churches throughout the countryside, indeed in each parish, it is established that everywhere there are four elders after the pastor, who are obliged to meet alternately every Sunday to discuss ecclesiastical matters together with the minister and also the prefect (wherever there is a prefect). These consistories of the individual churches (for so they are called in the countryside) have the power to inquire into any vices, crimes, and wickedness, to summon the guilty, to admonish, to argue, to rebuke. Only this seems to be lacking to many, that they do not have the power to exclude from the communion of the supper. Over all these presides our Bernese consistory, by whose authority those who refuse to obey the others are punished. Therefore, if the ministers were diligent, there would be enough discipline in the church. However, I will discuss this matter more fully with you another time. The departing brothers now call me away from writing. Farewell well with all yours. I give great thanks to our Lord God for your restoration. May the Lord grant you long-lasting health, for all our churches greatly need it. Calvin has more than once, with me hearing, sharply criticized Theodorus' Protevangelion with indirect speeches. Johannes Rudolf von Erlach died on April 6th, after more than a whole month of decay had consumed his lung. I fear that this was done by the judgment of God because of certain churches of his dominion that he had strangely despoiled; yet I hope that God did not deny him His mercy, since he otherwise departed piously from here. I visited him daily as he lay ill.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. Greet your whole household in my and my wife's name. Musculus will betroth his daughter Hester to Valentin Ampelandro, the schoolmaster of Zofingen, in these days. Bern, May 30, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his venerable and dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
