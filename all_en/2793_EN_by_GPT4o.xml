      <p>Peace and grace from the Lord, etc. I inform you, most humane man, that Valentin Schudi, pastor of the Glarus church, has passed away and I, unworthy, have been appointed in his place. I fear that I have taken on the burden of Atlas; for I would prefer to have found everything more perfect there than I have; but trusting in the goodness of God, I hope that He will not be absent from my labors and efforts, with whose help everything will be more perfect. The church, which I have led for 23 years, is now without a pastor; therefore, we wish to ask you to send us a man of sincere doctrine and piety, to whom the ministry of the word can be safely entrusted. He will receive an annual salary of 70 gold coins from the church stipend. If you do this, you will have done a most pleasing service to both God and us. Farewell in the Lord. From Glarus, given on the 28th day of December in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Fridolin Brunner, now pastor of the Glarus church.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, one of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my kind lord, to his hands.</p>
