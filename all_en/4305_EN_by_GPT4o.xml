      <p>S. D. I wish I could have benefited your most honorable niece, the daughter of your sister, in some way. She certainly saw what my daughter made; but how little is that? I am ready to do more for you, if I can, and indeed willingly. A few days ago, I received letters from our Haller in Bern; in them, he does not mention anything about what you wrote to me. However, he says that his people are ready if anything happens; now 4 delegates have been selected, 2 of whom will explain the whole matter currently being discussed to the cities, and 2 to the cantons; these delegates are expected, but have not yet arrived.</p>
      <p>For the copied letters of Mr. Calvin, I give your kindness the greatest thanks; I hear nothing else from France, except that the fervor of persecution against the faithful has, thank God, somewhat subsided. This was reported by Beldius of Claron, who returned from Paris these days.</p>
      <p>The Scottish and English war presses and burns the French. A noble envoy has come from Poland, bringing several letters from the brothers.</p>
      <p>Among other things, these letters report that John a Lasco died on January 8th, to the great sorrow of the pious; that Stancarus is now disturbing the churches, which otherwise multiply by God's grace; that he teaches certain foreign things, especially that Christ is a mediator only according to his human nature. They asked us for our opinion, which we gave, urging them to beware of new doctrines. They indicate that Vergerius has gone to Prussia to try to persuade the Palatine of Vilnius to accept the Augsburg Confession, for which more effort is being made than for the Gospel of Christ itself. The ministers throughout Poland are very indignant about this.</p>
      <p>They write that he attempted the same in England, for which the Bishop of London severely reproached him. They mention many things of this kind; they also proposed other questions, to which we responded. The Muscovite war is now quiet, and Livonia has peace; may it last long.</p>
      <p>The envoy has gone to Bern and Geneva, etc.</p>
      <p>While I write this, I receive letters from the most distinguished Mr. Friedrich von Salis, commissioner of the Rhaetians in Chur.</p>
      <p>The letters are dated June 2nd.</p>
      <p>Among other things: "King Philip's fleet was defeated by the Turkish fleet at Tripoli; Philip lost about 60 cargo ships; the loss he suffered is enormous. It is also reported from elsewhere that only 7 galleys escaped, and barely at that; the Turkish fleet now controls the Mediterranean Sea and is a threat to Italy, Sicily, and France; it is said to have 150 ships" etc.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, the Lord has once again delivered David from the hand of Saul through the intervention of the Philistines; for it is said that the French and Spanish are repairing their fleet and are occupied with those matters; therefore, they will not be able to do what they had planned against the faithful, as their forces are distracted. In the meantime, we must be vigilant and pray, etc. In Lucerne, Zug, and in our territory of Groningen, hail has almost destroyed everything. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I can write no more now.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 6, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer in Winterthur, my most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Winterthur.</p>
