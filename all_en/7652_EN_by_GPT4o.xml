      <p>Regarding the brother who was captured and taken to Rome, nothing certain is known. The magistrate here has outlawed those bandits who bound him. We hope that our lords will proceed further to avenge such a great injury. - The people of Morbegno have chosen as their minister of the word that distinguished and illustrious man, Count Ulrich, who now resides here in Chiavenna, still shining with sincere piety and a notably upright way of living for all good people. - As for me, with my colleague excluded from the church, I bear the burden alone, as long as it seems good to God and our father.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, the day before the calends of November 1568.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter is Mr. Guido, a minister of the word, who will communicate with you on certain matters of great importance.</p>
