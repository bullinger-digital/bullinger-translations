      <p>All greetings through Jesus Christ, our only savior.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, much esteemed brother in Christ, that everything is still well, intact, firm, and harmonious among the Swiss, especially those who preach, adore, and confess Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with all their heart and soul. Indeed, we are doing well both in the cities and in the countryside, we live and preach as best as we can, because the grace of God and all hope for the present and future have been taken from us. I reached my family after a fairly happy and fortunate journey, but I became weak in my whole body from excessive drinking of water, almost all my limbs contracted; but I have recovered a little by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>I can never forget and am extremely grateful before God and men for the friendship, kindness, hospitality, sumptuous meals, and utmost generosity bestowed upon me, unworthy as I am, by you brothers, the councilors, and many pious townspeople; yet I hope for much greater and better things, if God the Father wills, to live with you sometime and to die with you.</p>
      <p>My family and I, dear brother, are still in Esslingen, hiding in a small hut, working day and night with our hands for the sustenance of our miserable life, awaiting a calling, consolation, and redemption from God and pious brothers, from the body of this death, and to live in the heavens with Jesus Christ for eternal ages. I die ten times a day, because there are fights and terrors outside and inside; everything tends to worsen; apostasy and vain idol worship grow more and more. The best of us are like Paliurus. All that is done against the preaching of the gospel by insolent men goes unpunished; a dreadful persecution threatens us. May the power of God be with us with true perseverance and constancy in faith, amen.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask you, dear brother, and all brothers in Christ, to remember me for good. If I can, by the grace of God, which has not been empty and vain so far, benefit the church of God, I do not refuse labors nor do I abhor the immense threats of men everywhere. Yet my mind, as a human's, is very much concerned about where in the world my family should spend the winter, and Christ admonished his own, that their flight should not be in winter, etc. What more can I say! The Lord my God will provide most abundantly for my complicated affairs, without a doubt, and for all who love and confess Him, He promised; He cannot lie.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of our church, what should I write, I have nothing certain and worthy of knowledge, my brother; everything hangs under the judgment of death and entangled judgments, as I previously explained to you brothers when I was with you.</p>
      <p>They say that Johannes Brenz, Dr. Matthäus from Reutlingen, and other sympathizers are with our prince in Urach, trying to repair the church, which has collapsed, indeed not rightly founded by many. I fear they may start too late, because I see and experience repentance from many of these states. In short, they impose and appoint catechists to the churches with a prescribed gospel: thus and thus he shall preach, etc. Therefore, there is astonishment and miracles in our land; the prophets preach lies, the priests clap their hands, the common people love it greatly, etc. Jeremiah 8. Those catechists do not even dare to be called or addressed by people as pastors or preachers of the word of God, but as pedotribes. Ah, what is more contemptible than the word of God, it would have been better if we had never been born, etc. Our prince attempts many things with a burdened conscience; but I fear he will be able to accomplish little.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, as they say, is still with his son in the lower parts of Brussels. They say they are enacting new and unheard-of laws and imposing heavy burdens on people, and thus will possess and rule the entire Roman Empire by hereditary right. These will be our sins and utmost ingratitude. O illustrious Germany, exalted to the stars, you will be brought down and fall, indeed thrust down to the depths. We miserable Swabians have been made a spectacle and a certain admonition to you Swiss and all nations. These are, my brother, what I wanted you to know in brief and to show the utmost love and gratitude towards your church through our citizens, who have now frequented the Zurzach fairs. You, if it pleases, and I earnestly desire, write back through Christoph Froschauer, my esteemed lord, to the Frankfurt fairs, which are now at the door; he will have certain news from Esslingen. Meanwhile, farewell through Jesus Christ with your whole and holy church and family. I wish salvation in soul and body to all who love, fear, and venerate Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, especially Pellican, Walther, your colleague Fries, Zwingli, and especially Froschauer, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Esslingen, August 27, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Vitus Sacellius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, most esteemed brother in Christ, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
