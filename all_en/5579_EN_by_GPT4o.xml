      <p> Greetings. A battle took place in France on December 19th from 10 in the morning until late at night. Opinions vary on which side achieved victory. The surviving Swiss captains boast in letters written to their magistrate that they have won and accomplished everything; King Charles testifies the same in letters to the Swiss magistrate; meanwhile, they admit that the battle was fought fiercely: they left 21 captains and standard-bearers on the battlefield; the black riders charged through their ranks three times; from this, the rest can be estimated. It is written from Strasbourg on January 2nd that Condé was victorious, the admiral and Dandelot were captured, especially the constable's uncle was taken captive to Orléans; Condé's army was busy plundering the camps; there, unexpectedly, Guise charged with fierce cavalry and captured Condé and took him to Paris. From both sides, what is written agrees on this: Marshal Saint-André, the elder son of the constable, the Grand Prior of France, Guise's brother, fell: many were captured, many were wounded, especially Domal, Guise's brother. The English did not participate in the battle. It is written that 10,000 ascended to Orléans, where what remains of the evangelicals is gathered. Guise and his followers are triumphant; others think they triumph in vain. There are many things I could write; but the astonishing variety prevents me from writing everything; time will tell. Let us pray to the Lord. I greet your sister and the people of Ulm, nephews from your sister, etc. I wrote in great haste. Farewell forever. Maximilian is in Augsburg. They say Brentius is dead; I do not believe it, yet I wish to know for certain; they write from Augsburg that he is dead. Would that he had died before he wrote his Eutychian book on majesty, etc., to which I have already responded by the grace of God! Pray for us. </p>
      <p> January 8, 1563. </p>
      <p> Greet your brother, etc. </p>
      <p> Yours, Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his unique friend, dearest brother, and most esteemed lord. </p>
