      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I was instructed by Zwingli, for he did not have the leisure to read your letter, dearest brother, to read it thoroughly. I gladly complied and saw Tertullian in those passages you had noted. And behold, I found it clearer than daylight that he is of the opinion that intinction (for this is baptism) should precede repentance as a seal for those who are about to begin a new life, or (to use his words) for those who are called by grace to the promise destined for the seed of Abraham. What else is this but, as was heard from Matthew [8, 11], that the nations are called from the ends of the earth to enjoy rest with Abraham and the other patriarchs? Moreover, "the law came in so that the trespass might increase" [Romans 5:20], which hope Christ destroyed, to make the two one. Then I found Lactantius to be of the same opinion in chapters 15 and 20, as you had indicated, that there is one faith, one church, and that those who were before and those who are after Christ are saved through one Christ. We must rejoice, dearest Heinrich, and at the same time give thanks to our heavenly Father, who enlightens us more and more each day and makes us more learned. For who before has taught so clearly, so openly, what our Zwingli (surely by divine spirit) has so learnedly and aptly brought forth? I frankly do not fear to confess my ignorance, and indeed I do so candidly. However, the error arose, I think, because they called the evangelical and apostolic scripture the "New Testament," when in fact scripture is not a testament, and there is no scripture other than what was contained in the Mosaic books. However, the gospel is light and manifestation and indeed the fulfillment of the scriptures. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" [2 Corinthians 1:3 and others], who leads us from errors and the densest darkness into true light; may He so strengthen our hearts that we may never fall back into former errors. I wish you to be well.</p>
      <p>These are my thoughts, which I believe are sufficient regarding the matter, and which I would have sent to you immediately, had not the young man who brought me your letters, already departing, spoken of this word "anteponeret." Therefore, I asked Zwingli, who is a man of exact judgment and very sharp in weighing the opinions of the ancients, who, having examined the passage of Tertullian, thinks that "anteponere" in this place is a term of excellence and dignity and is used for "praeponeret." But let us write down the words of Tertullian: "He ordered that intinction should precede repentance, if, those whom he called by grace to the promise destined for Abraham, he should prefer through the seal of repentance." Zwingli advised that "ut" should be understood before "si," for the ancients in the time of Tertullian spoke briefly in this way "ut, si quos per gratiam vocaret etc., anteponeret," namely "them"; through the seal, that is, through the sign. For the ancients, as Zwingli thinks, found words with "sub" placed in the position of diminutives. I wanted to add this to my own, so that you might see how anxious I am about your matters, and so that you might also be satisfied.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>From ZÃ¼rich, the day after St. Andrew's, 1525.</p>
      <p>Your Leo.</p>
