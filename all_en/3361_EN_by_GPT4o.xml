      <p>Greetings. Just as the couriers are departing and the packages are being loaded onto their shoulders, it is written with the unanimous consent of all the evangelicals, not only theologians but also the counselors of the princes of the Augsburg Confession, that Schnepf, Sarcerius, Victorinus, the theologian of the Elector Margrave, and a fifth person I do not know, have been excluded from the colloquy by the other theologians of our party, sent home, and condemned for heresy because they have bound the grace of Christ to the sacraments and attributed almost more to the signs than to the signified in the forgiveness of sins.</p>
      <p>More is not permitted.</p>
      <p>Just as I am writing this in the pharmacy, it is certainly announced that the Roman King has three legates with the Turk; he has allowed two to proceed as far as Ofen, but he keeps the third and hopes, upon the King's request, to maintain peace for 7 years, for which the King would give him an annual tribute of 40,000 ducats and dismantle all the rebuilt fortresses. The King cannot do this; therefore, hopefully, nothing will come of it.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it would proceed that the King... would establish to eradicate religion and to scatter Germany, which is otherwise torn... I wanted to write this hastily. Augsburg, October 10, in the year 57.</p>
      <p>G[ereon] S[ailer] y[ours].</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere friend and teacher.</p>
