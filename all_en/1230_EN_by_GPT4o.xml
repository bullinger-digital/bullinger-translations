      <p>The king is said to have arrived in Vienna with great jubilation, the prince is to move from Augsburg to Spain in 14 days, and likewise, Queen Maria to Brussels. Nothing can be known about the emperor, when or where; for he is still very weak. A notable person writes to me that he has good information, that he was recently so very ill for three days that it was often not known whether he was alive or dead; for three deadly illnesses have attacked him.</p>
      <p>I also now receive letters from Augsburg, that the Confederates, by all accounts, should have no worries about war this summer; yet it might be better to be concerned and turn to the only peacemaker, God; for the emperor will undertake no great matters anymore, as he is quite decrepit; thus the matter with the Sophy is completely extinguished. It is also said that the plan for the prince to become king or emperor after the emperor's death is not advisable or feasible; rather, when the emperor passes away, everything should come to a free election.</p>
      <p>That is what someone writes; if it is not true, I should not believe such things anymore; for he should rightly have much knowledge of these matters. He also indicates to me that it is certain and true that the imperial and royal majesties do not get along well together, and the young ones even less; they have many and various disputes with each other. Nothing has come of the marriage either; the prince was supposed to inspect all the ladies in Munich, where they were then together; but it is nothing, and Queen Maria is said to have negotiated much between the emperor and the king, but achieved little.</p>
      <p>When the emperor wanted to grant the prince Milan, Liège, Utrecht, etc., and the electors did not want to consent, likewise the king did not either, the emperor in anger had the erected bridge torn down at once, etc., and the next morning sent the one from Papenheim (who is the under-marshal of the empire) into his hall. He had to hold the sword, as is customary, and also took eight other lords with him, and one of them made a Latin oration, which the prince did not understand; several more ceremonies and formalities were also performed in the emperor's chamber. Thus, the emperor granted the prince the aforementioned duchies in a corner against the customs and traditions of the empire; but when the king became aware of this, he immediately protested against it with a notary and witnesses. But I do not want to elaborate on this; I know it from notable, trusted, great people.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph has ridden to the emperor in Augsburg again; no one knows for what reasons.</p>
      <p>Duke Maurice is recruiting foot and horse soldiers; it is said he wants to punish his knighthood, who do not help him.</p>
      <p>I have previously written to you about Parma, how it happened, and it is the truth; if you have not received it, then a letter has once again been lost. There is now a very bad aspect, which my letters face, as has never happened to me in many years.</p>
      <p>During the Easter holidays, I sent several letters to Constance; among them was one I wrote to Junker Hans Kupferschmid, who left Constance with the king's permission, and a good friend in Constance, to whom I also wrote, asking him to deliver this letter to Kupferschmid's wife. He immediately sent the letter under the gate to the gatekeeper and asked him to deliver it, as people were always coming and going, etc. Thus, the gatekeeper placed the letter beside him at the Kreuzlinger Gate, and in the meantime, the colonel came, saw the letter lying there, recognized the handwriting and seal, and angrily wanted to know who had given him the letter. Fortunately, he did not know and did not recognize the maid who had brought it, which the colonel did not want to believe for a long time, etc. Now he took the letter and in the evening sent Captain Eckle, consulted on what they wanted to do with the letter; they decided that since I am the king's subject, the colonel, as the king's official, could well open my letters, wherever he got them, regardless of to whom they were addressed, etc.</p>
      <p>They opened the letter and then sealed it again as best they could and the next morning appointed someone, instructed him to deliver the letter to Kupferschmid's wife and not to say anything about the colonel, but to suggest that she should write back to me immediately; he had a certain message for me. Now it was revealed to Kupferschmid in the evening by a good friend, as it is known, since he sits by the city, how the colonel took a letter into his hands, which belonged to him, etc. When the person came with the letter and resolved the matter, they acted as if they knew or suspected nothing, and the lady immediately wrote back to me and gave him the letter, very poorly sealed, but the letter was so cleverly and artfully composed, etc. I think they also opened this letter, sealed it again, and gave it to someone to bring it here to Winterthur, lodged at the innkeeper at the Rössle, and sent me the letter and indicated that the one who brought the letter wanted to leave again in 2 hours, etc.; therefore, I should write immediately and send the letter to the Rössle. Now at that time, I had so much to do with other letters to Augsburg, which I had to finish quickly, that I told the messenger he could leave whenever he wanted; I could not write now, but would do so later in the day. Thus, they opened their mouths in vain, and nothing came of it. Oh, if I had known, I would have written such a good letter. See now, what kind of people they are and what they are dealing with; if other people did it, it would be villainy. But, thank God, they found nothing in the letter that would harm anyone; I had written to them about a house, that they might now come to Winterthur to buy or receive it, and how I would like them to be here too, and the like, etc. I had to show you this notable fraud and treachery.</p>
