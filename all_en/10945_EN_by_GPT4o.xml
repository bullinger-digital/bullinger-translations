    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only write now because of the Lausanne Disputation. The evaluation of the [Wittenberg] Articles by the Bern Synod, in which Calvin, [Pierre] Caroli, and Thomas Malingre also participated, is evident from the enclosed document; since a split would be dangerous, [the Concord] has not been rejected, but it is explicitly approved only within the framework of the interpretation given by the Strasbourg people.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask, dearest brothers, that you do not take offense at my delayed writing. I could not write to you sooner without leaving the matter unfinished. I spent and wore out twelve days in the Lausanne Disputation, which was most successful.</p>
      <p>On the night of the sixteenth of this month, our synod of parish priests, numbering three hundred, less four, was convened. Among them were several very learned men of the French language, namely Calvin, Doctor Caroli, Thomas Malingre, and some others. What our synod thinks of the Lutheran confession, and how the articles and Bucer's exposition of the same are approved, is testified by this present document of ours. It was received by our senate and people in the form we are sending to you. And certainly, if we had not seemed somewhat eager to foster concord, the Lutheran confession would have been entirely rejected by our synod, and that because of frequent ambiguities. For we must consider, as someone faithfully reminded us, not to separate and divide ourselves from the Swiss church. If, as he affirms, it is a matter of religion. I do not doubt that Luther, unless he does not wish to be a lover and pursuer of peace, will not reject our response. I think it is easy for you to understand on what our response is based, namely on the explanation or the testimony made in person by the brothers from Strasbourg regarding Luther. If he asserts that this is not his opinion, we have nothing to do with Luther and his confession. And thus we are out of danger. We wish to inform you of these things briefly, dearest brothers, and commend ourselves greatly to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 20th of October, year 36.</p>
      <p>Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Leo and Bullinger, his dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
