      <p>S. At the same hour, I received two letters from you, dearest lord and godfather, namely those sent by the courier, and another sent by another person. As for Naegelin, the consul, he is not in the city; he has gone to Culiacum ad Ripas, as they call it, for the grape harvest; however, I will send these letters to him immediately. I also saw your other letters sent to Mr. Nikolaus von Diesbach; but he too has gone with his whole family for the grape harvest.</p>
      <p>The council is very rarely in session; for besides the fact that the grape harvest has taken many away, the rest are now leaving with the new prefects.</p>
      <p>I think that tomorrow there will not be five or six who will not ride out, and some have already left, so that I do not know what response your council will receive from ours today. As far as I understand from your letters, our council is being urged by yours to send a delegation in the common name, which I fear ours will not do. People are otherwise not in good spirits; for the king is completely insane, and as we hear, he has refused even the queen's intercession.</p>
      <p>However, I will urge as much as I can, so that they do not fail in this pious work. There is no need to thank me for the cheese; for you have already repaid me a hundred times.</p>
      <p>As for the rumor that our people are going to bring aid to the French, it is nothing. Indeed, there are those who shout that the neighboring house is now on fire; but there are also those who oppose them with sound reasoning. Our people are indeed warned to be cautious, especially of Bollweiler, who is said to be leading an army through Burgundy and has already crossed into Strasbourg. Therefore, our people are preparing and keeping watch.</p>
      <p>There has also been action with the Burgundians, so that they remember the treaty, and the damage that will return to them from it. The Valaisans and Fribourgers have also acted with our people about jointly defending the new province.</p>
      <p>Some agitators have been captured and punished, but not with death. Letters have been sent to all the prefects to diligently inquire and note each individual who has gone into military service, and to transmit their names to our council. I hope that they will be duly punished.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to respond to your letters in haste. I will send Gribaldi's confession shortly.</p>
      <p>He has gone to Freiburg, ordered to leave this jurisdiction; from there he is acting through his family, so that he might at least quietly remain with his Fargias, though I do not know whether he will obtain this. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 25, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>What is it that Seneca mentions to Lucillus in book 15, which place you cite in Decade 2, sermon 1, chapter, about carrying linen and scrapers to the butcher and a mirror being held for Juno. I do not know what these ceremonies were like or where to seek their understanding.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
