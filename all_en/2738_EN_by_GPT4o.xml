      <p>S. I owe you great thanks, honorable compater (godfather), for receiving me so kindly and generously recently. Please do what you promised: thus, I will have some opportunity to repay you. However, I believe you have already understood from my brother how I returned to my people.</p>
      <p>I know you are curious about what is happening in Geneva, so here is a little about it. In the week I was in Zurich, they executed a fourth person, who, like all the previous ones, recanted everything he had previously professed or confessed before the execution, protesting that he had been forced to confess to being aware of Perrin's conspiracy by dire tortures and the hope of life promised to him if he confessed. He declared himself and Perrin innocent, stating that nothing of the sort had ever been discussed between them, and he now testifies this before the eternal judge, at whose tribunal he is about to stand. Nevertheless, he was beheaded. Reliable men also affirm that the tortures are more severe than those of Phalaris, used to extract confessions from the accused. Thus, hatred against them grows more and more every day. Perrin is here with others and continually protests his innocence. Our people would like to intervene. However, they refuse to change the sentence passed against them. They also say that they are buying provisions from everywhere, making it clear that they are preparing either for war or to endure a siege. Meanwhile, the Italian who had previously been brought here by them (as I told you) and accused Perrin and others of conspiring with the Duke of Alba to hand over Geneva to him, has been released by them. Since it appeared that the whole thing was fabricated by them, it was decided that the released Italian should be observed in our territory. Released by them, captured by our people, he has been brought here again as a captive of ours in recent days, from which many hope to learn astonishing things.</p>
      <p>Thus, things stand now. Meanwhile, the extension of the treaty is silent and does not proceed, hatreds grow, and I fear that unless someone intervenes, they will eventually erupt into open injuries.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have heard from good, wise, and prudent men that it would be good and beneficial if the people of Zurich and Basel jointly send a delegation and intervene as arbitrators to avoid scandal and greater danger, or at least offer their assistance through letters. There are those who hope that this would be very welcome to both parties: Therefore, according to your wisdom, communicate this with Mr. Lavater and other good men, and if it seems good, act so that such a thing is done without delay.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new otherwise. I am waiting to hear what you have from England. Musculus greets you. I ask you again to write to Maurice sometime. I told him you would do this; he replied that he would be very happy to consider you a friend. Therefore, as he is, you should comply. Farewell again with all yours, whom you will diligently greet in my name and that of mine. Bern, September 26, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable and dearest compater.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
