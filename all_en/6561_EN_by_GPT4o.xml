      <p>Revered Father.</p>
      <p>The question I proposed, I was not unaware of, nor were the things you wrote in the Decades unknown to me; but I precisely desired to have your response to the question because of certain individuals who are stubborn in this opinion, where once it was established that infants should not be baptized unless the sermon is concluded, this order should not be inverted, so that even if an infant dies during the sermon, the sermon should not be interrupted for the baptism, nor should it be done before the sermon or outside the time of the sermon; and in Geneva (to speak openly) this custom is observed.</p>
      <p>I argue that the command of God should not be transgressed for the sake of keeping the traditions of any men; but there is a command both to parents, to ensure infants are baptized, and to ministers, to baptize those who wish to be baptized and who are brought for baptism, and this command is given without any circumstance of time or place; the dead are not to be baptized now, but the living. Therefore, I do not see with what conscience I can, if an infant is brought who is at the point of death, pass by without baptizing, even if the sermon is not concluded, even if it is not the time of the sermon, especially since both the parents and the rest of the church are freed from this erroneous opinion that no one is saved unless baptized with water. I am not unaware that it is not a fraud in the meantime if one dies unbaptized; but it is a fault of the parents if they do not ensure baptism, and of the ministers if they do not baptize, for he transgresses no command, but we, who, to keep our tradition, neglect the command of Christ.</p>
      <p>I also approve of order in the church regarding place and time, when no other necessity urges us to act otherwise.</p>
      <p>Superstitions are also to be avoided, but the command of God should never be transgressed, nor do I approve of baptizing in the homes of parents if it can be done otherwise, but they should be brought to the temple outside of order when necessity demands, and baptism should be administered in the presence of some. This is my simple opinion, and I do not see how it can be disapproved.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there are those who so stubbornly hold onto certain customs of some churches that they cannot in any way depart from them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I now desire your letters, so that I might use them to... the truth. Everything else is going well, and we hope for success.</p>
      <p>The one we excommunicated for blasphemy against Christ and the Holy Spirit, as far as he denied the Spirit to be God, says he recognizes his error and asks for forgiveness. We did not want to reconcile him to the church so quickly, but we want to test for some time whether he has truly repented or not.</p>
      <p>For there are those who feign repentance because they fear the magistrate. Martinengo is in the Valtellina or, as Latin writers say, Volturena.</p>
      <p>Greetings to those who greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent father.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, October 23, 1565.</p>
      <p>I commend Friedrich to you; he will report the rest in person.</p>
      <p>Your Hieronymus Zanchus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church and most esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
