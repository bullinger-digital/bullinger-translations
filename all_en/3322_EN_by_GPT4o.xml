      <p>It is certainly written that three days before the defeat, the king sent three most cruel executioners throughout France, who would decide anything against the heretics without appeal, so that it would be clear to everyone how much he valued the prayers of the Swiss and Germans. He has as his advisor that one cardinal of Lorraine, a man, as I hear, of insatiable greed and cruelty, under whose auspices, despite the constable's resistance, last year's Italian expedition was also undertaken. He will lead the poor king into certain ruin, which would be bearable if the evil were not also to reach others and us as well. May the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ, eternally preserve us, taken into His protection!</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in every way venerable and most dear brother in Christ. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
