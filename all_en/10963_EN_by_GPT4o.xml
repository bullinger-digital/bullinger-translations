    <p xml:id="regest1">While others blame the people of Konstanz for staying away from the Basel meeting from November 12-14, there is no doubt about the goodwill of the people of Zurich. He is pleased with the agreement reached in Basel; he urgently warns against division and reminds of the legacy of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. The letter from Konstanz [to Luther] was also sent to St. Gallen and Lindau; only Leo [Jud] raised objections, but the ambiguities criticized are intended - for the sake of concord. Meanwhile, however, a letter from Capito, Bucer, Hedio, and Zell has arrived at the Konstanz council, which will rather hinder than promote the signing [of the Wittenberg Concord]. The people of Strasbourg provide an awkward explanation of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, demand that any letter to Luther be presented to them, claim full agreement between the Augsburg Confession and the Concord, and urge its unconditional acceptance. In particular, they attack Thomas [Blarer] and thereby endanger the success of Zwick's efforts. He asks for confidentiality and intercession.</p>

      <p>May the true salvation and peace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Although I know that some have taken our absence more harshly, we have no doubt about your fairness towards us.</p>
      <p>It pleases me greatly that you have reached an agreement in Basel. For nothing worried me as much as a schism among us. However, always resist evil temptations with great diligence and many sighs to God. For even if you agree among yourselves, I hear and know that the people of St. Gallen and Basel are ready for the current terms of concord, but not the others. You are not unaware of Satan's nature, who is entirely focused on stirring up discord among brothers and churches. Therefore, be prudent and encourage each other amicably and in a Christian manner. God cannot inflict a greater plague on you than to let you become divided, and it starts with a small displeasure until one gives the other entirely to the devil. I say this by no means to condemn concord with others, but so that you do not sell the peace of your churches for the concord of others. This is the one thing I always want to remind you of. Then consider this cause of concord carefully, not only for the sake of maintaining friendship among you, as I have already said, but also so that you do not commit anything that might seem or be inglorious to your most holy predecessors and teachers, Zwingli and Oecolampadius, of revered memory. The causes of death are irrelevant here. But you know how much good the Lord has done for your land through them. Therefore, be vigilant for this reason and pray.</p>
      <p>We also sent our response to St. Gallen and Lindau. Everyone is pleased. Only Leo [Jud] pointed out the objections of one or two places, and for this reason, his response is more acceptable to us than all the others. We thank you, Leo, dearest brother. But, as I testified in recent letters, we were obscure out of a certain zeal, for the love of concord.</p>
      <p>But what shall I say, dearest brothers? When we were ready to give Luther a response, which you have seen, behold, letters come to our entire council from Capito, Bucer, Hedio, and Zell, in which they try to urge him to subscribe to the articles. However, they did this with such arguments that they could not have more effectively deterred him from subscribing. They write to the council that, if anything (perhaps without his knowledge) has been done secretly until now, they should now hear the whole matter from their letters. But thanks to the Lord, nothing has ever been done of which the entire council was not aware.</p>
      <p>Then they explain the cause of concord, especially concerning the Eucharist, but in such a way that hardly one or two could understand. For they love clarity, and they are entirely convinced that the institution of the Lord's Supper is not something to be believed, but also to be understood.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they ask that nothing be given or written to Luther by us that they have not seen beforehand.</p>
      <p>They also threaten that grave consequences await us unless we accept the articles. They testify that the words and sentences of the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Articles are the same. They deny any concord unless we simply and unconditionally subscribe to the drafted articles.</p>
      <p>And what is most serious of all, they specifically slander our Thomas, Ambrosius's brother, as the author of the refusal to subscribe so far, and that everything concerning our church is lost if anything from his mind is written to Luther. What they have achieved with their writing, they will well experience in time. I have always done my best and turned everything to the best, and we have prepared the response with great heartache and always thought we would come out well. But I fear it is already halfway out. So they wanted to present the matter to an entire council through their writing and thought it was only Thomas Blarer's or my brother's matter, and when it came before an entire council, it would still go through. But it has fallen far short. Those are bad, bad counsels that prepare the way for internal strife. But we, by the grace of Christ, will hold together more strongly than ever before. Oh, how many sighs must Christ be invoked with, so that he does not abandon his church!</p>
      <p>I will not add anything else now. I wanted to pour this into your bosom. For there is no one in the world with whom I can share everything more safely. But let these things remain with you. And pray diligently for us.</p>
      <p>Now the letters must be given to the messenger. Farewell, therefore, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Last day of November 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Zwick. Forgive the unpolished letters.</p>
