      <p>Greetings. Your letters, reverend father and lord, were very welcome to me, even though they were delivered late. You sent them to the past spring fairs along with two booklets of your writings (for which I give immense thanks), one of which was in German and complete, the other in Latin missing a quire of pages, which I completed by writing, having obtained a copy with some difficulty from a friend who diligently concealed it and often denied having it due to fear and the tyranny of our papists, who are now attempting to restore the papacy by stealth. For they try to claim for themselves alone the church's judgment on doctrines, which they prohibit from being read, and the election of ministers, if any have died, rejecting veterans and experienced ones if they are promoted to ministry (as happened recently) as suspect (for it suffices for them to say this) and substituting novices still immature and very young (provided they swear not to become Calvinists) and countless other things of this kind. They also harass me in astonishing ways, as you will see from the copies of letters to the illustrious senate of Hamburg and Lüneburg, if you have time to read such things.</p>
      <p>The cause and origin of this enmity is as follows: A few years ago, our local theologians here introduced a new doctrine about Christ's descent into hell, first authored by the reverend lord Dr. Johannes Aepinus, the superintendent of the Hamburg church of blessed memory, who was otherwise not a bad man, but endowed with a gentle and placable nature, unless he was driven by the vehement instigator Joachim Westphal, that glorious and restless brawler. While all the other preachers of the word were silent like inert dogs, dazed by the authority of the doctor and not barking at the wolves attacking Christ's fold, this pestilent doctrine soon infected almost all the neighboring cities and then began to spread through the regions as quickly as possible, not without much harm to pious souls.</p>
      <p>To this, only one minister of the word of God in the Hamburg church of the lowest condition, namely the chaplain, as they call him, at St. Peter's, Master Tylomannus Eppingus of Münster, an elderly, pious, and solidly learned man, opposed himself, first privately once and again secretly admonishing the doctor in his house very amicably, then also publicly before the college of colleagues, and finally, when he could make no progress anywhere, writing to the illustrious senate, a copy of which writing (which is completely suppressed here) I send to you, collated with the original by the author himself of pious memory.</p>
      <p>As the contention grew stronger and the fight became more intense, Dr. Johannes Draconites, a vigorous defender of that doctrine, who was then living in Lübeck, joined Aepinus, intending to bring in reinforcements besides our locals. And since almost the entire city and many of the nobles were struck by the authority of Dr. Aepinus and Eppingus was despised by everyone because of his humble ministry as if excommunicated, I, moved by indignation at the fact, consoled the afflicted venerable old man and also brought back to the right path one of the most ardent defenders of Aepinus, namely the pastor of the church of St. James, Master Johannes Garzaeus, a pious and learned man, but too trusting in the authority of the doctor, by opposing to him what is written in the letter to my dearest brother about Christ's descent into hell, a copy of which your humanity has long had.</p>
      <p>Then, having considered the cause more deeply and recognized the truth, he suddenly became from a defender of the infernal doctrine its most vehement opponent, just as Saul once became Paul, for which he was also removed from his position as was Eppingus. For obedience brings friends, truth brings hatred, and from this a great envy was also stirred up against me by all the infernal enthusiasts. To this was finally added this: When the Anglican church was miserably exiled, which in the dead of winter arrived from Denmark through the rough sea to Lübeck, intending to winter there among Christian brothers until they could travel more comfortably with pregnant women and infants under a milder sky, then a great storm suddenly arose against them (whom the sea had spared) in all the churches, where they were publicly proclaimed as Anabaptists and most harmful people. But I, who was also there at the time, moved by their affliction, voluntarily presented myself as their intercessor with the superintendent of Lübeck. Then I also became a beggar for their poor and, having collected some money, relieved the poverty of the poor as much as I could, committing a great sin. From this, this corollary was added to me, that shortly after the English exiles were driven out of Hamburg, Joachim Westphal, the foremost of the infernal enthusiasts, instituted an inquiry against me as an inquisitor of heretical depravity, by which he would render me suspect in religion as not thinking candidly and finally also expel me from the city, and this not only because of the English or their doctrine (which he nevertheless wanted to appear), but because he understood that I did not favor his infernal doctrine (which he promoted with the greatest zeal and also took care to have it multiplied by the press and made public at his own expense and effort) but rather the sound and orthodox doctrine of the most learned and pious man Eppingus about Christ's descent into hell.</p>
      <p>Therefore, reverend father, I ask that through your most learned colleagues, or others who may seem convenient to your humanity, you would procure that this not unlearned writing of Eppingus be published, corrected by your judgment and illustrated with notes to the glory of the infernal enthusiasts (which they alone seek as once Herostratus), so that our distinguished master, the defender of the Saxon churches and the inquisitor and reformer of all Germany appointed by himself, may shine like a polished Eck, so that Germany may finally understand what kind of inquisitors and reformers it now has.</p>
      <p>And if only these things were published not only in Latin but also in German; then it would be over for Westphal, whom the people hate and the magistrates do not love, but they are forced to endure him because he has a prescription for his church for the days of his life, which he has rendered completely desolate, so that it is commonly said: "The pastor in the deserted church." He alone dared to protest before the senate, when Aepinus of blessed memory remitted the infernal cause, that he would indeed be quiet for the sake of the magistrate, but would not yield the cause. This can be seen in the second decade of the Psalms recently published by Aepinus, where concerning Psalm 16: "They eliminate many enthusiastic things as if to obey the senate, but in the marginal note they refer to ancient errors" etc.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while I free myself from the Westphalian inquiry by appealing to the senate, another intrigue is secretly woven for me in Lüneburg, undoubtedly by those (even if they dissemble) who have always wanted me destroyed, but have never dared to accuse me openly and have finally achieved in Lüneburg what they could never have done in Hamburg, perhaps because the Lord wishes to test our insignia, whether they are sufficiently fortified by the emperor's diplomas, of which I send you some images for friends who greet me from time to time, so that there may be some memory of me with them. Although that cross of infamy, pressed deep into the innermost parts, weighs much more heavily than the one that is the ornament of a helmet, indeed more than the many losses I have suffered shortly amounting to 400 marks of Lübeck. Nevertheless, I trust in the Lord's blessing that this ignominy inflicted on me will turn into glory, not mine, but the Lord's. Farewell and pray for me to the Lord that he may grant me true Christian patience; for these are the beginnings of greater things to come, and unless the Lord works patience within and in the heart by his spirit, signs and images are in vain, and whatever man can do.</p>
      <p>But you, reverend father, take care to always be like yourself, maintaining decorum in the gentleness of spirit, by which you will undoubtedly edify much, meanwhile allowing others to treat with dignity him who also publicly gnaws at your modesty as hypocritical, biting everyone like a rabid dog. For him, reviling is a game: thus he is wont to play with a certain marvelous metamorphosis, making from a noble Polish baron a horrid bear, from Bullinger a bull, from Calvin a calf, and saying: The Bull from Zurich and the Calf from Geneva as well as the Polish Bear ride through the Lord's vineyard etc. What the noble and generous baron Mr. John a Lasco, and also the reverend father and lord Bernardino Ochino, and Mr. John Calvin have written against our Westphalian Minotaur I have not yet been able to see. For it is not allowed to sell these things publicly among us: but what Schnepf, Greek-Latin, indeed neither Latin nor Greek but like a chattering jackdaw without sense, has vomited against you, these are esteemed among us.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Hamburg, August 20, in the year etc. 1556.</p>
      <p>Greet my colleagues, brothers, and friends in my name most dutifully and do not offend my fellow believers.</p>
      <p>Your reverend humanity's most devoted little client, Baptist Johannes Wisamer, subscribes. The Hamburg Senate is still deliberating on what they will answer me; however, the holy fathers delay them. The Lüneburgers have twice returned my entire letters unread through two citizens; but I will send them a third time through a prince. The superintendent of Lüneburg is a great friend of Westphal and a most zealous student of the infernal doctrine; his relative, the executioner, expelled me from the city of Lüneburg.</p>
      <p>To the reverend father and lord Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and superintendent of the church of Zurich, his lord.</p>
