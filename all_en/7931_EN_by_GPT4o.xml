      <p>Caelius Secundus Curio sends greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I will not now take upon myself to describe to you, most excellent and venerable brother and lord, the most unworthy things that have been done in recent days by certain men against those who think rightly, and also against your church and school, which have been noted, and have been agitated in sermons even more than in tribunals by persons certainly unworthy of them; but you will hear the same more conveniently from the one who delivered these letters to you, who is very well known to you, and who is sent to you for this reason.</p>
      <p>Therefore, now I will do nothing else but ask you to have the same faith in his speech as you would have in all good men, who in this city think with you, and to be willing to assist him in those things which he will ask of you (he will ask nothing, however, that is not for the glory of God and the benefit of the good), so that hypocrisy may not be able to elude, obscure, corrupt, and hinder truth, light, and goodness, which it strives to do in every way. But the one caution of all these things, and it is most necessary, is that they be communicated with a few and those most trustworthy, lest they be made public to their detriment and hindrance. Know that I am of the same mind towards you as an old man, as I was when I was a young man, when we were first received and refreshed by you from Italy as if from a shipwreck; for then I was in my fortieth year, now in my sixty-sixth, indeed short, if we consider the speed of time, long, if we wish to regard the exile from that heavenly homeland, to which pious faith longs, and the evils with which we have been exercised.</p>
      <p>But your age, dearest brother, how far it is from mine, and how you bear that most praiseworthy old age of yours, I long to know; for as far as the funerals of our dearest ones are concerned, we seem almost equal, except that God has preserved for me a most loving wife, and I pray that He may preserve her, while He has transferred yours, outstanding in piety. Let us pray to that heavenly Father and His eternal Son, that He may have mercy on us and preserve our remnants, and when the hour comes, that we too may willingly and gladly obey the author of life when we must depart from this fragile tabernacle.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my lord and ever to be honored brother, with all yours. Basel, July 23, 1569.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most upright Antistes of the Zurich church, most honorable lord and brother.</p>
