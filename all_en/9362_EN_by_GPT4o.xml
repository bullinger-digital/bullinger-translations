      <p>The true and splendid will, which you have abundantly and tirelessly demonstrated in adorning and protecting our Sarmatian churches, has aroused in the minds of all the pious a singular benevolence towards you. Nor indeed have you refused in these times to provide the best advice to our wavering affairs and to clearly and necessarily remind many of what is of great interest for our public salvation to know and follow. Therefore, unless we were well convinced of your candor and piety, we would hardly dare, without shame and embarrassment, to ask you to continue the care you have had for these Polish churches, even though cloudy times may be approaching. As in previous years they have been devastated by heresies, perhaps in the following times they expect storms of persecution in a certain fatal way. But may God, in His ineffable mercy, grant better things. Therefore, continue to support and sustain these churches in these regions with your most fruitful and salutary letters. And although some suffer from the most disgraceful crime of apostasy, yet the greater part of better mind thanks you, among whom we, along with the most faithful servants of Christ, thank you for your letters, so that some of us also strongly wish to gratify you.</p>
      <p>The outcome of our diet in electing a new king has deceived the opinion of many, not only yours, I say, but also ours, that is, of all good people. For before the appointed day arrived, we observed the variety of minds and different pursuits with many suitors on all sides wooing this Polish bride.</p>
      <p>But no good man would have ever believed that the pursuits of the parties had taken such deep roots in the hearts of our people, and we believed that the factious, if there were any, could be brought into order and restrained by the authority of great men and other good people. And when the orators of the candidates, who, if only they had all been candid, began to appear on the stage and were heard in order in the public theater of the nobility, then it became apparent, to the astonishment of all good people, the phalanx of the French faction. In the beginnings of repressing it, we and many other most diligent and vigorous men did what we could, so that it seemed to be extinguished and to rest. But like a gangrene, it secretly crept into the minds of many, so that when we thought everything was buried or repressed, behold, in that week, when the serious business of creating a king began, that phalanx and hidden faction, stirred by some evil genius, erupted, which had seemed to lie hidden throughout the entire diet, to play its part, to boast threats and arms with full cheeks, and to contrive every infamy. In restraining the furies of these men, many great men diligently exerted their efforts, and would that those enchanted by Circe's cup, who wanted to hold the first place, had never helped their inclined wall and supported it with their shoulders like Atlases, it would have collapsed and their impetus would have vanished into smoke and light breezes. But that Satan, who is never accustomed to be absent from his work, often attacks those who occupy the chief place and the higher pinnacle of honors in the republic with snares and frauds, so that afterwards the greatest crowd of the common people, who are led more quickly by example than by reason, follows their examples and thus, most disgracefully undermined, perishes utterly. Then God afflicts the hypocrites and dissemblers with just reward, while He makes them, even unwittingly, to make a pact with the sworn enemies of Christ and to follow their banners, until at last they fall into certain destruction with the impious. We have not seen the image and shadow of the levity of our nation in these diets, but the thing itself, with our utmost sorrow.</p>
      <p>Those who throughout the winter, having heard of that monstrous and ferocious crime perpetrated against the law of nations, detested that furious French deed, soon in this public assembly allowed themselves to be captivated by the song of the Sirens, that is, of Monluc, and embraced the same one whom they had previously cursed. O vain and most frivolous judgments of men, let us, I pray, pour out this grief and bitterness of mind into your bosom and testify to our anxieties and torments of mind. Indeed, to confess the truth, while we saw this fearful metamorphosis, we died a thousand times daily from the indignity of the matter. But in vain were our pains, our admonitions, and the intrepid voices of many magnates, especially of our Cracovian palatine, for defending the fatherland and religion, in vain, I say, were all these things done, with the adversary party, in blind impulse, not yielding anything of its obstinacy. Therefore, with all good citizens having suffered violence, Henry of Anjou was proclaimed King of Poland. How fortunate and auspicious this will be, all prudent and pious people inquire with forced tears, and undoubtedly, as you touched upon in your letters, it was given in anger and fury to punish our crimes.</p>
      <p>Indeed, because you have satisfied our wishes in writing, you have shown that our affairs are dear to you, and we would have obeyed your advice if matters had been intact, as we also responded to the Genevan brothers, who did not want to be absent from this business, having sent us a most excellent and well-equipped man. But after the feast, as it is said, he arrived to us, so that he who perhaps could have been of use if he had come in time, now seems to do nothing but reopen our wound with his arrival. For, instructed by such warnings, it was not permissible to undertake anything, indeed, we did not want to make his arrival known to anyone except a very few, with the greatest part of our people already inclined towards Henry after that election and suffering from fickle levity. Hence it happened that we could not assist this good man as we would have liked, and we barely provided him with a hundred florins, which they call Rhenish, and also added a good riding horse, so much have matters been reduced to straits. Moreover, those who have any faith are rare among the many who are sufficiently conspicuous for their futility and vanity. However, it was not very prudent to prepare danger for him and for you and for us and for the city from which he was sent. For here with us, the first wisdom is not to say anything to anyone indiscriminately or to everyone, as the proverb goes. Moreover, because our people are rich and very generous in promises, we consider the sinews of prudence, as Epicharmus used to say, to be, if not to believe everyone, at least to believe a few very well-tested ones. Thus, we cannot help those most excellent and pious men who are undeservedly exiled, if the times would allow, but the monetary situation here is difficult, partly because few are affected by the piety that would befit, partly also because many adversaries, with things thus changed, can not only be offended but also think something else sinister. However, if this good Frenchman has contracted some debt on our account, we will make an effort in the future to have it paid, and then we will assist the brothers' poverty, God willing, we will only wait for the opportunity.</p>
      <p>But I return to the French arts by which they have sought this kingdom. It cannot be said how varied and cunning Monluc has been in his legation, who, to praise his own, was accustomed not only to belittle but also to criticize others. And although his tricks were detected, we could not restrain many who were rushing.</p>
      <p>For this reason, as we touched upon above, with the good oppressed, the sought prey fell into Monluc's snares. However, it was provided by the magnates and nobility, especially by oath, mutual treaties, and certain laws and conditions, that the liberties and laws of the fatherland should not suffer any harm from a foreign prince. May all these things be ratified and firm and not be violated and corrupted by stratagems. Finally, as a supplement, so that our duty might not be lacking to the French churches, conditions and certain articles were conceived to calm and pacify the most afflicted state of those churches. All these things the French envoys have received in good faith to be fulfilled.</p>
      <p>Indeed, at this time, our envoys and legates are on the verge of a journey to France, who, when they arrive there, will deal with all these matters. And indeed, if I had seen it to be in the interest of the churches to go to France, I would have joined them, but because my mind predicts otherwise and taught by the examples of former times that all things are attempted in vain with such princes, I have decided to refrain. From these things, therefore, you can understand what the future state of our kingdom and our churches, afflicted by various changes, will be, yet we earnestly ask you, by your piety, with which you have always embraced us northern peoples, to pray unceasingly to the most good and great God for this kingdom and our churches, that He may not inflict deserved punishments for our crimes, but may deal mercifully with us, that He may not allow the assemblies of the pious to be dispersed or abolished and buried by some tyranny or excessive lethargy, but rather grant a new heart to the prince and the same mind to the magnates and inhabitants of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>But to other private matters, leaving aside our public ones. We have received the news of the death of the most excellent, most humane, and most learned man, Johannes Wolphius, and that not without great sorrow, because not only have we lost a friend who deserved well of the church and all the pious, if it is to lose to be transferred from this perishable world to eternal glory, but also because not only one school, but the whole assembly of the pious has been deprived of a most illustrious organ and faithful servant of Christ. We know that the deaths of the pious and most useful men are signs of God's wrath against the human race. Thus, finally, the Lord also calls to Himself His own from this fragile prison, lest they be too affected by the sight of dreadful calamities, and those whom He knows to be more steadfast, He often leaves surviving to a happy old age, that they may be witnesses of God's judgments and strengthen the weaker with their constancy. Therefore, we bear the death of the most useful man with a rather unjust mind, yet we come to the hope that Jesus Christ, the pastor and architect of His church, will provide another in place of that illustrious deceased man, both for you and for us, who will also help this wild and latest age of the world with his studies.</p>
      <p>In particular, dearest Lord Bullinger, I thank you for the booklet on the French atrocity, which will be a perpetual and indelible disgrace, which I received from you in recent months. Indeed, if many had not been of a light mind, that booklet and many other things shown to them on this subject could not only have turned our people from their purpose but perhaps also the Laestrygonians. But what can you do with those who rush to their own destruction? May God avert that omen. I have received other booklets as most welcome tokens of your love towards me, all of which I will in turn try to repay and reciprocate with every kind of service. For this reason, most illustrious men and most revered teachers, we will put an end to this abundance of words, but as I believe necessary, and we ask you in general to consider us, as you do, your most loving and devoted, and to commend our patrons, who still stand firm, and the faithful servants and ministers of the church and our churches, waiting for the hand of God, to the prayers of your divine clemency. Meanwhile, we will pray to God that He may make you and your churches abound in every kind of happiness, protect and preserve you from all danger...</p>
      <p>Given at Kraków, 10th of the calends of July 1573. Your most devoted and observant Andreas Prażmowski, pastor of the church of God gathered in Kraków. Christoph Thretius in his own name and in the name of the absent Paul Gilovius.</p>
