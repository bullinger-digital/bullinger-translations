      <p> Greetings. First, I am very glad to hear that you, my most kind lord Bullinger and brother, whom I always hold in high regard, are in good health despite your venerable old age, and that you still wish to depart and be with Christ. For this gives me hope that the Lord will allow you to preside over the church of Zurich for a long time yet; it indicates that you are dead to the world and live for God. </p>
      <p> Secondly, there was no need for you to excuse your silence so diligently; for I have never interpreted it as anything other than busyness, and it would be a great imposition if I were to impose upon you the necessity of replying, so that if you did not, I would consider you to be at fault and worthy of accusation. May this be far from me. </p>
      <p> As for me, the same thing happened that the poet said: "Love is full of anxious fear." Regarding my dialectical work, I am very glad that it is approved by you, most learned and orthodox men, and I am convinced that you will support its publication (if you can). But if it does not succeed in this due to the tyranny of suppressors, it will succeed in other things, which will not fall into their hands, but can be published by you and judged by you, and not by them. For they lie in wait for my reputation and my life, as Mr. Oporinus recently confessed to knowing, and Mr. Wyßenburg, when consulted by me, almost indicated the same. Therefore, if I cannot obtain from the academy that it be completed here as it has begun to be printed, another time must be awaited and not sent elsewhere, as some thought, lest they often find a stick to beat me with. For I am a thorn in their eyes, which if they could remove and cast away, they would not hesitate, and for this reason, they oppose all my honest callings with such great efforts, hoping that some occasion will be offered to banish me with disgrace; they certainly do not seem willing to allow me to be freed from this captivity with honor. However, the Lord is merciful and powerful and knows how to mock the enemies of His own excellently; He has given me this mind, that from day to day I am less terrified by their schemes and threats. To Him be glory and grace forever and ever. Amen. Mr. Wyßenburg, Oporinus, and Batmann, and I with my whole family, have received your prayer for the beginning of the year with the most grateful heart and wish for you and all yours both the present year and all future ages to be most happy. Amen. Farewell well in the Lord. </p>
      <p> Basel, January 18, in the year of human salvation 1568. Yours entirely from the heart, Johannes Hospinianus. </p>
      <p> To the venerable father and truly wise theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his honorable lord and brother. Zurich. </p>
