      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. A young man from Freiburg has spent some time with us dedicating himself to studies. The administrators in our monastery tolerated him among the servants and carters for a while, providing him with food, albeit rather poorly and sparingly, yet free of charge. However, now they prefer to spend the church's resources on hunting dogs and jesters rather than on students. Therefore, since he has no means to live, he has decided to move there, relying on the good hope that your kindness will be of assistance to him, so that he can devote himself to good studies and piety. As far as I know, he conducted himself quite honorably with us. And since he is now about to leave, he asked us for letters of recommendation. We therefore pray on his behalf that you may extend a helping hand to him, so that he may feel that our prayers have found favor with you.</p>
      <p>There are many reports among us, but they are so trivial that it would be annoying to mention them. I want to inform you of this one thing: Melchior Ramsauer has recently married the widow Anna Muntprat of Eberhard von Fulach, much to the amazement of the people, but even more to the indignation of her two daughters, Margaretha and Barbara, as she has weakened her nobility through this marriage.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and I beg you not to cease loving me in return, as I am most affectionate towards you. My fellow ministers greet you. Please convey my greetings to Theodor "Redbeard" Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, etc.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Schaffhausen, in the year 1545, on the 5th day before the calends of November.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and dearest brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
