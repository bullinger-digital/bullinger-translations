    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas is very grateful that Bullinger helped him during the bottleneck that arose during the printing. Here are some copies of the story of [Juan] Diazâ€™s [murder]. What does Bullinger say about it? He should distribute the other copies among the colleagues to whom Enzinas cannot write individually. The booklets (signatures) are intended for Theodor [Bibliander]. The small package should be sent to St. Gallen at the next opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is not true that the tyrant [Charles V] has fled, as was claimed. Let him die if he does not repent! For if he stays in the camp in this weather, he will probably not be able to fight at all next year.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enzinas has heard of a peace agreement. Does Bullinger know anything about it?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The news about Duke Maurice [of Saxony] and the Bohemians is unfortunately all too true! If only Philipp [Melanchthon] were here! Then Enzinas would not worry so much, even if he otherwise regrets the situation [in Saxony].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] If he finds the time for it at Christmas, he wants to visit Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enclosed are the [transcripts of the] decrees [of the first three sessions] of the Council of Trent. As soon as they are printed, he will also send copies of them. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. D. I owe you much, most learned Bullinger, for you alone provided help during the bottleneck of the printing. I now send you the story of Diaz, about which I would gladly hear your judgment. Distribute the remaining copies among the brothers, to whom I could not write individually. The booklets are separately intended for Mr. Theodor. You will send the small package to St. Gallen, and the one you have there to me, I ask, at the first opportunity.</p>

      <p>There was a persistent rumor about our tyrant having fled, but later it turned out to be false. May he perish if he does not wish to repent. For if he remains in the camp in this weather, perhaps he will not be able to fight next year.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I overheard something about the conditions of peace. If you have anything, share it. I will do the same if I learn anything first.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What we have heard so far about Maurice and the Bohemians from the widespread rumor is all too true. If Philipp were with us, I would not worry so much about the rest, although I also grieve for other reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If I can free myself around the Christmas festival, perhaps I will visit you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I return the decrees of Trent and am grateful. I will also send the printed ones when they are completed.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>26th of November, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop in the church of God, which is in Zurich.</p>
