    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger made a witty remark [with his handwritten dedication in Lelio Capilupi's "De vita monachorum"] about Gast gaining the Abbot [of Murbach, Johann Rudolf Stör von Störenburg] as a godfather. However, Gast has thus paved the way for the Gospel. - Gast sends [“De natura deorum gentilium commentarius”] by Cornutus. [Nikolaus] Gerbel's introduction to the map of Greece [by Sophianos] is not yet finished. Bullinger should inform Gast of the price [of the volumes printed by Christoph Froschauer, which contain the Latin translation of the German] writings of Zwingli. He is interested in how [the people of Zurich] have arranged Zwingli's writings. He will soon send the catalog with the foreign books [available in Basel]. - [Charles V] is traveling in northern Germany. At the Diet [in Worms] there are [only] a few bishops, abbots, and princes. The Spanish army is heading towards Vienna; a future sacrifice for [Sultan Suleiman I]. - [P.S.:] Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], whom Gast will write to soon.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>With this little book, you cleverly mock my fortune, that I have taken the Abbot, a pious, learned, and humane man, as a godfather. However, I know that on this occasion I have opened the door to the Gospel, whatever others may say or write.</p>
      <p>I am sending the book by Cornutus and will soon indicate the price. The introduction by Gerbel to the description of Greece is not yet printed, indeed not yet completed by the author.</p>
      <p>I would like you to indicate the price of Zwingli's works, but I already have some, namely the prophets and the volume that contains what is included in the New Testament. If the printer would sell the rest separately and you would indicate the price to me, I would consider what I should do. I have everything else in German, but I would also like to have them in Latin and to see the order you have observed. I will soon send the catalog of the books brought in along with some others. They say the Emperor is moving in Lower Germany. At the Diet, there are some bishops and abbots and one or two princes. The Spanish army is heading towards Vienna, a sweet morsel for the Turks.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 22, 1545.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor for me, to whom I will write shortly. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his special friend. Zurich.</p>
