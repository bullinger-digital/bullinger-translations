      <p>Greetings, venerable father in Christ. I have entered the same struggle to rescue my family from that Egypt, in which I was a year ago, and I sent letters to Casellas 15 days ago for this purpose, so that it may be conducted seriously and more cautiously, as the Landgrave promised me in his letters three months ago. Today I received letters from Lord Johannes Sleidanus from Strasbourg, in which he says that the Swiss can greatly assist me with their authority and favor with the king.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I had begun to attempt this before the 20th of the month by going to Bern; but I heard then that they were offended by the French king. Therefore, I began other plans, which have not yet progressed. The only reason for leaving Strasbourg (where I had been received) was that it was not beneficial. I would not want to attempt anything with the Swiss lords without first consulting you, if it seems right to you. Many other serious reasons have also arisen. Hence, I am more among hostile people than in the church; for I do not wish to participate, lest I consent to the schism, nor do I wish to reject your holy churches (with which I have communicated and with which I always remain in spirit) in any way. I agreed to participate if the error of ubiquity is abandoned and your holy churches are recognized with the schism removed, and not otherwise, as I also wrote to the duke in my own hand. However, if I wanted to desist from attacking the papacy, even if I never entered a temple, as if they were of no religion, I would easily act. Yet, I do not attack the papacy unless my duty requires it, such as when papist schools are proposed in the senate or when they want to promote doctors and masters with apostolic authority. Then I openly rise up, as I did on the 9th of May and the 24th of this month. Twice they have protested against me for all the damage to the university, yet I do not desist, as I also wrote to the prince, who did not respond nor hinder me, but neither did he assist. I recently wanted to rent a residence; but it was denied to me for the express reason that I attack the papacy. Several times, even 5 and 4 months ago, the prince wrote that a house should be rented to me, nor were they lacking; but they always found excuses to exclude me, nor did they obey the prince. About this matter, I have also often complained bitterly in my letters to the court and achieved nothing. Finally, on the first of this month, the prince replied that he could not provide me with a house of my own, even one rented by me. There is indeed a shortage, but not so much for me, a primary professor of law, unless others fear that I might draw scholars and many into my opinion against the schism, others that the papacy might be more oppressed, nor do they conjecture wrongly.</p>
      <p>I have fallen into so many troubles while striving for the rescue of my family; otherwise, I would have stayed in Strasbourg or Marburg. Three months ago, I wrote to my wife that, if an opportunity arises, she should not cross the Rhine; for then it would be better for my expenses to be in Geneva or Neuchâtel than here with great stipends. I beg through Christ, that if you can advise with your counsel, do not omit it. That Johannes Tufanus, the teacher of the Narbonne College in Paris (about whom I had written to you for the patrician boy) left Paris at Easter. My wife placed my son in the Harcourt College, where the air is very beautiful.</p>
      <p>But in place of Tufanus, Lord Ribosus, the tutor of Lord Rambouillet's sons, a nobleman who greatly favors us, or Mercerius, learned in Hebrew, both from Narbonne and pious, as one mathematician who recently came here from Paris told me, succeeded. Farewell. May the grace and peace of the Lord always be with you; I commend myself and that pious and arduous business to your prayers and those of your church. I wish to greet Lord Bibliander, whose Esdras I greatly delight in, the venerable Lord Pellicanus, Lord Zwingli, your son-in-law Lord Lavater, and others.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, the last day of July 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours and most observant, Charles du Moulin, in my own hand, because I dared not trust anyone here with the aforementioned matters.</p>
      <p>I fear that the schismatics have already spread a sinister rumor about me to the princes, to whom I recently wrote for the liberation of my family.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt, Johannes Murellus, a Spaniard, formerly an old Sorbonne acquaintance of mine, who ten years ago defended the Sorbonne (while I was attacking it) with difficulty, later converted, then expelled from England, has been preaching in French since the 18th of April.</p>
      <p>If the Lord grants me sons, I will teach them not only jurisprudence most excellently, but also the most open means of attacking both the papacy and the said schism; I came to the academy to provide the same to the listeners; but while a house is denied, I am frustrated for the most part; for I would teach more at home... (since I do nothing else).</p>
      <p>I wanted to attract printers here, and there were two ready; but everything would have had to be managed at my own expense alone, neither the academy nor anyone else wanted to help.</p>
      <p>To the most pious doctor of the Church of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
