    <p xml:id="regest1">[Bucer] reports from Schmalkalden: The eleven theologians gathered there do not want any agreements on religion and church property unless there is consensus on the fundamental issues of doctrine. The Duke of Guelders [Wilhelm von Jülich] remains steadfast while Emperor [Charles V] holds court in Ghent; the Duke believes he need not fear France and is supported by England. Although the Emperor has been friendly to the Schmalkaldic envoys, he cannot be trusted, and the Pope does not want the religious question to be resolved by the Imperial Estates; [Matthias] Held may soon fail. The English King [Henry VIII] is open to dialogue; writings on the disputed issues are being sent to him. The Emperor wants to meet with several kings and may soon take action against [the German Protestants]. In Ghent, 25 prisoners were executed; Wilhelm von Fürstenberg has become an abbot, and Duke Heinrich of Brunswick seems to want to provoke a war with his latest polemic.

      <p>Greetings. From Schmalkalden, these are the reports: Philipp Melanchthon, Johannes Bugenhagen (Pomeranus), Justus Jonas, and Cruciger from Saxony, three from Hesse, two from the lower cities, one from Duke Heinrich of Saxony, eleven with Martin Bucer are in Schmalkalden. They agree that nothing should be negotiated regarding religion or church property unless with those who accept the doctrine of justification, the true use of the sacraments, and the keys, nor will they concede anything that detracts from the purity of faith or Christian liberty. However, the assembly is not easily expected, and the Emperor seems to be planning serious actions. The spirits of all who stand by the Gospel are firm and vigilant against the vigilant enemies.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Guelders, standing by his black (we do not know what this means), will not fail in the promises by which he has taken the people of Guelders into his trust. The Emperor is holding court in Ghent and has already imprisoned 50; however, the people have not yet been disarmed. It is believed that the King of France has denied the Emperor aid against Guelders. The Duke of Suffolk, an Englishman, has gone to the French King with great pomp in the name of his king and has been received with royal magnificence, so we shall see what the French King can do for everyone. The King of England has sent a considerable sum of money to his ally, the Duke of Guelders.</p>
      <p>The envoys of the princes have been heard by the Emperor; he has not yet responded, but he will respond shortly. He promised through Scherper a reasonable (appropriate) answer. This clemency is interpreted as feigned, and they fear it may be so because of the Turk as well.</p>
      <p>He seems very reluctant to promise the same, that the states should meet and seriously consult about religion. They say the Pope fears the truth and the consensus of the estates.</p>
      <p>Therefore, everything is hindered by the Emperor. They also think that Held will fall into the pit he has dug.</p>
      <p>The Englishman further offers a disputation in writing and in person. Four writings are prepared, which will be sent: On marriage, the mass, both kinds, and vows. On the first of April, they decided to meet the Emperor, the French King, Ferdinand, and the Scots. There are four whom the Emperor's men threaten: the English, the Danes, the people of Guelders, and us. In the court, little is said about us, perhaps because we are the first designated for war. Therefore, the people should be urged to repentance and prayers.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Emperor has executed 25 prisoners on the wheel. He denied their friends burial. Wilhelm, Count of Fürstenberg, has become an abbot. The name of the abbey has completely escaped me. War is feared, so insolently has Heinrich, Duke of Brunswick, acted in a public pamphlet against the Elector and Hesse. I hear they have said they will avenge the injury not with words but with action. It seems to me that this was done deliberately by the Brunswickian in the presence of the Emperor, so that our people might start the war; for all their plans have been directed here so far. Come, we have learned and teach that the kingdom, power, and glory belong to the Lord forever and ever; let us hold on to this. May the Lord grant that, however we are attacked, we are ready.</p>
      <p>I am sending you and Theodor another disputation. I thought I would make Theodor laugh, but good God, how I see everything not as serious as necessary to know. Do you think the Christian life can exist without such disputations? You will remind your people, whom you sent here, to devote diligence equal to utility here, if they wish to one day confront the Papists.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children, and with Theodor and Pellican. Basel, April 6, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be respected.</p>
