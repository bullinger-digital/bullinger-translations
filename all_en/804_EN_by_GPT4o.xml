      <p>Well-learned and honorable, especially gracious, dear sir and brother-in-law, I extend to you my friendly, willing service, and whatever I can offer in honor, love, and goodness, always beforehand. Although I have written to you little in the years following the death of my dear wife, it was solely the heavy obligations, which have been imposed on me by my son until now, that prevented me.</p>
      <p>For, even if I had informed you of the same, you would have received little joy from it (as now). I have always hoped for an improvement, so that I could write something more pleasant to you. But since this has not appeared and too many changes have been delayed for too long, I can no longer conceal from you, my dear sir and brother-in-law, my heart's painful concern, that for several years I have endured such an unseemly, cruel, and unwilling time with my son Hans Jakob; for despite the fact that he, at the age of 44, impregnated a young daughter with whom he led an unashamed life, thereby coming into great disgrace and imprisonment, and my wife, his mother, had to die from the grief brought upon her, leaving me little behind, he has, over all this, taken it upon himself to squander his youth and the fortune granted to him in a presumptuous life quite recklessly. Consequently, on the Saturday after Hilary of the past year 1548, because he had seduced the wife of a citizen who was then in the service and retinue of His Imperial Majesty, who also stayed day and night in his house, and with other women, whom he is said to have boasted about, he was notorious and lived very badly with his wife, also at all times completely arrogantly disregarded me and my fatherly punishment and faithful warnings, while his wife was shamefully accused by him of all sorts of things, for which he again came into prison and was released upon my pleading request on a written pledge and a hundred guilders, which were imposed on him as a penalty, so that his wife agreed to separate from him before the ecclesiastical judge in Altkirch.</p>
      <p>But when they had long argued with each other and he appealed the judgment to Byzantium, suffering great costs and disgrace, they finally reconciled themselves, whereupon my lords imprisoned his young lady, who had kept house for him during the time his wife was away from him (because he is said to have had dealings with her over the pledged matter), and after a long proceeding, an impartial court from the three cities in the forest and lands was appointed, which condemned him for the fourth time, and also let him know. But since he (as he could not obtain sufficient support for and from the law at his request) did not appear, he was declared in default upon their complaint. What distress and disgrace I and my current wife have suffered in such notoriety, I cannot write here, yet it would be preferable to choose death for this.</p>
      <p>Thus he appealed the aforementioned judgment to the royal government in Ensisheim in Upper Alsace, where he grew into a lawsuit with my lords (in which I, due to my civic duty), could not provide any assistance, to which he, despite my repeated requests, never wanted to accept an amicable settlement either before or after the held trial.</p>
      <p>This legal exercise has now lasted for years, causing him to come into great costs for his own matters, and my lords as well, causing them to be unable to use me in my son's matters, to release me and take another servant.</p>
      <p>Thus, I must pay for it, as I have never been able to be beneficial nor can be. Therefore, he has stirred up such an unspeakably great affair, envy, and displeasure in the city, that I cannot write briefly, as I do not have a person who would be comforting to me in this. Moreover, he has caused a lawsuit and such a disturbance in the city with three or four citizens for the sake of scolding in Ensisheim, that people everywhere have something to say about it, for which I and my children must pay against many. I am now without service for a year and must thus lose my own due to the disobedient, reckless person (who has little compassion for me). Now, four years ago, when I saw my son's reckless, arrogant, and contemptuous disobedience, I married an honorable widow from Laufenburg, with whom I have now had children. So that I may raise them honorably, and not have to lose and waste what the Lord God has provided us against my will, the unavoidable necessity requires me to engage in another serviceability.</p>
      <p>And since I find from the aforementioned displeasure that the inheritance of my son is entirely dangerous to expect, as you can deduce from this, and the true and rightful friend is only felt in need, and at this time among all my relatives, I know no one more agreeable, to whom I have more hope and comfort than to you and my dear sister, and since my desire is not to touch silver or gold, I appeal to you, my dear sir and brother-in-law, with my friendly request, that you may, in this unforeseen necessity of my imposed obligation, extend your brotherly help and advice to me and my children without harm to yourself, and assist, whether I might obtain an honorable service with you or around you, yet always with your faithful advice, on what I should engage, hold, and trust myself in this matter, as you, as the highly understanding, see fit for the best, to inform me of this for the most beneficial, so that it must be held better hereafter, likewise not to burden you with the given report, nor to take it too harshly; for I would have preferred to have kept it longer from you, although I do not doubt that you have been sufficiently informed of all proceedings before. You will kindly greet my dear sister Anna and your children, and whoever loves you, from me and my wife.</p>
      <p>Given at Rheinfelden on the 13th day of January in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>And although my lords released me on the Saturday before the gentlemen's carnival in the year 1549, they have subsequently provided me with a credible document, as you can see in the enclosed copy.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, citizen and teacher in ZÃ¼rich, my dear brother-in-law.</p>
