      <p>Greetings. We have received copies of your most holy work published against the pernicious sect of the Anabaptists, most esteemed lord and compater (godfather), and Musculus and I give you immense thanks. He himself would have written to you as well, but due to his occupations, he cannot do so now; however, he will write soon, as I hope, and in return, he sends you his "Loci" (a theological work). Now he wants me to give you our mutual thanks on both our behalves.</p>
      <p>Regarding the disaster or calamity at Abbatiscellensis (Abtwil), I have informed our people, who are very sympathetic and, as I believe, will also send an honorarium to them.</p>
      <p>From France and Geneva, meanwhile, since I last wrote (which I hope you have received in the meantime), we have received no certain news. We are very surprised about how that tumult is going and what outcome will ensue.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn anything, I will inform you without delay. I recently wrote about Naogeorgus, and I have nothing to add to that now.</p>
      <p>I deeply sympathize with the church of Richenwil (Richterswil).</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve it in true purity.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, the Ubiquitarians are causing a great tumult. Those who were previously united with us in the ministry of that church are gluttons and rascals; they remain silent against the testimony of their conscience, they dissimulate, indeed they even join with the adversaries and attack the truth. One person opposes them, a certain schoolmaster Matthias Schenckius from Constance, whose learned writing against ubiquity was recently sent to us. I frequently urge our Musculus to assist the struggling church and truth there with some private and small German writing; for it seems to me that he owes this to God, the truth, and that church which has deserved so well of him. But I cannot push him into this arena.</p>
      <p>I would therefore wish that you also give him a nudge, if such a thing seems advisable to you. If you have any certain information about the new council convened in Milan, please let us know; for there is much talk about it among our people. All of ours greet you, especially Musculus, Haller the treasurer, Hagius, my father-in-law, and my mother. Give greetings to all of yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 2, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most esteemed compater.</p>
