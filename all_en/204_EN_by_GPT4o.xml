      <p>I am still eagerly awaiting that Peter with your letters, as your courier could not reach him yesterday. I have nothing to write now, except a few things for your next letter. Nothing like what was spread there has happened to my brother; I also hope that he will soon greet me here with his colleagues; for the council wishes them to be present to consult together with others on this more than serious and grave matter.</p>
      <p>If our Leonard has not yet received his book, I have no doubt that he will receive it shortly; it was hidden among people who read it not without great benefit to themselves and others. As far as this matter is concerned, you can be at ease; for no fraud has been committed here.</p>
      <p>I am greatly delighted that Musculus is so highly regarded by you; he is indeed a man worthy of being revered and loved by all good and learned people for the unique gifts of the Lord that shine so brightly in him. We will expect his wife here with the children and will do our duty until they are informed by him where they should go. I will make sure that you are informed as soon as they arrive, since you so desire.</p>
      <p>What happened to the five martyrs in Gaul by the grace of God (if what Schnepf wrote to me in earnest is true), if I have not written to you recently, you will learn from Marcellus Theodorichus.</p>
      <p>Bucer sent us a long writing, which was presented to the council of Strasbourg by the ministers of the word concerning that undecided matter of the Emperor. He writes that everything there fluctuates between hope and fear, but that hope somewhat prevails.</p>
      <p>The Wittenberg school responded piously and courageously to their elector regarding the Interim, hoping that the prince will not be able to accept it due to his previous splendid promises.</p>
      <p>I will be extremely surprised if it does not soon collapse, which is being imposed everywhere with such violence and haste against the unwilling. I truly believe that if anywhere, here the proverb will hold true: What is done quickly, perishes quickly; soon won, soon lost. The most gracious Savior will not be able to ignore the sighs and anxious prayers of His children in these extreme dangers for much longer.</p>
      <p>I commend to you with all diligence that poor Paul Rasdorfer, miserable in more than one respect, so that you may provide for him among your people, or wherever it may be possible, so that when he arrives, he is not forced to incur greater expenses than his situation allows. I am very sorry for the good man, as he is not equipped with any means to bear exile more easily.</p>
      <p>He is in poor health, burdened with many children, and has no fortune at all, not to mention his advanced age and unsuitability for great labors, as well as some other issues. Therefore, he must be embraced more closely with the bowels of charity, of which we still have some means to help others.</p>
      <p>May Christ love and preserve you, my venerable and dearest brother, with all yours. Pray for us with tireless zeal, so that once delivered from these evils, we may magnificently praise the Lord in the church of His saints. July 19, 1548.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Lindau, named Lux von Kirchen, has left Lindau with his people, as have all the noble women who were in the free convent in Lindau, not wanting to await the ruin. May God grant that they never return there.</p>
      <p>The last message from those of Lindau has also returned, and the Emperor has given them another 12 days to finally consider themselves, with many good and bad words, so that some are beginning to waver. Yet, it is hoped that more will remain on God's side. Oh, it is truly pitiable that we are all such miserable weaklings and that our faith is so entirely weak, and that we fear so badly in such a good cause, where no loss threatens us, and do not freely place our life and death in the hands of Him who alone can make us live or die eternally.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
