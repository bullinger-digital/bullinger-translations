      <p>Greetings. Safe and sound, I have returned to my people on the first of September.</p>
      <p>Everything in our synods has been quite successful. Praise be to the Lord. We found the classes much more peaceful than we had hoped. Since we were also given the power by the senate to settle everything, we resolved most matters so that only a few remain to be referred to the senate. The controversy over predestination was discussed in no other class except the one in Lausanne, with François Saint-Paul defending his own opinion and all the others defending theirs collectively. After hearing both sides, they did not seem to differ so much in their opinions, provided they could bear with each other in a spirit of modesty and charity. And as far as I can judge, the dispute is not so much about doctrine as about other matters that have arisen in the heat of contention.</p>
      <p>However, we have settled whatever disputes were among them, and I hope they will remain peaceful in the future. As for the doctrine itself, the class seems to me to think and teach quite moderately and in a Catholic or orthodox manner. For they establish no other cause of damnation than man's sin, nor do they refer this solely to the bare will of God. Meanwhile, they consider it not to be inquired why God leaves some in their just damnation. Rather, they say, as the apostle does: "O the depth, etc." and "Who are you, O man, etc." Nor does François seem to think otherwise. As for church discipline, all the classes gave us a great deal of trouble. For none excepted, they all requested that the examination of their own be given to them, and the power to exclude from the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>None, however, pressed this more vehemently than the people of Lausanne, as you can gather from their written statement, a copy of which I am sending you, which they presented to us by common consent. To which we simply replied: Discipline is necessary in the church, but the same form cannot be established in all churches. We do not condemn this form, wherever it is accepted in the Christian church, although we are not unaware that this form particularly has a place in those churches, and was also formerly used especially among those who had no Christian magistrate of their own.</p>
      <p>In our churches, however, it is not possible for such discipline to be established, and nothing would follow but the greatest disturbances and seditions, indeed the overthrow of the entire gospel, if anyone were to persist in establishing it. We also pointed out other dangers that would follow from this concerning satisfaction and other matters, and we urged them to desist from that institution and to be content with the discipline of the magistrates and consistories. But if they absolutely refuse, let each one individually write down his name, then we will report everything to the senate. After they saw their names being requested, they abandoned the institution. Thus, this matter was suppressed in such a way that no mention of it will be made before the senate. This is the main thing that occupied us. There were also other matters concerning private individuals that it is not necessary to recount. We hope for great fruit to follow from this visitation. As usual in our synods, all the prefects, praetors, castellans, nobles, etc., were present, whose number in some classes far exceeded the number of ministers, and each of them was forced to undergo censures, including the barons who live under the rule of our lords. This struck great fear into everyone. I hope, therefore, that everything will be better from now on. In the doctrine of ceremonies, nothing has yet been done between our church and the church of Geneva. I hope the way to settle this will also be easy. I discussed many things familiarly with Calvin. He is very disturbed now because of the case of the heresiarch Servetus, who is detained there in chains. Since Gwalther can tell you everything about this case, I will write nothing. He will also tell you the latest news. Indeed, he is in a hurry, so I cannot write more now. Therefore, consider these few things, which I have barely written in haste, kindly. All of ours greet you. May yours also be safe, especially your family, to whom I ask you to convey many greetings from me and my family. Farewell. Bern, 6th of September, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
