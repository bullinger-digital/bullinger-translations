      <p>S. Today, just at nightfall, I received your letter, most honorable father, which indeed was very pleasing to me for many reasons, and for which I give you immense thanks. I, however, was unable to write in the previous days due to my health; for I had entirely entrusted myself to the doctor and stayed at home more...</p>
      <p>Our envoy greatly embellished that disaster that occurred near Montb√©liard: he reported that the prince lost 2000 of his veterans and that twenty-four military standards of the slain were brought to the king.</p>
      <p>He received them so lavishly and sumptuously that the lords' intention to punish the disobedient soldiers was postponed to another time and perhaps to the Greek calends. He certainly averted the retribution that those deserved who went into military service against the mandate of the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>From Italy, it is written as a certainty that the Venetian senate has decreed that the goods of those who are suspected of Lutheranism and are imprisoned and perish should no longer go to the accusers and informers, but to the relatives of those who are destroyed.</p>
      <p>Chur of the Rhaetians, November 29, 1568.</p>
      <p>Since... the son-in-law of Mr. Friedrich von Salis was disfigured with papal spurs and a golden chain, neither he nor Mr. Friedrich's letters have been seen here. - There were great men who thought that the abduction and deceitful entrapment of Mr. Cellarius should be avenged in this way: One should seize a monk or a priest, also from their places, capture and bind them, and in the presence of several preachers and lords from each league, bring them to the place where the pious Cellarius was captured, and there one should place a triple crown of paper on him, bind an iron chain around his neck and two spurs on his feet, and then hang him on a bright gallows. With this, everyone would be paid back in their own coin. But silver arrows fly, which prevent these things.</p>
