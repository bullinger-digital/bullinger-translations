      <p>Greetings from God through Jesus Christ our Savior. Recently, around the Nones of March, when our prince stayed with us for a day or two, I was invited by his order to a meal. As soon as I arrived, I prayed before the meal, as well as afterward, according to the prince's command. During the meal, he discussed various and serious matters, especially the controversial topics of our religion at this time, in a manner that seemed to me far from ordinary. I thought we owe much to God, from whom we have such an understanding judge of divine matters and so fair in discerning controversies, in whom, if anything is to be desired, it is to be hoped with all prayers that his life and morals correspond and respond to his judgment. However, it is not necessary to recount everything in detail here, except for this one thing that he instructed me to write to you. Having made an honorable mention of you during the meal, knowing that I had once had a life and friendship with you, he asked whether I was also a Zwinglian. I replied that I was neither Lutheran nor Zwinglian, but a Christian; however, regarding my opinion on the Lord's Supper, which is consistent with the word of God, I by no means despise those who either precede or agree with me in it; but I embrace and venerate them partly as fathers and teachers, partly as brothers in the Lord. Then he said, "It is well," and soon turned to other matters. After the meal, when the table was cleared and thanks were given, he detained me alone with him, having dismissed the others, and there he very diligently inquired what I thought about the sacrament, and, lest I should fear anything or dissemble or hesitate, he ordered me to be of good courage and speak freely. I indeed said, "I have no one to fear or see more in all these matters except God, whose judgment, since it is certain, must not be stood against, as long as my opinion is approved by Him, I refuse nothing about what others may judge of me. Therefore, I first spoke about the sacraments in general, placing them on the same level of dignity with the external word of God, so that what is taught and promised by the word of God, the same things, not some new or different ones, are brought to the mind by the sacraments through the other senses, and that in a new, suitable, and especially convenient way for human understanding.</p>
      <p>For just as the preaching of the word of God, striking the hearing, excites a certain divine motion in the mind assenting to God's promises, so also the sacraments, through certain external signs, affect and strike the other senses in some way, so that the inner man, now by sight, now by touch, now by taste, now by smell, being moved from outside, is more sharply reminded of the hidden things beautifully depicted by the external appearance of the signs. Therefore, the sacraments are like God's seals attached to the tablets on which the description of the covenant between God and us is contained, added for this purpose, that the minds of men, perceiving the divine will concerning themselves more firmly and clearly, might be more closely joined and bound to God day by day. Wherefore, the connection and association of divine things with the external word is the same as the truth, that is, the reason of the things signifying and signified by the signs themselves. And just as the gospel is indeed the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, but by the fault and guilt of the unbelievers, it is the odor of death to death for those who do not obey, so also the sacraments are only salutary for the faithful, but for profane men, because of their contempt and abuse, they are profane, useless, harmful. Having explained these things almost to this point, I descended to the specific case, that is, to the Lord's Supper. Where I showed that the same analogy must be observed in all things [Greek], that is, of the signs and external things, to [Greek], which are internal, spiritual things, signified. Therefore, as the receptacles are, so also are the objects: to the human body, the external bread and wine are suitable, not so to the soul, but on the contrary, the food of the soul is that heavenly bread, which gives life to the world, so that now the mind, being incorporeal, is not properly fed by bodily things, thus the food of our soul must be suitable and convenient, which is perceived. Therefore, all phantasms about the true and natural body and blood of Christ in the most holy supper, otherwise than by spirit and faith, must once and for all be cut down. To these, according to the hunger and thirst required of the guests worthily approaching the Lord's table, it is easily understood what kind of food and drink is perceived there. For those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are invited to this supper (I said), to whom also fullness and full possession of righteousness is promised, which we obtain nowhere except in Christ, through whom we are led from eternal death to life, and in this temporal life we are sustained and progress day by day in regeneration. To this extent, the body and blood of Christ are proposed to us in the supper under the external appearances of bread and wine, so that our faith may look to and have Him as the only author of salvation.</p>
      <p>When I had proceeded thus far in speaking, the prince nodded, saying that all those who say and speak rightly, who say that the body and blood of Christ are truly perceived in the supper, but only as far as the sacrament or spiritually, and he cited a certain passage from Luther's writings, where Luther, outside the heat of contention, had said in this way: "The sensible body of man receives sensible bread and wine, the insensible soul receives the insensible Christ." "Hence," he said, "all those who today fight for Luther's opinion seem more to defend the authority of their master than to contend about the matter itself. For if they wanted to consider, they could have gathered from Luther himself what the matter was. However," he said, "this controversy has given us great troubles so far, and there is not yet an end. For in Saxony, Pomerania, and the adjacent regions, he who feels differently from them does not even dare to open his mouth, otherwise he would be expelled by all.</p>
      <p>I recently," he said, "gave letters to John a Lasco to a certain friend (whose name he kept silent) living in Saxony. He had by all means dissuaded John a Lasco from muttering anything about the Lord's Supper, it being so dangerous even to mention this cause in passing. Finally, there remains," he said, "one scruple for me in the opinion of the Zwinglians, which I wished to be removed by John a Lasco; but he did not satisfy. Therefore, I would like," he said, "you to write on this occasion to Mr. Bullinger, so that I may also hear his opinion. Paul, writing about the resurrection of the Lord, after he had enumerated many to whom He had appeared in the body, finally testifies that Christ was also seen by him. Since this happened after Christ's ascension into heaven, it is asked how Paul could have seen Christ if Christ, as to the body, is in one certain place. Mr. a Lasco said," he said, "that Christ was seen by Paul when he was caught up to the third heaven." Then I said, "What if," I said, "Paul saw Christ in the same way as Stephen, about to be stoned, still living on earth, saw the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God? However, I do not wish to prejudge anyone in this matter." But he said, "Write," he said, "to Bullinger about this matter, so that he may remove this scruple for me." "I will do so," I said, "shortly." After this conversation was completed, he kindly dismissed me. Meanwhile, I always thought that this favorable opportunity for doing good was divinely offered to us, so that the prince might not only be instructed by your humanity through a letter in this matter, which he especially seeks to be explained to him, but also that he might be reminded of his duty in other matters as well, pertaining to ecclesiastical and political governance.</p>
      <p>For in both areas, many things are committed that are hardly becoming to Christian men, which need serious attention if anyone were to urge it. For those who ought to press the princes most to take up this care of right attention are almost mute dogs, flatterers, or such jesters that, if they sometimes dare to speak freely, they seem to act lightly and laughably rather than seriously. Hence, they not only prostitute themselves but also their ministry, to the great pain and mockery of the rest of the pious. Therefore, I earnestly beg you to write back to the prince, so that he may see that I have performed my duty, which he enjoined. Farewell in the Lord with all yours, and greet my teachers, Mr. Martyr and Bibliander, from me.</p>
      <p>Given from Wetter on the day before the Nones of April in the year 1557. I commend to you my cousin Johannes Pincier.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Pincier Veteranus.</p>
