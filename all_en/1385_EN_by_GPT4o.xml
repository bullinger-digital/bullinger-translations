      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am finally sending you the books you mentioned in your letter; the rest are not available with us. The commentary of Peter Martyr on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians has not arrived. As for the books published by us, I cannot write anything certain at this time, as they are not yet completed; but soon I will carefully note all the books published by everyone and send them to you.</p>
      <p>We hear dreadful things about the Turk; he has occupied the most fortified castle in Hungary, and Hungary had no stronger place to defend against Turkish incursions. Ferdinand's men want to gather an army, but after suffering a defeat. However, the treasurer has undoubtedly written more to you about these matters, as I hear he has received letters from Augsburg about various things, whom I could not speak to at this time, because he has not been seen and my affairs have not yet given me the opportunity to approach him.</p>
      <p>The Neapolitans are still bravely resisting their enemies. If the Turk were armed, the Maurician army would undoubtedly be dissolved into various parts, as some conjecture. Finally, nothing is more certain than the English sweat raging most cruelly in Brabant, even among the best, although some affirm it has now ceased a little. The pestilential plague troubles us little. Our Myconius is gravely suffering from his domestic illness, which will eventually consume him.</p>
      <p>Oporinus will publish the history of Nicephorus, I believe this winter, which King Ferdinand will send to him; it has been translated into Latin, I do not know by whom, in which we will find various things about the ecclesiastical state most suitable for establishing the concord of the scattered churches. And some of Abadie's works, the ecclesiastical historian. The Lord aids the reformation of the church with various small works; but the bishops do not want to be wise, they do not want to be reformed. Therefore, let them perish with that pomp and the worst institutions, which they daily devise to obscure the word of God.</p>
      <p>What is the Pope doing, where is he hiding? What do you hope for from the council? There is a rumor with us that the Bishop of Mainz is setting out with 40 horses to the Council of Trent. When will the Swiss send some to the slaughter? They say the Pope is in Ancona and is there giving birth to some monster. The beast will not cease to vex the church with its wiles, but it must perish with all its own, let it be so, let it be so. Basel, August 27, 1551. Greet Mr. Theodor, to whom I will shortly give letters and booklets.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gast.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
