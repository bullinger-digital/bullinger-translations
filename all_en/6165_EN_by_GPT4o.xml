      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>I hope that my most illustrious prince is not estranged from you, indeed he favors you, as far as I can see. He was expecting your letters, in which you would indicate what you have heard about the new army, whether it is advancing or if indeed the Turk and the sea are to be attacked. He was truly pleased to hear what you had written.</p>
      <p>I am sending letters to the royal legate through Schaffhausen, which I entrust to your faithfulness.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well, most esteemed man.</p>
      <p>Doctor Aurelius greets you.</p>
      <p>I greet the entire family, school, and church. The grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, June 11, 1564.</p>
      <p>Brother Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger of Zürich, to be honored.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
