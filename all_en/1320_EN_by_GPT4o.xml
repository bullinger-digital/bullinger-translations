      <p>I have certain information from Augsburg that negotiations with Magdeburg have resumed in earnest; they are willing to do much, to pledge allegiance to the emperor and recognize him as their emperor, to give a large sum of money, also to dismantle some fortifications and more, as much as possible, etc., but on the condition that the Interim, the priests, and foreign troops are not forced upon them; they want none of these three in the city, as it would lead to the ruin of their souls. However, the imperial majesty did not want to agree to this, and so the negotiations have once again broken down.</p>
      <p>As soon as the envoys returned home, those in the city once again sallied out and inflicted great damage on the enemy (who had not yet expected this).</p>
      <p>Now, new negotiations are supposed to be underway. This is written by Sebastian Kurtz, who is well-regarded by the Fuggers in Augsburg and is a very dear servant to them; he has a brother in Lindau, named Mathis Kurtz; this is also written to Pappus in Lindau and credible people in Augsburg. But one of our people went to Augsburg eight days ago with Master Heinrich's son; he is expected to return soon and, I hope, will bring good information about these matters.</p>
      <p>It has been credibly reported to Duke Christoph of Württemberg that Margrave Albrecht has been captured, which is why he, since he is related to him through his wife, sent the young lord of Höben last week to see how things stand with him; he is expected to return soon. A very trusted man told me last night, who comes directly from the court of Württemberg, where he stayed for eight days, namely in Stuttgart, and also brought me a letter from the chief court councilor and land steward Balthasar von Gültlingen, who wrote to me about many things at my request, namely that he has no doubt the duke will remain in the country; also, negotiations are underway with the king, but still on very difficult terms; also, that the duke has been dismissed from Augsburg with full grace by the imperial majesty. In the court chapel, everything in religion is conducted as it was with the old lord; otherwise, in some places of the principality, both the gospel and the Interim are preached. Frecht is the supreme superintendent in the prince's stipend. Brenz is also in the country, is much used, and the duke has two fine preachers at court, Master Caspar Greter, the other I do not know. The old princess has mass read in her own chapel; the prince does not prevent her from doing so, as it is hers and the subjects have sworn to her; she is in Nürtingen; she has not studied well in the Bavarian land.</p>
      <p>In addition, he has let me know many things orally through the aforementioned trusted man, as he has experienced many things himself and seen at court: that the duke is very humble without any pomp, that he and the princess love each other very much and she is always with him and rides around with him; that everyone has free access to him; that he is very straightforward, goes to the chancellery and council daily himself, so that the councilors do not complain about anything higher than that he is very diligent and they never have rest or relaxation, having to earn their pay with hard work. He does not want a penny of the church property, and what was previously taken into the chamber must now be separated again with much effort and work; it is assigned to the poor people of each place, etc., and to education. With the game, he has given the peasants a mouse: whoever is caught in the act will be punished with four weeks in the tower and a fine of 20 florins; if caught a third time, he will be brought to justice.</p>
      <p>At court, he still eats and dines daily in the refectory in Stuttgart with fifty fish. There is great discipline and silence observed at the table, also prayers are said before and after the meal; the common servants are given a fixed amount of wine, so they cannot get drunk. His young lord and the ladies must go to the sermon daily and always say something about it or be punished; they are raised in learning and great discipline.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards, who are still in the country, are so superior to the common man that they have several times very urgently petitioned the prince and recently added: they are willing to risk life, property, and blood for his grace; he should relieve them of these people; for they can and will no longer endure this oppression; but if he cannot protect and free them, they will seek and do everything themselves to get rid of this burden.</p>
      <p>And it is believed that the peasants will take action and drive out the Spaniards or even kill them. But it would be hard work; for the peasants always have to bear the blame, and yet nothing less is sent to the city; it is always the last that is the worst.</p>
