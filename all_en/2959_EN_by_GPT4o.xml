      <p>S. D. You have encouraged me, O Bullinger, dearest brother in the Lord, to the frequent duty of writing, and I do not know to whom I would rather or more willingly wish to gratify than to you, if I had any cheerful subject to write to you about; for everything is so disturbed, so improperly done, that almost the pen, let alone the mind, recoils from comprehending the iniquities of men. If you either delight in these, which I do not believe, or wish to be informed, pay attention. I have now performed my duty first in Nuremberg, then in Augsburg, and finally at the court (with God as my witness) as faithfully and diligently as I could, moving every stone to see how truth and justice might be propagated far and wide in both divine and secular matters, and my effort was not entirely without some progress for a while.</p>
      <p>But when the work had to be entrusted to endurance, it mostly remained imperfect and collapsed, alas. Our prince elector showed a good hope of true piety on the surface, Michael Diller, the court preacher, no less; but after they involved themselves in the commerce and society of certain princes and the followers of Brenz, not to say conspired, the whole order of things is overturned.</p>
      <p>Everyone shouts and vociferates against the doctrine of Mr. Zwingli, of blessed memory, and not only against this but against all, however pious, who come to us from the Swiss, completely ignorant of the truer and more sincere doctrine, and what is most absurd, unwilling to hear and be informed about the themes of controversies, indeed rejecting all pious conversations and communications. Perhaps they think they have acted religiously enough if they say: "What is to be conferred with those who were long ago condemned by the holy Mr. Luther?" But to me, considering the matter more carefully, a far different reason for avoiding the conversation occurs, namely, partly because they do not want concord, partly because they utterly despair of victory in such a contest; I say nothing of the shame with which they, now defeated, are suffused.</p>
      <p>There is also the ambition of vain glory, which dares to oppose even the most manifest truth. Furthermore, the poor wretches are compelled to admit that the taking of the body and blood of Christ is done only spiritually or, as some wish, sacramentally, yet they shamelessly quarrel about some bodily real bloody presence, I would soon say. But I will let this pass. For there is another and indeed worse evil than this: almost all the athletes of the new papacy come together and conspire that they will no longer admit anyone from the Swiss, and those admitted they will drive out; such is the great and obstinate envy and treachery of the new papacy. Therefore, how the matter of religion now stands everywhere in the empire is easily apparent: the pious and learned are oppressed by hatred and envy, afflicted with reproaches and slanders, expelled, and in their place the most wicked, ignorant, and worst kind of life are substituted. I greatly fear, therefore, that even our Laurentius Agricola will soon be dismissed, not considering that he is surrounded by such great supports and testimonies of both life and doctrine as no one else has been for the past hundred years. All the good men of the whole city observe, love, and venerate him, interceding most earnestly for him, foreseeing and predicting the ruin of the church if he departs. Moreover, they publicly confess that they have never had a more vigilant, learned, and life-sanctified preacher. And if you gather all the votes of the whole city, you will not find ten men opposed to him, and those only who still cling to the old papacy with a firm grip or aspire to the new one. Among them, the senatorial scribe, a man in all respects inhuman and insolent, named Conrad Laetus, not of my lineage, but of some butchers, takes the lead, who has fixed this calumny on Laurentius and reported him to the prince.</p>
      <p>However, I cannot sufficiently marvel that, although this scribe was previously most odious to the prince, he has now gained favor with this disgraceful deed. But I cease to marvel when I recall examples of this kind. Finally, to bring the matter to an end, I foresee a new union with the old papacy shortly.</p>
      <p>The Furies, Alecto and Megaera, will give birth to a thousand. The old ones rage, and the new ones rave against the worshippers of piety.</p>
      <p>There is some, though very little, hope of protecting and retaining Laurentius. I wish I were an Atlas to bear this burden; but since I am almost alone in publicly supporting his cause, I fear I may succumb. My efforts will be strong and so fervent that I will not be moved even if I am thrown into the mud with him. Moreover, for the sake of truth, I have been proscribed from place to place four times before and deprived of many goods and things. What will happen the fifth time, time will tell. Now exhausted by labors and years, I love tranquility and fixed abodes, but the will of the Lord be done, for I will not at all bear it with difficulty if I am buried among the Swiss brothers; for I hope that a little space for dwelling among them will be open to me.</p>
      <p>The affairs of the empire, due to perhaps a lack of money, are forced to be peaceful outwardly, but the minds, by Hercules, are fervent and ulcerated within.</p>
      <p>Our cardinal, entirely carnal, has published an apology against those who accuse him of seduction and treason. I do not know whether it defends him more or accuses him. Among our princes, as I see, he earns little favor with his masks and trifles.</p>
      <p>There was much hope for the future diets; but now, as I hear, they have fallen into oblivion; in my judgment, they will be postponed until the forces of war are resumed. The Turk prevails in Hungary, but it is uncertain whether he will make an incursion into Upper Pannonia with a hostile hand.</p>
      <p>The Saxons have changed their nature into wax, being much softer in spirit; they devote themselves to hunting, drinking, and the art of archery.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, their courtiers collude with the pope and priests, swallowing the goods of the churches, indeed entire monasteries, so that in the end, one badly fermented mass is made, as above.</p>
      <p>I read your "Origin of Error," and I also read your apology, a heresy plainly unconvincible, which the Lutherans not only fear but also shudder at, whose rays they can bear less than those of the sun itself, yet they do not dare to confess the truth. Some say they have read it, but it does not satisfy them; some say your books are forbidden to them, affirmed by the Wittenberg school, lest they be seduced. O by the faith of the gods, what fine theologians to confirm and defend their own, not so much skilled as to refute others. Farewell, ornament of our church.</p>
      <p>I cannot find Calvin's and Bernhard's apologies against the Saxons available here; if you have received the price from me, I would like you to buy them.</p>
      <p>Brenz, that square tribulator, wrote among other things about the supper that Christ is in the bread as in the kernel of a tree, which is neither seen nor touched, yet is no less present in the kernel. O beautiful argument, yet not entirely to be rejected, if he concedes such and such a presence in the bread, although from the planted kernel a tree sometimes grows, from the bread, however, a carnal body does not grow, but is only nourished and vegetated. Very nicely argued.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and pray for me. I earnestly pray to the most good and great God for the prolongation of your life. I recently hoped that a colloquium about the supper would be established, in which you would participate; but the hopes of the hares made my hope vain.</p>
      <p>You will greet the lords consuls, the chief scribe, and the whole choir of the muses most diligently from my heart in my name. July 2nd, in the year etc. 56. Hastily.</p>
      <p>I cannot reread.</p>
      <p>Yours, G[eorg] L[aetus].</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
