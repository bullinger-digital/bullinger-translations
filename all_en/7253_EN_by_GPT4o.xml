      <p>Eduard from the Counts of Thiene, a leading citizen of the city of Vicenza. I will say this one thing to you: that I am not forsaken by my God in such a long and grievous cross, but that I endure this martyrdom cheerfully and patiently, contemplating not the things that are seen, but the things that are not seen.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, on the sixth day of October, 1567.</p>
