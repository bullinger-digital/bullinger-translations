      <p>Most beloved godfather in the Lord, although you receive two quite elegant and lively letters from us, namely from Mr. Haller and Mr. Nikolaus, my dearest godfathers, from which you will be able to learn all about our affairs, it seemed appropriate to inform your prudence with a word or two about the cause of the Genevans, which in my judgment is getting worse and worse every day, so that it is to be feared that from this discord a conflagration may arise between these two cities, ours and theirs, which must be diligently worked on by both you and the other neighbors to extinguish. The hatred of the name of Calvin, our beloved brother in the Lord, is being so greatly increased by the malicious efforts of certain men that I fear, lest if any tumult and danger arise, all the blame will be cast upon his head. Therefore, it seems to me that he should be advised to take the utmost care that these cities do not fall apart from each other.</p>
      <p>Nor do I doubt that if he wishes to be an advocate for accommodating himself to the society of the Bernese, he will easily achieve this; which he ought to take care of more diligently, as it is certain that if this society falls apart, the cause will be attributed solely to him and the French, whom he has with him. But concerning this matter, you will be able to learn more and more certain things from these two brothers and my friends. I have written this to you only so that you may have the occasion from my letters to confer with them about this matter. I pray that you consider this kindly. Greetings to your household and the other lords and brothers. Farewell excellently in Christ the Savior. Bern, 8th of September, 1555.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most beloved godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
