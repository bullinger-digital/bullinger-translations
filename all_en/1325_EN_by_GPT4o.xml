      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I would like to address you briefly, most learned Bullinger, and indeed in Latin, as I have been accustomed to do so far, but the current state of my affairs neither allows me to be brief nor to speak with you in Latin; therefore, I ask you to forgive me for addressing you in a new manner. I need a wealth of words because otherwise, you cannot grasp my situation. I preferred to use the vernacular language rather than Latin because it seemed to me that the esteemed council of Zurich, my most gracious lords, required it. For I wish to give an account of my actions to them through you rather than through my letters, about which I will inform you in the following, so that if I am perhaps too lengthy or inappropriate with untimely narration, you can, with your wisdom, handle my business there in a more concise manner and with a speech more suited to the understanding of the lords. I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to do this through Christ, our Lord, and through brotherly love. So, in brief, this is my situation.</p>
      <p>On the 20th of June, I had a complete council convened, and before them, I took leave from my service, and that for the following reasons. About 14 days before I took leave, a good fellow came to my house and said to me, among other things: "If you do not reveal me, I would like to tell you some news." I promised him I would keep silent, then he said: "A respectable, trustworthy man here has informed me that it was only by a few votes that your lords gave you leave and kept the Swabian."</p>
      <p>These are the words I should have spoken to them. Now, these words struck me so deeply that I compared them with several conjectures that had occurred before, from which I had long anticipated what is now present. I asked the one who informed me of this if I could report it to a mayor or governor, to which he replied: "Yes, but do not mention my name." So, on the same day, I went to the governor, as the mayor was not at home, and informed him of what was said to me, to which he completely denied it, etc. I pressed him and finally brought him to the point where he said to me: "Mr. Michel, perhaps something was said about me, so I will freely confess to you what I have said. It was said that you are leaving us and are here in Zurich. I said I was sorry, but if he does not want to stay with us, then he must be let go," etc. Mr. Peter Fuchs said to someone that my lords knew thoroughly and precisely that I already had a benefice in Zurich, etc. Another councilor said in the bathhouse, after I had taken leave, that it would be better to give someone leave beforehand than to take leave. From all this, one can well conclude that the aforementioned speech must not be entirely empty. But I did not want to bring all this up during my leave because the council would not have been consistent. And I also believe that some of the council have been involved in this practice.</p>
      <p>At the same time, another matter arose, which first moved me to take leave. My lords have a preacher in their territory in a village called Corsemont, who has served the church in Corsemont for 12 or 13 years, has lived honorably with them, so that my lords and also the peasants must acknowledge that they cannot reproach him but must praise him. But the peasants think he is not learned enough, therefore my lords should give them someone who is next to Corsemont at a filial, called Summenwa, which the aforementioned Philippus, who is now deprived of the benefice, had previously promised and left to the one who is now placed in his position out of compassion, as he is also one of the exiled brothers from Montbéliard and has done nothing, etc. My lords have now handled this without us, the preachers, which is against their reformation. Now they have acted similarly a year ago with another preacher in the parish of Corclarin; although he was rightly deprived of his service, his successor, who is also one of the exiled from Montbéliard, was also irregularly appointed against our synodal statutes and also irregularly dismissed; one must think that it was entirely simoniacal at both places. I was very dissatisfied, partly because (Fünklin had not yet been called to Biel) I advised them, showing them how much it displeased me that they acted so completely against their and also all other evangelical church practices. Then they asked me not to be angry, it happened without any danger, they were not mindful of the statute, which rarely happens, that they appoint benefices, but as it is in constant practice with their dear confederates and neighbors from Bern, that they cannot easily forget their statutes in such daily practice, otherwise, they held with them. I replied: "I am well satisfied, but should it happen again, I would no longer be your servant, you should believe me by the truth." So they promised me they would be more mindful of the statute in the future. With that, I left them.</p>
      <p>Now they have forgotten all this so much that they now, for the second time, yes, also much, much more grossly than before, acted against all their previous promises and also against their own statutes, regulations, and order of their Christian reformation.</p>
      <p>For they have not only acted simply but entirely deliberately and defiantly, and, as I believe, solely to annoy me (since I took the matter seriously, but the other preacher did nothing, or out of hypocrisy, as the end has proven) in this matter, which I hereby make known to you. The brothers in the territory, except for the two who were irregularly appointed, came here to Biel, complained to me and Füncklin about the unfriendly actions of my lords, and each of them let it be known here that they all, each individually, fear that the same will happen to them in the future. We all agreed with each other, namely that we would ask the governor for a meeting with my lords, and when the appointed day came, we would then remind and complain to my lords of these three points in a petitionary manner: 1.</p>
      <p>That we ask for Mr. Philippus of Corsemont, that they consider his old service and many children and let him remain with the benefice, etc. But if that were denied to us, then our other request would be: 2. That they, the lords, allow us to inquire with the church in Zurich and Bern about their practice and order in such matters, about which we have a dispute with each other, etc. If they also denied us that, then we would remain with their statutes, that was the third article. Now Fünklin was appointed to ask for a meeting, but with what loyalty he accomplished that, I do not know, but I do know well that someone later said to me, when I pressed on it: "Dear," he said to me, "do not insist too much, you know well that he accomplished it?" etc. My lords did not give us any, but proceeded with their matter, dismissed Mr. Philippus and appointed the other in such a way that no servant of the word from other parishes of my lords was present, nor any of us from the city. Now that my lords have proceeded so boldly and defiantly, it moved me so much that I declared and testified loudly and clearly that I would remain with their statute, as we had agreed with each other in the colloquium or chapter, as stated above, regarding the third article. The statute reads as follows in the reformation, which is recorded in our synodal books in Latin: "VI. Ecclesiastical authority must be vindicated, which our Lord Jesus Christ has given us in Matthew 16, not for destruction and ruin, but for edification. This is what the consistory does. Nor is it permissible for a bishop, abbot, provost, or colonists to move any preacher from his place without the advice and decision of the senate and synod, before whom his case (provided it is not criminal) must first be discussed. Nor is it permissible for any brother to renounce his office on his own accord, to seek another without the permission of the brothers and deputies in the synod, and that under the faith given to the dean. Nor should the freedom of speech (which preachers have from God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ) be inhibited in any way, either by the senate or others, so that they may not teach, exhort, and correct according to the prescription of the Old and New Testaments, etc. [...?] If any of these things that have been done occur, all the brothers should unanimously demand a mission, etc. And whoever of the brothers has plotted against another's benefice, either by himself or through any intermediaries, he should be deprived of both his own and the other's ministry or benefice, etc." These are the regulations and statutes of our synod. How they have been observed in the two aforementioned examples is easy to understand. I had a serious conversation with one of the council - not the least - and showed him that if my lords persist in these matters as they have begun, a new papal simony and tyranny will arise among the evangelicals, where the servants of the word will be appointed and dismissed, and neither skill, piety, etc. will be considered, but power, favor, money, love, envy, hatred, and calumny will fill and empty the churches with servants, and the more pious the servants are, the greater danger they will stand in, etc. To this, he replied to me: "That is why we do not want to give you priests the sword, so that it does not go among us as it did among the papists." What I further replied to him, I will leave to rest here.</p>
      <p>After my lords dismissed Mr. Philippus and appointed the one from Montbéliard in his place, as mentioned above, my lord mayor summoned both of us preachers in the city and gave us a day to appear before our lords. Füncklin remained silent, but I said: "Lord mayor, the sheep are now out of the stable, so it is too late to close the stable." I thought about it for 3 or 4 days and finally, according to my conscience, could not find anything else but to commend myself to God and his grace and take leave, partly because I had spoken, partly because the statutes of our synod allowed it, thirdly because we had resolved it in the chapter. If I have sinned in this matter and acted more rashly than is proper, may God forgive me. It has been a serious zeal with me, whether it is a wise and right or an unwise and wrong zeal. I can testify to God, who is a knower of hearts. How unfaithfully my fellow brother has acted in this and other matters, I leave to God's judgment, who will find him at the right time. When I took leave and my lords dismissed me and then called me back again, they completely nullified all my reasons for taking leave and answered nothing else to my taken leave than that I should reconsider, and they showed no penitence or regret for their actions against their own statutes, but rather said more, they feared God for having left Mr. Philippus on his benefice for so long. And when they had admonished me several times to reconsider, I replied as before, I had already considered, I could not act against their statutes and my spoken word. So I went home from them again to my house and preached the following two days, namely on Sunday and Monday. After that, I went to Bern and informed my dear lords and brothers, the preachers, of all my matters, and especially asked for advice from Mr. Hans Haller, if they came to me again in Biel and asked me to take up the service again, how I should behave in this case, whether I could, without regard to my previous word, accept the service anew without detriment to my faith and my authority in this church. There I found good faithful advice, but for the sake of brevity, I will leave that to rest as well.</p>
      <p>When I returned home from Bern, I found the situation as follows. My lords had asked me for the third time, when I took leave, not to leave them but to stay with them; if I had any shortcomings, I should come before them, and they would always hear me kindly. I refused them such a request for the third time. And since I went to Bern for a benefice, they see well that I want to remain with my leave. Therefore, they unanimously decided to look for another preacher, and for that reason, they immediately sent Mr. Jacob Füncklin with their chief constable to look for another preacher, I do not know where. They also continued, if I had not gone to Bern, they would have sent for me and tried further to persuade me to stay. It is also said that Füncklin said of me that he did not know that I had gone to Bern on Tuesday, but thought I was at home and wanted to preach on that Tuesday as I had the previous two days. To all this, I give this answer: Firstly, that my lords asked me for the third time to stay, I do not deny, but it is indeed their speech that my leave seemed very strange to them, and they were shocked by it, asking me not to take their actions lightly and to reconsider.</p>
      <p>They have indeed repeated this several times. If I should have stayed for such simple words, when I had just taken leave so earnestly, it seems to me it would have been a great frivolity and instability on my part. I also did not see or hear any sign of repentance from them, by which I could have noticed that they would improve what I took leave for. The mayor said well, the council chambers are always open to me; if I have any shortcomings with them, I could come before them, and they would always act according to the circumstances of the matters, they said nothing further, etc. That they claim, if I had not gone to Bern for a benefice, they would have sent for me and asked me to serve them further, answer: I took leave on Saturday, preached on Sunday and Monday, and no one came to me who said: "Stay here, my lords will send for you on that day," but they played it out with diligence, as soon as I turned my back on them, that they called the citizens and informed them about me, what might be unfavorable to me and favorable to them, and thus they settled and calmed the citizens and the whole community. But God knows all the truth, to whom I testify that if my lords had been serious about keeping me, I would have met them, with the advice of my dear lords and brothers in Bern, in such a way that they would have had to make amends, as long as my spoken word before God and the world would not have been detrimental to my faith and office. I returned home 4 days after I went to Bern and stayed there for 4 days before I left again, they knew that well; why did they not send for me?</p>
      <p>They were not serious. The practitioners had won the matter and now achieved what they had long studied. Without a doubt, if they had known that the greater part of the council, the citizens, and the whole community would be so easily persuaded and calmed, they would have given me leave long ago, I can conclude from this their speech, where they now say: "Dear citizens, we would have given him leave sooner, as we would have known well that it would have caused an uproar, but since he has taken leave from us, we can do nothing about it and are sincerely sorry," but they have urged me to take leave with so many occasions that I cannot and may not tell everything, God will bring the truth to light, etc. If I went to Bern for a benefice, it has been sufficiently answered above. I hope in God, those in whose name and command I have served in Biel so far, they have enough benefices to provide for me, I think they will not push me onto other people's shoulders; but if they do, I know in my conscience that my God, whom I have served so far, will reward me faithfully and graciously and fatherly sustain me as, when, and where it pleases him, etc.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, that I should have given them cause by running to Bern too quickly, that they had to look for another preacher immediately, that is a pure pretext and a blue mist they are making before their community's eyes. I have almost a whole year alone cared for the old Mr. Jacob in his illness, except for some sermons that my dear godfather Lüpolt blessedly did; why were they not so quick then? Also, I have cared for Füncklin alone for 3 weeks when he was in Constance, why did he not do his best now and admonish my lords to stand still for a little while? He is as faithful to me as the brothers of whom the holy Apostle Paul writes, etc. He never came to me. He never promised me, but immediately got up and rode off to look for another preacher. He also claims he did not mean otherwise than that I would preach for him on Tuesday, as I had the previous two days, that is untrue. Blaurer's son brought me three booklets from Füncklin on Monday, after I had preached, with this message, I should not mind the pulpit on the next day, Tuesday, his lord wants to preach himself, so I sent the boy back with this answer: "Tell your lord, I will preach tomorrow," then the boy came back and told me a second time: "No, the lord does not want you to preach, but he wants to preach." Then I said: "Go and tell him, he should now do his best for a few days, I will go away," etc. Why did he not let me preach on Tuesday, why did he claim he did not mean otherwise to me than that I would preach for him on Tuesday as well as the previous two days? It all happened to my disadvantage. Therefore, dear Mr. Heinrich, when I took leave, I asked my lords not to expel my wife and children for a while until I found a place to stay; I also offered that when I am at home, I will take care of the pulpit if it pleases them, but they have not given me any answer so far and have not let me on the pulpit anymore, but appointed other preachers. It is also said among the common people that my lords have sent some councilors to my house to talk to me, that is as true as if I said: "Master Heinrich Bullinger came to my house today." So everyone is allowed to lie and talk about me as they please. I am also here so lonely, so despised, as if I had never been recognized in Biel and had never done any good there. Well, I praise God for it and commend my case to him, etc. What disgrace and shame I have encountered from Füncklin for a year now, what unfaithfulness, also, how my lords have treated me since then, I complain to God, I do not want to keep you longer with it, etc. I ask you, most excellent man, to take care of all my reasons. For I am so poor and needy that I hardly have the means to support myself for a month.</p>
      <p>Please handle my case with your esteemed council in such a way that I may soon have the most certain experience of your goodwill and faith, which I do not doubt you will do diligently. I am unable to come to you myself due to my body and money, therefore I kindly ask you to excuse me to my lords for this reason as well, and I ask you to promote this my son to my lords, so that he may soon be sent off with an answer, for I have no certain time that I may safely stay here. And also impart your advice to me candidly.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all yours and also greet all your colleagues very much in my name.</p>
      <p>Given hastily, July 2.</p>
      <p>Michael Schlatter, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
