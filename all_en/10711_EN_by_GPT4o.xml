    <p xml:id="regest1">His suspicion that Capito and especially Bucer, in their insistence on the release of Grynäus to Tübingen, are disregarding the welfare of the Swiss churches and want to force them to accept Bucer's Concord, is now shared by others. He renews his criticism of the opinions of Melanchthon, Bucer, and others [to the French king], referring to a letter from Capito [above No. 663]; the damage caused cannot be remedied by apologies. He supports the convention proposed by Capito and wishes for a meeting of the signatories of the [Zürich Communion] Confession [No. 482] with the inclusion of Konstanz. He expects nothing from a council. He sees the reason for the haste in the Concord issue in impending persecutions, under the influence of which Capito stands. He is not fundamentally opposed to a Concord but rejects the articles conveyed to him by Theodor [Bibliander], behind which Bucer seems to stand, in agreement with Grynäus. He is astonished that Bonifacius Wolfhart has expressed opposition to the Concord, which originated from Augsburg, and is surprised by a query from Thomas Blarer, whether Basel really made more concessions than Zürich. Rumors about the French king, the emperor, and the pope; request for a statement on two writings by Melanchthon.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would have written to you many times in the past days, if Capito and Bucer had not made me so perplexed that I could not write what I most wanted you to know, due to the length. They have troubled us so much because of the dismissal of Grynäus. But thank God, the most astute among us have finally realized that their counsel is not as sincere as they claim, even though they swear by all that is holy that there is no impurity hidden. It is so difficult to recognize one's own emotions, and equally difficult to hide them from those who see clearly. I fear Bucer does not favor us. He would despise it if all the Swiss churches perished, just so that those under the empire would remain. He has spoken and written things from which I could confirm this suspicion. Capito seems too sincere and simple to attribute this to him. He was here but did not approach me, even though he stayed until the fourth day. I do not interpret this well, but I hardly dare to speak openly. Unless we agree to Bucer's Concord, he threatens war against the sacramentarians. While he was here, he tried to persuade our council with a rather long speech to dismiss Grynäus, as if he, being in Tübingen, could avert the impending war. Therefore, we have made an effort to retain him, so that if any kind of war arises, there is someone to fight in the field. This is precisely why they are so anxiously striving to take Grynäus away from us.</p>
      <p>Now I come to Capito's letters, which I recently sent to you along with two booklets; for I have read them, as he had entrusted. He orders you to defend the writings of Melanchthon, Bucer, etc. I also advise the same. But what imprudence it is to add to the writings of Melanchthon things that are not entirely in conformity with them, and to send them to foreigners, even if they were the dearest friends? Also, to allow the one who has been proclaimed as the antichrist to remain in his seat, with his wealth and power? Do not the enemies rightly say: "If you start the song too high"? - whatever the intention of their writing (for I easily find an excuse for them). Does not the Frenchman rightly say that the doctrines have been mitigated? They have imposed a terrible and, unless God prevents it, a most dangerous title upon us. But they will write apologies. Let them write iron books, they will never succeed in erasing from the minds of the enemies what has once been conceived. However, if all are like the one I saw, namely Bucer's to the people of Constance, I would prefer that they remain silent altogether.</p>
      <p>Capito requests a convention, about which I have written to Theodor. I do not disapprove, but I would especially like us, who issued the confession together, to meet with the people of Constance, if it could be done conveniently.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council he writes about, and the emperor's obedience to the pope, I say nothing except this: no council will be so good as to restore Christianity in its entirety. What then would impiety, which is being plotted, do? It is our duty to entrust everything to God, but in the meantime to act according to the talent entrusted to us.</p>
      <p>For what he says about the beginning of persecutions being planned, seems to be the reason why they labor so much for any kind of concord. For they are not seeking a solid one at this time, as Capito has clearly expressed here among the brothers. We also desire that concord, ready to redeem it, if it seemed so to the Lord, a thing not easily credible, but of solid truth, which does not seem to be the case, towards which the articles sent by Theodor are directed. Tell me, my brother, if I do not feel rightly. The second and third articles seem to disagree, besides the fact that they harm the truth.</p>
      <p>The former says, in very intricate words, that anyone, by faith, receives the body of Christ, the latter admits even the unbelievers. Then they seem to be entirely fictitious, although they have the flavor of Bucer. Briefly, I say about these: They do not please me, unless I do not understand what they contain. I discussed with Lord Grynaeus. He clapped his hands, saying: Ah, miserable ones, they do not yet know the power of faith! This I confide to you.</p>
      <p>But the least: Bonifacius Wolfhart from Augsburg asks by letter what I think of the concord established. For he says it does not please him, as it only bears the appearance of concord. Therefore, the least, because something has recently begun to be done from Augsburg. Then Thomas Blaurer asks from Oporinus by letter, whether the people of Basel "have conceded anything or to what extent in the concord"; for the people of Strasbourg complain "that they cannot bring the people of Zurich to agree, but the people of Basel have joined." And this certainly the least, since nothing else has been done so far than what has been done equally with you, nor have we ever responded differently than you have responded, indeed you have responded for us through the common confession. What is it then, that they lie about us? They say you recommended the booklet to the people of Münster. We recommended it thus, if it contains nothing against our confession, and that orally, since Bullinger did the same in writing. For Capito had once indicated this to me in letters. Nor do they write or speak about us out of love; for I do not know if there is anyone who despises us more. But let these things be. Take kindly what I pour out to you. I do not use the same freedom with others; for I know with whom I am conversing when I converse with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with yours and Utinger, my venerable friend. May the Lord keep you with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 9, 1535.</p>
      <p>They say the French king is gravely ill, the emperor is in Rome with the pope, etc.</p>
      <p>Let me know what you think about Melanchthon's booklets, etc.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, President of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
