      <p>C. S. C. through Christ Jesus sends greetings. The reason I have not responded sooner to your letter, most excellent and beloved Bullinger, is partly due to certain of my own occupations, and partly because I preferred to give my letter to our Laelius, who affirmed that he would be departing shortly. Therefore, since Laelius was preparing to return to you, I did not think it should be delayed. First, I thank you for writing to me about certain matters concerning the common affairs of the Swiss, about which I do not think it is necessary to say what seems to me now: rather, we should ask the Lord to turn the plans of men to His glory and the salvation and peace of the church. As for your written agreement with Johannes Calvin on the matter of the sacraments, what is it, my most excellent Bullinger, that you seek my judgment on? For I am not one who should pass judgment on such great men, nor, if something perhaps did not quite please me, could it now be changed, since whatever it is that has been transacted between you has been disseminated through almost all the churches. I know that this writing was sent from Geneva to England already a month ago. However, I will say this in general: I greatly approve of concord in the church, and especially among the teachers, which the clear and steadfast opinions of the divine scriptures approve and confirm: such as your agreement on the matter of the sacraments was, as far as I could understand from the writing itself, with a few exceptions which, if well and soberly understood, perhaps can bring no harm to religion. For I noticed that something foreign and strange was mixed into your custom of sincerity, not without some great artifice. They are called appendices of the gospel, seals, instruments: they are said to confirm, continue, and renew the communion of Christ Himself: certain goods are said to be conferred through them, Christ is said to be increased in us in some way while we use them: finally, the fruit, which perhaps did not exist in the very use of the sacraments, is deferred and brought forth to some unknown times. All of which, although, as I said, they can be excused by some reason, are nevertheless, unless I am mistaken, foreign to that simple custom of the divine scriptures, and such that if anyone wishes to defend them, he may fall into great perplexities, and not only useless, but also dangerous contentions for the church of God. But yet, as I say often, they can be excused by a favorable interpretation: which interpretation, since you bring it in your common writing, I accept and gladly embrace with you. And about these things, more than enough. I have nothing new that our dearest brother Laelius does not have. Therefore, you will learn everything from him, whether about English matters or others, or about ours, which seem to have some importance, whom, since you receive him back, I do not doubt will be dearer to you (with the sweetness of his genius and also the candor of his spirit).</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed and most beloved brother, and greet your entire most holy family in our name, to whom we wish all good things from the heart.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first day of September 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most friendly brother in the Lord, Coelius S[ecundus] C[urio].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent Antistes and most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
