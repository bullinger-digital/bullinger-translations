      <p>S. I received what you wrote to Lycosthenes, along with your letters to me, and our people immediately received similar news from England. Now, indeed, Mr. Wolfgang Wissemburg from Strasbourg, having returned from the margrave's baths, indicated that he understood: with the king indeed deceased, Mary has been appointed queen, but the course of religion will remain free as it has been until now, and what has been established will be maintained intact; for the young king of Scotland is to be married to Mary with the consent of the kingdom's nobles, and he himself is imbued with the doctrine of true piety, and it is not far off that Scotland may separate from the French, even for the sake of religion. These things, I say, he received from some of the city's nobles, which I did not want to keep from you. We must pray to the Lord that He may illuminate this world with the light of His Son and mercifully preserve it. Otherwise, there is deep silence here. Your son, along with Froschauer and his companion, missed the ship today, but will have another tomorrow; his talent and modesty are pleasing, so I hope he will engage in higher learning not without benefit and will someday be a pleasant comfort to your old age. Farewell well with your wife and all yours, whom I lovingly and respectfully bid to be well in my words. Basel, September 5th, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
