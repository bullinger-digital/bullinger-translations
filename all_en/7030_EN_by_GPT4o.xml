      <p>Greetings and Peace. Your letters were most pleasing to me, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, to which I respond later because I was expecting a certain messenger soon, through whom I could safely send both your ancient coins and my more detailed letters to you; for I do not consider everything to be entrusted to just anyone. However, due to the past storm full of winds and melting snows, he came to me later than I expected.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask your kindness to forgive the tardiness of the letters. I greatly fear that the outcome may confirm your prediction about the evils flowing upon us, and even more so because we continue more securely, plainly obstinate in all crimes. If someone compares the state of the people of God shortly before the Babylonian captivity and the destruction of the city of Jerusalem with the form of our age, they will find the times not much different. Since the ages are almost the same and God is the same hater and avenger of all impiety, a similar outcome is to be expected for us. May the Lord have mercy on us. This year, as far as I hear, Germany does not greatly fear the attack of the Turks, because in the previous year about one hundred and fifty thousand of them fell by sword and plague, and now their emperor is also entangled in civil war. Only let not all the strength of war be turned against the confessors of the divine name, whenever all the blame for misfortune is transferred to them by the antichrists, who, having first destroyed them, then trust that they will consume all the Turks with no or little trouble. May the best and greatest God protect His church in Lower Germany and everywhere on earth and scatter and break the wicked plans of the adversaries. Gotha of the Saxons is still surrounded by a siege (I do not know how necessary) and there is no hope of liberation yet, because the conditions of peace are not acceptable to those in the town. The state of our city is almost the same as before, both in religion and politics. The Augsburg Confession has almost the same authority among most as the Holy Scriptures, not to say anything more bitter. There is also a great scarcity and high price of all things (except wine, which we drink this year at a tolerable price) so that the poor can hardly sustain life, whose number increases more every day. Meanwhile, there are few who feel this is the hand of God and think about true repentance of life, which greatly discourages me. For the two ancient silver coins sent, I give you great thanks in my name and in the name of Occonus, most distinguished men, to whom this service of yours was very pleasing, and they in turn promise you their service both in other matters and in transmitting whatever you may request from their coins.</p>
      <p>The younger has three or four silver coins of Hadrian, but none with this inscription, which is seen on your Hadrian, which is rare in silver, frequent in bronze. Therefore, it would be more pleasing to him. C. Marius is not the one who started the civil war against Sulla, but one of the triumvirs under Augustus unknown to Occonus.</p>
      <p>After those men, who wish to greet you respectfully in their name, saw your coins, behold, I return them to you through a certain messenger with great thanks. You, in turn, ask from me and those most distinguished men, whatever you wish (which we have done more confidently by the right of our friendship) and you will find us not ungrateful. Balthasar Funccius, the consul, my uncle, asks to be respectfully remembered to you and earnestly requests that if there is any error in his booklet, which might offend you or otherwise require correction, it be amended by you or another minister of your church before it is committed to the press, than which nothing could be more pleasing to him and to you.</p>
      <p>My wife greets you with our daughters, to whom, along with the whole family and the ministers of your church, I also ask you to convey my many greetings. Farewell, remember me in your prayers to Christ. I commend my mother to you again, as I have already done before. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Memmingen, February 20, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Funccius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
