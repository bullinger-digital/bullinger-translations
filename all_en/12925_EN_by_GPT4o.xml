    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] From Myconius' letter of April 4 [No. 2873], which he received today, Bullinger can gather what kind of unrest this impure adulterer [Hans Wylle] has caused. Myconius knows how Bullinger judges such marriages and how much he had already disapproved of the marriage of the pastor Beat Gering, who was active in Bern. Gering married the woman [Agathe...], with whom he had betrayed his legitimate wife [Sabinella, née Buchser] and fathered a child, which led to the dissolution of his first marriage. He took the adulteress to Basel and from there to Strasbourg, where people were aware of the facts and approved the new marriage despite everything! The people of Zurich would never have done this! With them, an adulterer is not allowed to marry the woman with whom the adultery occurred. Consequently, the people of Basel do not make themselves guilty by not recognizing that marriage. For King David also had to hear the accusation that he had married and moreover killed! Even the most disgraceful papists do not recognize such marriages! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] If it is customary in Basel to excommunicate people who have committed such offenses, and if all those who had to decide on it passed this judgment, it cannot be sinful. In Zurich, this practice does not exist. Such people are punished by the magistrate according to the offense. However, the Lord's Supper remains open to them. Everyone must decide for themselves whether to participate or not. In Basel, it seems they proceed differently. One should always keep the prosperity of the church in mind. Rightly, therefore, one should ensure that such an outrage is punished! Myconius should read what Augustine wrote against the letter of Parmenianus, Book 3, Chapter 2! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Greetings to Markus Bertschi and all colleagues. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] The first news [about a second victory of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony], which Bullinger communicated from a letter of Vadian with the writing transmitted by the two young Zurichers [Johannes Buchter and Markus Wüst], is doubtful, especially since it is not confirmed elsewhere. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Greetings to the ailing Johannes Gast, who may soon recover. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings also to Francisco de Enzinas and Bernardino Ochino. </p>

      <p>S. D. I received your letter dated April 4 on the 6th of the same month, most esteemed man. I understood what kind of unrest that impure adulterer has caused. You ask what I think about that marriage and what I say about your advice and action. But you cannot be unaware of what I think about such a marriage, even from the case of Beat Gering (now a minister of the church in Bern), which was similar. I disapproved of the man's marriage as much as possible, which he contracted with the woman with whom he had committed adultery, whom he had impregnated, and because of whom his legitimate wife was torn away from his legitimate bed through divorce. For he took her with him to Basel, then to Strasbourg. The people of Strasbourg approved and ratified such a marriage (which they did not ignore what it was)! But we never ratified nor approved it! Therefore, you have committed no sin, who did not want to join in marriage an adulterer and an adulteress. Furthermore, it is accepted and practiced by law among us that no one is allowed to marry the woman with whom he committed adultery while his first wife was alive. For David also heard among other things: "You have killed and moreover taken her." The most disgraceful Roman popes said: "Let him not marry the one he defiled with adultery" (this was said by one who is openly impure; we believe the gospel!). But there is no need for me to show more that such marriages are illicit. You know it!</p>

      <p>Regarding excommunication, if it is customary among you to excommunicate such people, if all those concerned have agreed and passed judgment according to the accepted custom, I see nothing in which you have sinned. It is not our practice to excommunicate either these or similar ones. Such crimes and criminals are punished by the magistrate according to the nature of the offense. We leave the Lord's Supper open to all; we exclude no one except him who has excluded himself. But in your church, I think, the situation is different. See to it, brothers, that you always do what is edifying! You rightly ensure that this great crime is punished, if only for the sake of example! Read, I pray, what Augustine wrote against the letter of Parmenianus, Book 3, Chapter 2.</p>

      <p>I communicated through our boys what I had received from Mr. Vadian. However, I have always doubted the truth of the matter, and now even more so, since no other testimonies follow to confirm the first one. But let what is good in the eyes of the Lord be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am very sorry that Mr. Gast, our beloved brother, is ill. You will greet him faithfully. I will pray to the Lord to restore him to us soon.</p>

      <p>Farewell again with Mr. Dryander, Bernardino, and all the good ones. April 6, in the year of our Lord 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful minister of the church in Basel, his honorable lord and brother. Basel.</p>
