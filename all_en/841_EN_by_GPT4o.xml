      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I did not want to neglect the opportunity to write, dearest compater in the Lord, even though there is nothing that I necessarily need to write. By the grace of the Lord, we are all still safe, and there is nothing burdensome affecting my household, except that my wife cannot put aside the longing for our daughter who has gone to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that whatever inconvenience there is, will be alleviated over time, if not completely removed. That your people have allowed Mr. Johannes Haller, our compater, to serve this church is commendable and, as I hope, very beneficial for the church. As for my affairs, I am waiting to see how the people of Bern will consider my necessity. In the meantime, while I am staying here in Bern, Hervagius, the printer from Basel, sent me fifty florins, all of which I have spent beyond the Bernese stipend, and in addition, some from the remaining sum of my substance. If no insight occurs, it will soon be exhausted. I hope Mr. Haller, after his mission, will also consider my cause. But if he neglects me, the Lord will not. This is my hope. I hear sad news about the people of Strasbourg. A rumor is spreading here that on the day of purification, those unclean spirits, once cast out by the power of the word of Christ, have been received again into the house swept clean. If you have any certain information, I beg you to share it.</p>
      <p>The people of Augsburg have sent Mr. Claudius Peutinger to Rome to the Bishop of Augsburg. What the senate is planning, after the return of the envoys they sent to the Emperor last year, is not known, but it will soon become clear.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve His church. Farewell very well, dearest compater, along with the other lords and brothers. Greetings to your entire household in my name and that of my family.</p>
      <p>Bern, 16th February 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, dearest compater in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
