    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Bern are striving to do the best for the Reformed in Bremgarten, in accordance with Bullinger's wishes. Bullinger and Pellikan should continue with their widely appreciated Bible interpretations. Haller agrees with Bullinger's advice in No. 83 "De ratione studii," but complains about the lack of time and describes his daily routine. He concludes with remarks about some works sent to him by Bullinger and with the news of the death of Heinrich Wölflin.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What the people of Imontani threaten the brothers in Bremgarten with, I have reported to our people from the mouth of Sebastian, especially to Pandaretus Pastor, who is now acting as a delegate at the last four assemblies. Although they had not heard a word, after reading the articles of the assemblies, commonly called "den abscheid," they learned the same thing that Sebastian had reported. The letters of the people of Bremgarten were read, in which they committed themselves to the Quinquepagist papism, as well as what the pious fear, proposed in the dioceses. Hence, it was entrusted to the same delegates, namely Stürler and Pandaretus Pastor, to advise the Five Cantons and dissuade them from their plan. If they refuse, the matter should be settled by legal means. This is all we have done for your advice and as much as we could achieve.</p>
      <p>Therefore, regarding your letters, I cannot respond to each one individually due to lack of leisure. I would only advise you to continue assisting the same brothers with Pellicanus with the gifts with which both of you are abundantly endowed, as evidenced by what has been published. It will be important for both of you to help those who are unlearned and ignorant of languages, yet minister the word with pious zeal, with your skill in the scriptures, rather than showing off your learning to the learned, since only charity builds up and knows how to be all things to all people, while knowledge puffs up. Each of you should strive for brevity, yet in such a way that even the moderately pious or learned can immediately sense what the spirit of the Lord wants in the simplicity of the scriptures, and therefore what we should teach and on what occasion everything should be spread among the people. These are the things that many have desired for many years. May the Lord provide so that you may continue as successfully as possible. Our Zwingli abhorred publishing many commentaries, lest we become attached to them and delay our reading of the Bible without judgment. But since not everyone is able to go to Corinth and the majority is delayed from reading the Bible because it seems impassable without a guide, continue, continue, and communicate with me as far as each one has progressed. For I do not cease to advise the brothers to obtain this from God and finally from you.</p>
      <p>As for the "De ratione studii," which is excellent, how could it displease? But I fail in this, that through the tumult of all things and affairs, it is not possible to divide the days and hours in such a way. I am forced to claim the morning hours for the consistory on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and it is not enough to have assigned them to this, but when I return home, I am also forced to be a consultant exposed to all the country people, whatever they have ever had to do in the consistory. For it is our custom that everyone presents their affairs individually. Then there are three sermons to be made for everyone. When I have given my mind to these, I am sometimes forced to steal the night hours. You judge how much time is left for the regular reading of the Bible or the study of languages or histories. I am silent about the care of the churches, which distracts me so much, demands so many letters, that sometimes the mind and spirit fail, not to mention words. If you have anything by which you can help me thus overwhelmed, please advise.</p>
      <p>The booklet by Bertram, read from the beginning, pleased Farel so much that he took it upon himself. If Froschauer has more, let him send two or three, which I will pay for. I read what you sent about predestination, and at first glance, they could not displease. But they have not yet been weighed and judged by me so that I can respond to them with judgment. However, I will respond as soon as possible after I return home from the chapters. Sebastian will report his own and all other matters. He is most recommended to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich, and continue to love me as you have begun and do not cease.</p>
      <p>Our Lupulus has passed away.</p>
      <p>5th of May.</p>
      <p>Yours, as little as I am, Berch. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
