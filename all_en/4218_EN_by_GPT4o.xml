<letter xml:id="file4218"><body><div><p>Most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, recently some letters addressed to your lordship from Johann Abel were brought to me by post, which I would have gladly sent to you immediately if I had had the opportunity of a messenger, and therefore I ask you to attribute the delay of a few days to the lack of a messenger. From England, I still have no certain news about the queen's marriage; the son of the King of Sweden has returned to his father and, as I hear, has earned uncommon praise among all the orders of the Kingdom of England for his prudence, modesty, and generosity. The Emperor's envoy still remains in England; however, I do not know what he intends to accomplish.</p><p>The French oppress and afflict the Scots with unjust and arrogant domination, even though the Scots refuse to do nothing of what they owe by agreement and custom to their queen; however, the acceptance and profession of the gospel is the source and origin of this discord. There is great expectation among all about what end God will give to the French persecution. Recently in Spain, one hundred and twenty-four were burned in two executions, and although the king detested the extermination of such good men and wished to convene a national council, the inquisitors and papists informed him that matters which had once been condemned by the authority and judgment of general councils should not be brought back into new deliberation and dispute; that his father Charles had made and encouraged the Lutherans more insolent by leniency and softness; these incurable and corrupting members should have been cut off with the sword long ago, and if he wishes to clear his father from suspicion, he must counter this contagion with sword and fire. In Antwerp, cruel savagery is also being exercised against the pious, and now they are being drowned to save wood. I ask you to commend me to Peter Martyr and your son-in-law; my duties towards you will remain constant forever. Strasbourg, February 20, 1560.</p><p>Christopher Mont.</p><p>The Emperor is said to be in Breslau now for the marriage</p></div></body>.</letter>
