      <p>Greetings. With a unique event, the Lord of things has provided that my third son out of four is summoned to England. It seemed fitting, as he departs and returns from me, that I give you my letter, which I write to Mr. Edmund, to be read by you and at the same time to ask that you do not hesitate to commend the young man to him in my name. For I remember that you showed me his letter to you and that the man, of better repute, has been well known to you for a long time, from which it happened that the opportunity presented to me concerning my Dithelm was considered a divine benefit.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us, in which farewell, my venerable and dear Bullinger. On my estate, 15 days before the calends of September 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church of ZÃ¼rich, ornament of Switzerland, his particularly esteemed lord and friend.</p>
