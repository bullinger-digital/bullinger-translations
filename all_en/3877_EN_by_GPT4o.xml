      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote about the Lausanne affair on the 24th of this month, on which day many, relenting in their obstinacy, agreed to the concessions of the senate. Now, therefore, I will reveal what was further done on the morrow, what catastrophe followed, and what the present state of these matters is. On the 25th of February, some remained to be examined, but they were the most obstinate of all.</p>
      <p>For when they learned from those who were examined on the 24th what had been done with them, they conspired anew, as it were, not to consent, but rather to choose exile, and they also caused some of those who had consented the previous day to be troubled in conscience, so that we could hardly restrain them from returning to the senate and still asking for exile with the rest. Thus it happened that nine or ten of the principal ones preferred to go into exile rather than consent to the concessions of the princes (as they call our senate). As for the professors who remained, namely Ribittus, Tagaultius, Beraldus, and Randonus (for Merlin had already been dismissed after Beza), they requested an amicable dismissal.</p>
      <p>This was granted to them, provided, however, that, as they also promised, they would remain until Pentecost. They say they cannot abandon the common cause of the brethren and be in the church with a good conscience, lacking that ecclesiastical discipline. After these matters, the senate wanted us to choose others in place of the proscribed.</p>
      <p>But since not all the Savoyard ministers are as well known to us as the Germans, it was decreed yesterday that a delegation should be sent there, and the deans and jurors of the remaining classes or chapters of the Savoyards, that is, all the visitors, should be convened, so that suitable persons may be chosen from each class to be appointed over these churches. Two senators are being sent, along with Mr. Musculus, Benedictus Aretius, and myself, who are tasked with also inspecting the state of the school and considering how it can be retained and newly instructed. Meanwhile, Viret has written to the senate, and very gently, so that he seems not far from agreement. Therefore, before we proceed there, he will be called here so that both the senate and we may deal with him, if perhaps he can still be retained: and there is still hope, if agreement can be persuaded to him, that by his authority all the others may also be brought back. But what will happen, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Mr. Nicolaus von Diesbach, now acting as consul, earnestly prays that you, through this messenger who brings these to you, will also write to Viret, and urge him to concord and agreement together with us. He believes, as we also think, that your authority will have great influence with him.</p>
      <p>I therefore also ask you to write to him and send the letters to me through this messenger. I wish Mr. P. Martyr would do the same.</p>
      <p>For since they always cite his writings and authority against us, we in turn cite his example to them, that in the Zurich church, lacking this discipline no less than our church, he remains peaceful and tranquil, does not stir up any unnecessary disturbances, nor institutes such offenses and desolation as they have before them. But so that you may also understand the concessions of the princes, and that we have some discipline, indeed greater and more severe than I have seen in any Zurich churches, I will write what we have and what has also been granted to them. We have in each parish, not only urban but also rural, so to speak, consistories which are to us ecclesiastical senates. In these are appointed a minister with four others, in some six or eight, elders, according to the size of the churches. All of them are bound by oath to watch over the offenses of the church and to restrain them. These consistories also have the power to call all those who seem less instructed in religion, and who either do not know how to pray or recite the Lord's commandments and the creed. They are allowed to examine, instruct, and exhort them there, and prescribe periods of time for them to learn. No one is exempt from the power of these consistories.</p>
      <p>Only this the senate does not want, that all (whether their faith is certain or not) be generally examined there, but only the rude and unskilled, lest this examination eventually degenerate into auricular confession again. Then they also have this further power, to call all those who offend the churches with public crimes, fornicators, drunkards, usurers, bloodthirsty soldiers, etc., and to admonish and dissuade them, and moreover to advise (note well this word advise, for it is expressly granted to them), that if they do not wish to change their ways, they should not approach the Lord's Supper: for it is better for them not to approach than to eat judgment to themselves by unworthily partaking.</p>
      <p>However, they do not want anyone to be forced, or any violence to be done to anyone's conscience after that admonition is made: but if anyone wishes to approach after such admonition, professing repentance, he is to be admitted, yet so that the consistory may observe him more diligently thereafter than before, and if it finds him either speaking against the consistory and its assessors or those ecclesiastical constitutions, or thereafter defiling himself again with his former crime, it is to report this to the prefect of the place, who, under penalty of losing his office, is to send him here to the senate, where a decision will be made about him according to the nature of the offense. And so that the authority of these consistories may also be greater, they want the prefects, wherever possible, to be present with them and to support their authority. You see there is some discipline in our churches, as many of them complain. They could be content with this until the Lord grants something more perfect.</p>
      <p>But they prefer to abandon the churches and institute such offenses, and to bring such infamy upon the pious magistrate, who received and nurtured them as exiles and almost beggars. Under whose shadow they fled from a severe storm, they now tear them apart and stir up such disturbances for them. Nor would it be impossible to obtain more from the senate, if it saw them rightly using these concessions. But since we daily experience how they use their inquisition not only against the unskilled, but against anyone, however pious and learned and of blameless life, who does not approve all their or Calvin's sayings and writings in the matter of predestination, but requires greater moderation, this makes both the senate and us fear tyranny. I could recount to you many remarkable things they have done under this concession, so that it is a wonder the princes do not take away all the power previously granted to them. We are also troubled by that sacramentarian schism, which once miserably vexed and exercised this church. For what would have been done at that time, if the mere power of excommunication had been in the hands of the ministers? Surely all who thought rightly would have been excommunicated and the Lutheran error would have been established. And if such a thing should happen again (which may the Lord avert), you see how much the truth would be in danger. For unless the senate had retained it here by its authority, it would already have been lost.</p>
      <p>We also still hold in memory what these same Lausannese then disputed about the superiority of ministers, that the minister was above all, etc. Therefore, there are reasons why the pious magistrate (whose piety in this very cause and action I have come to know so that I cannot but praise it) does not want to grant all and full power to their discretion. But I digress too far.</p>
      <p>They have chosen exile rather than these concessions. They pretext conscience, and the word of the Lord, the institution of Christ, the apostolic example.</p>
      <p>They say they cannot with a good conscience administer the supper to those whose faith is not certain to them. That the wicked should not only be punished by the magistrate, but also restrained by the church and its ministers, that the holy should not be cast to dogs, and other such things. You would not hear any of them speaking well of their church.</p>
      <p>To them all are dogs.</p>
      <p>If they had Corinthian churches, they would have excommunicated not only the incestuous, but all others as well, and would have so purged it that, considering the vices of that church, I cannot see whether they would have retained anyone in the church, even one at least. But I am excessive.</p>
      <p>This cause vexes me greatly.</p>
      <p>Therefore I am more verbose.</p>
      <p>I beg you to pardon me.</p>
      <p>You have other more necessary things to do.</p>
      <p>But I cannot help but pour into your bosom what troubles me. I still beg you to write to Viret.</p>
      <p>For which reason this messenger is sent by the senate, I still do not know while I write this. The Lord Lieutenant from the senate informed me through an apparitor that a courier is to be sent to Zurich, so that if I wish to write anything, I may write. Therefore, I have poured this out rather than written it.</p>
      <p>I always commend myself and our churches to you. Mr. Diesbach, Haller, Hag, Tillger, Steiger, my father-in-law, mother, Musculus, and all the brothers greet you. Bern, the last day of February 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>I do not have time to write to my brother now.</p>
      <p>I would like you to share this with him, so that he may also know the catastrophe of this matter, about which I also wrote to him before. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his perpetual lord and compatriot to be honored.</p>
