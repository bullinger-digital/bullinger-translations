      <p>Greetings. Your letter, most illustrious and honorable Lord Bullinger, has been and remains most welcome and dear to me. I am truly grateful that my efforts and assistance, which I offer to your nephews, are appreciated by your kindness and by Lord Gwalther, both most illustrious and learned men. I will strive, my Lord Bullinger, to ensure that your approval is not in vain. I love the young men for their integrity, and I embrace them greatly for their talent and diligence, and thus I promise myself everything from them. I have written about their studies to Lord Gwalther; it will be your judgment; you, whatever pleases you, will freely advise according to your right, which you have over your sons and also over us; we will, God willing, prove ourselves both men and obedient. I have already received from you, dearest and most kind Lord Bullinger, two commentaries or homilies, one on the true conversion of man, the other, in which the principal points of our religion are briefly taught and a response is given to Brentius's Testamentum inofficiosum. For these gifts, I give you great thanks; your writings greatly assist me at this time, when our church, most miserably trampled, is almost entirely torn apart by some. That you responded so openly, succinctly, solidly, and modestly to the Brentian calumnies is not as dear and pleasing to us as it is troublesome to the adversaries; for they have been deprived of the opportunity to respond, and many good men are attracted to the reading of your writings because of your modesty. Therefore, I greatly praise your undertaking. I gave 10 or 15 copies of that response, which Lord Froschouer gave me, as a gift to my fellow citizens and other friends; I hope I have not attempted this matter unsuccessfully. But I speak more freely than is proper.</p>
      <p>I earnestly and repeatedly beg you, most kind and learned Lord Bullinger, to forgive me and my liberty.</p>
      <p>Written in Heidelberg on the 13th day before the calends of 1571. Your most devoted Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety, learning, and wisdom, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his honorable lord, etc. In Zurich.</p>
