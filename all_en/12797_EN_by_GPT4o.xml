    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Serin takes the opportunity presented by the messenger [...] to inquire whether Bullinger has received his last letter from November 5, 1546 [HBBW XVIII, No. 2660] with important news. It seems strange to him that he has heard nothing from Bullinger since his letter of September 4 [HBBW XVII, No. 2565] with the dispatch of Rudolf Gwalther's "Endtchrist".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should not think that due to the agreement between the Ulm council and Emperor Charles V, the Ulm preachers have had to endure anything bad or that anything has changed in the matter of religion. For the emperor's hands are tied due to the contractual arrangement until a so-called free, Christian council decides on it. However, this is of no use at all to the former colleague [Serin himself?] of Martin Frecht in Dillingen! Some nobles and canons from the entourage of the Bishop of Dillingen [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] wanted to arrest him at night in his house in the Ulm area, but did not find him and therefore left him a message that the bishop would certainly take revenge on him because he had committed the "crime" of preaching in the territory of Dillingen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There is hardly any other news. Vadian will certainly have communicated the news from the people of Ulm and from Johannes Brenz. There are such vague rumors circulating about Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse that one might consider these two rather than the emperor to be dead!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings and a request for prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] It is just reported that the emperor is soon to come to Ulm. May the Lord stand by us!</p>

      <p>Greetings, most reverend Bullinger, along with your entire college.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Although I try to restrain myself from bothering you too often with my letters, I could not resist taking advantage of the messenger's convenience to ask whether you have received the letter I sent you on November 5th. It seems strange to me that I have heard nothing from you since your letter of September 4th, in which you sent me "Antichrist" by Rudolf Gwalther. I therefore ask you, out of your kindness, to inform me. In my last letter, I conveyed to you some matters that are somewhat important for you to know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, I wanted to write to you so that you do not think that because the Ulm council has reached an agreement with Emperor Charles V, we preachers have suffered any adversity or that the state of religion has been somewhat altered. For the emperor cannot attempt anything in these matters due to the agreement until a so-called free and Christian council decides on it. However, this peace agreement is of little help to the good man who was Martin Frecht's colleague in Dillingen. Some nobles and canons from the entourage of the Bishop of Dillingen sought to arrest him at night in his house in the Ulm area this week. And, since they did not find him, they left a message with the neighbors, some of whom he knows well, that the bishop would be an open enemy to him and would certainly take revenge because he committed the "crime" of preaching in the territory of Dillingen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have little other news that I think would be unheard of to you. However, I assume that Vadian has shared with you the news from our people and from Johannes Brenz. Regarding the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, we know so little that you might sooner believe them to be deceased than the emperor.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and praise and invoke the Lord with us, that He may preserve us. Ulm, January 11th, 1547. Leonhard Serin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Shortly after these were written, we were informed that the emperor is soon to come here. May the Lord, in His immense mercy, turn all things to good and be with us, guiding, guarding, and preserving us!</p>
      <p>To the illustrious in piety and doctrine and most deserving of all theology candidates and indeed the entire Church of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, a brother in the Lord, much beloved and esteemed. Zurich.</p>
