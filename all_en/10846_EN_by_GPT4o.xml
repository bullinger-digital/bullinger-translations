    <p xml:id="regest1">The enclosed letter [No. 772] was returned to him by [Konrad Hermann, known as] Schlupfindheck, after the Zurich messenger [...] Zeller, to whom it was handed over by Heinrich Rubli, lost it on the way; Bullinger should be cautious of this messenger. The people of Freiburg want to take Bern to court over the defamation of sovereignty symbols, primarily concerning claims in the Bern-occupied Diocese of Lausanne, where Bern appointed a bailiff and, to Freiburg's displeasure, installed [Pierre] Viret as a preacher; the arbitration procedure according to the treaty could be detrimental to Bern. The Duke [of Savoy] trusts that Emperor [Charles V] will emerge strengthened from the conflict with the French King [Francis I] and does not consider himself defeated. The people of Bern are suffering from increasing taxes; apart from the free preaching of the Gospel, the expansion of their territory has brought hardly any advantages, but has only aroused desires. He reminds of his concern regarding the appointment of Sebastian [Meyer]: Everything must be done to ensure that he stays in Bern to support Kaspar Megander and [Peter] Kunz. Sebastian [Meyer] will write himself soon.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There are many reasons, my dearest Bullinger, that should and can frequently prompt me to write. But I do not know by what fate it happens that what I undertake in this matter turns out less satisfactorily. For I rarely hear from messengers, or only when I am very busy, and the letters written and sent do not always, as I see, reach you. For if you do not know: The letters I enclose here I recently received from Konrad Schlupfindheck, found in an open field somewhere, as he reported, discovered by a peasant and tossed through the hands of many until they were finally delivered to him. When he returned them to me, it caused no small amount of surprise and distress, as I had entrusted them to the public messenger of your city through your local boy Heinrich Rubli, thinking they could not be more securely delivered by anyone else. However, whether he lost them through negligence or deliberately discarded them elsewhere, they were certainly opened and made public, from which certain danger or harmful suspicion could have arisen for both of us if I had written anything offensive in appearance on the papers. I mention this so that you may either kindly warn this messenger (called Zeller) or be cautious of him in the future, lest you unknowingly betray serious matters when dealing with friends, and your friends elsewhere stumble if he continues to handle your matters negligently.</p>
      <p>There is indeed no news, except what has long been publicly proclaimed. The people of Freiburg are perpetually the same, deceitfully plotting from all sides for our ruin. They intend to accuse us of having removed their symbols of sovereignty from certain villages, which are still disputed, especially in those places where they had intended to protect the Bishop of Lausanne from our injuries. For if you do not know: The entire territory of that bishop and all the rights that Lausanne had have been occupied by us, as he openly aided our enemies with counsel, supplies, and assistance. Therefore, an official from our senate has been appointed there from among the citizens, and Pierre Viret has been designated to preach the word, which I believe you can imagine greatly displeases the people of Freiburg. Thus, they will rightfully attempt to vindicate both their own and their bishop's injury, to whom our people have pledged their support, although I greatly fear that we may lose the case. For according to the treaty, four judges, two from each territory, theirs and ours, are appointed, among whom if they cannot agree on a verdict, the accuser chooses an arbitrator from their own, and if this happens in this case, who doubts that the decision will be against us? But more on this when I receive more certain information.</p>
      <p>I hear that peace is being negotiated between the Emperor and the French King. Whether it is achieved or the French King is defeated by arms, we are likely to face war, let alone uncertain victory, with the increasing power of the Emperor. Relying on this, the Duke is abundantly confident, as he is so alienated from more equitable peace terms, clearly declaring his intention, as if victorious, to give, not receive peace, abundantly showing that he wishes to keep it free and intact for himself to attempt and attack again on any occasion, and that he makes no loss of the region pledged in so many ways. Innumerable taxes are daily demanded from our people, which already amount to over 7600 florins assigned, besides unknown new creditors undoubtedly emerging daily. If the magistrates annually decide to pay all these, as is necessary, it is certain that the miserable will be tormented by heavy exactions, especially in this poverty of our treasury, so that I am indeed convinced that apart from the propagation of the Gospel, we have achieved nothing good with this expansion of territory and empire, and I fear it will be the first cause and occasion of calamity. You know what the multitude of prefectures, that is, the nourishment of idle men, has hitherto inconvenienced us, nor do you miss the desires that have found occasion and material to be promoted. I wish you knew how even the pious, whom we judged, present themselves with great offense. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord that this success may not be an obstacle to His glory and the Gospel, and ruinous to the fatherland.</p>
      <p>What I recently advised about Sebastian through the schoolmaster, I ask you not to neglect. For it is, in my view, of the utmost importance, as it is the only way I see to provide for our church. He is a holy, serious, learned man, made to retain the benevolence among brothers, with a character so candid and so free from all arrogance that no one can hate him unless they are most malevolent. Add to this the authority he wonderfully wields with the senate and the people, more easily achieving everything with common effort, which, if ever before, certainly in these times, innumerable things need to be corrected, restored, and preserved. Megander treats him with enough affection, but I do not know if he is vigilant enough to ensure he stays with us, whom he also publicly approved by his own judgment. Therefore, I alone roll this stone, certain that the senate will spare neither effort nor expense to retain him here with his wife and children. But, as I said, since he is uncertain, he must be earnestly encouraged by the brothers to obey the calling Lord. He is more patient in labor than either Kaspar or Kunz, as I discover from domestic acquaintance.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest father and patron; if you write back, even briefly.</p>
      <p>On the 24th of April, 1536.</p>
      <p>Sebastian greets you, from whom, unless he had been overwhelmed with business, you would have received letters. But he will write at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Sulzer, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Take it in good part; for I have written without revision.</p>
