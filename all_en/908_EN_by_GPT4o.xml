      <p>Everything that is happening here, most illustrious and esteemed bishop, I have written extensively elsewhere, not so much to you as to my teacher, Master Bibliander. And although I have not yet received any response, since I entrusted my letters to trustworthy people, I cannot doubt that they have reached you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, from the point where I left off in my last letters, I will recount what has happened here: and first of all, regarding public affairs. The peace between the French, the Scots, and the English, long desired, was proclaimed in London on March 29. Boulogne was returned around April 24. The French paid half of the agreed sum.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have three hostages from France remaining with us. Some of them are being converted to Christ.</p>
      <p>We are expecting some French nobles who will confirm the peace. May God grant that it be perpetual! There is great change here, but, thanks to God, for the better, as far as the matter of religion is concerned.</p>
      <p>Duke Somerset was honorably received into the order of counselors around April 9. We are expecting a more thorough reformation of the church in the next parliament, which has been postponed to October. Master Hooper is working much and usefully in the church of Christ; from whom you could learn all about his situation, if he had time to write. The messenger is pressing, and he is not at home: therefore, I will write as much as I know about his affairs.</p>
      <p>His Lenten sermons before the king were very free and useful. He has stirred up some idle nobles and bishops against him, especially because he urged the king and counselors towards a more thorough reformation of the church. However, the king received everything with a most grateful mind, as he later declared: for he offered him the bishopric of Gloucester through the chancellor on April 7; but Hooper refused to accept it unless the bishopric was granted to him free from superstitions.</p>
      <p>This was difficult to obtain, as the bishops strongly opposed, wanting to defend the vestments and inventions through creatures. However, he obtained victory beyond all men's expectations on May 15. Therefore, he is now the bishop of Gloucester, soon to move to his bishopric. He plans to visit his parents during these upcoming holidays. Then, having returned here, he will go to Gloucester, God willing. I pray to the Lord that he may uproot and plant for the benefit of the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>These days, having finished Daniel, he is reading the prophet Nahum; when he finished that, he began the prophet Zechariah on May 5. He received your letters and the decades from the king on April 22. He then offered the king a book splendidly adorned on April 25; how pleasing it was to the king, you may learn better from Hooper himself later. Your name is beginning to be pleasing to the Archbishop of Canterbury, as far as I understand.</p>
      <p>John a Lasco arrived in England on May 13. He came most welcome to all the pious.</p>
      <p>He has decided to stay in London and establish a German church, of which he will be the superintendent. And indeed, it is a matter of utmost necessity, that the word of God may sound here in German to avert the heresies that are being introduced by our people. There are many Arians, Marcionists, Libertines, Danitists, and similar monsters. In these days, namely May 2, a certain woman was burned alive for denying the incarnation of Christ. The people of Bremen and the remaining churches are fortifying themselves: but they are more broken by private dissensions in the cause of religion than by external force.</p>
      <p>They are disputing among themselves about the descent of Christ into hell, about receiving or abolishing adiaphora (indifferent things). The cunning of the antichrist is astonishing in undermining the churches of Christ. Our king is of such piety that he could be a miracle to the whole world. He has instituted everything for the propagation of the glory of God. He has a sermon every Sunday, which he used to have during Lent. Would that the bishops would burn with zeal together with the nobility.</p>
      <p>The book of Peter Martyr on the Lord's Supper could not be printed in English by the bishops, even those who are evangelical. Master Cox is no longer the king's tutor: he is the dean of Westminster Church; and if he recovers (for he has been very dangerously ill these days), there is a rumor that he will be made Bishop of Winchester.</p>
      <p>Thus, the impious bishops are being replaced by the pious: although in this matter, indeed, nothing is yet certain, as far as I know.</p>
      <p>I wrote elsewhere about a certain man from Zurich captured here and condemned to death for a slight (as I understand) offense. We, having used all diligence, obtained his release from the king, which costs four English pounds. This money is being collected by good men as alms. His name is Valentin Wermelin. If you know his parents, and they are well, we would wish that money to be sent back to the Flemish church here, which is collecting it and paid for him. He remains in prison for a few more days.</p>
      <p>He promises everything better. We are sending him back to you. He seems to be a noble person. Johannes Stumphius is a very upright and studious young man. I commend his piety to you very much. Whatever is spent on him is not lost, but will return to the church with much interest. Master Utenhovius stays with Master Hooper and is in good health: he was too busy to write: meanwhile, he commends himself to you very much. Lady Anna, Hooper's wife, is not at home: she has moved to the house of a certain noblewoman near the city to take the air.</p>
      <p>I have nothing special from her, except that she is in very good health with her little daughter: nor do I have time to visit her now because of the importunity of the messenger. The wife of Driander is now in London, to go up to Germany to her husband.</p>
      <p>May you deign to commend me to your wife, Master Pellican, Bibliander, Gesner, my esteemed teachers; also to Froschauer, Master Johannes Frisius and Sebastian, and our other friends. Joanna asks you to count a crown in the name of Master Zinckius: she will take care to have it returned to you through Master Hooper. She commends herself entirely to you and your family. Farewell. London, May 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>I do not have time to reread; the messenger is pressing. Your sincerely devoted servant, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
