      <p>S. D. For your benefit, my excellent compater, I have written two letters, one addressed to Beza, the professor of the Lausanne school, and the other to Mr. Sulcer, the minister of the Basel school. Beza wrote a letter of three pages, in which he explained his entire journey; for he had gone as an envoy to the German princes to request that they send ambassadors to the King of France to plead for the captives. He recounts, therefore, how he was received and what response he received, namely that the princes would send to the king.</p>
      <p>But we do not know whether they have sent or not.</p>
      <p>He then recounts how he turned to Worms, what he discussed there with the evangelical interlocutors, and that he is hopeful that if we come to a colloquium, concord can be achieved with them. Therefore, he considers it worthwhile if we request a colloquium from them.</p>
      <p>He says the sacramental cause hinges on these three points: 1. They assert that the true body of Christ is joined with the bread; 2. And that so really, that whoever receives the bread, whether believers or unbelievers, also receives the body of Christ; 3. The nature of the glorified body is such that it is not circumscribed, and the nature of Christ's body exalted to the right hand is not circumscribed, but is simultaneously in heaven, on earth, everywhere. And Brentius openly asserts the ubiquity of Christ's body, yet not many agree with him on this matter. He also sends the confession, which he presented in the name of the French churches to the learned in Worms. All these are lengthy; however, you have what we have replied to him.</p>
      <p>Then Sulcer writes to me and my fellow ministers in his and their name, indicating that there is hope for a future colloquium; if it is to be held (although nothing is certain yet) and we are invited to it, he asks if we will come. We respond to him, as you see; but when you have read this, return it safely, so that it does not get lost on the way or fall into malicious hands. You will also share this with Mr. Philipp, whom you will greet most amicably.</p>
      <p>Both of you, however, should ensure that these matters are not spread, and finally, that you use them prudently, so that no offense arises from them, etc.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from Picardy, except that some say the king fought there unsuccessfully, others deny and refute it; however, they say that in the field of Ferrara, the men of the French faction fought successfully. I am waiting to see what is true, waiting for the limping messenger.</p>
      <p>I still have some things to share about the colloquium in Worms. There is so much of it that I cannot quite manage; I could almost write myself crooked and lame; for there is never any rest. Farewell together with friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 14, 1558.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Chur church, my compater and most beloved brother. To the preacher at Chur at St. Martin, Mr. Hans Schmid.</p>
