      <p>S. The reason I am writing to you now, esteemed lord and brother Bullinger in Christ, is this: A certain girl was brought to the governor of your district, where I preside over the church, a few weeks ago from the Sequani (a region in Gaul), a beggar, not entirely of sound mind, yet not completely insane, you might say she embodies simplicity and innocence, so lame that she cannot even walk a step. She knows well how to handle and work with flax and hemp and has diligently practiced this with the governor; otherwise, she enjoys and occupies herself with dolls, as girls do who have not yet outgrown childhood.</p>
      <p>When the governor learned from her that she claimed to be from Zurich, he kept her until my arrival and asked me to hear her. She told me she was the daughter of a certain Jacob Ziegler, a baker who had lived (while he was alive) in the New Market; her mother was of Conrad Grebel... whose father was executed in Zurich in the Fish Market for French bribes and corruption. She had been taken to the Baths of the Margrave of Baden with the hope of being cured; but the hope was in vain. From there, she was led around for a long time and treated most miserably in many places.</p>
      <p>She finally cried out to the governor, imploring: "O my dear grandfather, do not leave me under the linden trees and help me back to Zurich." When I asked how she became lame, she replied that the notorious witch and sorceress Studler, who was executed among you, confessed under torture that she had bewitched her to be lame in the eighth year, and this illness befell her in the very year she had predicted; for before that, she had been healthy and unharmed. Having heard this, I asked the governor, since he was sufficiently endowed by the Lord and had only one son, not to cast out the most miserable girl; the fair was approaching, to which many citizens of Zurich would come, from whom we could both inquire whether what she said was true or not: if we found out how things stood, we would easily find a way to help her.</p>
      <p>He complied and has treated the girl so liberally and humanely with his whole family that she seems to have become another person. May the Lord reward such a pious deed with grace.</p>
      <p>We both met citizens of your area at the fair and learned that either everything or most of it was true. Therefore, we consulted a lot among ourselves on how we could ensure she is brought to you.</p>
      <p>Finally, it seemed to us that the magistrate should be addressed, which we did. He wrote letters to your most holy council, which I decided to send to you, since I know your intercession carries singular weight and it is not the least part of our duty to care for the poor, to work for the miserable girl so that she may be brought back to you as soon as possible. I have praised your benevolence towards the poor magnificently to our magistrate and stated with certainty that once you learn of this, you will act at the earliest opportunity to help the girl. Here, many prayers are not needed, I know well, as it would be like spurring a horse that is already running. The young men you recommended to us have arrived.</p>
      <p>In Marburg, they were in great (as it seems) freedom, so that they seem reluctant to bear our yoke unless seriously admonished by you. Otherwise, I do not doubt they are of liberal minds.</p>
      <p>We have arranged for them to stay with Doctor Jacob Wecker, a respectable and not unlearned man, who has the stepdaughter of the late Grynaeus, an excellent woman, as his wife, so that they are in an honorable family and near the church and college. Furthermore, we will endeavor (with God's help) that, if they wish to obey us, they do not waste time, otherwise, you will be informed in due time. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 18, in the year of human salvation 1559. Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and best man, Heinrich Bullinger, servant of Jesus Christ among the people of Zurich, his lord and brother, always to be honored in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
