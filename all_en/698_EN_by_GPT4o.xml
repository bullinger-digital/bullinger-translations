      <p>Greetings. Know that I have returned safely to my wife and children.</p>
      <p>However, I am angry with myself for not having thanked you, Gwalther, and Gesner in person for the books you gave and partly inscribed and dedicated to me. My mind was somewhat distracted by the presence of that man whom you know; but I hope my journey will be successful. The story about the baker in Vienna, Austria, who recently threw the sacrament of the Lord's Supper into the mud and trampled it, is very true; for soon I will send you both the name of the author and the details of the event. The Emperor was certainly seen not long ago riding a horse in Antwerp, but he was unwell; as I hear, he intends to take special care of the wood and then return to Germany; whether he has accomplished this yet is still unknown. He is indeed planning something significant; for he is gathering money from everywhere. They say King Ferdinand is displeased that the right of the empire might be taken from him after the Emperor's death. Things are going badly in Augsburg; for the senate is now solely concerned with how to abolish the purity of the gospel and fully restore the papacy.</p>
      <p>I commend Marcellus Theodericus to you; he is certainly a thrifty man. As for his acting as a mercenary, it seems he does so in the manner of the Emperor's soldiers, whom Saint John the Baptist did not entirely reject or condemn; for they were the servants of a pagan leader. I ask you not to hesitate to forward the enclosed to him. Farewell and convey my greetings to the lords consuls, the prothonotary, and the entire choir of the Muses.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, let it not be hidden from you that a certain woman from the patricians of Zurich bathed with me in the baths, from whom I learned quite clearly that your leaders are eager to reform the Zurich magistracy after the model of the Augsburgers; therefore, watch out for serpents in your bosom, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, former head of the church in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend, to be delivered.</p>
