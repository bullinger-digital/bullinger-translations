    <p xml:id="regest1">Diethelm Keller still owes part of his penalty for insulting Bucer; Myconius is to ask the Basel council to intercede for him. In Pilsen, princes and bishops [of the Nuremberg Alliance] have gathered, and King Ferdinand might also join them; however, he might rather travel [to the Schmalkaldic League meeting] in Frankfurt, as the electors present there want to negotiate with him personally rather than with his envoys. The evangelical sea cities are arming themselves; Nuremberg is suspected of having delegations with both parties.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You know, my esteemed Myconius, that Diethelm Keller was fined by our most illustrious council for some foolish papers posted against Bucer on the first of May in the year 1538, both in body and in money. For he paid 50 pounds or 25 guilders; he is now compelled to pay an additional 15 guilders or forfeit his stipend. Here I would like to ask you to obtain letters from the most illustrious council of Basel, which would intercede for the poor and foolish young man. I wish you would send me the letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the assembly in Pilsen in Bohemia, you are not unaware, I suppose, that it is famous even for the presence of princes; for they say that Ludwig, Duke of Bavaria, Heinrich of Brunswick, and then several wealthy bishops, whose leader is the Cardinal of Salzburg, a cunning man born to weave schemes, are there. They also say that Ferdinand will come there, unless it is more likely that he prefers to go to Frankfurt; for he is said to have been summoned there by the three electors of Saxony, the Palatinate, and Brandenburg. For they did not want to hear Bernhard, the Cardinal of Trent, sent by Ferdinand, nor a certain one from Lund, who bears the title of Bishop of Constance, adding the condition that unless he himself comes, they will hear no one in his name. The evangelical sea cities are preparing themselves with arms, artillery, and supplies. Some suspect the people of Nuremberg because they have delegations with both parties. May the Lord do what is conducive to the glory of His name and the safety of the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with Grynaeus, a most beloved man. March 13, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, his most dear brother.</p>
