      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Who among us, dearest brothers, would not want to be called pious, faithful, and vigilant and prudent ministers according to Christ's commendation, if not all the churches' concerns torment us? Therefore, since I see the root and fomentation of all evils attempting to infiltrate our churches, namely the corruption of the princes, I am not at all weary of informing you of the state of affairs with us. French gold does not hesitate to boast publicly in our city that within a few days Zurich has both made and confirmed a treaty with King Francis again. Although we do not doubt that these are blatant lies (for we promise ourselves far different things from holy and sincere Zurich than this foolishness, not to mention this nefarious crime), this is the method and the only means by which they try to persuade us of the same. They may indeed try, but in vain, which I can certainly promise you from God. Therefore, dearest brothers, if anyone among you whispers or boasts differently about our people, do not believe them and diligently ensure that these warlike men, who are neither useful nor honorable to our country, do not have a place among you. Moreover, the state of our church is most holy and so sacred that there is nothing I would desire in it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, 25th of May, in the year 32.</p>
      <p>C. Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the word in Zurich, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, and Erasmus Fabricius, his dearest brothers.</p>
