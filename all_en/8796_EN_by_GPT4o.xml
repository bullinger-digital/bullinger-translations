      <p>Honorable, dearly beloved sir and especially trusted, dear friend, since I have to write to my servant in the city about what needs to be done, I have not been able to send you this letter along with my friendly greetings and service, and I also ask you, if any news should come to you in the meantime, to inform me of it; for I am very concerned. Hans Vogler did write from Augsburg the other day and reported that he could not write much news this time, except that things did not go according to the papists' wishes everywhere; but he does not report how or what. Otherwise, I have nothing at this time that I could accomplish by writing. I hereby commend you to the grace of God.</p>
      <p>In haste from Uster, the last day of February. Your faithful Ulrich Philipp von Sax, Freiherr 1572.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, my dearly beloved friend.</p>
