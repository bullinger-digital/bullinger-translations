      <p>S. D. Some Swiss soldiers make us sad, who came this week from the Guise's camp and report for certain that after the admiral left Orléans and went to Normandy to the English, Guise destroyed all the bridges behind him and thus prevented him from returning to Orléans, which he meanwhile besieged, bombarded with great artillery, and finally captured, taking a few prisoners, freeing captives, and killing all the faithful to the last man.</p>
      <p>Although I hope for better things, the example of Rouen still frightens me.</p>
      <p>I would indeed prefer to die than to hear that Orléans, in which there are so many saints, is being stormed by that wolf.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you love us, write quickly what has happened in Orléans.</p>
      <p>While I write this, letters are brought from Chur. I now report words from these: "Captain Karolin tells me that the Cardinal of Trento, seized by madness, is bound with two chains.</p>
      <p>And while he was telling this, our chief judge was standing by, who today had business with our bishop in the name of the city, who affirmed that the Bishop of Chur reported the same.</p>
      <p>They added that the Pope is gravely ill, so that he is not far from death." Furthermore, Augustinus Maynardus writes on March 7 from Chiavenna to Fabritius that the Pope has appointed the captain of the church as the Duke of Savoy, by which name 60,000 scudi return to him annually, that Cardinal of Lorraine has gone to Innsbruck to the Emperor, that the Venetians are starting a serious persecution against the faithful, that all the goods of Count Ulysses have been confiscated, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted to record these briefly and send them to you. It is also consistently written that the Turk is preparing a fleet against the Spaniards, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell and, as soon as you can, write what is happening in Orléans. May Jonville be safe together with his brother Budeus and other pious men.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have added a summary of my Apology of the true religion, which I wrote in German, my son-in-law made it Latin, not to educate you from it, but only to give you some taste of my work.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
