      <p>S. The courier from Lucerne met me today at 6 o'clock as he was leaving the city gates. I asked him to wait for these letters to be completed at the nearby house of Mr. Johann Jakob P., which I barely managed to obtain. I wrote via the Constance courier on the 21st of this month, sent the remaining part of the departure, and urged that you should not deal with the people of Lausanne or Geneva regarding the teacher by chance, but through this hired courier. Again, I beg and implore you. Oporin's nephew could come to me, to whom I must respond. I would prefer someone offered to me by you. Therefore, I ask you to act diligently and spare no expense. I will ensure that you do not provide anything ungrateful. I am not allowed to write more. Greetings to Gesner and friends. Very quickly. January 25th, in the year etc. 56.</p>
      <p>Gereon Sailer, Doctor of both laws.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, and most select friend. Zurich.</p>
