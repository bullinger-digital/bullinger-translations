      <p>S. D. I read what you wrote, brother, about my treatise, etc., and I give thanks to my Lord God, who through me brought to light what pious and learned men do not disapprove of, among whom I count you not among the least. I received from Oporinus the German book on the Lord's Supper by Mr. Boquin, Mr. Pincier, and Mr. Wolfgang. I wish the senators would change their minds! The most illustrious princes, the Palatine and the Hessian, etc., will be quite offended. But I hear that Sulcer and some Coccius or Essich value the Württemberg prince and Brentius more than their own churches and all the pious. I do not know, however, if they are to blame; it is written to us that they are highly suspect. Certainly, where there are Lutherans, they cause disturbances, etc.</p>
      <p>May the Lord convert them or overthrow their wicked and restless plans! I thank your kindness, who would have sent those booklets if I had lacked them. Our Jungius wrote to me the same things he wrote to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, after the fact, you ask about letters being conveniently sent to England; we send them through merchants to Frankfurt. But Mr. Julius, the minister of Martyr, has also left here for France.</p>
      <p>You might conveniently send to the Strasbourg market.</p>
      <p>If you have also sent to Strasbourg now to Mr. Christoph Mont, the doctor, the secretary of the Queen of England, and asked him to take care of it, he will gladly receive it for his kindness; for I often send letters to him, but before the merchants' departure, I sent what I wanted, etc. I fear that our allies or confederates, oppressed by external scarcity, and the impious and cruel ones, constantly urged to war by the pope, may attempt evil plans. May the Lord have mercy on us and convert them or overturn their violent plans, or if He strikes us with the rod for our merits, may He not rebuke us in His fury! Since I hear you have nothing at all of what was discussed in Naumburg, I send some things about the Council of Trent. I ask, however, that you ensure they are returned in time and not lost; send them back by Friday at the latest. Share with Mr. Matthias, whom you will greet.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 28, 1561.</p>
      <p>I ask you to send this to Bischofszell.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans are utterly overthrowing the churches in the dominion of Rychevillano; everything must go according to the Württemberg reformation, etc. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
