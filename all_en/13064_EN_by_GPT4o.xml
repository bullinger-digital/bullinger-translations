    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It has already been six months since Calvin, as requested, sent Bullinger's writing ["De sacramentis"] along with the opinion he wrote on it [HBBW XIX, No. 2825, from February 25, 1547] to Bullinger. Since then, he has heard nothing more. Yet, during his visit to Zurich, Bullinger encouraged him to engage in regular correspondence. Meanwhile, Calvin has heard a few times from travelers passing through Zurich, but he cannot recall ever hearing from a traveler heading to Zurich. Should Bullinger have another opportunity to write, he should take advantage of it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Regarding the situation in Germany, Calvin unfortunately learns more than he would like, but never anything about the city of Constance, which is so important to him. The people of Strasbourg were very afraid that Emperor Charles V would winter with them, and they still say that they would not let him into the city if they received support from elsewhere. What do the Swiss cities say about this? The rumors that the Emperor would attack them have subsided since the unrest in Italy. Calvin fears that the Italians are paralyzed with fear of the Emperor. He is said to have already occupied Piacenza and Parma and either killed or at least defeated Pier Luigi Farnese. After this success, he will probably subdue Italy this year. And if he has already moved to Strasbourg, he will hold this position to attack the Swiss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Now is the time for the [Swiss cities] to deliberate. If they remain silent, they deliver themselves to the Emperor. But there is no need to tell Bullinger that. Calvin knows that the [Zurichers] are brave and want to find a way against it. The neighbors, on the other hand, are foolish, as they do not want to consider how to tame this beast [Charles V]. If they want to perish voluntarily, may the Lord at least guide his chosen ones to resist in time! The [Swiss cities] rightly shrink from a close relationship with France. Such a relationship would indeed be inappropriate. Yet Calvin does not understand why they shy away from any treaty with France.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The bearer of this letter is the young [Michel Roset], the son of a Geneva councilor [Claude Roset] who is a friend of Calvin, who asked him for a recommendation for his son. [Michel], as far as Calvin knows, is to stay with the Zurich treasurer [Jakob Werdmüller] to continue his studies in Zurich. He already has basic knowledge, learns quickly, and is inclined towards study. Bullinger should strongly recommend him to the Zurich teachers in his and Calvin's name, so that they do not treat him like a stranger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to all, also from the colleagues. May the Lord protect the Zurichers and bless their work. Especially, greetings to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has already been six months since I returned your book to you with my annotations, as you had requested from me. Since that time, I am surprised that nothing has been received from you in response. You reminded me, when I was there, that we should frequently engage in the duty of writing to each other. Meanwhile, I have heard several times that some of your citizens have passed through here; I do not recall having anyone who would visit you. If ever the opportunity to write arises, I would especially ask you not to let it slip away.</p>

      <p>Regarding the calamity in Germany, I am forced to hear more than I would like, and yet, how Constance, which deeply concerns me, is faring, is not mentioned. There was great alarm in Strasbourg when they thought the Emperor would winter there; indeed, even today they deny that the gates would be open to him if they were supported from elsewhere. What the Swiss cities are thinking, I do not know; the rumors of war being waged against them have quieted somewhat due to the Italian unrest. But what if, terrified by his threat, they all dare not move! Now, he has occupied Piacenza and Parma, having killed, as some say, or at least defeated Pier Luigi Farnese, and it is possible that he has pacified Italy for himself this year with such success. If he has entered Strasbourg, you see the camps occupied, from where he might invade you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now, my dear Bullinger, it would be time for you to deliberate. For by remaining silent, would you not be offering your throat! Although I appeal to you in vain here. For I know your citizens will be so wise as to desire a remedy to be applied. The neighbors are plainly foolish, who refuse to admit any reasoning to restrain this beast. However, if they wish to perish voluntarily, may the Lord guide his chosen ones with the spirit of counsel, so that they may meet the dangers in time. There are many things that rightly deter you from a French alliance. But just as it is not at all expedient for you to become deeply entangled with him, so I do not see why you should avoid all connection.</p>

      <p>Moreover, this boy who delivered my letters to you is the son of a certain senator with whom I have a great deal of familiarity. He asked me through our friendship to give him a recommendation. He will be dealing with your treasurer, as far as I understand. But the father's plan is for him to advance in his studies, of which he already has the beginnings. And he is of a teachable nature, not alien to the muses. Therefore, I ask you to commend him to the teachers of your school, in your name and mine, not in an ordinary way, so that he may be given more consideration than a stranger. This service will be greatly appreciated by me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and friend, much to be honored in the Lord, together with your colleagues and brothers, whom you will greet in my name, and that of my brothers. May the Lord be with you perpetually and bless your labors. I also wish much health to your wife and children.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 13th of the calends of October, 1547.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, most esteemed brother and colleague.</p>
