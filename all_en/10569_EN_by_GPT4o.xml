    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the help so far. He would like to take over the parish of Veit [Kappeler], who is moving away from Kempten [Allgäu], which was offered to him by Paul Rasdorfer and Jakob Haistung, because he cannot stay in Frauenfeld anyway, as he wants nothing to do with the priest [Michel von Usigen]; he asks Bullinger to advise him and, if necessary, to inform the council of the matter.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord through Christ.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and brother, I have long understood and experienced your good will towards me not only through friendly words but also through deeds. Therefore, I am all the more confident to call upon you now for advice and fatherly help.</p>
      <p>I was recently approached on Wednesday by the preachers from Kempten, on behalf of their lords, to come up there without delay. I was summoned by Master Paul Rasdorfer, my dear brother, with these words: "Dear brother Peter, our brother Veit has been called to Württemberg, has requested leave from my lords, and it has been granted to him. Therefore, we have been entrusted to appoint another who matches us in teaching and conduct. I have mentioned you to my brother, Master Jakob Haistung. He is pleased with you. Therefore, our request and desire is that you arrange to come here without delay, and we will undoubtedly bring you here, etc." Since I now wish to leave Frauenfeld with a good conscience, and I know of no one else to take my place, it is my request and desire to you to advise and assist me so that I may also obtain a home. For I fear that after St. John's Day, I will no longer have a place in Frauenfeld, as the priest, the pastor there, has the authority, along with the bailiff, as he says, to appoint a preacher who pleases him. And although he wanted to hire me as an assistant and spoke to me about it in the church, I did not want to agree, have nothing to do with him, and neither be nor be named his assistant or preacher, nor demand or move into a house from him, as I have informed the community. If I now had to return to Zurich after St. John's Day and might be unworthy to my gracious lords because I am not a native Swiss, and if I were to reject this friendly call, it could cause me great harm. Therefore, I ask you to advise me faithfully, as I have no doubt you will. You may also, if it seems useful and good to you, inform my gracious lords of this, whether they might appoint another here in my place or, if I am driven away without fault, provide for me fatherly as for another child of the land, so I would not fear any danger or expulsion. I have not yet felt any displeasure on my part, praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Frauenfeld, February 19.</p>
      <p>Peter Rümeli, always your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable, and pious Master</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, faithful servant of the word of God in Zurich, his dear lord.</p>
