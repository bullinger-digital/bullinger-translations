      <p>Greetings and readiness to serve.</p>
      <p>Although you have not yet received any letters in my name, most honorable man, now (prompted by Erasmus Ritter, my guardian, to inform you of my circumstances) you will receive a few words, somewhat unpolished in Latin and very awkward.</p>
      <p>First of all, I owe you eternal thanks for the benefits bestowed upon me, namely that you have always cared for me and wished for me to live rightly and piously, and I am especially grateful that you have continually shown yourself to be my father and guardian, particularly in this matter, that you have recommended me with all diligence to your Erasmus Ritter, who has also been deserving of me. I see and feel that your recommendation has carried great weight with him, who also wishes me well and loves me as a son.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you should know that I am now a deacon in Scherzligen near Thun and have a very good position there and a most pleasant place, and I hope to gain a good reputation by serving the Lord liberally.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, I am about to take a wife, and it is necessary for me to have a companion in marriage, which I have said I would do and will do, God willing, if it is allowed with your counsel and peace, or if you know of anything better or more useful for me, let me know. Also, I pray that you continue to commend me as you have until now, and also my brother and sister; you will always have me as your most grateful son.</p>
      <p>If there should be any opportunity for me to be of service to you and yours and to the fatherland, there would be no delay on my part. I will be a Zürcher not only in body and spirit but also in doctrine. Therefore, if you wish to oblige me, I beseech you to remember me in your prayers, that I may receive the Holy Spirit and be able to rightly understand the words of the Lord and persevere in these words to the very end. Thus, I commend myself entirely to your humanity as diligently as I can; be mindful of me and mine.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to all brothers in Christ and your family, especially to M. Georg Binder, my teacher, most dutifully. Then, if you have any news, let me know. I have not used a great abundance of words, and I have not written everything sincerely; for I am now occupied with very great affairs. This is what I had to write to you; I would have more, but time does not permit. Regarding the marriage, tell me what you think. Take care of your health. I pray to God that you may remain with us for a long time. Endure and preserve yourselves for favorable circumstances. Given on the first of May.</p>
      <p>Write back soon.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich am Staad, also known as Fischer, deacon in Scherzligen.</p>
      <p>And to the pious and equally learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most venerable guardian, let these letters be given. Zürich.</p>
