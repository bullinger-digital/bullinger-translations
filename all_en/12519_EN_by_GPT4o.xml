    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received Bullinger's letter [No. 2464] from June 18 [with the addendum] from the 19th [not received] from the [Augsburg] messenger. [He will communicate Bullinger's advice to the Augsburg council], without mentioning Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Despite Emperor [Charles V's] claim that the armaments are neither directed against the [Protestants] nor against Augsburg, an attack can happen at any time. The [Imperials] cannot be trusted!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The envoys of Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg and the Protestant cities of Upper Germany are consulting in Ulm about defense measures. The Augsburgers are arming themselves. They hope to soon have as many soldiers as the opposing side. However, one must always reckon with human unreliability. Therefore, the people of Zurich should pray for them and help them as much as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Enclosed is a letter [from the Augsburg council] to the Zurich authorities with a detailed description of the situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Frölich had written extensive letters to Bullinger, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, and some councilors of Constance, which should have arrived in Lindau around June 10. It would have dire consequences for him if these missives had fallen into the hands of the opponents.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Since the [Imperials] also do not have particularly many troops, financial support [for the recruitment of mercenaries] would be helpful to the Augsburgers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings. The people of Zurich should pray that the conflict is resolved without bloodshed.</p>

      <p>The grace and strength of God be with us all. Amen. Most beloved, dear lord and brother, I have received your two letters, dated the 18th and 19th, with the utmost thanks from our messenger. You shall remain unmentioned and I hope to achieve good through it.</p>

      <p>The situation remains such that we fear daily attacks, as we are surrounded by military mustering and armament, although His Imperial Majesty graciously writes to us and promises that it is neither because of religion nor against us. However, considering the faith of the Greeks and past events of our time, no trust can be placed in it. The envoys of the Duke of Württemberg and the Protestant cities of Upper Germany are gathered in Ulm, standing firm and seeking defense. Likewise, we, this city, are preparing as much as we can (as there is apparently a lack of people); we hope to soon be as strong as the opposing side is now. But we are always betrayed by unfaithfulness. Therefore, you will pray to God, our Father, and also help humanly (as God grants you), because this burden is imposed on us for the sake of God's honor, which we primarily seek.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your lord is remembered again herewith, and all matters are reported in detail and nothing is kept secret. I am confident that they and all honorable hearts will oppose this dreadful treacherous plan of the priests and save us from being thrust under the realm of Satan.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have written long letters and many necessary things to you, Lord Gwalther, Gessner, and some lords of Constance from here, and the letters arrived safely in Lindau on June 10. And if they should be opened and fall into the hands of the adversaries, it would cost me dearly. God grant a better outcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The opposing side also lacks people; therefore, a supportive help with reasonable payment at the beginning of the matters could be very beneficial.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet all dear lords and brothers for me with the exhortation that they should pray to God, so that this difficult matter may be carried out to His divine honor and to our salvation without bloodshed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Given in haste, June 25, 1546.</p>
      <p>You know me well.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader (Antistes) in the word of God in Zurich, etc., to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
