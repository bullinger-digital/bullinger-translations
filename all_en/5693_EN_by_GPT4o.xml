      <p>Greetings. I send this to you in good faith, and at the same time, I give you my greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>And to repay you somewhat, I send the conditions or articles of peace, just as I received them from Geneva yesterday.</p>
      <p>Beza writes from Orléans on March 29th that Admiral has accepted the surrender of all the peoples in Normandy, the Bretons, the Poitevins, the Cenomans, the Turones, and the others on this side of the Seine, and that he has advanced, well-equipped with cavalry and infantry, to relieve Orléans from siege; on the way, he encountered couriers who announced that peace had been made.</p>
      <p>However, I understand that many doubt whether this peace should be accepted in this way; if I receive anything more certain, I will let you know.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, April 18, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to recommend Hieronymus Zanchi to you, as I know he is already highly recommended to you; he has the main points of the French peace.</p>
      <p>I wonder what the magistrate has said and how he received the letters from our magistrate, in which he recommended the cause of the Pellizari.</p>
      <p>I also wish to hear everything about your case. You say: "If only you had acted differently."</p>
      <p>But I say that we, who are called examiners, have named you according to our custom among those to be appointed, etc., but we did not order our magistrate to write to yours.</p>
      <p>It is not for us to prescribe to him or to infringe upon what he has decreed.</p>
      <p>What then should we have done?</p>
      <p>We have no absolute power.</p>
      <p>And because we named you, I believe we did so for just reasons, as you understand from the previous writing, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Johannes Fabricius, pastor of the Chur church, esteemed lord and my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
