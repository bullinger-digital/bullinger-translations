      <p>Greetings. I have received all your things, for which I thank you, but especially I ask that you give my greatest thanks to the most distinguished Mr. Lentulus for his tireless efforts. If ever there is an opportunity to deserve well and in turn serve him, he will find a grateful man with God-given strength and most devoted to him; you will greet him. I am glad that Bettus, an excellent man, has faithfully carried out what I entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>I write this so that you know I am still alive, although quite uncomfortably; but thanks to God, who in His holy will deals with me most mercifully. The king is said to have come to Lyon not entirely in strong health; for he suffers from quartan fever. The queen mother, Alençon, and Navarre with 4000 musketeers met him to receive the king.</p>
      <p>The Swiss legion is said to be stationed not far from Lyon, not well received by the inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Everything is expensive there. It is also said that 3000 black horsemen have crossed the Rhine to the king. Condé is said to be coming to us today. Where he is going or what he is going to do, I do not know. The soldiers from Holland return tattered from Belgium; Orange is still alive, etc. I am eager to know what is certain about the African war. We have various matters to attend to here. If only the Lord would provide strength, so that I could do what I ought! But due to the weakness of my old age, I would prefer, if it pleases God, to be stronger.</p>
      <p>But let what is seen by the Lord be done. To the Lord be praise, glory, and thanksgiving forever, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, very hastily, September 17, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
