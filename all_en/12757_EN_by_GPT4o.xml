    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] May the letter from the pastors of Strasbourg to their colleagues in Zurich [No. 2704] be taken seriously and answered! The people of Strasbourg adhere to God's word [in the matter of the Lord's Supper]. They reject any interpretation that would shortchange either the human or divine nature of Christ. They wish to continue fellowship with all those who adhere to the Basel [i.e., the First Helvetic] Confession. Should there be any in Zurich who, despite everything, no longer wish to regard the people of Strasbourg as fellow believers, the Zurichers should restrain them so that others do not treat the people of Strasbourg in such a harsh manner in this already difficult time. Hopefully, the response from Zurich will be comforting and not painful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Furthermore, the pastors of Zurich are asked to explain to their colleagues in Strasbourg how the response of the Four [Protestant] Cantons to Emperor [Charles V on October 26] can be justified. The authorities of Strasbourg hold Zurich in high regard; as does the Landgrave [Philip] of Hesse, who will hopefully continue to do so. The current situation in Germany requires this more than ever...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In their letter, the Four Cantons rightly reminded the Emperor of his alliance with the Pope [Paul III on June 26], according to which heretics are to be exterminated and all Germans are to be brought back to the Roman Church. In his letter to the Four Cantons [on August 27], the Emperor, of course, neither denied this alliance nor expressed any intention to question it. He merely denied wanting to suppress the word of God and the Christian faith; but he naturally thinks of his understanding of the word of God and his faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The fact that he emphasizes in his letter that he has not only Papists but also Protestants on his side does not mean that he intends to revoke the alliance with the Pope or the Edicts of Worms and Augsburg [of 1521 and 1530]! It is difficult to break a strong bundle of wood. But now that the bundle has been untied by personal enmities among the [Protestants] and by their greed, the Emperor was able to break the strongest rods, so that he can now easily break the already scattered weaker sticks. He has also promised Duke Maurice [of Saxony] (who claims to want to hold on to his religion) nothing more than that he will settle the religious dispute in a friendly manner. But what does this mean other than imposing the council's decisions? It is also certain that the instigator of this war was his Dominican confessor [Pedro de Soto], who considers the Protestants the greatest enemies of the world. We know what is happening in "Belgium"!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Four Cantons also know that the Emperor had promised the Protestants religious freedom at the Imperial Diets in Regensburg [1532] and Speyer [1544]. But at the Imperial Diet in Worms [of 1545], he said that he had promised them too much and could not keep his promises.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Now the Emperor demands that the [Four Cantons] adhere to the old treaties [with the Habsburgs] and therefore order the return of their [mercenaries serving with the Schmalkaldic League] and threaten the disobedient with punishment. The Four Cantons replied that they intended to serve the Emperor as before, and that the subjects who went to war acted against their mandates and should therefore be punished. With this, they calmed the Emperor and also admitted that all those who came to the aid of the [Schmalkaldic League] did something punishable. From this, it can be inferred that the [Schmalkaldic League] is rebellious and not attacked because of their faith! Obviously, the Four Cantons were only led to such a response because the Emperor assured them that he did not want to suppress their religion. However, it was expected of them that they, as members of Christ, the German Empire, and the German estates, would not write anything harmful to the [Schmalkaldic League] in their response, unless they had concluded that the Emperor was neither attacking the [Schmalkaldic League] because of their faith nor endangering the freedoms of the Germans. It was therefore expected that the Four Cantons would prove themselves as Christian allies of the [Schmalkaldic League] (allies who adhered to God's word and opposed the blasphemies of the Antichrist).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The papal nuncio [Girolamo Franco] has indeed revealed the content of the treaty between the Pope and the Emperor to the [Confederates]. It clearly shows that this war is intended to bring Germany back under the Pope's control. The Four Cantons must therefore also fear for themselves. They should have explicitly asked the Emperor whether he really entered into such an alliance with the Pope (unless the papal nuncio lied about it) or whether he no longer intended to uphold this alliance. Only if he could reassure them on this point would they recall their mercenaries; indeed, they would even urge the [Schmalkaldic League] to show obedience to him. Since he also claims to have nothing against German freedoms, the Four Cantons should have asked him why he was attacking estates that had neither been heard nor condemned. And as long as the Emperor had not assured them that he had canceled the treaty with the Pope, it was expected that the Four Cantons would have proven themselves as good defenders of justice and freedoms and would not have calmed the Emperor with such a letter as they did, without first trying to persuade the Emperor to make peace. The [Schmalkaldic League] knows very well that the Emperor could never have assured the Four Cantons that he had broken the alliance with the Pope. Consequently, he should not have demanded that they adhere to the treaties made with [his house], especially since his alliance with the Pope violates them. The [Schmalkaldic League] also wonders why the Four Cantons did not respond to the Emperor's claim that the [Schmalkaldic League] was forcing monks to leave their orders, even demanding an oath from them never to become monks again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The enemies can now boast of having convinced not only Maurice [of Saxony] and the Brandenburg princes but also the Four Cantons that the [Schmalkaldic League] is rebellious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Zurichers should understand what the Roman Antichrist and the [Imperials] are aiming for! Because of all this, Bucer cannot imagine that the [Zurich colleagues] do not regret the response of their own. But if they could explain why such a response came about and why the [Schmalkaldic League] can expect something better from the [Four Cantons], the [Zurichers] should do so, so that Bucer can explain it to those who asked him to inquire about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Emperor imposes high and harmful peace terms on the [Schmalkaldic League] for all of Germany. The [Schmalkaldic League] is financially exhausted. They also no longer have many soldiers, while the enemy has become bolder with the increase of troops from Duke Maurice and the Bohemians.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] But the heavenly Father will not deliver the [Schmalkaldic League] to the Antichrist. He leads and comforts them for his glory and the salvation of his church. This is certainly the time when love grows cold in most people and faith becomes exceedingly rare.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The [Eternal] Peace of the Land [of 1495] demands that every estate of the Empire assist the innocently attacked. But now even allies execute the ban against their own without any prior judgment! Even less would anyone come to the aid of the [Schmalkaldic League]! Yesterday someone came [...] from the camp of the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony]. He reported how he was denied passage through Franconia to return to his territory. The Imperials occupy the Protestant cities of Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg ob der Tauber, which were betrayed for money by the military. This is the situation with the [Schmalkaldic League] from a human perspective. But God will not deliver the church to the Antichrist!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bucer recommends the young Bernese [Jonas Danmatter, Johannes Fädminger, and Adam Mühlhofer]. They are pious and eager to learn.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I ask you, by the Lord, that what we have written in the common letters to you may have the effect on you that they should, according to the word of God and the law of Christian charity. For as we hold to the simple confession of the words of the Lord and explicitly exclude any interpretation that would detract from either the human nature in Christ or the heavenly glory, and as we desire to maintain Christian communion with all who persevere in the Basel Confession, I do not think there is anyone among you who would not wish to embrace us as brothers in the Lord. And if there are any who wish to act harshly, I trust that you will use your authority to moderate their severity, so that no occasion is given to others to demand harshly what they believe, especially in this most afflicted time of the church. I ask you to respond to us in a way that comforts us in the Lord and does not add pain to pain!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, I ask and beg you to write how we should excuse the response of your four republics given to the Emperor. Our people truly love your nation and republics; likewise, the Landgrave (Landgraf) of Hesse, whom we wish to persevere in love for you, as the Lord commands and as the current state of Germany certainly requires, if ever before.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your republics rightly objected to the Emperor about the alliance made with the Pope to exterminate heretics, who are considered heretics by them, and to bring back to obedience to the Roman See all those in Germany who have defected from it to the obedience of Christ. However, in his response, the Emperor does not deny that he entered into this alliance; he does not deny that he wishes to uphold it; he only denies that he wishes to suppress the word of God and the Christian religion by force, which is undoubtedly understood by him to mean the word and religion that he follows.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What he wrote about having not only the Pope's but also the Protestants' support with him cannot reassure anyone about the execution of the papal alliance or rather the Edict of Worms and the recess of Augsburg. It was difficult to break a solid bundle; now, by abusing the private enmities and desires of some of our confession's people, he breaks the stronger rods, so that he can later more easily break the remaining weaker and already scattered ones. Duke Maurice wants to appear to have best protected his religion, yet he extorted nothing more from the Emperor than that he would work to settle the religious dissension through friendly, amicable ways and means or other orderly ways. But what are these ordinary ways other than the decision of the council and its subsequent execution? It is certain that the Emperor was moved to this war by his Spanish Dominican confessor, who, those who know him affirm, cannot be imagined as more hostile to us. What is now being done in Belgium is known.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Your republics are not ignorant of this, just as you are not unaware of the declaration given at Regensburg and the recess at Speyer, in which the Emperor promised us and our religion peace much more fully. However, later at Worms, he openly testified that he had promised us more than he should have by right, and therefore it is not in his power to fulfill those promises to us. These things, I say, were known to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now the Emperor has asked them to be willing to maintain the hereditary union they have with him, to recall the soldiers who fought for us, and to punish those unwilling to return. They replied that they would continue to faithfully and simply maintain what they ought, and that those who fought for us acted against their mandates, and therefore are under their indignation and expect to pay the penalties upon their return. Thus, they seem to reassure the Emperor about maintaining that alliance, and acknowledge that they have sinned, and that those who fought for us are to be punished by them, from which it certainly appears that they now consider us as rebels to the Emperor, and that we are not attacked in this war for the sake of religion, as those whom they should not only not help but also not allow their own to fight for us! This response seems to refer to the Emperor's declaration that he does not wish to suppress your religion and the word of God, etc. However, he did not explicitly write that he does not wish to suppress your religion. Therefore, good men hoped that your people, as members of Christ and the German nation, would have had such regard for our states and orders (as true friends of yours), that they would not have responded against us unless they had first certainly learned that the Emperor neither seeks our religion nor the freedom of Germany, and that we are rebels to the Emperor. And they thought you would have responded to the Emperor that you are united in the fellowship of Christ with all who follow the word of Christ and have rejected the blasphemies of the Antichrists.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Now the Pope, through his nuncio, has presented to you the heads of the treaty struck between him and the Emperor concerning the present war, in which it is clearly stated that the purpose of this war is to bring Germany back to obedience to the Pope. Also, the Emperor should not grant peace to anyone unless the Pope wills it. You are indeed numbered among those who are both Germans and have defected from obedience to the Pope to the word of God. Therefore, you rightly fear for yourselves from the war and thus ask that the Emperor be willing to respond explicitly whether he has made no such treaty with the Pope (and that the Pope's nuncio lied both in words and writings) or if the Emperor has meanwhile rescinded this treaty and does not wish to be bound by it; for if he had made you certain of this, you would have worked to ensure that not only none of yours would take up arms against him, but also that our orders would satisfy him for all disobedience of which they had been convicted by legitimate judgment. For what he promised about not violating the freedom of Germany would require that he attack no one unheard and uncondemned with arms. If the Emperor had not responded that he had rescinded that papal treaty (for he can in no way deny having entered into it), our people hoped that you, as lovers of justice and freedom, would not have made him so secure about not providing us with your assistance, unless you had first tried to settle this war and had presented our exoneration to the Emperor through legates, and had asked him to be willing to forgive this war for the common salvation of Germany, etc. Our people do not doubt that the Emperor would not have given you a certain response about the rescinded treaty, so neither could he have asked anything from you about maintaining the treaty, which he himself acknowledged he had already violated through the papal treaty. Our people also wonder why it did not move yours that the Emperor, in the charges by which he wanted to convict us of rebellion with you, mentioned that we forced monks to reject their cowls and promise that they would not resume them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The enemies now boast greatly that they have brought not only Maurice and the Brandenburgers but also you to the point of recognizing us as rebels and, if you are not to fight against us, at least ensuring that yours do not fight for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Your prudence understands what the Roman Antichrist aims for, what he seeks, and what others do as well. Therefore, I think you regret that your people responded in this way. However, if there is anything that can excuse this response or add better hope for us than this response seems to promise, I ask you to write it to me. And those who ordered me to ask this of you do so with a truly candid and friendly spirit towards you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The enemy has proposed the harshest and most pernicious conditions of peace for all of Germany. Our people are now completely exhausted, especially reduced to such a narrow number and with the enemy emboldened by the accession of Maurice and the Bohemians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>But God is our Father, who for the sake of his Son will not betray us to the Antichrists. Pray with us that he may guide and strengthen our people in all things for the glory of his name and the salvation of his church. Amen. It is indeed a time in which the love of many has grown cold and very little faith is found.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The common peace of the empire, which they call the Landfrieden, requires that each estate of the empire assist those who are attacked without cause. Now they even execute the ban decreed without any prior judgment, who are also bound by hereditary alliances and the closest ties of blood to repel all violence. So far is it from anyone helping us! Yesterday someone came from the army of the Elector, who reported that he, as he had planned, could not return to his domain through Franconia. The Emperor's army holds Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg, towns whose soldiers of our confession cry out for money. Thus our affairs lie everywhere according to the flesh. But God will not betray his churches to the Antichrists.</p>
