    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hotot visited Jodocus Kilchmeyer yesterday, who showed him a letter from Bullinger [not received]. Unfortunately, there was no letter for Hotot included. However, perhaps Bullinger has already written and the letter got lost. Hotot has now been waiting in Bern for three weeks for this letter and for his luggage, which was supposed to be sent to him by his host in Zurich [Georg Rubli]! If Bullinger has already written to Hotot, he should do so again, so that Hotot does not have to remain in uncertainty any longer and can enjoy a letter from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] If only what Bullinger wrote to Kilchmeyer about Emperor Charles V were true! But Hotot heard the opposite from a trustworthy man [...]: The Emperor is doing well, and the Diet of Augsburg is proceeding according to his wishes! Hotot reports more about this in a letter to Theodor Bibliander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He has already personally thanked Bullinger for the great benefits he undeservedly received. When he wanted to express his gratitude again in this letter, he realized that he cannot provide any reciprocation for such benefits (let alone in written or spoken form). He therefore plans to do so on a suitable occasion, even if Bullinger (who will hardly be dependent on his help) should not benefit from it himself, but others whom he will recommend to him if necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I visited Master Jodocus (Jodocus Kilchmeyer), who showed me your letters written to him, and since there were none attached for me, I feared that you might have written something earlier that has not been delivered to me. I have been here for the third week in expectation, especially of your letters, and also of my luggage, which I had entrusted to my host to be sent here when I left Zurich (Tigurum). Therefore, if you have written to me before, I ask you not to disdain to undertake this task again, so that I may be freed from this uncertainty and at the same time delighted by the most desired enjoyment of your letters.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If only what you wrote to Jodocus about the Emperor (Charles V) were true! But I hear quite the opposite, as a trustworthy man has informed me that he is well and conducting everything at the Diet (Reichstag) according to his will, which, since I am writing to Master Bibliander (Theodor Bibliander), I did not want to repeat to you as unpleasant news. Whatever is certain, you will receive from him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have thanked you in person for your benefits bestowed upon me voluntarily and undeservedly. I had thought to fill this entire letter with the same thanks. But when I considered the magnitude of your merits towards me, I immediately refrained. For they are such that they cannot be rightly repaid by any benefits, let alone should I attempt to do so by letter or speech. But I will consider at some point how I might repay you in reality; and if not towards you (to whom my efforts can by no means be of service), this gratitude will be experienced by those whom, if it so happens, you will wish to commend to me.</p>

      <p>Farewell. In Bern, on the first of October, 1547. Your most devoted, Jean de Hotot.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in learning and virtue, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich (Tiguri).</p>
