      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most faithful and candid D. Bullinger, I would gladly write more auspicious things, for which we all diligently strive to obtain, if only success had followed and the outcome had matched our efforts. We are all most ready to comply with you in all things; however, when we ask and approach more cordially, we mostly find the name of D. Musculus more known to them than we had estimated. They soon inquire: "Is he the one whose books Sultzer recommended and imposed on our preachers?" Since we do not dare to deny this, we are poorly received; indeed, they are indignant and judge us imprudent and not very circumspect, who seem to want to risk again; they say we should have understood the nature of those who subscribed to Luther, who called us seducers and condemned us and wanted to heap all blame and the burden of everyone's indignation upon us, which is evident in the writings and published books, with which even our field is filled. What if they now say something else in a moment of distress? If, they say, "they had stood firm from the beginning, God might have averted this dire wrath and vengeance from Germany. And with all this, we have been mocked, who have experienced this very thing not once in reality, as we have been afflicted by this satanic tergiversation, it is better for us to enjoy the peace of the church that has been obtained. As for the Emperor, if we must experience it, we should commit ourselves to God, as we know no place of refuge, therefore we must prepare and equip ourselves either for a bitter death or a bloody victory with the confidence conceived towards God, that He will not forsake us. Therefore, it seems little advised to entrust anything to them, since their formulas of speaking diametrically oppose our disputation, reformation, held synods, and oath. And because words are for the sake of things, it was fitting that these matters be openly exposed and illustrated with such words, so that I would not want the matters themselves to be twisted and snatched by posterity to the sound of words; for from there it is confessed and known to all that the disaster of purer religion existed from the beginning. And although they openly retract those things which they admitted either induced by the suggestion of others or by private weakness or finally by human lapse, which might seem the work of an ingenuous man, if this honor is given to the truth, which is worthy, if anyone seriously aspires to it, to which its luster and candor is attributed by open testimony, perhaps yet they will refuse even this very thing, because they think it will be dangerous, because they will offend their dignity by this. The example of Doctor Sebastian is also recalled, who, although he had subscribed to Luther, yet the same Sebastian swore among us with the highest divine attestation, nevertheless he stirred up the greatest fire among us and after our open opinion was rejected, after he had insinuated himself quite comfortably, he then exercised his poison and sting and thrust such a bitter one, from which the teeth were long astonished.</p>
      <p>We truly experience that you have great influence among our people, so that many are grieved that you labor so earnestly in promoting such men, who were leaders in either fostering or advancing this doctrine; they would do whatever they could without offense to the church in your name. However, whatever these fugitives now promise, they seem to do it only compelled by distress and not by zeal for the truth; therefore, it is little cautious to trust them, as they are naturally more verbose, by whom also many, whom we still have among us as Swabians, have imposed upon us, whom they think it healthier to expel than to introduce others. Always preserving the integrity of those who have solidly felt with us and neither subscribed to Luther nor openly attacked us with published books or otherwise even tacitly with a name have criticized our religion.</p>
      <p>But if poverty afflicted anyone, whatever they might have thought, we are all ready to contribute help and support to them; in this certainly we will be most inclined, so that they cannot complain that they are abandoned by us in this.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we ask that you would be willing to write to us hereafter and not neglect us in addressing the consul or senate; for from there an error not to be expiated could easily be committed, which seemed not only opportune to us but also to other good men, that the matter should not have been grossly reported to the senate; for we could have inquired when the matter was to be handled. At the same time, we ask that you do not believe hastily and do not allow yourself to be led astray by the allure of words; indeed, many know how to hide and suppress what they feel and to wait for opportunity and occasion.</p>
      <p>And so that you may know briefly and absolutely, whoever is merely in suspicion of having conspired with Luther or Bucer, these more cordial ones execrate, as they are the cause of all these afflictions. Such as we have shaken off from our shoulders, we again refuse to submit to them and to be burdened and troubled by them. For both Sultzer and Battus could say: "We were only devoted to the writings of these and used them; but if you receive the same authors and foreigners among you, why are we, their mere disciples and natives, excluded from our homeland?" When good men discuss this with us back and forth and measure it by this standard, they always tend to prefer that we are not yet disturbed by these, not as far as providing support (because we are ready to alleviate their poverty), but to entrust the helm of doctrine. From there we also believe that the senate has suspended this matter, we would gladly say that they perhaps want it removed. However, we will try with all our strength to mitigate the matter in whatever way we can and will not cease, if ever God deigns to supply what is desired.</p>
      <p>These things, good Bullinger, I desire you to consider, which I write not from myself, but also commanded by Lord Jodocus, Weber, and Nikolaus, so that you may clearly understand what those with whom we have spoken here and there think. The same things also met D. Haller, although more covertly; but he writes by himself, yet most think and advise that fire should be avoided from burnt things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent one. You will greet in the name of all of us all the learned and Musculus, to whom we wish and pray for all healthful things. Farewell again with all your family.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern on the 13th of July in the year 1548. We all fear lest the wound that has healed be reopened.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Eber(hard) von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant, learned, and faithful man D. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zürich church, his always especially revered and respected lord and patron.</p>
