    <p xml:id="regest1">Müller received Bullinger's letter and commentary on the Gospel of Mark. Bullinger would have had reason to reproach Müller for his long silence or even to stop writing to him! However, Müller was burdened with many affairs, especially since his enemies laid nasty traps for him at the court of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg when he was sent to Emperor Charles V for a year [1541/42]. Fortunately, they could do nothing more than slander him out of envy to the Duke, who always has open ears for such things. But all they achieved was that Müller left the tyranny of the Württemberg court and turned to the practice of law in Augsburg. His enemies are pained that Müller now has a better position, more suitable for study than before, and that the prince has realized that they have deprived him of one of his most loyal court officials. - No matter the danger Müller found himself in, he never forgot Bullinger, but rather thought of describing his entire misfortune to him in detail, though he lacked the time or a messenger. - He even took Bullinger's letter about the Lord's Supper [HBBW XI, No. 1548] with him to Spain, without fear of the Inquisition, and at the Diet in Worms, he always had Bullinger's "De scripturae sanctae autoritate" in his hands. He is also very pleased with Vadian's "Orthodoxa et erudita epistola de corpore Christi" and the other writings sent by Bullinger. - Now that his situation has improved, he would like to write to Bullinger more often. - He knew that his relative [Georg Müller] had died, but he is glad to hear that his widow [Sybille, née Vollrat] and the daughter [...] are well in Basel. Best wishes and greetings to Anna [née Adlischwyler], Vadian, and all the brothers. Müller apologizes for the haste. He will soon write about the dangerous situation in Germany. - [P.S.:] He apologizes for the corrections.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Dearest brother, I received your letters along with the Commentaries on Mark, which are testimonies of your love for me, with great joy. I must confess my negligence, for you have the most opportune occasion to accuse me of not having written to you, my dearest friend, for a long time. You have long testified to your brotherly love for me through many letters and works sent to me, and I always feared that, because I did not respond, you might either send me bitter letters, worthy of my negligence, or never send any letters to me at all. But, as I should have excused myself to you, you perform the duty of a brother and excuse your brother yourself; for you attribute my lack of writing to my affairs. Indeed, I was hindered from writing to you by my affairs, especially those caused by my most unjust enemies at the court of the Duke of Württemberg, who laid the most pernicious traps for me while I followed the Emperor in the prince's delegation to Spain for a year. But I am grateful that they have no cause other than that they could not bear my fortune, which, by some fate, is always so easily exposed to such storms, and that the prince of a weak mind always has open and easy ears for such detractors. Therefore, they achieved nothing more than to lead me from tyranny to the law, and they are tormented by the injustice they attempted to inflict on me, and they grieve that my ship, which they tried to wreck, has reached a quieter port, where I can better serve the care of the republic with gentler muses than can be done in the courts of princes, and that they have stripped an imprudent prince of a most faithful minister, etc.</p>
      <p>But no matter how many waves I have been tossed by in the meantime, I have never forgotten you, my dearest brother, but have always intended, when I had the time, to write to you in detail about the entire tragedy of my misfortune; however, I often had the opportunity to write shorter letters, but the opportunities for messengers were lacking.</p>
      <p>I love you so much, and your letters, which you recently wrote to me about the Eucharist, are so dear to me that I even wanted to take them with me to Spain; I read and embraced them often, and the most cruel tyranny of the inquisitors did not deter me from them. Therefore, now in Worms, in my spare hours, your book "De scripturae sanctae autoritate" sent to me was always in my hands. I cannot adequately express how much I am delighted by this and by the Orthodox and learned letter of our most learned Vadian on the body of Christ, along with the other most Christian little books sent to me.</p>
      <p>Now I am in a republic and have obtained a condition that I have always sought through sea and land and many dangers, and in which I will have more time to visit you with my frequent letters. Therefore, I ask that you attribute my negligence, for not writing in the meantime, not so much to my being tossed by various dangers in different places.</p>
      <p>I knew that my relative had passed away. However, I am glad to hear that his widow and daughter are well in Basel. I wish you, along with your wife and children, the most learned Vadian, and all our brothers, the best of health, and I ask that it not be troublesome for you to greet Vadian himself and all our brothers very much in my name. Pardon the haste. For soon, and as soon as I have the time, I will write to you more and communicate with you about the most dangerous state of our Germany, and I will conceal nothing that seems to be in the interest of our religion.</p>
      <p>Given on the 18th of September in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Nikolaus Maier.</p>
      <p>Pardon the corrections, which my haste never allows.</p>
      <p>To the man of utmost piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, his dearest brother, etc.</p>
