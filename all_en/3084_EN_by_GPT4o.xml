      <p>Greetings. You are indeed a very courteous man, who takes the intention of doing good as a benefit and interprets what you wish to be done by me as if it has already been accomplished. Indeed, although from the time when our friendship and acquaintance first began, I have never lacked the desire to do well by you and yours, yet no opportunity has been given to declare it in any matter, unless it seems worthy to you that your son speaks well of you and you value greatly that I recently lent him money when he was being pressed somewhat more harshly by an adversary.</p>
      <p>Indeed, when I learned, though it was true, that there was a danger of him going to prison, I thought it my duty to ward off whatever danger threatened your son with a small amount of money, and I did it for no other reason than to free him from the adversary's insistence without trouble or disgrace. Therefore, it was not necessary for you to thank me so much, much less to send a gift in addition that is not to be despised. But I will allow you to be generous, provided that I am given an opportunity to repay the favor sometime.</p>
      <p>Your son could have easily avoided that trouble if he had consulted me, who now, as I seem to myself, have begun to understand the ways of such men to some extent. But what happened to him is what happens to many others, who, due to their own candor, think they must earn the favor of anyone. Burcher had already left before I received your letters; but your son satisfied me, having obtained the money from I know not where. Therefore, there is no need for you to be concerned about this matter any longer. What is being spread about the arrival of Melanchthon, both elsewhere and among you, is entirely uncertain; for although that good man, who has done much good, wishes to leave those whose unheard-of ingratitude he experiences, and to be freed from this trouble which some ill-disposed people cause him, yet, as I understood from his latest letters, he holds the wolf by the ears; for he remains unwillingly longer among those who he feels are hostile to him, and yet for many reasons he cannot conveniently extricate himself from there.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you have until now. I am glad to hear that Dr. Peter Martyr is well and I wish him all good things, whom I also ask you to greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, on the first day of January in the year 1557. Petrus Dasypodius, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his esteemed friend.</p>
