      <p> S. I am glad to have received this message; for a long time, I have not received any, except that I recently wrote to you through those two Belgians, who in the meantime also brought their theses to you for examination. But behold the cunning they used. Since we did not want to take it upon ourselves to judge these theses here and respond to each one, but only encouraged the parties to concord with a general writing, they feared that you would follow our example and do the same, so they preferred to leave mine here rather than bring this prejudice, as they called it, to you; for they knew that I would write to you about what we had decided here. I wonder, therefore, whether I have revealed to you what was done with them here or whether they have shown you our writing (which we also changed twice in their favor). I also wonder if you have responded to each of their theses. If this is to be done, there will be no end to the disputes, and that ecclesiastical governance will eventually turn into mere tyranny. However, so that you know what I wrote at that time, I am sending the letters again, unopened. I have nothing to add to them. Few things are reported from France, and those are so uncertain that almost no one knows what to believe. Some affirm that the state is moderate, others say it is utterly ruined; that Cardinal Lorraine reigns again, Condé and the Admiral are in great danger; the affairs of the church are so weakened and worn out that there is no longer any hope of ever uniting forces. Therefore, the Lord must be prayed to all the more diligently, and we must hope, as Philo once said, that divine help will begin when human help is no longer available. We have the same news from the Netherlands as you do. However, I am surprised that this war is being waged in Friesland, so far from Antwerp, and who those are who have driven out the Spaniards and under whose banners or auspices they are fighting; I therefore ask you, if you can know this, as you surely do, to explain it to us better. Both consuls, Steiger and Mülinensis, also both treasurers, my father-in-law, Zehender, and all the brothers greet you. I wish health to all of yours. Bern, July 19, 1568. We do indeed know about Orange, but whether they serve him or have other leaders, we do not know. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
      <p> M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
