    <p xml:id="regest1">Cousin thanks Bullinger for the friendly reception of his letter [No. 2104] and his gift, as well as for Bullinger's reply [not received], with which he has considered him despite great workload and disputes with the [opponents] (who are best punished with contempt and ridicule). It was worth waiting for the letter, which he has read several times! - Cousin also thanks for Bullinger's books, which he sent to him through [Johannes] Gast. Even if Bullinger downplays their significance, Cousin appreciates them much more than six hundred [books] from the sophistic pen of the "swine from the herd of Epicurus"; books that are significant only by their weight, not by their content, as Quintilian vividly said. Cousin does not know whether to mock people who hinder Bullinger's work for Christ's vineyard, or whether to rather regret that Bullinger repeatedly has to deal with such snakes. He has seen Cochläus’ [“Replica brevis”] (there is nothing more vehement, impudent, and unlearned!), in which Cochläus accuses Bullinger of poisoning the Zurich church, and at the same time claims he is of sound mind, where even Orestes showed more sense than Cochläus! For if Cochläus had even a spark of common sense, he would have refrained from this writing of his, especially since his earlier books were mocked by many scholars. - Even if Bullinger is content to live in harmony with his conscience and with Christ and does not care about his reputation, he already enjoys more fame in his lifetime than any deceased person, so that it leaves the fools speechless. May Christ preserve Bullinger for a long time! - Cousin, for his part, wants to devote himself with all his strength to the study of piety, to which Bullinger has admonished him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I give you, most illustrious Bullinger, my eternal thanks again and again for receiving my letters to you with such grace, along with the small gift, and for your generous spirit in writing back to me, especially amidst your Herculean labors and struggles with the monsters that distract and hinder you, not without great loss to letters and piety, in restoring Christian literature and piety. I would rather you scorn these vipers than waste even one hour of your excellent studies in refuting their madness and taking any trouble! For we also easily tame this Pharisaic kind with nothing more than laughter and contempt.</p>
      <p>How grateful and delightful your letters were to me, I can hardly express. As soon as I received them, I eagerly kissed the writing of your hand with reverence. I read and reread them (and it was a pleasure to linger!). Finally, I placed them among those things which I am accustomed to hold as most precious. There they will hold an eternal place of your goodwill towards me.</p>
      <p>I also give you the fullest thanks for your books, which our Gastius sent to us, from which we recognized your interest in me with great pleasure. I do not wish to flatter you; I will not remain silent about one thing: I value and esteem your books - however much you may downplay them - more than six hundred of the sophists' books from the herd of Epicurus' swine, which are heavier in bulk, as Quintilian vividly wrote, than in content. Indeed, I am uncertain whether to laugh at this kind of people - who do not cease to oppose your most holy labors, which you have been expending with great effort on Christ's vineyard since almost your youth (what a miserable madness!) - or rather to grieve that you must continually contend with such vile and ignoble antagonists. For I have never seen anything more bitter or impudent than Cochläus' little book, nor could anything more unlearned even be imagined. He says the Zurich church lives on poison served by Bullinger. Elsewhere he claims to be sane, though I would dare to swear that Orestes had more sense. If he had even a half-ounce of sane mind, he would have refrained from that writing, after his earlier booklets were torn apart by many scholars and hung up as public mockery.</p>
      <p>But let such writers be gone! Bullinger will live on and be valued by all, while their memory will perish with a crash! "If glory remains after death, I am in no hurry," someone wrote, so that I need not say that you have already attained so much glory and admiration among all the learned and good people, whose number is great in this age thanks to you and your kind, that it has rarely happened to anyone deceased, while in the meantime some foolish people burst with envy; although you care nothing for such glory, content to be approved by Christ and your conscience. I pray that He, with all the good and learned, may preserve you safe for the world and theology for a long time, even if you seem to be looking towards the harbor.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I will devote myself with all my heart to striving with both oars and sails towards that study of piety, to which you lovingly admonish me with your most prudent and learned letter. And since, most excellent Bullinger, you have made a place for me among those whose study and service are not ungrateful to you, I will henceforth take the greatest care to maintain this observance with you diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell, chief ornament of the Swiss and of our age. Given at Nozeroy, 10 days before the Kalends of July in the Christian year 1545.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Gilbert Cousin of Nozeroy.</p>
      <p>To the most eminent theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. In Zurich.</p>
