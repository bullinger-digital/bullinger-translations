      <p>S. D. Before all else, since I understand that you have bathed at Fäber, I pray to the Lord that He blesses your bath, strengthens you with vigor, and grants you long-lasting health through Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am glad that all my letters written about the matter have not only been delivered but also well taken care of. I now entrust the entire business to Mr. Willi, a most distinguished man, and I do not doubt that he will wisely manage everything with his prudence. I only ask this one thing from his kindness, that he may ensure with the most illustrious Chur council that a letter is written to the most distinguished Bern council, just as I understand that a response has been given to our Zürich council and senate for their commendation.</p>
      <p>If you send those letters to me, I will ensure through the prefects of either Lenzburg or Königsfelden, who are very friendly to me, that they are properly delivered to Bern. The Bernese will see that I have done good work, and the Chur council will testify that they hold the commendation of such a great republic in some regard, by which the Bernese will also be bound to them, etc.</p>
      <p>I have indeed read what Bellievre wrote in his own name and in the king's name to all the cities and republics of the Swiss about the lifting of the siege of Poitiers. Meanwhile, the story is reported differently from elsewhere, namely that the king's brother besieged Châtellerault, and therefore the admiral selected from his otherwise very numerous army, brave cavalry and infantry, whom he sent from the Poitiers camp against the king's brother. Eager for battle, they hurried; when the king's brother saw this, he immediately withdrew. Hence, they returned to the admiral, who never deserted Poitiers with the greater part of the army, but even a few days ago besieged it very tightly, so that either the king must fight with the admiral, or Poitiers will be captured by force or surrender. These things are indeed reported thus; whether they are true, time will reveal and prove. Would that Cardinal Empsen would set out for Rome in such a way that, if he digs a pit for others, he would have dug it for himself and fall into it, never to return! But may the Lord's will be done. You will greet Mr. Ruinella, an excellent man and dear to me, most kindly in my name and thank him greatly for those new things. I see that not only the West is entangled in the most disastrous wars, but also the East itself, a sign of the coming judge. I do not wonder that Venice, like Sodom of old, is struck by a heavenly thunderbolt. Would that the Venetians open their eyes and see what is holy and just! What I have, I share with you, but on the condition that you return it by the next courier, the paper I think, which I have enclosed with these.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever with your dear wife and children. Zürich, the last day of September 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Chur church, my lord and honorable and beloved brother. Chur.</p>
