      <p>Venerable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear lord and good friend, my entirely willing service is always ready for you at all times. Therefore, I thank you most sincerely, as much as I can, for the very honorable gift of Baden wine, which you sent me through this messenger, which is entirely undeserved on my part. If I could repay such and other good deeds and honors, which you and yours show me daily, with my small means, I would and will not spare myself at any time for you and yours. I will inform my lord Count JÃ¶rgen tomorrow, as soon as I can conveniently come to him, of your and my lord Mayor Laffer's friendly greetings, as well as the unfortunate condition of the aforementioned lord mayor, which is a cause of sorrow for him. It is no less so for me; for he has shown me so much honor that his long-lasting health would greatly please me. With this, I ask you to greet on my behalf and on behalf of [Mayor] Haben, also Master Ulrich Zwingli, and anyone else you would like, most kindly, praying to Almighty God that He may eternally keep you, my very honorable, dear lord and trusted friend, in His grace and protection.</p>
      <p>From Baden on the 6th day of September in the year 1550. Your always willing Hans Rudolf von Erlach.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my very honorable, dear lord and trusted friend in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf von Erlach.</p>
