      <p>S. A good man, a citizen of Strasbourg, otherwise from Basel, writes from Strasbourg: "Meanwhile, we are of good hope that our community and council will remain steadfast by the word. However, how the powerful, who have returned as envoys, will hold themselves against the response, time will tell."</p>
      <p>Indeed, I hope they learn something from the example of the people of Constance. For they have, as feared, a city full of traitors; therefore, they need circumspection. May the Lord protect them and instill strength, so that they may resist evil.</p>
      <p>They know the tyranny of the Emperor, another much more severe one, about which, if you do not know, that citizen of Strasbourg says in this manner: "On the 3rd of August, His Imperial Majesty summoned the great and small council to Augsburg before him, dismissed them, and at his pleasure, with other persons, all, except for 10 men, who were appointed by the community, from the guilds, dismissed all guilds, so that they should never be reestablished. And as soon as the council was appointed, His Majesty had this publicly announced and commanded in all the crossroads of the city by the city bailiff, three heralds, and 8 drummers, under great displeasure and corporal punishment, that no one should oppose it. And they say all the gates were closed." Behold the Emperor.</p>
      <p>The same: "Many cannons and bullets are being brought to Speyer, and the one from Buren is in excellent armor; no one knows where to."</p>
      <p>It has been reported to us that three traitors were removed by the people of Constance. We are surprised that nothing about this has reached you. One is said to have been a tribune, another from Augsburg, the third (thirds) a fisherman.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and the brothers in Christ. Let us be diligent and perpetual in urging repentance and prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, 13th of August, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
