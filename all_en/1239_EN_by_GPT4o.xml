      <p>I received two letters from you in the past few days: both full of singular benevolence towards me, and for that reason, most welcome to me. It is well that God has not only given us the same spirit to encourage the King of England and his advisors to continue, but also made our plans so aptly agree with each other. This certainly will, as I hope, contribute somewhat to their confirmation. I am now beginning to expect daily the return of the messenger who took my books there with the letters. As soon as he returns, if he brings anything worthy of report, I will make sure it is shared with you. Meanwhile, I wrote to the most illustrious Duke of Somerset, and pointed out that it could not be avoided that the papists would grow more insolent unless the dissension over ceremonies was settled promptly. Therefore, I urged the man to extend a hand to Hooper. Whatever the Pope may pretend, I do not believe the Council of Trent is being seriously convened.</p>
      <p>The reason for my conjecture is that the King of France has ordered all his bishops to diligently inspect their dioceses: each one is to report the acts of visitation completed within six months to the metropolitans. He intends to hold a national council of the entire kingdom. There is no mention of Trent or the Pope there. Yet I do not doubt that matters are being conducted between them by arrangement. Namely, that the Frenchman, to please the Pope, will dissolve the Council of Trent under the pretext of a national council. The wise judge that the torch of war is lit in Italy. The Turkish envoy is now at the French court, urging the king to war. A great fleet threatens Italy or Spain. Therefore, may the Lord occupy them so that they are not so troublesome to the church. Since you know that my journey to Trent will pass through your area: you are too inhumane not to offer us at least one lodging. But perhaps you are waiting for a new bull to admit us. For we are not among those who, by right, custom, or privilege of the Holy Apostolic See, obtain a place. Therefore, we will be allowed to rest at home. Although there is also work to be done at home. For Christ provides the material for labor and Satan does not allow us to sit idle.</p>
      <p>You will pardon my haste. For when these German youths offered me their service, they gave me only an hour to write, which is almost up. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, to be sincerely respected and cherished by me.</p>
      <p>My colleagues respectfully greet you. In my name and theirs, you will convey many greetings to Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Gwalter, and the other brothers. May the Lord protect you all with His defense, guide you with His spirit, and prosper your labors.</p>
      <p>Our agreement was printed here in Latin less diligently than I would have liked. But it will be printed again shortly. Meanwhile, I have attached the French version to the Latin, in which no error will be found.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Calvin, truly yours.</p>
