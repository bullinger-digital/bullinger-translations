    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger will surely have been informed about the results of the negotiations [between Georg Müller and Konrad Zwick] in Stein [am Rhein]. How burdensome everything is!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Peter Scher the Elder from Schwarzenburg wrote a letter from Balingen the previous evening, full of terrible news. He reports that the Imperial forces in Württemberg are raging so badly that they even overshadow the Turks. People are fleeing, wandering around, and are at a loss! In Markdorf [correct: Marbach am Neckar], the Imperial forces acted particularly horrifically against their promise: The men were hung by their genitals; their wives and daughters were violated before their eyes; and to get the people's money, they were tortured in every conceivable way; even the officials were tortured for a long time before they were killed; the houses and estates of several nobles were burned down. Many pastors have fled because some had their genitals cut off. Some pastors also had plates nailed to their heads as punishment for refusing the clerical tonsure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Last Wednesday [December 29], the Duke of Alba, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, called for the capitulation of Stuttgart and Cannstatt. Although the cities asked for time to consider, they had to surrender immediately. The enemy also raged cruelly there. Scher suspects that in the meantime, Tübingen has also fallen, even though the garrison of the castle intends to resist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Teachers and students have already fled from Tübingen; so has Erhard Schnepf, who arrived in Konstanz the day before yesterday, where he was granted shelter at his request. He is still waiting for his wife [Margarete, née Wurzelmann] and children. He also reports of great misery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Herrenberg was also taken. The whole country [Württemberg] will soon be conquered, except for the occupied fortresses like Tübingen Castle, Urach, Hohenasperg, Schorndorf, Kirchheim unter Teck, and a few others. Hopefully, they will hold out.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer received a letter from [Johannes Knoder] from Hohentwiel yesterday. It reports that Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg] is in negotiations [with Emperor Charles V], that he is very dissatisfied and only seeks an honest peace. His envoys [Balthasar von Gültlingen, Johann Fessler, and Ludwig von Frauenberg] have not yet returned [from the Emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] How could such tyranny establish itself without resistance? Who would have believed that one of the two camps would perish without any act of war? May God help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Yet Blarer remains undaunted and hopes that this enemy too will yield with God's help. May God grant true peace! Blarer wishes Bullinger and his people a year full of grace and peace on earth, and eternal life beyond!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Due to his many obligations, he must now close the letter. Bullinger will learn that the Konstanz council has written to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Enclosed is a copy of a letter from [Hans] Baumgartner dated December 23. The council received it yesterday in the absence of [Konrad Zwick]. Bullinger can see from it how the [peace negotiations] are being made palatable with fine words.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] May the Lord protect us! Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dearest brother, you will surely have been informed about what was negotiated in Stein. Oh God, eternal God and merciful Father, how burdensome everything is!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Scher wrote last night from Balingen in Württemberg such a lamentable letter. A pious heart should rightly weep blood over the fact that God's wrath has come upon us so cruelly. He reports that the enemies are acting so cruelly in Württemberg that no Turk could act more terrifyingly: People are cursing, wandering aimlessly, running back and forth, not knowing where to go; mothers and children, young women and old women are being dragged around so miserably that even a stone would feel pity! In the town of Marbach, they acted so horrifically against their promise that it is unbelievable: The men were hanged by their genitals, their wives and daughters were violated before their eyes, all people were tortured with wondrously strange tortures to extract money from them; all officials and commanders they encountered had to endure long torture and were then finally strangled! They also burned down the houses and estates of several nobles. Many pastors have fled from the towns and villages because some had their genitals completely cut off. They also nailed plates to the heads of some pastors, saying: since they do not want to wear tonsures, this must be their tonsure. In summary: It is an unbelievable tyranny!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Last Wednesday, the Duke of Alba called for the surrender of Stuttgart and Cannstatt. They asked for a delay, but could not obtain it, and had to surrender immediately. They have behaved there in such a way that no one can describe it. And my brother-in-law suspects that they have now also taken Tübingen, although those in the castle intend to resist.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The doctors and students have all scattered and fled a few days ago. Doctor Erhard Schnepf arrived here the day before yesterday from Tübingen. He is waiting every hour for his wife and child. He requested shelter here, which was granted to him. He speaks of great misery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Herrenberg has also been taken, and the whole country will soon be completely conquered, except for the fortresses that are besieged, like Tübingen Castle, Urach, Hohenasperg, Schorndorf, Kirchheim unter Teck, and a few others; they may hold out, God willing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I received a letter from Hohentwiel last night, from which I gather that the Duke is very dissatisfied and that he is indeed in negotiations, but is not at all willing to accept anything that is disgraceful and dishonorable to him. His envoys have not yet returned. In the meantime, the enemy acts tyrannically and cruelly. I hope to God that nothing will come of it, that he will submit to the Emperor. It is better to lose a country with honor than to keep it with shame and dishonor. It can always be regained soon, especially if some fortresses hold out and if the Lord God is willing to have mercy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Oh my God, is it not to be pitied that such tyranny should have a free course without any resistance? Who would have ever believed that one would sit still and watch one another perish? Help, eternal God! How great is this wrath?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Well then! I am still undaunted and hope without doubt that this enemy too must soon give peace and be pacified through ways and means that are well known to the dear Father in heaven! Let us call upon Him with earnest and sincere prayer. He will look upon us with grace, sheathe His sword, and give a lasting peace for the sake of the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ! In this wish and desire, I heartily wish you and yours many, many good, gracious, peaceful, glorious, loving, and patient years here, and there (in the afterlife) eternal life! Amen. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I can write no more. There is so much business and writing that lies upon me! Take it for good. My lords are writing to yours, as you will be informed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>So I send you a copy of a letter. It just arrived yesterday in the absence of my cousin to my lords from the rich, powerful man, the Baumgartner, although given on December 23, from which you can easily gather what one intends to achieve with good words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>May the eternal, merciful Father protect us from everything that is dishonorable to His name and therefore detrimental to our salvation and eternal life! Greet all good lords and friends. Everyone greets you.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
