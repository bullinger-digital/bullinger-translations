      <p>Greetings. Since our friend Crispin has not yet returned from the fair, whom I understand from others' reports is bringing me letters from Philipp, I am refraining from writing certain things until the return of that young man, through whom you recently wrote to me. I only wanted to inform you of the state of our brothers at present.</p>
      <p>The Alpine brothers are again being harassed not only by the court of Turin but also by that of Grenoble, for two valleys are under its jurisdiction. Many have been taken to Grenoble, having been summoned to give a confession of faith.</p>
      <p>A day has been set for all to return to the abominations of the papacy. If anyone captures either ministers of the word or schoolmasters, fifty gold crowns have been promised for each head. It has been decreed that they be seized by armed force unless they comply within the appointed time.</p>
      <p>In Paris, eight days ago, three were burned. And although it is likely that the enemies intended to instill terror in all by the punishment of a few, we will soon hear, if others continue steadfastly, that every street corner of the city is ablaze. It seems that Pharaoh's stupor is awakened in this one matter by the calamities of war, so that he may rage more fiercely against the pious. May the Lord restrain all his furies.</p>
      <p>Because you wished to publicly testify to your love towards us by dedicating your commentaries to the exiles of Christ, the foreigners here thank you with common letters and would wish, if given the opportunity, to demonstrate their gratitude more fully in deed. I also considered it my duty to add this word as a token of support.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and my esteemed brother, together with your family and fellow ministers. May the Lord preserve, guide, and continue to bless you all to the end.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 7, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, esteemed fellow minister and brother.</p>
