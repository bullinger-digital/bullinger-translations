      <p>To the man endowed with the highest piety, learning, and erudition, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of Zurich, my most esteemed lord and teacher, Johannes von Ulm sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>As I am about to send you this Interim, I cannot, most learned and dearest man, refrain from adding a few words of my own, although I am at a loss for what to write, unless perhaps you wish me to recount your benefits towards me. But I think you are already weary of such recollections; indeed, I am ashamed to have labored so often in expressing gratitude, which I cannot even begin to repay in thought. At the same time, I fear that I may fall under suspicion of flattery, as if this praise of your merits towards me is attributed not to duty but to the occasion. Should I not mention it? What then should I write, or how should I now express my gratitude and show myself to be thankful? I shall do this: henceforth, I will write only if there is something of which you should be informed by me; for I am certain that you do not doubt that I offer you the diligence, goodwill, and respect I owe, even in my absence. I do indeed write to some there, even when there is no need, but only to those with whom I have some domestic use or familiarity. I do not dare to interrupt you, a man of such gravity, dignity, and learning, overwhelmed as you are by the waves of your occupations, with frequent letters. Only, my lord, love me and be well; for it is not only when we love and respect you most that we are well and enjoy our letters (yours?), which I have never considered anything sweeter or more honorable, with the utmost pleasure, so that my relatives may eventually understand and recognize that I did not leave Germany rashly.</p>
      <p>Given in London, the noble metropolis of the English, on the third day after the feast of Mary in August. The letter was written very briefly, and behold, your letters are delivered to the Archbishop of the English, which I have learned from Mr. Peter Martyr that you wrote to him both most kindly and most honorably. The first part, if I remember correctly, was a serious and learned admonition regarding his episcopate, the other a subtle transition to [Greek]. But (to explain the matter to you in the fewest words possible) although your letters, which were immediately copied, brought both pleasure to all and a full and welcome exhortation to the bishop himself regarding his duty, I would like you to know for certain that he has fallen into such a deep sleep that we have gained a very cold hope of him being awakened by your most learned letters. For he has recently published a catechism in which he almost approved that foul and sacrilegious transformation of the papists in the most holy supper of our Savior; all other dreams of Luther, it seems, appear to him quite firm, clear, and lucid. O miserable affair, lamented in the speech, writings, and records of all nations, that today the sheep of Christ are surrounded by a new error by some, and none of those who are most powerful in learning and authority boldly oppose these cowherds, that is, blockheads, and send them into exile! Farewell again and again, and from me and Wilhelm Petersen, your most loving in Christ, be very much greeted.</p>
      <p>Your most loving Johannes von Ulm, Swiss.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with the highest piety, learning, and erudition, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of Zurich, his esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
