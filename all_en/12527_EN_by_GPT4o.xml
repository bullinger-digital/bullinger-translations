    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer is in a hurry because he has guests and the messenger [...] wants to depart; however, there is nothing new. He has received Bullinger's letter [No. 2474].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- What Bullinger writes about the Emperor [Charles V.] is true and requires vigilance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Duke Wilhelm [of Bavaria] has refused the King [Ferdinand] the establishment of a training ground. It is therefore certain that he will not stand against [the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Augsburg is despondent in the face of the impending danger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Ferdinand] claimed to Duke Wilhelm that [Suleiman I.] had arrived in Stuhlweißenburg with 100,000 soldiers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [The Schmalkaldic League] is sending a delegation to the meeting [in Baden on July 5].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Their troop recruitment is progressing well. The majority of the mercenaries want to fight on the side of the Protestants for the Empire and against the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Emperor has sent heralds from Regensburg with mandates ordering the restoration of [Catholicism] and the abolition of [Protestantism]. However, at the request of [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, [Weigand von Redwitz], Bishop of Bamberg, and Duke Maurice of Saxony, he has recalled the envoys. All just deception!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The brave Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] has destroyed the [imperial] training ground at Riedlingen. The Abbot Prince of Kempten [Wolfgang von Grünenstein] understands the situation and wants to support the city of Kempten. He has already sent them grain and other supplies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger should write comforting letters to the people of Augsburg and make them aware of the opportunity [to profess their faith].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The people of Konstanz are expelling the women and children of those who are joining the Emperor, including [Barbara im Steinhaus], the wife of Sigmund von [Hohen]landenberg, who is recruiting mercenaries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Blarer hopes for an improvement in the situation if they do not engage in futile negotiations. Even the [Catholics] will advocate for peace if they recognize the seriousness of the situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Bullinger should briefly indicate whether the Zurich pastors should arm and assemble in the event of a fire or other alarm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The estates have submitted a petition at the [Imperial Diet] in Regensburg for the punishment of the murderers [of Juan Diaz, Alfonso Diaz, and Juan Prieto]. The Emperor replied that, given the fact that the people of Memmingen executed [Ludwig Vogelmann] in 1531 despite his safe conduct, he does not understand the agitation. [Charles V.] has also moved two additional companies to Regensburg. The envoys [of the Protestants in Regensburg] feel so unfree that they do not communicate anything in their letters that they would fear being made public.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Blarer must stop, as the messenger wants to depart. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- In the evening, the Count Palatine [Friedrich] and Duke Ulrich will meet.</p>

      <p>In the utmost haste. The messenger wants to depart. I have just had honorable guests. But there is nothing new with us. I have received your letter. In it, I sense your true diligence and earnestness. May the Lord be your reward.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What you write about the Emperor is true. It requires vigilance. Duke Wilhelm has refused the King a training ground, and it is certain that he does not want to stand against us. More on that another time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Augsburg is not entirely despondent, as I am told, because the danger surrounding them due to the situation and training grounds is said to be greater. The King has informed Duke Wilhelm of Payer that the Turk has arrived at Stuhlweißenburg with 100,000 strong. What is true about this will soon be known.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Otherwise, negotiations are being conducted and brought forward by our envoys at the meeting with yours, as you will learn.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Everyone is willing to join our side. And the mercenaries have generally made the cry, saying: "I march for the Emperor;" others saying: "I march for the Empire," which draws us, as their statement makes the Emperor and the Empire find, and calls our side the Empire, as it is the majority.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor has sent out several heralds with mandates from Regensburg, that everyone should re-adopt the old religion and abolish the new, or expect all disgrace, etc. Upon this, the one from Granvelle, also the Bishop of Bamberg along with Duke Maurice of Saxony, have traveled. They have humbly requested that His Imperial Majesty should not hasten, etc. Upon this, he has recalled the heralds. But it is all just deception; may God protect ours, that they are not deceived by cunning and led into misery!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Duke Ulrich is very resolute. The training ground at Riedlingen is destroyed. The Abbot of Kempten wants to commit life and goods to those of Kempten. He has given them much grain and other supplies, as he understands the matter, where it will lead.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Write to Augsburg comfortingly, and that they should not overlook the opportunity. I will also do so, but that one should turn to God above all, without whose grace and favor everything else will be in vain. Also, pray faithfully for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>My lords are sending women and children after those who are now joining the Emperor. Among them, the noble lady from Hof has also been sent away. For her husband, Sigmund von Landenberg, is also leading mercenaries to the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I hope in God, it will soon be better, if they do not fall into futile negotiations. For the bishops and clerics, seeing the seriousness, will themselves push for peace to be made. May the gracious and best will of God happen!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Let me know with a word, how it is with you preachers in Zurich, whether you must also arm and run to the places in case of fire or other unrest, or not. Write now yes or no with this messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Do not forget!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The estates have petitioned at Regensburg to His Imperial Majesty for the committed murder, etc. His Majesty has replied that she is not yet deliberated, but what it should be, even though these have killed such a one, while those of Memmingen in a past year have executed one, who carried the imperial majesty's safe conduct with him in his bosom. Oh, the miserable, unprincely answer! He has taken two more companies of soldiers to the previous ones to Regensburg into the city. And the envoys are so entangled, that they dare not write anything in their letters, which they might fear if it came out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I must break off. The messenger is departing. Pray for us and greet all good lords and friends. They also send you all good wishes. Given in haste, at 12 o'clock, June 29.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Tonight, the Count Palatine and Duke Ulrich will meet.</p>
