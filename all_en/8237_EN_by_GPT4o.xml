      <p>Greetings. I accept your excuse, my brother, on the condition that, whenever you have the leisure, you write at least something about our affairs and those of Italy. I would indeed gladly write about the affairs of France and Germany if I had any certain information. Many things are indeed circulated, but only by doubtful rumor, and I do not like to speak about uncertain matters. Therefore, the brothers will forgive me if they receive nothing from you about doubtful matters; this is not due to negligence or contempt, but out of necessity. Now, I note down in a few words what I have. In the last expedition to France, very few of our people set out. The magistrate takes away all the remaining property of those who have set out and escaped.</p>
      <p>The Bernese captured over 100 of their own while crossing the Nidau, and led them all bound in pairs to Bern. From there, they sent each one to his place and to his prefect.</p>
      <p>All the cities and prefectures in the Bernese territory are ordered everywhere to decide in public courts (mitt landtgerichten) what punishment should be imposed on them. However, I hear that a capital sentence is being pronounced against them; yet I have not heard of any being executed; those who were the instigators of others going into military service will be in danger. The Republic of Geneva has accepted the articles of pacification between Savoy and themselves, composed by the Bernese; now the response and consent of the prince is awaited. From France, we have, though I do not affirm it, but report as I received it: it has long been deceitfully acted upon to settle the war; now, however, with the deceit detected, heavy preparations are being made on both sides. It is said that the king will besiege Charité, the admiral will lift the siege if he can, and that he has obtained Marseille, which is still doubtful to me, etc. The Swiss who recently set out are still stuck in Salon in Campania and have already begun to struggle with the plague and a shortage of all things; they are expecting gold, but it has not appeared anywhere so far, and therefore many will sing: 'O were ich daheymen in mines vatters schüre' (Oh, if I were at home in my father's barn) etc. The tumult in England, stirred up by the papists, has been recently quelled by breaking their forces, I think I wrote to you; but new disturbances have arisen in Scotland due to the governor being struck by a cannonball. In Transylvania and Hungary, I hear the Arian virus is greatly increasing due to the familiarity of Blandrata, a most impious man, with the king, and this weed is not decreasing in Poland. In Saxony, there are very serious and harmful disputes among the theologians of Jena against those of Wittenberg and Leipzig about justification, etc. Many fear this matter will come to blows. Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxony, defends the Jena theologians, while Elector Augustus supports the Wittenberg theologians, hence the cavalry, which Johann Wilhelm had begun to prepare to aid the King of France, now looks elsewhere. The marriage of Casimir and the daughter of Augusta will be celebrated on June 4th in Heidelberg, where great preparations are now being made, as if indeed, etc. The Emperor has convened a diet at Speyer for Trinity Sunday, which many think will not proceed; others insist otherwise.</p>
      <p>The Emperor demands a tribute from the Bohemians, Moravians, and Silesians as much as no king has ever demanded, over 70 tinnas. If it continues, what do you think will happen? In short: from almost no places are tolerable things being written. But this is the just judgment of God, which precedes that great and final one. May the Lord Jesus have mercy on us and keep you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 14th, in a rather harsh winter, etc. 1570. Greet our friends, whom you know, the honorable consuls, Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all others in order.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The one who brings you this letter, Rhetus, is a pious and learned man.</p>
      <p>He lives with my Simler and will perhaps return to us within 14 days. He is my godfather, having lifted my son Heinrich's son Johann from the sacred font; therefore, I commend him to you.</p>
      <p>One more thing I earnestly ask of you, that the news I have mentioned so far, transcribed and enclosed in your letters, and also these of mine addressed to Friedrich, attached by me to yours, you ensure are delivered to him promptly. In this, you will greatly gratify me and free me from burden and labor. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, the same one.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, colleague and my most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
