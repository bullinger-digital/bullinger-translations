      <p>P. S. D. For several months now, most illustrious man, I have not written to you, partly because I was away, partly because I lacked couriers. Now I will write a few things that come to mind. We celebrated a wedding here magnificently, about which I have not written to you, because neither do you wish to know nor is it fitting for me to write, as I am mostly ignorant and did not wish to see. Prince Casimir did not want to be joined by Dathenus or Olevianus, but called Bretta Willing. This matter greatly displeased our people. The Saxon ordered him to be informed to have Casimir and his daughter recommended, and if he were driven away by those contentious ones (I think he called them disputants), he should come to him; he would not fail him. The court preacher, as I hear, does not shy away from the truth, although a certain sermon of Olevianus, exceedingly inept and full of insults and slanders, greatly disturbed him, so much so that he is said to have told the Elector Prince that he would easily agree with our writings, from which the spoken word is as far removed as he had not believed before, which he himself heard.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have urged the prince to restrain the intemperance of these men, if indeed he desires peace.</p>
      <p>What the Wittenbergers recently disputed in the promotion of six theologians, you will receive at the next fair. I could not obtain a copy of the theses or the speeches, otherwise I would have sent them. I was scarcely given the power to read; I read quickly, and they satisfied me so much that I marveled at the learning and judgments of those men. They write and speak expressly against the enemies of the Trinity and the defenders of ubiquity, and indeed vigorously and learnedly. I hope this writing will be the cause of the greatest goods. Jacob Andreae was there then or shortly before, who left angrily, openly saying they were Zwinglians or Calvinists. It is certain that the chair of the school and church is now held by our men, which had not been done before; except for that old man Major, there is no one, as I hear, who does not openly agree with us, as is abundantly clear from the theses.</p>
      <p>The assembly is now at the door; I think the proposal will be explained this week.</p>
      <p>The Elector, I think, will be present for about eight days; all the other princes have gone home each to his own. The Saxon met the Emperor on the way and discussed with him about matters I do not know. Here they celebrated equestrian games, among others.</p>
      <p>The Saxons were amazed that our man always sits in the women's quarters; for elsewhere he is scarcely seen in such games. I indeed fear that he has lost all the authority he had with them, if he had any at all. There is nothing more certain than that we were known and are now made more known. Augustus left a preacher for his daughter, who should ensure that the matter of the supper is not improperly instituted.</p>
      <p>About our affairs, I scarcely know what to say. Our people hold to the old ways and think that if the law is to be violated, it should be violated primarily for the sake of the kingdom; they proceed vigorously against the will of God and men. Yesterday in two churches they announced to their people that they wish to restore that private absolution called (they name it judgment or institution), which they had previously condemned and rejected with great clamor as a very bad, superstitious, papistic thing. With what face they now recall what they could scarcely remove before not without contention, I do not know, except that I know we have no face. Besides one dismissed, I know no one yet because of excommunication. The sum is: they are the prince and do what they want in such matters and indeed more than the prince himself would dare to do. Those who are of the council all resist strongly except one. How much good will follow from their attempt, those with moderate sight see. May God grant that not with the weeds shortly after the wheat is also uprooted.</p>
      <p>I trust my relative has already sent you the writing, which I was very sorry to understand from your last that it had not yet been sent. It is long and therefore could be copied more slowly. I have now written to him that, if he has not yet sent it, he should send it immediately, and I am persuaded he will do so.</p>
      <p>About your Rodolphi I will say nothing now, from whose letters you will understand how they are. The hypocaust will soon be completed, which could not be finished because of the wedding, with the craftsmen occupied in other matters of the prince.</p>
      <p>I would like you to inform Master Johann Wolf (for I am not free now because of many businesses to write either to him or to Master Gwalther or to any others; I would have gladly written also to Master Lavater, etc.) that we have here now an Italian surgeon, who passed through Clavenna, who indeed conducts himself excellently in his office so far.</p>
      <p>With him, I say, his son could be excellently instructed and learn things that our people have never seen. I would advise him, if he can in any way, to send him here. I know for certain, he will not regret the deed; for besides seeing diseases of all kinds daily (for they flock to him from everywhere) and their very successful treatment, he will also see dissections of bodies, hear frequent conversations of doctors, sometimes lectures, inspect the preparation of medicines,... in short, he will now have what he wants, if he wishes to consult his studies.</p>
      <p>These are the things I could now write to you and which occurred to me now very occupied. I know nothing new at all that is worthy of writing. The French affairs seem to be getting worse, while the king, on the advice of Alba, prolongs the war. The affairs of the Moors in Spain are also reported to be less successful. And indeed I do not see how I can hope well, whenever subjects resist the magistrate; but the Lord knows what he has concluded with himself. I pray to the most good and great God with all my heart, that he may keep you all safe; bless you and your works and studies, as he has done so far, with the glory of his name. Amen. I pray you, my most honorable Master Bullinger, to commend me most dutifully to the other masters, brothers, and colleagues of yours and greet them very much in my words. As I said a little before, I could not write now; otherwise, as I hope, I will compensate for what has been neglected now.</p>
      <p>Perhaps during these dog days I will come to you. Your most observant Thomas Erastus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his master always to be revered like a father.</p>
