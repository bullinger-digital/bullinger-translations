    <p xml:id="regest1">Peter Rümeli has shown him Bullinger's letter and asked him to provide information about their dispute [with the Catholics]: The appointment of political offices has proceeded as usual, they will continue to jointly handle law and court matters, and the decision in the schoolmaster dispute was left to the governor [Christoph von Sonnenberg]; thus, the conflict is at rest. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, Mr. Peter Rümeli has kindly written to me, informing me of your loyalty and diligence, which you continuously bear for the sake of our church: for which we thank you most highly. He also asked me to write to you about the matter as his fellow brother in the gospel of Christ; which I have done, though not very willingly, as I am quite unknown to you; yet, to give place to the truth, I have done it promptly. I ask you to take it in the best way.</p>
      <p>Our opposing party has dismissed our lawsuit and rights, as you have been informed by them before. However, with God's help, it has come so far again that, as is customary every year, all offices of authority have been reorganized and appointed. In this, my gracious lord governor has acted bravely and honestly, as I know well, towards both parties. Regarding the school matter, both parties have come to the governor, who is to decide it amicably or legally. My lord governor has also publicly offered to our community that he will not handle the matter in any way that would bring any disadvantage to us or our children of our faith in any way, but rather let us remain in peace. And with this, the matter of all things is now completely resolved, and they handle law and court matters together as before. How my gracious lord governor will decide for us, we will inform you.</p>
      <p>With this, we commend you to God. Always keep us in good memory as our lord and fellow brother. Greetings to Master Löwe and Rudolf Tumysen.</p>
      <p>14th of January.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Fehr.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious and dear lord, preacher in Zurich.</p>
