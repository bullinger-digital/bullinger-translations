    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Von Cham received a report from Johannes Haller about Augsburg the day before. He would have informed Bullinger about it if he had not gathered from Haller's letter that Haller had also written to Bullinger [No. 2791]. The situation now seems truly dangerous. However, the stubborn people of Augsburg are to blame. Nevertheless, he feels sorry for the pious people who now have to fear for their possessions, and even for themselves if they remain in the city. If they had followed their advice, [the Danube campaign] would have turned out differently! Von Cham has always suspected (which has unfortunately come true) that the Protestants would become disunited due to the attack that never materialized. Everything is entrusted to the Lord.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Since the other cities [of Southern Germany] have surrendered to [Emperor Charles V], von Cham fears that Constance will do the same. However, if the city remains steadfast, efforts will certainly be made to ensure it reaches an honorable peace that also benefits the Confederation. If the inhabitants of Constance are given the opportunity to decide their future, they will surely vote for surrender, given their fickleness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Haller's letter, it appears that he was offended by Bullinger's letters [including No. 2770]. However, he will probably be pleased with Bullinger's subsequent letter [No. 2780] and the letter from the Zurich council [dated January 30]. Bullinger should encourage Haller again so that he bravely proclaims God's word. He has the suitable character for it. However, with bluster, the Augsburg church can hardly be built.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Von Cham has written to Sebastian Schertlin, asking him to advise Hans Wilpert [Zoller] (who does not want to return to Zurich) regarding his future, as the situation is dangerous, especially since imperial troops are being moved to Augsburg. He has also expressed his sympathy to Schertlin [given his difficult situation], invited him to come to him, and promised to accompany him to Zurich, where he would be received with honor. Additionally, he has also written to Zoller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blessing wish for Bullinger and his household.</p>

      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear sir, my friendly greetings and entirely good-willed service be with you always, dear Master Heinrich. Yesterday, a letter from Johannes Haller reached me, informing me of all matters concerning Augsburg. I would have written to you about the matter, but I understood from the letter I received that he has also written to you. I can well understand and think that the situation is very dangerous. The miserable stubborn people want nothing else. I am only concerned for the pious, honest people who meant so well, and some of their own, who must also stand in great danger. If they had followed the same, with God's help, it would have gone a different way. I have always feared that they would separate, and it would go as it unfortunately has. We will entrust it to the Lord God. He will arrange it well in His time according to His will.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I fear for Constance, as the other cities have all surrendered, they will not persist. If they had the grace and fortune from God to present themselves bravely and confidently, I have no doubt they would be pursued, through which they might eventually come to a good, agreeable peace, which would also be beneficial for the Confederation. I fear, if it comes before the common people (as the common people are fickle and unsteady!), they will do as the others. May God grant them grace to remain steadfast.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>From Haller's letter, I understand well that the good man has taken offense from your letter, although I think he will receive comfort and joy from my lords' and your subsequent letters. You should also write to him encouragingly, that he may manfully and bravely proclaim the word of God. He is gentle, and with bluster, not much will be built in that place. Who knows, the Lord God will arrange everything for the best.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding Hans Wilbergen, I have written to his lord, Sebastian Schertlin, advising him on what to do, since he does not want to return home and yet would stand in great danger if an imperial garrison were to be sent to Augsburg. I have also written to him myself. I have complained to Lord Schertlin in my letter and invited him to come to me, hoping he will come to me in time. I want to bring him to Zurich in my lords' stead, with good hope that he will encounter much honor and good.</p>

      <p>Entrusting you and your household to the protection of the Lord God, given at Kyburg, the 12th day of February in the 47th year. Your good-willed servant Bernhard von Cham, bailiff at Kyburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
