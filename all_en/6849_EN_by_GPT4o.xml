      <p>Greetings. I received the letters you sent through Mr. Dathenus and those you sent through our local scholars. I always give you great thanks for your faith and diligence. Mr. Dathenus explained everything to me most copiously; we, in turn, treated him as kindly as we could. He also discussed everything with Mr. Steiger, as you instructed. However, we found no solution. We are pleased with what you write to both princes, and especially that the Palatine should not present himself as a party first, as we understand that the conditions of the colloquy are still to be discussed; but if he is to be drawn into the party at all, he should insist on the same conditions that we have always commonly demanded from the Papists. We hope, however, that in the meantime, while these matters are being deliberated, many other things will intervene to impede this colloquy, or if this does not happen, that nothing else will be achieved than to remove those public contentions. We believe he will return through us. What you wanted to be sent to Geneva, I sent to Mr. Beza through the same person; he will undoubtedly contrive something. I return the rest to you. However, we are grieved if anything has resulted from here that Sulcerus wrote to Brentius. We see what the faith of men is; but it will be so aired that I hope the ears of those who are the authors of this matter will ring. As for the rest, we have nothing from France that is of any importance. Mr. Dathenus indeed reported to me what you heard from Linerus; but none of these things have yet reached us. Meanwhile, while we await Gentile, the leader of the Anabaptists, indeed of those who are among us, has been captured; we are now dealing with him. I think he will be punished, as he should have suffered the same twenty years ago; in the meantime, he has seduced many here and there. I told Zehender what you wrote. He thinks that his letters, which he sent to you through the one who makes gunpowder with you, have not been delivered to you; nevertheless, he thanks you and greets you most warmly and expects those insignia of yours. Farewell. Greet all the brothers in my name, especially those who are of your household. Mr. Steiger and all the others greet you very much, especially mine as well. Mr. Consul Negelinus was struck by apoplexy in recent days and lost almost all speech; but we still hope he will be restored in time.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 18, 1566.</p>
      <p>I wrote to my brother yesterday; but I think these will be delivered to you sooner.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot of all.</p>
