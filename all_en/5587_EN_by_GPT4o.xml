      <p>Greetings. Finally, letters from the admiral, by which we were informed about the battle and its outcome.</p>
      <p>The prince had led out his troops to force the enemies to leave their camp.</p>
      <p>If the infantry had performed their duty, victory would undoubtedly have been achieved immediately with no trouble and almost no loss; the cowardice of the infantry, which some suspect to have been treachery, delayed the success.</p>
      <p>When the prince saw them disgracefully idle, I mean the Germans and the French, he broke through to at least compel them to fight out of shame.</p>
      <p>There, his horse was wounded in the shoulder.</p>
      <p>Hence it happened that the enemies, who were not far away, gained control of him, as he could not recover his horse in time.</p>
      <p>The constable was already captured, the marshal of Saint-André was killed, one of the constable's sons, the Duke of Nevers, received a fatal wound.</p>
      <p>The brother of the Guise, whom they call the Grand Prior, was gravely injured.</p>
      <p>About twenty other leaders fell, among whom were three knights of the royal order; many of the primary nobility were captured, who are today held in safe custody.</p>
      <p>The German knights conducted themselves bravely, as befits military men; there was similar enthusiasm in the French cavalry.</p>
      <p>A great slaughter was inflicted on the entire enemy army.</p>
      <p>A fifth part of our men did not perish.</p>
      <p>Among the captives, there is no one except the prince, about whom we are greatly anxious, except for one, by the name of Movifium Simphaleum.</p>
      <p>As night was pressing, both sides retreated to their camps.</p>
      <p>There was great panic among the enemies.</p>
      <p>Our men had such confidence the next day that they did not hesitate to provoke the enemies.</p>
      <p>Guise remained within his fortifications. It was enough for the admiral to have given that demonstration.</p>
      <p>The prince is held in a certain fortress between Chartres and Dreux.</p>
      <p>The queen has set out for the main city of Chartres.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the king followed.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the prince was brought there.</p>
      <p>The outcome of the conference is unknown, except that there is a fear of excessive inclination towards the vain hope of pacification, which has hitherto been the cause of all our troubles, because having been betrayed three or four times, he could never be persuaded to take precautions, although he opposes his guards quite courageously, so that you might say he has taken on a manly spirit since the day of the battle.</p>
      <p>He brings forth the edict, which the enemies promulgated in the king's name in July, where it is said that the war was undertaken for his liberation.</p>
      <p>He therefore denies that it is consistent for him to now become a captive.</p>
      <p>He also adds that, since he was created governor of the kingdom by the votes of the estates, representing the person of the king, there is no one who may lay hands on him, who is second to the king.</p>
      <p>The day before the battle was joined, the prince had named the admiral as his successor.</p>
      <p>All the troops swore again in his name.</p>
      <p>He received a not insignificant number of infantry. A thousand landsknechts, or thereabouts, have returned to their homeland.</p>
      <p>The Reiters are no less eager than at the beginning: no tumult, no sign of defection.</p>
      <p>The duke himself encourages all his allies to constancy and hopes for the best.</p>
      <p>He also asks that no faith be given to the prince's letters until he has been restored to his freedom.</p>
      <p>It is incredible what I say, and yet very true, that the constable was led by only twelve men all the way to Orléans, and indeed with such speed that they entered the city a little after twenty-four hours, having covered thirty Gallic miles, that is, a journey of fifteen hours.</p>
      <p>The admiral had decided to join the English to himself. If the situation required, he did not fear a second battle.</p>
      <p>If by chance he heads towards Lyon, do not think he is fleeing.</p>
      <p>There is indeed a rumor that he is seeking a peaceful region where he can refresh his troops, but some deeper plan is hidden.</p>
      <p>And certainly, it is of great importance to bring aid to Lyon in time, before it suffers from a greater scarcity of provisions there.</p>
      <p>The defection of Baron Adrets has also occurred.</p>
      <p>If the Duke of Nemours is defeated, the entire region of France up to Aquitaine will be cleared of bandits.</p>
      <p>The province of the Occitan language is so abundant in wine and grain that, with the roads opened, the people of Lyon will be out of danger of famine.</p>
      <p>Thus, a siege will not be feared in the future.</p>
      <p>And if two thousand horsemen come as reinforcements, they will bring back not a few companions, which will be a strong addition.</p>
      <p>The letters of our Beza, which were brought to me, were either intercepted or went astray through detours.</p>
      <p>He had written four days before the battle on the web, but due to the stupidity of the messenger, the letters wandered for some time before they were returned to me.</p>
      <p>I send a copy.</p>
      <p>He himself is indeed safe in Orléans, as he had bravely encouraged the soldiers to battle and stood among the leaders, as if he were one of the standard-bearers.</p>
      <p>This is the state of our affairs.</p>
      <p>The enemies seemed to have done a great service to themselves if they spread the smoke of boasts to blind the eyes of the simple.</p>
      <p>But I have faithfully described the history.</p>
      <p>There is one thing I earnestly request from you and all good men, that if there is any rumor of the arrival of Cardinal Lorraine, you promptly inform me.</p>
      <p>He pretends to be making a journey to the new Roman king to be a matchmaker who will arrange the marriage of the King of France with his daughter.</p>
      <p>But he thinks otherwise.</p>
      <p>Therefore, before he approaches France more closely, it is important for us to know about his journey.</p>
      <p>You diligently investigate, and if you have discovered anything, rather inform me through arranged horses, so that his wicked plans may be countered.</p>
      <p>If only, when Baldwin passed through there, someone had been an advocate for my cause: certainly, either my right would have been denied, or he would never have escaped the noose.</p>
      <p>Although it was decreed for me not to touch on Polish diseases at this time, you prevailed with your prayers that I should expose the impious error by which our people are fascinated.</p>
      <p>I was amazed at his foolish arrogance, who so confidently threatens us.</p>
      <p>Although I suspect the author of the letter to be a certain audacious Frenchman, whose character I seem to see there as if in a mirror.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have set forth my judgment at your request, and because the response about the Mediator was lost, to prevent anything similar from happening, I have taken care to publish this, because it will also be useful to be widely known.</p>
      <p>While the letters await the messenger, a rumor arose about a new conflict, in which two enemy banners were cut down; for what is said about the death of Guise at Cambrai does not seem credible to me.</p>
      <p>Three thousand men were sent from Lyon to ravage the neighboring fields.</p>
      <p>Wheat has already been brought by many ships. If they recover Mâcon, as they hope, the supply of provisions will be ample due to free navigation from Burgundy; for the Saône will abundantly supply wheat, wine, wood, and hay.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and brother, whom I sincerely respect, along with the other fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you all safe, always guide you with His spirit, so that He may bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, January 16, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>I would have sent these sooner, if Trecius had not earnestly requested that I delay them until his departure; for he thought his arrival to you would be more welcome if he delivered them himself.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there was no other messenger at hand; but rather it was in my mind to hire one who would go as far as Bern.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the rumor, which the Germans spread here about the legates killed in Champagne, will also fly to you, which I nevertheless consider to be false, because the most illustrious Count Palatine had advised Mr. Spifame, the prince's legate, not to press for sending a legation.</p>
      <p>Thus, the matter had been interrupted.</p>
      <p>But what they say about one being from the Luneburg family, and the other a Count of Mansfeld, is in no way credible.</p>
