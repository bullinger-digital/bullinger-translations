      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best. Dear Master Heinrich and dear cousin, it is my friendly request to you that you do not forget about me because of my brother, as we have discussed with each other, that you might be able to arrange it well through the merchants, that you write to Magdeburg now at the Frankfurt fair. For I was in the young carnival at Bruggarten with the mayor Honeger, who has also recently come from Bern. He also told me that he had heard about my brother's business in Bern. Therefore, if possible, do your best. I, my wife, and my children all send our warmest greetings and an entire friendship. Nothing more, then take care with all of us.</p>
      <p>Given on the fourth day of March in the year 56. From me, Heinrich Bullinger in Brugg.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear cousin in Zurich, to be delivered to his hands.</p>
