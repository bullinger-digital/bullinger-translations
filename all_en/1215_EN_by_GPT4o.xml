      <p>May the Lord Christ be eternally with you, along with the offering of my very willing service, as well as all love and goodness.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious, dear lord and good friend, the Almighty, our faithful God and Father, has taken my dear brother-in-law, Hans Christoph Hoecklin, blessed, into His grace. My dear sister, his bereaved widow, as well as other relatives and all of us in the flesh have received this with heartfelt sorrow. But since we recognize through His grace that everything He does is well done and happens for our best, we have reason to praise and love Him through deed and life. We also give Him due thanks that He led him before his end, where he could be comforted and reminded of his salvation from God's word in his last needs. Secondly, the friendship and kindness that an honorable council has shown to the deceased's relatives in your honor also brings us great pleasure. May the Lord reward them for this, and whatever his relatives and all of us could earn and compare for the city of Zurich, we are always willing and inclined. The deceased's, my dear brother-in-law's blessed brother and bereaved widow (as a sign of a grateful mind towards an honorable council) have also arranged to give ten guilders to the poor box in Zurich, but not at all with the intention that it should bring any comfort to the deceased, but rather to serve as a particular delight to the poor. And if it were the case that it should bring any suspicion, as if it were done with the intention mentioned above, then I would like to ask you, my especially gracious, dear lord and friend, on behalf of my dear sister and our brother-in-law, to distribute these ten guilders among the house poor, where you know it is needed, and to serve them in this; the city and I will earn your friendship in all respects. I hereby commend you and your entire household to the gracious protection and care of the living God and pray that He may let you live long and well to His praise, for the betterment of your neighbor and your own salvation.</p>
      <p>Dated Montb√©liard, March 19, 1551. Your willing friend Peter Scher of Schwarzenburg the younger.</p>
      <p>To the learned and esteemed Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God in Zurich, my especially gracious, dear, and good friend, in Zurich.</p>
