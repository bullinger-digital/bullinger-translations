      <p>Greetings. In recent days, I responded to your letter dated June and truthfully dispelled the suspicion of my alienated mind, and I sent you a second crown for the exposition of the sky, hoping you received both, etc. Now I have nothing else but to adorn a complaint of lethargy, namely, the longer I expect tranquility for the church and the country, the more distant it appears. For, to recount at least one danger from countless troubles, the Lutheran faction has taken such deep root among us that it seems, in the judgment of the common people, impossible to uproot. The people of Augsburg, Ulm, and our prince Otto Heinrich accept no one into the ministry except extreme Lutherans, who are also emboldened because Mecardus, Johannes Heinrich, and several others, previously considered pious preachers, have joined the Wittenberg faction. Hence, you would hear a remarkable metamorphosis: the Neophytes openly condemn their predecessors and accuse them of heresy.</p>
      <p>The people bear the rashness of these men with difficulty; many are alienated, and there is also a great defection from them to a certain monk, Johannes Wilde, who preaches to the Papists at St. Maurice, whom some more discerning individuals prefer to all the Wittenbergers. The Lutheran symmists recently held a synod among themselves, if it pleases God, most holy, and unanimously decreed the corporal, carnal presence of the mortal nature of Christ in the bread, etc. Hence, it has come to pass that they, while preaching, have struck with anathema all who do not think likewise, and have specifically attacked the Zwinglians, Oecolampadians, Schwenckfeldians, etc. Even if not all did this, yet some of them, namely Peter Ketzmann, publicly proclaimed it. This insolence and impiety indeed stir up great turmoil; the church is again scattered, the simple populace laments, and begins not only to doubt the doctrine, both old and new, but also to think ill of it. I heard from a most Lutheran declaimer that in a single week, shortly before, five persons fell into despair, some taking their own lives, others being caught in the attempt and saved. No other reason is given for this evil than the burden of consciences, which are such horrendous difficulties and scandals that they are very pleasing to the Papists, so much so that they even highly praise the Wittenberg institution and seem to be somewhat reconciled with them.</p>
      <p>May the heavenly Father and Lord be gracious to us through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Among the orders of the empire, there is no other connection than the preservation of the papacy, as far as the greater part is concerned.</p>
      <p>The rest are so suffused with the shame of past events and the poorly managed affair and have become so astonished that they do not even dare to mutter or whisper against Rome. In short, I see with my own eyes that the empire is utterly ruined. Let us therefore learn to bear the yoke of the most severe tyrant shortly.</p>
      <p>The letter of the King of France to the states gathered in Frankfurt has energy and indeed singular grace; but it is sung in vain to the deaf. Farewell and convey my greetings to the consuls, your colleagues, the chief scribe, Mr. Gesner, Froschauer, etc.</p>
      <p>Lauingen, November 13, in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my gracious lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
