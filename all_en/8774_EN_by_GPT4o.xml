      <p>Your letter, written on August 20, 1571, was delivered to me in the past month of January by those three young men you mentioned in the letter itself, dearest brother in Christ. Indeed, last summer our letters were sent to you along with some books printed in your name against those papal bull nonsense. In fact, your book, most perfectly and truly dictated, and most accurately written, could not but be most pleasing to us and to all the pious.</p>
      <p>For this gift, we rightfully confess that we are greatly indebted to you: indeed, even the queen read your book, not without rejoicing. I hope that long before now you have received both the letters and books and small gifts from us: from which you will abundantly understand what we have done in publishing your book. Now to the letters you sent. As for your young men, be of good cheer; for those to whom they have been commended are diligently looking after them with a friendly spirit and a sense of piety. And this indeed they deserve, and the zeal, study, and infinite labors of Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Bullinger, and Rudolf Gwalther in propagating sincere religion and overthrowing the deceitful machines of false religion. As for your sons, since you have especially entrusted them to the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Salisbury, and me, we will take care that you are entirely without care: although the Bishop of Salisbury (which I cannot narrate without a groan, for he was a treasure of the English Church) breathed his last while visiting his diocese and migrated to heaven from here, indeed to his own advantage, but to our greatest and intolerable disadvantage. Nor indeed in the meantime will we neglect either Gwalther's son or Butler, whom you commend to me again and again. But to satisfy your wish, two of yours have their seats in the University of Cambridge, but in different colleges, and they are engaged with a large and learned assembly.</p>
      <p>Our affairs, by the great benefit of God, not to say a miracle, are in a fairly comfortable place.</p>
      <p>Recently among us, the Duke of Norfolk secretly conspired with the papists and even with the pope himself for the destruction of our most serene queen and kingdom, indeed for the subversion of the holy gospel of God. But the Lord is always graciously present with His own.</p>
      <p>For a long time, he was imprisoned not without suspicion of evil. At last, his wickedness was revealed. He was brought to trial and, justly condemned, was sentenced to death. At last, the foul bilge of the conspiring papists burst forth. Blessed be the Lord God, who timely brought such crimes to light! Now (as we hope) all is peaceful, except that Satan does not cease to go around and roar, seeking whom he may devour. Here let us help each other with mutual prayers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalther last year (I think) sent letters to our brother Parkhurst, the Bishop of Norwich: which because they stirred up some disturbances among men of his opinion, who are always striving for innovations and do not wish to be subject to the ordinances established in our church, I thought it necessary to warn our brother Mr. Gwalther to be more cautious, lest he seem to support contentions with his writings, either unknowingly or unwillingly. If my speech appears too harsh, let him consider from what spirit it has proceeded, certainly from a benevolent and most loving one. May the Lord Jesus preserve you safe for a very long time for His church!</p>
      <p>From the Isle of Ely in England, February 12, 1571.</p>
      <p>I almost passed over the little book you sent me about the authority of Scripture and the church. It is truly a golden little book, and worthy to be handled by all the pious. Yet the papists do not cease to bark against it. They say there are many doctrines that rely on the consensus of the fathers and the church, not on Scripture, such as these.</p>
      <p>Many things are necessary to believe, which are not in Scripture: The perpetual virginity of Mary. We use things strangled and blood.</p>
      <p>The Father is unbegotten. Christ descended into hell.</p>
      <p>The Son is consubstantial. Water is to be mixed with wine in the chalice.</p>
      <p>The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Martyrdom supplies the place of baptism.</p>
      <p>Infants are to be baptized. Prayers, offerings, and alms benefit the dead. One baptized by heretics in the form of the church is truly baptized. No one is admitted to the Eucharist before being baptized. God is three persons.</p>
      <p>The apostles were baptized.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with extraordinary learning and piety and my dearest brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
