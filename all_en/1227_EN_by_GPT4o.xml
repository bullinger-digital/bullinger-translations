      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received three letters from you, to which I have not yet replied. In the latest, you mention the nephew of Mr. Vergerius and ask that I give him 10 florins in your name, as you know he is in need of money. You do well to advocate for the cause of a very good friend.</p>
      <p>I called the young man to me and asked if he needed money. He said he was suffering from lack of funds. What have I done?</p>
      <p>My affairs are so reduced that I do not have even three, let alone ten gold coins at this time; for I live in an apostolic manner, and money does not wish to have a stable place with me. But things are well. I approached Thomas Grynaeus, with whom he is staying, and asked him to lend him three or four crowns if he needed them; he immediately promised that he would gladly do this for your sake. However, if he had refused, I would have borrowed even 20 florins from friends if he had needed them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be without worry; he now has money for his daily needs, apart from the sustenance provided by Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have not yet received any news from the Frankfurt fairs. I have only received this sad news, namely that Bucer has died in England; he was a remarkable instrument of God in the church and worked much in the Lord's vineyard.</p>
      <p>They say the Emperor is sending a delegation to the Turk to extend the truce for four years, so that he might more conveniently harass the cities of Saxony and Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Our Myconius preached on Judica Sunday and fell in the middle of his sermon in the very pulpit and gently settled to the ground; the cause was distillations from the head. He is still confined to bed, and I fear for his well-being. Perhaps he will never preach again due to the severity of the illness, which does not relent but increases daily.</p>
      <p>Farewell. More soon with a list of books. Monday after the Easter festival 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>Baron Georg has ordered me to greet you in his name, and if you have any news, to share it with him.</p>
      <p>I am now beginning to read the Decades sent as a gift. Regarding the church you write about, I am extremely pleased, and they could not be written more clearly, even if no one can satisfy the papists, who approve their nonsense and adorn monastic customs, even if Christ himself were to preach.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his ever-honored teacher.</p>
