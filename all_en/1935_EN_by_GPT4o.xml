      <p> S. It is very pleasing that you accept my exoneration as true and complete, and satisfying to you; for I would rather have countless Caesars and Roman pontiffs angry with me than you. I will never be persuaded to acknowledge that I have ever sinned against Matthias, no matter how you may involve me with him. I have been deserving of him in more than one respect; he himself should see how worthy a return he has made for my candor and his office. Certainly, those who are well acquainted with this matter will pronounce more fairly on it than many others, especially God, the knower of hearts. But now I will add nothing except these new things, which we received yesterday as certain from the people of Bern. </p>
      <p> For some time, it has been believed that Duke Maurice and Margrave Albrecht have reconciled with each other. However, recently someone came from Duke Maurice's camp and truthfully reported that both armies, Duke Maurice's and the Margrave's, are camped between Hildesheim and Hanover, a mile apart, and that the Margrave has 7,000 well-equipped horses and 50 companies of infantry, while Duke Maurice has 10,000 cavalry and 32 companies of infantry. On the 4th of July, Duke Maurice sent a trumpeter to the Margrave with a letter of defiance, which the Margrave had carried around his camp and shown to his cavalry and infantry, declaring that he would deliver a battle to Duke Maurice. Likewise, the next day, he sent his trumpeter to Duke Maurice with a letter of defiance. In response, Duke Maurice prepared for battle; however, the two Dukes of Mecklenburg and Pomerania intervened and, with great entreaty, obtained a truce for two days, the 6th and 7th of July, during which peace negotiations were conducted. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile, as the Margrave was found to be weak and unprepared, he retreated to the land of Hesse and, as it is believed, towards Schweinfurt. Duke Maurice pursued him closely, and as both armies began to observe and skirmish with each other on Sunday, the 9th of July, between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, it led to a battle and a fierce engagement ensued. Many honorable men, captains, and others perished there, and particularly Duke Heinrich of Brunswick's two sons, Philipp and Carol, are said to have died, and the old Duke was wounded, as well as Duke Maurice being shot through the arm. The Margrave's horse was found with two pistols on it, as well as his cloak; but where he is, is still unknown, as the post left early the next morning, Monday, the 10th of July. The man from Heideck pursued the fleeing army, and a great defeat occurred; Duke Maurice also captured all the artillery that the Margrave had. Let us pray for the peace of the church, whose ruler is the Prince of Peace. Farewell. 22nd of July, 1553. </p>
      <p> To his dear Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich. </p>
