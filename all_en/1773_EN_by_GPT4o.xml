      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I recently wrote to Pellicanus, my most esteemed uncle, that I had sent your letter to the Secretary of England, most illustrious man, to Strasbourg with a most faithful messenger, to relieve you of all anxiety, as I was then unable to write due to lack of time and also had nothing worthy of a letter. However, I received Peter Martyr's most learned treatise on the matter of the Eucharist, for which gift I give thanks that will never die, as I am completely lacking the means to repay. You overwhelm me with your kindnesses to such an extent that I do not know by what name I am more bound by your generosity; yet I wish that some occasion may be given to me, by which you may in no way find that you have bestowed a benefit on an ungrateful person. I am currently in poor health, having been tormented for eight days by the most severe illnesses, still unknown, to such an extent that I have once and again convinced myself that the end of my life is at hand; I experience no signs of plague, which, however, has claimed 2500 and more among us over two years. Yet the illness around the chest is sometimes so severe that its sudden recurrence forces me to many cries and expels sweat everywhere, soon the whole force vanishes and all the wickedness of the pain is removed far away. Now, however, by the kindness of God, I have recovered again and feel no pain at all; yet I expect every hour when the illness will recur and torment me with its rage. I have nothing new; but I am expecting our printers, who will return in two days from the Frankfurt fair; if they bring us anything good, I will gladly share it with you (if the Lord restores my health by His kindness). Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 4, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the especially renowned man for piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, incomparable friend. Zürich.</p>
