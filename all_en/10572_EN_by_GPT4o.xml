    <p xml:id="regest1">Has taken on a difficult position in RÃ¼ti; because he is being opposed and isolated by the residents of the former monastery and by the caretaker [Jakob Kumber]. [Wolfgang] Huber, the eldest of the monks, and the caretaker want to slander him to the authorities in Zurich because of his Matthias Day sermon, in which he spoke about the misdeeds and the end of Judas and sharply criticized the embezzlement of others' property, especially alms funds. Asks Bullinger to justify him if the matter comes up. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Peace be upon those who love, etc.</p>
      <p>My dear lord and father, I am well mindful of your fatherly words that you initially said to me, that you would place me in a position where I would face much resistance. "If God is for us, who can be against us?" [Romans 8:31]. I could well have spoken with Saint Thomas: "Lord, send me wherever you wish, except to the Indians!" Yet, I have resolved, with divine help, to bring forth some fruitful results from this obstinate people, as I have told you. But it is not within them, so if they do not allow it, the caretaker and they are of one mind and train an entire household with them, no one needs to turn to me, speak, and act well, they become hated and must pay for it, and they lead the people according to their will.</p>
      <p>So it happened recently on Saint Matthias' day, I addressed his election and the end of Judas and how Judas deserved a shameful death, this opinion being that he was a steward of God's property and the alms, which he misused and stole from, first the small, then the large, and in greed, his heart was possessed, that he forgot his honor and office and looked upon others' goods, God gave him a reprobate mind, that he fell into greater vices, into betrayal, bloodshed, etc. Thus, all who give themselves to greed and deal with others' goods and draw them to their hands, especially the holy alms meant for the poor, God will punish and meet with a dreadful end, also all those who live godlessly and do not change their lives, they will end miserably. And I cited other scriptures with this, namely Numbers 16: Dathan, Abiram; 2 Kings 9: Jezebel; 1 Samuel last chapter: Saul; 2 Samuel 18: Absalom; 2 Kings 19: Sennacherib, and Abimelech, etc. And thus I wish to give you an account of my teaching, and I believed that I had done well and exhorted in a Christian manner, to no one's detriment. Then the Huber, the oldest monk, ran up to the gallery and incited the caretaker, whether he would not do something about it, claiming I had shamed and mocked them and all the officials, and had called a community and testified against them. Yet, one must say what they want, there is nothing to it. But it is no different than as you are informed here. They do not want to be touched, punished, and led, and interpret all words sinisterly, as some have done to me, and incite other people who let it go, and then want to wash their hands. And I inform you of this as a dear father and lord, for I have achieved the goal of driving out the whores. For the lords have sent them their own spoon. And I hoped I would destroy the kingdom of the Antichrist and set up the pious Christ if the adversaries were not there; I had enough pious people.</p>
      <p>I ask you to excuse me if it was ever considered, and let me be committed to the truth and the right cause. Protect me, so I will strive for all honorable deeds.</p>
      <p>Greet your people for me. Farewell prosperously and healthily.</p>
      <p>Given on the Saturday before Oculi.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Steiner, submitting to your precepts.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy hands of the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of divine matters in Zurich, always obedient to his lord.</p>
