      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ and S. P.</p>
      <p>I believe I have sent two letters to you, most illustrious man, in recent times, in which I took care to describe to you everything that is happening here. If they have reached you, I do not doubt that you have understood everything exactly, and have been able to easily see by which paths the devil advances to attack the church. However, if they have been suppressed, I suspect it was the work of these new apostles. For they are remarkable deceivers, and nothing is done without deceit.</p>
      <p>However, to make you more certain that the things I wrote to Trecius are true, I am now sending this sheet, in which Gregory has vomited and published everything. I say that he has published everything that they thought should be published and spread among the people, especially at this time. For there is no end to the monsters they hide in their bosom.</p>
      <p>In the name of God, we ask and beseech you that Trecius returns to us as soon as possible, but instructed by you: to whom also letters have been given to those men who are of some importance here. But because in past times we have written extensively and clearly about all these matters, I do not see it as worthwhile to pursue them further now. However, I pray to the Lord God that He may keep you healthy and safe for the glory of His most holy name. Given in Krak√≥w on the 19th of November in the year of our Lord 1562.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Stadnicki, most devoted brother and minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and constant restorer of the true worship of God among the people of Zurich, my lord and brother to be reverently honored. Quickly, quickly, quickly, faithfully.</p>
      <p>In Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
