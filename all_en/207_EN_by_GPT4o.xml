      <p>S. P. D. I have nothing to write, other than the most sorrowful disturbances, most learned Bullinger, of almost all the free cities of Germany, which now almost all suffer from a dreadful servitude not only of things and bodies, but also (which grieves and torments far more) of consciences, which are severely oppressed and distracted by that sacred book published by the Emperor, which indeed, against all expectations and against the faith (as they say) given to all, so presses and compels our people that, the peace of the parties which he so solemnly promised, he fulfills in no part at all and so approves the papal, that, where it is still intact, he orders it to be kept whole, as if demonstrating that in the future council all things will return to their former state, so that nothing remains that our churches have received.</p>
      <p>The Wittenbergers have responded in writing to their Maurice, who asked what they approve or disapprove in that booklet; which I have decided to send to you, if perhaps you wish or have time to read it. It is rather cold and prepared to endure, which, however, cannot be endured and admitted without scandal. Much more freely and, if I am not mistaken, more learnedly and wisely is the response from the ministers of Strasbourg in a fairly large volume, which I have only seen rather than read; for the one who had brought it, received from Ambrosius Blaurer, suddenly took it away, denying us all opportunity to copy it. I beg you to take care to have this; you will have it from Ambrosius, if you wish. I also send the main points of the acts of the diet, but they are poorly copied by some lazy person. The acts themselves are being printed in Mainz.</p>
      <p>Some reformation is also being printed in Augsburg, I don't know whether it is to amend the morals and life of the clergy or the laity. Great men think it will be nothing other than a very painted specter.</p>
      <p>When I have obtained it, I will send it; but in the meantime, I beg you to kindly return all those things, so that I myself may be able to read them. Among the Danes and Sarmatians the gospel flourishes, and very well, as you also advised, the doctrine of Christ is held in England. On the fourth day before the Ides of July, the Emperor went to Bavaria to hunt, I don't know whether wild beasts or wild soldiers, who are said to be secretly enlisted in great numbers, to hunt. I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts. I wish the forest is well and does not mix branches of treachery, which may eventually harm us! For I see factions formed everywhere to attack the sound doctrine, which depraved morals cannot bear. But the Lord will also protect his own against every arm of the flesh.</p>
      <p>Lienhart Bek came here to St. Gallen yesterday; he confidentially informed me that the Emperor has finally been persuaded and convinced that the Interim will not be able to set or establish its foot firmly, unless it is the case that the Swiss are also kindly or forcibly made to accept the same. You see here the atrocity of the faction, which extends with very long hands, and I fear that the Pope proposes something very different to our people in the diets than what he decides with a few in corners.</p>
      <p>He also indicates that the Emperor has ordered quarters and lodging to be made at Füssen and Kempten for some Italian troops, which are certainly supposed to arrive there. It may well be a trick to frighten the cities of Lindau and Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>Someone from Augsburg has written here; he does not doubt that the Emperor intends to impose the Interim on the cities of the Confederation. Therefore, we must be vigilant and carefully consider with what mutual faith we will stand for the truth.</p>
      <p>Fortmüller wants to let Vogler's matter rest, but he absolutely refuses to admit that he has done wrong in word or deed. He cannot bear it, he wants to stand for the right. I have not been able to recover Ferrers from him.</p>
      <p>You will greet your colleagues with my words and commend me to the honorable councilors, whom I greatly wish to be in good health. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 20th day of July, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the far best and most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
