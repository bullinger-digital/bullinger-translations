      <p>To the man learned in the highest doctrine and the knowledge of the best arts, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed patron, Johannes von Ulm sends greetings.</p>
      <p>If letters are delivered to you from me less frequently than from others, I ask you not to attribute this to my negligence, nor even to my busyness, which, even if it were great, could never be so great as to interrupt the path of our love and my duty. For as I came to London, I was again informed that there was someone to whom I could give letters; thus, I have sent these second ones: in the first, I declared to you what was achieved by your recommendation, and what the state of England was, and how all our affairs were, as they are fleeting in prosperity, good in adversity. After those letters were sent, the great generosity of the Duke of Dorset followed towards me; for he promised in good faith to give me 20 crowns annually; he recently counted out 12 to me. I have been staying for three days in his court during this hot and dusty time, when no lectures are held in Oxford: I live, however, with Mr. Skinner and John Wullock, men indeed excellent and very eager for you, for whom nothing more sacred, nothing more learned, nothing more loving of you and our religion can be said or imagined.</p>
      <p>For as soon as they learned from your letters sent to me last month that you were safe and sound, they testified with me to God and men that they were exceedingly glad; and they asked repeatedly how the affairs of Switzerland and your dignity were: I replied that the state of all Switzerland was good, fortunate, and happy; that you indeed, with great fruit, preach and illuminate that most holy name of Jesus, the Best and Greatest God, without any exception of labor or time or occupation. Then Wullock, learned in Greek and Latin, fell into that conversation which we had very joyfully about you a few months ago. "Do you know," he said, "what was recently said back and forth in Oxford? After you had told us much and for a long time about Bullinger's excellent goodwill towards us, and what I had learned from his letters sent to you and many others; I thought to myself how we might obtain from him that he dedicate and describe some of his writings to our lord and prince; for I judge that he would thereby obtain the greatest favor among all the pious, and indeed eternal glory of his office from God. You seemed to promise us that Bullinger would certainly do this, as if for certain, if only you had more certain knowledge of the prince's will and judgment in this matter. Know, therefore, that I have signified this whole matter to him in detail, and it was so approved and praised by him that nothing at this time is more distant and ancient to him than to receive some booklet inscribed with his name from him. Now, therefore, it will be your task, my Johannes, to stand by your promises and fulfill the faith once given to me in this matter." Thus he spoke. Therefore, since it seemed very hard to me to deny him, whom I loved uniquely, and who I felt loved me dearly, especially when he was asking for promises and desiring excellent things, I decided that I must write to you, my teacher, about this matter immediately, so that you may undertake the free and just consideration of this duty. If you fulfill what we have promised about you, you will seem to have considered not so much the opinion of all good people as your own authority. I know, most excellent and dearest to me, that it is not wise to affirm the will of another; but if, however, from the face, from the eyes, from the speech, briefly if the sense and mind of anyone can be perceived from long use and honest life, I dare to assure you that this princely man, most polished in all liberal doctrine, will give such specimens of his genius and spirit, which are most worthy of a prince, and most glorious to you and all yours. Thomas Caius, a man most noble in the knowledge of all languages and most familiar to this prince, had decided to write to you about this matter in our opinion, unless the distance (by which we are now separated) had been an impediment. But about this another time. I want you to know this matter through me; use your judgment about it: for I have no doubt that you will perform what seems best to do with the counsel and prudence with which you are singularly endowed, at the earliest opportunity, and will accept this request in the part which either my utmost respect for you or your benevolence towards me demands.</p>
      <p>I am thinking of going to Oxford shortly, from where I will write to you if there is anything new, if the situation allows. Here everything is safe and tranquil: the king is well and alive; the peasant uprising is wonderfully quelled, many papists, about 5000, are killed, and almost all the rest are pacified.</p>
      <p>It remains for you to be well, and to convey my greetings in the most ample words to all who have deserved well of me. I am entirely devoted to this one thing, that neither you nor my best teacher Johannes Wolphius may seem to have promised anything rashly or received anything in vain about me: if I cannot fully liberate your faith in this, I will certainly accomplish it with zeal, indeed with singular diligence, so that both the fair and the unfair may someday understand that fortune rather envied us than that my effort failed your authority. Just make sure to persevere in loving me, and sometimes address us with your letters. You can do nothing more pleasing for me at this time. Farewell and be well again.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your authority, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with the highest piety, doctrine, and the use and knowledge of the greatest matters, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
