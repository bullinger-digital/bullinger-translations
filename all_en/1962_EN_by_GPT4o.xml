      <p>Greetings. We have received your letters along with those you wrote to Vergerio; I will send them to him as soon as I find a messenger.</p>
      <p>Returning from the Duke of Württemberg, he told us many good things from there, especially how he made your name less disliked by the preachers in that duchy; it is indeed surprising how they abhor the writings of all who affirm that Christ's flesh is in heaven, not truly here on earth. He says he is hopeful. We also saw letters sealed and signed by the Duke, confirming that he was received by the Duke as his advisor. But I do not doubt that he has informed you of everything, even if he did not pass through there on his return. He has translated into Italian the faith and confession of his prince, which was sent to the Council of Trent long ago, written by Brenz; moreover, he has published some other booklets written by him in Italian, now printed in Tübingen. I have read a good part of them. I praise what he has written; however, I wish he would teach more than he exclaims and use a milder style of speaking. Lord Baionensis now hosted Vergerio, Father Comander, and me twice, feeding us with no less learned conversations than dishes. He told us many things about the more learned men of Europe, whom he has almost all seen and spoken to, except for you there. You can hardly believe how well he remembers and promptly brings forth everything. I wish you could converse with him once, you would hear a man recounting many things about almost all matters of Europe. I know you would listen gladly; from there you would gather things that would be of great use. He has attended all the councils and public debates that have been in Germany for several years as a delegate. Therefore, during dinner, among other things, he spoke very amicably with Vergerio, saying to him in our hearing: "Reverend Vergerio, today and yesterday I eagerly devoured your booklets now printed in Germany. But to speak freely, as befits a free and friendly man: with your permission, you seem to me to pour out everything with a certain force and impetus, only to stir the minds of the common people against those who are religious; however, I advise you to pay attention to yourself in the future and, mindful of your own dignity, to take care to write things that can teach and contribute something to learned and serious men." Yet we noticed that Vergerio is held in high regard by him. Why do I write this? Four days ago (if I am not mistaken), Lord Baionensis sent his scribe to me, asking that I quickly send you letters of new matters, which he showed me to read, along with a little letter composed to you; he also asked me to send to you how he, in the letters he showed me, written to a certain friend in Clavenna, advised all Italians and Vergerio to refrain from slander and to act more modestly.</p>
      <p>I replied that I would not have a messenger to Zurich on the same day and could not find one before Tuesday, as you know. Then I asked that the scribe write down the words of Baionensis from that letter for me, so that I would not say anything more or less. He did; you see it on this sheet. With what intention he does this, I do not know; certainly, he frequently accuses Calvin of excessive vehemence and rashness. I perceive that he has sent everything to you without waiting for this day. To those, I add this: those who come to us from the region of Etsch (Adige) assert firmly that King Ferdinand is moved against his brother Charles and that there is already consultation on how to restrain Charles's power. I will send you a copy of that confession of ours when I find a trustworthy messenger. I am more verbose, even if unwillingly, but since there is nothing else to write, I have written this. Farewell, most illustrious man, and continue to love us in return. Comander, Heimius, completely worn out by old age, Tscherner, Pontisella greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, on the 19th of August, in the year 1553. Yours entirely, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
