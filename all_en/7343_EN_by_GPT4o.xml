      <p>Greetings. I am compelled to retract what I wrote to you these days, namely that the deacons of the churches of Geneva and Lyon would come to you. Indeed, they came here, as I wrote, and brought us these letters, which you will see here, and they intended to proceed to you as well. But when they heard the opinion of our senate, they preferred to return to their own rather than to proceed further.</p>
      <p>They seemed to our people to have acted very imprudently, because, without waiting for the money, which they knew had been collected here for them, they dared to send a delegation and demand more, even though they did not yet know what it was that had been collected for them before. They could have at least warned us with a single word; but they did not do so. Therefore, it did not seem right to the senate to establish a new collection again, nor even for them to proceed to your churches; for they think you will perform your duty voluntarily. Furthermore, it would be a sign of extreme lamentation if they were to approach the churches in this way now, and it would encourage the enemies if they knew, interpreting it as if the money collected by our Republic was to aid Cond√© against them; therefore, it is better that this be done through letters and ministers of the word rather than through such a delegation.</p>
      <p>Thus, they returned to their own. The total collected here for them approaches a thousand crowns; we believe that you will not fail this cause either. Meanwhile, we have nothing new. I hear that some even doubt what the Genevans wrote about the defeat of the Savoyard cavalry; others affirm it to be true. Today, a certain citizen and merchant of this city reported to me for certain that they clashed again in France and that our side was victorious, and that the king was brought to the point of requesting a three-day truce, during which peace might be made. How true this is, I do not affirm. I write to you what I have and from whom I have it; I do not want anything I write to be sold as certain in my name. I would rather write nothing than be accused of vanity; but since you urge me, I write what I have; I cannot affirm what they are like. When everyone believes something, then I too begin to believe; meanwhile, often things that seemed not worthy of belief at first hearing are true.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you and wish you and yours a most prosperous year; I also wish this for all of you.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the very day of the Lord's birth, at the beginning of the year of our Lord 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
