    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Frecht's letter [to Blarer], which he is returning. Regrets that [Johannes] Bader is following Schwenckfeld. Would like to see the commentary on Matthew by [Wolfgang] Musculus. The book described as learned by [Martin] Frecht, written by the historically inexperienced [Andreas] Osiander [“Coniecturae de ultimis temporibus”], would have been better not printed; Daniel and the [Revelation] of John are poorly interpreted there, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and others are mistreated. Bullinger received a regrettable lampoon against Osiander even before the book was sent, which he, after becoming aware of the book, understands as God's punishment. Greetings to Frecht, who should know that neither Bullinger nor Vadian advocate war [against Luther]. Bullinger's silence is solely due to his many tasks. Cochläus - may he convert! - was certainly punished by God, even if in a kinder way than Uzzah was back then.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I thank you for Frecht's letter, dearest brother. I am returning it here.</p>
      <p>I am saddened that Bader, neither an unlearned nor a bad man, has fallen into the Schwenckfeldian heresy. However, I am consoled again by what the apostle said: "There must be heresies, so that those who are approved may be made manifest among you" [1 Corinthians 11:19]. May the Lord open his eyes and restrain the man Schwenckfeld, harmful in many ways, whom several centuries have not seen a man so apt to deceive many as this hypocrite. Many evils, long since cut down, are flourishing again in him.</p>
      <p>Until now, I did not know that Musculus had written on Matthew. I wish I could see the man's work! But I will discuss these things with him.</p>
      <p>Frecht says that Osiander has published a book of profound learning on the end of the world. But I (speaking without bias) think he would have gained greater esteem for learning and piety among the devout if he had not published that book.</p>
      <p>I see that the man has many things prepared for display and delights in some great and profound cabalistic matters. He treats the passages of Daniel and John unlearnedly. He promises a chronology; but at the end of the old Rome and the beginning of the new, he sufficiently shows that he is not entirely skilled in times and histories.</p>
      <p>He bites Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and others with a venomous bite, lest he should not seek praise perpetually from the contempt of others. May the Lord have mercy on the man!</p>
      <p>In recent days, before I had seen Osiander's conjectures, friends sent me the "Mirror of Osiander," a learned and satirical poem published against Osiander. At that time, I wished it had not been written by the author, whoever he may be; but when I read the conjectures, I think of the judgment of the Lord, who imposes on him what he does not want, while he speaks what he wants. Certainly, I would have preferred both to be omitted.</p>
      <p>Greet Frecht, and tell him that neither Vadian nor I favor Mars (war); nor does he have any place among us. Therefore, it is not because of Mars that the Muses are silent, but because of business.</p>
      <p>The Lord undoubtedly exercised the judgment of Uzzah on my Cochläus, but more mercifully; for he revived, but to repentance. If he continues to apply his rash and profane hands to the ark, the hand of the Lord will eventually strike him. May He have mercy on him!</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 31, from the evening sermon 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
