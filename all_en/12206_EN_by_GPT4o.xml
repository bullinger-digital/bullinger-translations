    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian has understood Bullinger's last letter [the postscript of which is received above No. 2154]. Bullinger should not doubt that [the contributions for the "Swiss Chronicle" by Johannes Stumpf] will be completed well and to his satisfaction. However, due to his many official duties, Vadian has not yet been able to complete the description of the "Thurgau" and the [St. Gallen] monastery. - Vadian has indeed laid out his work somewhat more extensively for the benefit of historiography than Johannes Stumpf would think, as he intends to provide an overview of the rule of the Frankish kings from [Clovis I] to Louis [IV the Child], the son of King Arnulf [of Carinthia], especially since the founding of monasteries and abbeys took place under their rule. This work is already well advanced. Vadian has consulted printed and handwritten chronicles as well as documents, and he strives to illustrate the difference between the old, good customs and the innovations, especially among the clergy and with regard to the popes, so moderately that no one can accuse him of hatred or insubordination. However, he leaves the judgment to Bullinger and Johannes [Stumpf]. - After that, a chapter on the origin of monasticism is to follow, then one on the state of the German abbeys and monasteries at the time of the old Frankish rule. Even if it might offend the clergy, they will have to admit the truth [of this description]. - The fourth chapter deals with the beginning of the monastery in St. Gallen and contains a catalog of the abbots, which causes Vadian the greatest effort. In doing so, Vadian will cautiously oppose the impious abbots. During the time of the exiled abbot Kilian [Germann], he not only searched the [St. Gallen] monastery library but also many documents, account books, and the protocol book, in which the newer, foreign negotiations and the session reports were recorded and from which it can be deduced how Toggenburg and other [possessions] came to the monastery. Vadian will likely make himself unpopular through this. - Vadian will also depict the history of the city [St. Gallen], and how it attained its freedoms. [The Zurich] mayor [Johannes] Haab learned some of this [in 1534] in his role as [arbitrator]. Vadian will strive for utmost care and caution: Praise of the city is permitted, but only under the claim of truth. - If [Bullinger and Johannes Stumpf] give him time, Vadian intends to have everything compiled by the coming August. If not, he will at least have dealt with the city [St. Gallen], whose illustration is already completed. Vadian's brother-in-law Hans Widenhuber plans to come to Zurich with the painter [Melchior GÃ¼gi] (a saddler, but as skilled as Apelles) at Pentecost [May 24] to deliver the picture of Christoph [Froschauer]. - Vadian will definitely finish his begun work. It might even be published. Like Stumpf (whose work he holds in high regard), he writes [his chronicle] in the Zurich writing style. He aims to have everything compiled by [September 1]. - Bullinger should share this letter with Stumpf and urge him to hurry with leisure.</p>

      <p> S. My willing service along with what I could do before. Gracious, dear lord and friend and brother; I have understood your recent letter to me and have no doubt that the matter will be handled and executed in such a good manner that it will be pleasing to you, and if anything comes up regarding the writing, I will accomplish everything and not hide it. As for the Thurgau and what pertains to the description of our monastery, I am not yet finished, nor have I been able to finish. I wish that you could see or actually know what my tasks are. I often wish, God knows, for a month or two in a forest and am now willing to take a leave from the council so that I may have space and opportunity to complete this one task. However, I have undertaken the work somewhat more extensively than Mr. Hans Stumpf might think, and for the good of the entire history. Since the beginning of the monasteries and foundations, as well as the restored faith, occurred in the times and years when the old German and Frankish princes ruled in all our lands of the Confederation and the land of Swabia and Bavaria, and since most of the foundations were established by them, and yet few people carry any knowledge of how it stood in those years and what transpired in them, it seemed necessary to me to compose an extract or epitome of the rule of the old German princes of the Franks, from the first baptized King Louis to the last Louis, King Arnulf's son (with whom the line of the true old Frankish kings ended and became extinct). This work is now completed (thank God) and I do not believe that you have read it so briefly, orderly, and clearly (with all sorts of uncommon things recorded) by any German (but I do not wish to boast about it; the work shall praise or criticize me), drawn from good old, not only printed but also written chronicles and substantiated with old letters of evidence (intermixed therein). It will nevertheless run to a book of paper or somewhat more. I also strive everywhere to enable the common reader to measure what has been customary from old times and what (especially concerning the clergy) has been newly adopted, and I let the popes be very faithfully depicted, and all with such moderation that no one will be able to accuse me of any hatred or bias (for I know well the law of history), but only to zealously bring the truth to light, etc. Perhaps the mountains will labor, and a ridiculous mouse will be born. But I want to have the judgment willingly and gladly placed at home with your Honor and Mr. Hans, (whom I have offered to serve). Next follows the title on monasticism, how it originated and what its foundation and cause were; about the first, middle, and last monks, etc. The following title is about the state of the German abbeys and monasteries at the time of the old Frankish rule, from which they mostly began and were brought up. This title will cause pain to the current swarm of priests and monks; but they will have to acknowledge the truth. The fourth title is about the beginning of the monastery in St. Gallen, of which I have very credible, undeniable good materials, which will be brought forth from the monasticism itself, etc. You will see that. After that follows the catalog of abbots, which gives me the greatest work. And it is well worth striving for, so that everything is presented purely and truthfully and without suspicion. </p>
      <p> This I want to bring to the stage masterfully, with God's help. I will use rhetorical insinuations and indirect praises, which if anyone examines, will taste more of aloe than of honey. Finally, from the studies of the more reputable abbots, I will overthrow the arts and efforts of the impious abbots. For I have examined and searched, during the recent exile of Kilian, not only the library of our monastery but also the old documents found there, furthermore the account books and especially the one that contains examples of more recent diplomas and the acts of many years of assemblies, etc., and how Toggenburg was bought and paid for and otherwise came to the monastery (as they call it), etc. From all of these, many and various things not only pleasant to read but also fruitful, which I will outline with as much brevity as I can. I may perhaps incur some hatred; but for the sake of truth, hatred must be borne. I want to truthfully show our city's history and how it became free, except for a few things, which I will frankly present. Then I will also append the rights that our city has within the confines of the monastery (for which one is also preserved with letters and seals). It is not known that we are so little obliged to the monastery and that my lords have such good justice therein. The lord consul Habius discovered some things when he recently acted as judge, then also as an honorary arbitrator. There I will act very candidly; for nothing is more foolish, nothing more odious than boastful and falsely self-claiming arrogance. It is permissible to commend the homeland, but with the patronage of truth, which I will indeed religiously cultivate. But these things are said to you and Stumpf. If you are willing to give me time, I will have everything written by my hand by the coming August; if not, I will undertake only the city, whose illustration is already made; and my brother-in-law Hans Widenhuber has informed me that he intends to come with the painter at Pentecost and deliver it to Master Stoffel. You will see a fine painter; he is a saddler, but of admirable and far more elegant talent than his face and forehead promise. Apelles could not have made it more accurately than he, so that our true and artistic painters do not want to undertake the work after him. But my intended work will nevertheless be completed and kept with me; perhaps it will also come to light with time. I write everything in the Zurich dialect, which Stumpf also uses, to whose work I attribute much; but in mine, more will be reported in many places, in some fewer. If I were given space, I would certainly have everything together by Verena's day. </p>
      <p> With this, God be with you. Share this letter, I pray, with Stumpf and urge him to hurry slowly. I will send you the rest concerning your Honor shortly. Be assured, you will be pleased. St. Gallen, May 14, 1545. </p>
      <p> Joachim Vadian, yours. </p>
      <p> To D. Heinrich Bullinger, as a revered brother. </p>
