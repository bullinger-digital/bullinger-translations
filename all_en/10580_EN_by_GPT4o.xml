    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to the inquiry from the Wiler Chancellery of the Abbot of St. Gallen regarding how many Bernese [politicians] had been at Kyburg and in Zurich, [from the clerk Großmann] in Pfäffikon exaggerated information was provided; Bailiff Lavater communicates this to prevent rumors.</p>

      <p>My willing service, friendly greetings and all the best beforehand, friendly, dear Mr. Bailiff.</p>
      <p>The scribe of the monk in St. Gallen from Wyl has written very earnestly to Pfäffikon and requested to know how many of the Bernese were with the bailiff of Kyburg and Zurich. Then the one in Pfäffikon wrote back again, now splendidly and gloriously much more than in the matter. Namely, there are 6 councilors from Bern there, etc. And what he now knew, which was against the abbot, he wrote. My lord of Kyburg has instructed me to write this, in case (if) some talk should arise from it, so that you would know how it went. Nothing more, then God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich on the 5th of March in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your willing servant.</p>
