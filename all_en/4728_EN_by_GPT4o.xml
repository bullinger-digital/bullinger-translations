      <p>Greetings. I have now received your letter written on the 21st of this month along with the discussion of the words of the Lord "In my Father's house" and I am grateful. I have again received letters from the court, in which friends express that what you wrote was most pleasing to them. I believe that in a good and pious cause, the king will not lack friends and that God will be with him.</p>
      <p>On the eighth or ninth of April, I will visit you and we will discuss matters in person with several others. The whole family sends their regards to you.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to all friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, March 24.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
