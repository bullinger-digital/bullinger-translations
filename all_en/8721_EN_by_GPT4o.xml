      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Reverend Father, I am responding to your letter later than I should, and this is due to the fault of our Gabriel, who, without informing me, sent off two careless messengers from your side; in addition, my beloved wife fell ill, from which she is now freed by the grace of God, after having given birth to twin sons, Wolfgang and Leonhart, on the 4th of December, and has now recovered well. I thought it was in the interest of our friendship to inform you of this, so that you might share in my joys and together with me give thanks to our God for His merciful and abundant blessing, and at the same time keep my little domestic church in your prayers. I ensured that your letters addressed to the University of Wittenberg were delivered by a trustworthy man to the chief professor of that school (my greatest friend), although I have not yet received any response; however, I do not doubt that they have been properly taken care of, nor do I want you to doubt. If they ever respond, I will ensure it is safely delivered to you. I will send you back the copies of the letters from the University of Wittenberg and your response, which you shared with me to read, through another messenger; it could not be done through this one. You will learn about the proceedings of the synod of the electoral churches held in Dresden from these pages. A certain friend from Wittenberg writes to me in this manner: "All good people hope that the Genevans and the Swiss, when they read this document and judge it candidly, will join us and embrace the same doctrine with us. We pray to God that this may happen." But I await your judgment. Please let me know if Mr. Gwalther has written anything on the Gospel of Matthew; for I have obtained his homilies on Mark, Luke, and John from a certain bookseller of ours. He asserts that he has seen nothing written on Matthew by the same author. If homilies on Matthew exist, I will arrange to purchase them from your Froschauer at the next market, etc.</p>
      <p>I write carelessly and quickly on the very day of my wife's delivery, 1571. More at another time. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Laurentius Dürnhoferus.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and most illustrious man, outstanding in learning, virtue, prudence, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, a pious and sincere teacher of the Gospel of Christ in the Church of Zürich, his lord and friend, to be revered.</p>
