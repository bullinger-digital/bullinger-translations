      <p>Grace and peace be with you from God through Christ, our Lord and mediator.</p>
      <p>Reverend man and dearest friend in the Lord, Master Laurentius Agricola, our mutual friend, delivered to me a letter written by you along with a certain literary gift.</p>
      <p>Indeed, when he previously spoke with pious enthusiasm of your remarkable and most memorable piety combined with utmost humanity, I began to love you greatly; now, however, since you yourself, amidst your great occupations, have not only deemed it worthy to write to me, a man bound by neither acquaintance nor familiarity, but also to offer your friendship voluntarily, I embrace and observe your humanity with a much more ardent spirit. And if only there were an opportunity or means by which I could in turn demonstrate my zeal and love towards you.</p>
      <p>But since this is denied at present, I will always retain the memory and desire to show gratitude and will pray to Christ, our Lord reigning at the right hand of God, to guide your heart with His Holy Spirit and to confirm and illuminate you for the glory and truth of His kingdom. Farewell happily in the Lord. From Lauingen, on the ninth day of the month of October in the year 53.</p>
      <p>Johannes Schmid, minister of the Church of Christ, which is there.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man endowed with exceptional piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his dearest lord and brother in Christ.</p>
