    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests help in finding a preacher for [Balthasar von Kuenring] and inquires about someone from Hirzel who might be suitable. [Martin] Frecht reports in a letter about a newly published edition of the "Loci communes," in which Melanchthon explains his opinion for the French king; further, he writes that Schwenckfeld, who is unreliable, has found a place to stay in Ulm, and Franck has been asked by the Ulm council to justify his writings; both have followers from Augsburg. Zwick thanks God for the recovery of a member of Bullinger's household. In Schaffhausen, the church is threatened due to the disunity between the authorities and pastors regarding the Anabaptists. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>You know what kind of minister that baron, who was recently with you, desires. If you know someone, I would like you to inform me of his character and nature along with his name; for the baron will write to me from Frankfurt about what I should do. There is someone from Hirzel near Horgen, whom you know well. Let me know what kind of person he is; for the lord would indeed be worthy of having a well-mannered, sensible fellow. Therefore, be helpful and give advice.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to report, except that Philipp Melanchthon has once again published his "Loci Communes," in which he accurately explains the reasoning behind the advice given to the French king. This is what Frecht writes to me, adding some notes about Schwenckfeld and Franck. "Schwenckfeld," he says, "has found lodging with us in Ulm. He promises earnestly to observe the laws of concord, but I fear that, like one hiding under the shield of Ajax, he will meanwhile spread his own doctrines under the pretext of this concord. He stubbornly wants to defend that the human nature in Christ is completely deified to the extent that it has shed the nature of a creature. Franck," says Frecht, "has been ordered by the council to publicly either declare or retract all his erroneous writings. They have their supporters, especially from Augsburg, who have flocked here in droves to avoid the plague." These are a few things from Frecht's letters.</p>
      <p>I thank the Lord that your young man has recovered, and I pray that He keeps you especially safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Be concerned about Schaffhausen; for there is little agreement between the magistrate and the ministers, with some Anabaptists, as they say, provoking them. Certainly, the churches must be helped lest they perish due to dissensions.</p>
      <p>But farewell; for I cannot write more. Thomas with his sister and brother Konrad wish you the very best.</p>
      <p>September 10, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I send greetings to Theodor, Leo, and especially Pellican.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
