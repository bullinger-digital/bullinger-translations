    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Zwick is traveling to Zurich; Blarer would prefer to negotiate with Bullinger and the others himself. He wishes unity and steadfastness for the Swiss churches in light of the concord activities, as no one can force them to abandon their stance; he admonishes [Bibliander] not to be carried away into publishing against fellow believers with different views, so that unnecessary conflict is avoided. He thanks for the dedication to the [brothers] Zwick and to him in the commentary on the Epistle to the Romans. [Bibliander] will soon respond with his own poem. Best wishes to Pellikan and everyone else. He would like to have the Psalter by [Helius Eobanus Hessus], if it is available in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If the ornament of our city, Johannes Zwick, were not already traveling to you, I would very much wish to have enough time and leisure to write abundantly to you, to our Theodor, and to my other friends in Zurich and Bern about all the matters which, unless we are careful, will one day cause a great ruin to the Christian republic. Now, as he departs to you and shares the same views and sentiments with us, I entrust myself to other occupations.</p>
      <p>You will hear how there is no cessation for some good brothers, but they are too officious in mending a worthless concord, and I wish it were worthless, Bullinger, and not also fatal, if you consider the outcome. I wish this one thing for the Swiss churches, that they may be true to themselves and, neglecting all superstition, continue to be united in that concord which Christians sincerely adhere to. Defend your freedom, my Bullinger, preserve matters intact, so that you are not exposed to one danger after another, be cautious. No one will rightfully expel you, no one will force you to do things that are not inherently part of the nature of purer Christianity. To this end, I especially exhort you and Theodor not to rush into publishing against those who contrive against our spirit, if they are not otherwise opposed to Christ. Clearly, contempt and hatred should be directed not at the persons of the pious, but at the vice itself. Gentleness and tolerance will commend your cause more than any contentions, and the plans of the obstinate are hindered by neglect, but promoted by provocations, if they find a place.</p>
      <p>That you have deemed the Zwick family and mine worthy of the honor of your commentaries on the Pauline Epistles is both pleasing and deserves gratitude.</p>
      <p>I have compensated Theodor's most charming poem with my own musings; however, I have postponed sending them to him today, so that if I review them, they may be more adorned.</p>
      <p>I wish Pellikan and all of yours to be well.</p>
      <p>I hear that Helius Eobanus Hessus has published the Psalms of David in elegiac verse; I wish to know if they are available with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable Bullinger, and continue to regard me and our city with mutual love.</p>
      <p>Constance, May 18, 1537.</p>
