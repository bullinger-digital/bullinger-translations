    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has nothing new to report. Fear and distress are spreading. He sent a letter via Konrad Zwick [No. 2778]. May Zwick's mission [in Zurich] be successful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer has received Bullinger's letters [No. 2774 and No. 2776]. He need not have apologized for his letter [No. 2767], especially since Blarer is a greater scribbler. But how could it be otherwise in light of the many events and the lack of time?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On [January 26], the council of Konstanz sent a courier [...] to Augsburg, to whom Blarer also entrusted a letter for Georg Frölich. The Spaniards intercepted the courier and confiscated the letters (which contained nothing important). They did nothing to the courier.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [Peter] Buffler writes from Isny that among the delegates sent from there to Emperor Charles V was the carpenter and guild master Hans [...] (who had once been to Bullinger). This man, who has known the Emperor for several years, said he clearly recognized him both on horseback and on foot when he was in Ulm for the homage.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Emperor is in Ulm, as is Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, who will perform the act of homage personally. The imperial troops are said to be impoverishing the people in the Ulm area and behaving strangely in the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Buffler writes that he was informed from Vienna (where he has a branch) that Suleiman I is in great armor. Additionally, there are many robberies in Franconia. For instance, several wagons with goods from the Netherlands were confiscated near Würzburg, and two more were plundered near Nuremberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The Emperor is sending Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach with 500 horsemen and several units against Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. He also called on the Franconian nobility and the bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg [Melchior Zobel and Weigand von Redwitz] to support the Margrave militarily. However, the latter rejected the Emperor's request at a meeting in Nuremberg, stating that the House of Saxony had not attacked them. The Elector is said to have 5000 cavalrymen and 20000 infantrymen. Landgrave Philip of Hesse is also said to have a considerable army. And Coburg is well prepared for a possible attack by the Margrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blarer must break off, as he also wants to send several letters to Württemberg and Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Bullinger should continue to pray for the people of Konstanz. May the Lord protect them from a false peace and reveal His will to their authorities. Without the courage granted by God, they will not be able to withstand the failure of the other cities. However, Blarer hopes that the gracious Lord will continue to stand by the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bernardino Ochino arrived in Konstanz on Saturday evening [January 29] coming from Augsburg. The Emperor had demanded his extradition (as well as that of Sebastian Schertlin), but Augsburg enabled his escape. He will probably also come to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Frölich and many other good, pious people are suffering a thousand torments. May God assist them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] In haste.</p>

      <p>S. There is nothing new, my dear brother, that I have to write. Fear and distress are breaking out everywhere. I have written to you through my dear cousin. I hope he will accomplish something good. May God will it!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have received your letters today with great thanks. I am surprised that you ask for forgiveness for your writing, as I am a much greater scribbler. But the events and the lack of time do not allow otherwise. I would gladly exchange mine for yours in every way.</p>

      <p>My lords sent a messenger with letters to Augsburg eight days ago. I also gave him a letter for Georg Frölich. He was intercepted by the Spaniards on the way and the letters were taken from him. They did nothing to him. There was nothing special in the letters.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Buffler writes to me from Isny that Master Hans, a carpenter and guild master in Isny (this man has been with you at some point) was also one of the envoys to the Emperor to accept the reconciliation. He says he saw him clearly and distinctly. I have known him for several years; I saw him on horseback and standing, as they lay at his feet. He is the one indeed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now the Emperor is in Ulm, and Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is also there. He wants to perform the act of homage personally. People say it is a wonder how they impoverish so many poor people around Ulm and behave strangely in the city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Buffler in Isny writes that he received a letter from Vienna (where he has his business) that the Turk is preparing for a significant campaign. Also, there is much robbery in Franconia. Not far from Würzburg, several wagons with goods from the Netherlands were taken away; they were carried off. Also, not more than 3 miles from Nuremberg, 2 wagons with goods were cut open; the riders took from them what they liked.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Emperor is sending Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg against the Elector with 500 horsemen and several companies of foot soldiers. He has summoned the nobility in Franconia, as well as the bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg, to send troops with the Margrave. But they held a meeting in Nuremberg with their envoys and rejected the Emperor's request. They said the House of Saxony had done nothing against them; thus, they should come together further. It is not known what will come of it. The Elector is said to have 5000 cavalrymen and 20000 infantrymen; the Landgrave also has a considerable force of foot soldiers and horsemen. Coburg is well fortified to hold against the new force that Margrave Albrecht is leading there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Now I must break off. I have several letters to finish for Württemberg and Ulm.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Oh, do not cease to pray and plead that the Lord God may graciously protect us from a false peace and reveal His gracious will and pleasure to our authorities here. For He alone must give heart and courage, otherwise it cannot and will not be that we will stand here in such instability of all others. For we are not equipped for it with any means. But the dear God, who has so graciously meant us above many others in many things until now, will not abandon us now, I hope. Therefore, He is heartily prayed to through His Son, our Savior.</p>

      <p>Bernardino Ochino arrived here on Saturday evening from Augsburg. The Emperor had demanded him and Captain Schertlin to be sent out, but they managed to get him out. It is thought he will come to you as well.</p>

      <p>The good Letus is in a thousand troubles, and many other good pious people with him. May God help them fatherly and be comforting to them. Amen.</p>
