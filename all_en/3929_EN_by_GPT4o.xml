      <p>Most excellent man, from the letters and the account of our Mr. Fabritius, I easily see that my letters have not been delivered to your kindness. Therefore, you should know that we have again received the book you sent to our son Alexander, which we had requested, unharmed, and also adorned, which our son greatly desired, with the characters of your hand of the most beautiful and serious sentence. We also received five kisses; however, it would have been more pleasing if you had sent us some of your Sermons in exchange for them. Nevertheless, we give the greatest thanks for your great kindness; you continually do what is fitting for you, and more than you are obliged to do.</p>
      <p>May God, our heavenly Father, grant you sufficient strength. The last letters you wrote to our Fabritius about Melanchthon, he read to me. I am not surprised that he now rushes to us, but more so that he has been absent for so long; for those with little education do not easily grasp what is said about sermons and figurative or metaphorical words (for I know how slow I was myself to grasp such things); but truly, that learned men like Philipp do not wish to recognize this, is most surprising.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing notable to write, and if there were, our brother Fabricius writes enough. Farewell, therefore, most excellent of men, and do not cease to love your Philipp.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 23rd day of April in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Entirely from the heart, as always, your devoted Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy of reverence by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
