      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, who is our only peace.</p>
      <p>Your letters have been delivered to us, most excellent and esteemed brothers, from which we have understood what kind of discussion was held between Mr. Calvin, Farel, and you regarding that sacramental matter, which has been contentiously debated by many for far too long, not without grave offense and danger to many souls and consciences. We have also learned, not without singular joy, that mutual hands have been given among you, so that by establishing a harmonious declaration, you have cut away all that seemed to have given occasion for disputes on both sides until now. We have read the declaration sent to us. We have also particularly understood from our brother Haller by what occasion you have come to this discussion on both sides. You indeed ask that we also wish to write to you our judgments on this declaration. We are prepared to do this, and all the more willingly as your humanity, love, and pious care, which you also bear for our churches, have been deeply perceived by us, for which we do not doubt you seek the best counsel. Therefore, we wished to respond to your few matters, and not to conceal any of our opinions from you.</p>
      <p>And first indeed, regarding the declaration itself, although in the first few chapters it seems not so clearly, but somewhat obscurely stated, we have nothing to criticize in the matter itself (as far as we can judge). But everything seems to be said well, learnedly, and Christianly, especially since in the latter part, those things that have hitherto supplied material for this contention are diligently rejected. However, because we are not unaware of how much that method of concord has harmed our churches, and what could again be done by those brothers acting insidiously, and since it is also said in the preface that not everything that could be usefully and aptly said about the sacraments is included in this confession, and especially those things that otherwise agree with the true understanding of them, etc., we suspect and fear that under this pretext any obscurities might be imposed or concealed. And therefore, having been struck as fishermen, we cannot help but be perpetually anxious, especially since it is not hidden from us what kind of people have sometimes been discovered in this cause who now join hands with you (for which we indeed congratulate both them and you greatly).</p>
      <p>Therefore, it seems to all of us by unanimous consent that this confession should not be published at this time, but that the mutual agreement between your churches and ours should suffice for the present, lest that unexpected concord produce more suspicion and disturbance than peace. But if it seems advisable to you to publish it publicly, it will indeed be permissible by us: we prescribe nothing. However, we will not be able to submit and subscribe our names. Not because we refuse to bear witness to the truth, but because neither the times nor the customs of our churches would bear this.</p>
      <p>For with hatreds still growing, we could easily be accused by our people, especially the weaker ones, of some unknown machinations, from which our church would be rendered more disturbed than peaceful. It will be easier for you to do this, whose churches have not been shaken by as great a commotion as ours. Nor would it be permissible for us to do this without the consent of our magistrate. Whom we do not consider it fruitful to appeal to on this matter. Moreover, since our disputation and your confession against Luther have sufficiently and more than adequately declared whatever pertains to this cause, we do not see how it would be greatly beneficial to publish another confession. But neither has there ever been a public dissension between the church of Geneva and ours, so it seems unnecessary to publicly testify our agreement even to the papists.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it seems more fruitful that from the writings published hereafter on both sides, the whole world may perceive that we do not disagree at all. Likewise from daily sermons. Therefore, continue in that doctrine which you have used until now, as there is no doubt about you. We will also continue faithfully in the same. Let the Genevans continue in that which they have declared here, having cut away those ambiguous expressions which they have used until now. Let them cease to slander the doctrine of our people. In this way, it seems safer to declare our agreement than by immediately publishing a confession, about which it is still doubtful whether they will follow it in all things in teaching and writing. If they do, the concord will stand on its own, and the same spirit will testify to our agreement. Meanwhile, let us love one another, lay aside hatreds, suspicions, soberly judge all things, and pray to the Lord that He may truly unite us in the spirit of concord and preserve us in pure truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>These things to you more freely, most esteemed brothers: not that we wish to prescribe anything to you, but lest we conceal from you our judgments, which you so candidly and eagerly request from us. It will be yours to consider all things favorably. May the Lord Jesus, our King and High Priest, guard you and your church. Pray for us and ours.</p>
      <p>Bern, 4th of the Nones of June, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller in his own name and in the name of all the fellow ministers, pastors, and readers in the church of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and faithful ministers of Christ, pastors of the church of ZÃ¼rich, fellow ministers, and most venerable and beloved brothers.</p>
