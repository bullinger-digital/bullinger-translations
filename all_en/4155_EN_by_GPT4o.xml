      <p>Greetings. I have read your letter, most illustrious man and revered father in Christ, and I pray to the Lord that He may bless your labors and keep you safe for us and His church for a long time. I am currently quite busy; for whatever time is free from sermons, I devote entirely to what I might call the French matter. I am gathering the opinions of all who believe this alliance should be renewed; for this cause is now being discussed, but it is beginning to be done secretly. The king's envoys are advising him not to delay this matter to the last moment; they wish, as I see it, to preempt the plans of certain individuals.</p>
      <p>But these things, as I said, are all being done in secret.</p>
      <p>When I have gathered everything that can be said for and against, I will send it to you; for the cause is very complex, and there are countless things that trouble me, but not everything can be entrusted to letters. Therefore, if it is possible and I am still alive, I will fly to you in early spring; I do not think this cause should be publicly proposed in the meantime. From Italy, it is written to us for certain that the Venetians have a very fortified castle on the borders of their territory, called Orza Nova, which the Spaniards have thought to capture by treachery and have attempted to do so with the help of certain monks residing in that castle. It is said that the monks were expelled and allowed to leave, and that some Spanish leaders, about ten, disguised themselves in monk's clothing and wanted to carry out their plan under this guise. But when the castellan suspected that something was not right, he is said to have seized the monks and sent them along with the Spaniards to Venice. If these things are true, as they are certainly affirmed to be true, they will aid our cause in Valtellina against that one from the Quadriis. These things are written hastily.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 12, 1559.</p>
      <p>After writing these, the orator sends your letters to be read, in which you write the same thing as I do.</p>
      <p>But also what is reported about the Scots, I think you know; it is said that the king has now assembled a new army and appointed the brother of the Duke of Guise to lead it. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
