    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast has read a little in Bullinger's writing ["True Confession"] against Luther's ["Short Confession"] and approves of everything. The Lutherans are in fear. The learned Leipzig theologian Alexander Alesius wrote to Gast, saying that it was heard Bullinger was planning a book against Luther, which could cause new unrest and hinder the success of the Gospel; according to the Pope's letter and the Emperor's threats, they would be in great danger. - Gast sends two books by Oecolampadius. - The book ["In primum Musculi Anticochlaeum Replica brevis"] by [Johannes] Cochläus, which is not available [in Basel], could be bought by Gast at the Frankfurt [Spring] Fair if Bullinger needs it. - Gast will admonish [Sebastian Lepusculus] not to ignite a new fire and not to disparage [Simon] Grynaeus' famous name through [Lepusculus' commentary on Aristotle]. Gast encloses a letter from Gilbert [Cousin]. - May Bullinger remain unharmed for the churches! - [P.S.:] Bullinger should give [Cousin's] letter to Theodor [Bibliander] to read, so that he writes something to [Cousin]. He is a good man devoted to the Gospel, even if he still adheres to papist ceremonies. He educates the youth well and reads everything that is published [in Basel].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, my dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have read a few pages of your response against Luther's fanatical and deceitful pamphlet, and I approve of everything greatly. You treat the cruel man kindly, whom you will never make tame or gentle, even with the most flattering words. He will have his judge. However, I know that the Lutherans are trembling. Dr. Alexander Alesius, a learned and pious theologian from Leipzig, whose commentaries on the Psalms I have at home, wrote these words to me: "We have heard here that Bullinger is preparing a writing against Luther; this may perhaps cause new unrest and hinder the success of the Gospel. And we will now be in great danger and peril, as it appears from the Pope's letters and the Emperor's threats." So he said.</p>
      <p>I am sending two books by Oecolampadius. Cochläus' book is not available with us. If you need it, I will buy it at the Frankfurt Fair.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I will admonish Lepusculus not to ignite any new fire, so that he does not make Grynaeus' famous name ignoble with these writings. Here you have what Gilbert wrote to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, may you remain safe for a long time for our churches, which are being devastated by the most cruel wolf.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 28, 1545.</p>
      <p>Give these letters to our Theodor to read, so that he finally writes something to our Gilbert. For he is a good man and very devoted to the Gospel, although he is still bound to papist ceremonies for convenience and profit; nevertheless, he teaches the youth well, and whatever is published anywhere, he buys and reads.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, etc. To Zurich.</p>
