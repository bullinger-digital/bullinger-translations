      <p>My friendly greetings and all good things beforehand. Highly and well-learned, gracious, dear lord and brother, I wish you a good and prosperous year, likewise my wife, and since I have kindly asked you to show all good and brotherly loyalty to my lord Mayor Laffiter.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, as you have often written to me by hand, that I should thank you most highly, where I can earn it for you, I am willing to do so gladly. Furthermore, concerning Mr. Hans Haller, as our dear allies from Zurich have delayed, Mr. Hans has conducted himself so honorably with us that it is truly commendable, before God and the entire community here in Bern. Therefore, it is my friendly request to you, that you speak with Mayor Laffiter and with other lords of mine from Zurich, that they may allow us this Mr. Hans Haller; for it will bring great benefit to us all; for he is pious in teaching and life and acts in loyalty. Then concerning his salary, my brother Gladin Mey will inform you how it has been arranged; for my lords will make it with him, so I have no doubt, you will be well satisfied. If only our allies from Zurich allow my lords, then, dear Master Heinrich, take action and ask Mr. Walter and other workers in the word of God, that they all may help; for it is of great necessity for many and for our sake, that one has loyal leaders. Therefore, take hold of the plow, that the man may be ours. Regarding the other matters of the dispute, the rich trade, my brother Gladin Mey will inform you, so I believe, you will be well satisfied.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear Master Heinrich, call upon good lords and friends, that the man may stay with us. Where I can serve you and Mr. Mayor and for a pious city of Zurich, I will not spare myself, where I can serve you; for I am too insignificant in my appearance; but I would like it to proceed rightly.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I let you know, that I have not left the house in 12 weeks; for I have long been dealing with the matter for my gracious lords, and still cannot change. As it pleases God, so it is right. Lastly, it is my friendly request, you may greet the mayor and other dear lords of mine from Zurich and all the preachers and Master Hans Fries; he was with me in Baden. Nothing more than may God keep you in His protection.</p>
      <p>Given on the 10th day of January in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Forgive my writing; for I am still sick and cannot write well.</p>
      <p>You may understand the matter better than it is. Your loyal servant at all times, Bitzius Haller, treasurer.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious dear lord and good friend, to his own hands.</p>
