    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the learned theologian from Leuven, Dr. Albert Hardenberg, whose letter from Strasbourg [not preserved] Bullinger recently made accessible to Vadian [see No. 1973]; he wants to see Vadian before he returns to Strasbourg via Constance, and is still undecided which call to follow; he still serves the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], to whom he returns for the Reichstag; he enjoys disputing, especially about the Eucharist, and has the correct understanding of it; Vadian should strengthen him in this. The French [King Francis I] and Emperor [Charles V] are said to have made peace; may the war come to an end! If [Christoph] Froschauer brings news [from the Frankfurt Fair], Vadian should learn of it. [Johannes] Gast writes [No. 1990], in Troyes, 80,000 gold coins worth 4 guilders each have been found; Gast has seen some of them but could not recognize the characters. Bullinger expects and wishes for Vadian's remarks on "his Cochläus." Greetings. Albert [Hardenberg] will tell him astonishing things about the activities of the Anabaptists.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. You now see and hear in person to your satisfaction Dr. Albert Hardenberg, the Frisian, a theologian from Leuven, indeed a truly pious and most learned theologian from the scriptures. For he who presents this to you is the same whose letters from Strasbourg I recently shared with you. He comes for no other reason than to see you. Then he will head to Konstanz, and from there to Strasbourg. He has received invitations from many princes and cities. He is deliberating with himself which ones to visit and to whom to dedicate his work. Currently, he lives at the expense of the Archbishop of Köln. He awaits the Reichstag to return to the bishop. He gladly seeks and debates, especially about the Eucharist. Although he holds the correct view on it, he still desires to hear the opinions of more learned men. I commend him to you and urge you to strengthen him in the pursuit of piety and in the confession of the truth. - They say peace has been made between the Emperor and the French. The terms are not yet known. May that cruel slaughter cease at last! Froschauer has not yet returned; when he does and brings anything worth knowing, you will know. Gast writes that in Troyes, 80,000 gold coins have been found, each worth 4 guilders; he has seen one or two brought to Basel, but did not recognize the characters. I expect and desire your comments on my Cochläus. Farewell with all yours. You will hear amazing things from Dr. Albert about the furies of the Anabaptists, etc. Zürich, 28th of September, in the year 1544. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord, in St. Gallen,</p>
