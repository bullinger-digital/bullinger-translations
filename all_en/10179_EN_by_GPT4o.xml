      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>At our Martinmas fair, Miconius and our Sultzer write about what is not only a rumor but also a reputation among them, namely, that in extending their empire, the people of the mountains are entirely determined not only to subjugate part of the common territory but also to take over Lake Zurich and the part of the upper Bernese valleys adjacent to Jacob, and that they are planning to do this not openly, but through secret conspiracies. Therefore, if you are unaware of this, I would like to inform you, not because I fear they will undertake such a nefarious deed unless it is the rod with which the Lord threatens from heaven, but so that the plans of some, who consider themselves fathers of the country, are more closely observed. We have done what we could with private individuals who were to be trusted, and I have no doubt that you will do the same. Otherwise, may you all be safe. Write as often as leisure permits and business demands.</p>

      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
