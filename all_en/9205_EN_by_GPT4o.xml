      <p>God with us. How it went with the barrel and kernels, I wrote to you the day before yesterday in the letter enclosed here. But now, since the cart did not come, which you had arranged for us for the day before yesterday, I am sorry that we put the kernels into the barrel; for you well know that it does not improve if it stands long in the barrel. We have placed it inside the house and are waiting for when it is convenient for you to fetch it.</p>
      <p>Herewith I send you new news, you may well show or send it to Mr. Burgower. I received the news from Cologne the day before yesterday from Mr. Belleure from Solothurn; he has written to me again, now the third letter, indicating that the news from the Netherlands comes to him from a person who has good acquaintance. He also indicates that no king has yet been elected in Poland, but they are postponing it until April, and Emperor Maximilian is strongly advocating that his son King Rudolf be accepted as his successor. He does not write a word about France. Greet Mr. Hans Conrad in Schaffhausen and other dear gentlemen and friends, etc., with you Mr. Hans and LÃ¶wen. But how is it that his late father's portrait cannot be returned to me; he has kept it for so long, and it is time that it is returned to me.</p>
      <p>Look and take it into your hands, when it is convenient, that you send it to me, yet ne quid pereat aut obliteretur (lest anything be lost or obliterated).</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna and the children. Omnes nostri vos salutant (All of ours greet you). Wednesday, 18th of February, 1573.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
