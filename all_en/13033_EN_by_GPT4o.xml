    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since the messenger [Andreas Müller] is in a hurry, Bullinger does not have much time to respond to [Myconius’] letter from July 25 [No. 2967]. Moreover, he has only just received the letter from Johannes Gast, written on July 14 [No. 2949]. However, this does not require a special response. Gast and Myconius should continue writing, as their letters are always a joy! Gast should procure for Bullinger an edition of Persius’ Satires, commented by Johannes Murmellius and printed in octavo format by Eucharius Cervicornus in Cologne, and send it through this messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] King Henry II of France has promised the Swiss Confederates his help against any enemy, as long as they remain united among themselves. They are indeed united, if one can speak of harmony given their different religions. When the Inner Cantons say that they disregard faith, they mean that they will not refuse assistance to the [Protestant] cantons in case of an attack, but will come to their aid as if they shared the same religious beliefs. It would be better, of course, if all the Confederates had the same true and proven religion, but since this cannot be achieved today, it is good to be friends and not enemies, as long as one does not rely solely on the help of the Inner Swiss or enact something against the faith. The division of faith also troubles Bullinger, who also knows how the battle jointly undertaken by the [idolater] Ahab and the [pious] Jehoshaphat against the Syrians ended. May the Lord save His own, not because they deserve it, but for the glory of His name!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Basel and Mulhouse were summoned to the Imperial Diet, as if they were subordinates of Emperor Charles V. They complained to the Confederates about this. In response, the Confederates sent a candid letter [on July 9] to the Emperor, urging him not to summon the people of Basel or other allies to his Imperial Diets in the future and to ensure that this does not happen again, especially since he has often instructed the Confederates to remain quiet and promised them to respect their freedoms and customs if they did so. Yesterday, the [Swiss] messenger [...] returned with the Emperor's response [from July 28]. The Zurich mayor [Johannes Haab] unsealed the letter and had it read before the council. It was decided to send copies of the response to the individual allies, which explains the presence of the current [Zurich] messenger [Müller]. The response states that Basel and Mulhouse were summoned by mistake, as they have been registered in the imperial register since ancient times. However, since the Helvetians do not wish to be deprived of their rights, privileges, and customs or to be treated as enemies, he will not summon them in the future, as he wishes to be regarded by them as an ally and friend. Nice words! If only there is no trickery behind them! So enjoy the peace and thank God for it, do not cease to ask Him for help, and remain vigilant against these deceitful people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In Glarus, credible people are said to have observed a nocturnal celestial phenomenon. Two squadrons of horsemen appeared, and between them two lions fighting each other, as well as a radiant Swiss cross. One lion devoured the other, and then the horsemen disappeared. But the cross remained sparkling in the sky for almost an hour. This is what Bullinger has heard. In Zurich, the phenomenon is considered credible, but he cannot vouch for it. Myconius should interpret it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Emperor arrived in Augsburg on July 23 with a great triumphal procession. On the 26th, Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony was brought into the city in a carriage and under the guard of 500 marksmen. He is being treated quite well. In contrast, the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, imprisoned in Donauwörth, is being mistreated by the Spaniards. The ailing Emperor has undergone a treatment with guaiac wood.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On August 22, the ratification of the German [Swabian] League is to take place. At the Imperial Diet, which begins on September 1, the Emperor is said to plan to deform the religion and reinstate the Imperial Chamber Court, thereby also involving the bishops and the clergy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, is already residing in his palace. The Augsburg authorities no longer dare to make a sound. The Emperor was granted the cathedral. The Bavarian Duke Wilhelm IV claims St. Ulrich, and the others all the other churches!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In Zurich, they are expecting the return of Johannes Haller from Augsburg. The soldiers are committing terrible atrocities there. Bullinger could write much about it, but he must stop.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also to Francisco de Enzinas and Johannes Oporin. Six o'clock in the morning.</p>

      <p>S. In response to your last letter dated July 25, I write these few lines, as the messenger is in a hurry, and I must also hurry. Our friend Gast wrote on July 14, but his letter reached me late. Please greet him and ask him to buy for me the Satires of Aulus Persius, annotated by Johannes Murmellius, printed by Eucharius Cervicornus, I believe, in Cologne or elsewhere in octavo format, and send it to me through this messenger. I do not wish to trouble you with these small matters. There is nothing else to respond to him. However, you should encourage him to continue writing, as I delight in your letters.</p>

      <p>King Henry II of France has encouraged the Swiss to maintain harmony and has promised all his support against any enemies, as long as they remain united. They are indeed quite united, as much as harmony can exist among those who have different religions. When the Inner Cantons say, "We want to set faith aside," they mean that they do not wish to abandon us because of our religion but will offer mutual assistance, as if we shared the papist religion. This is how they explain their statement. They wish to fight in their religion alongside us, so that we may fight in our religion with them against enemies. Certainly, there would be more hope for a good man if we all shared one true and solid religion, but since this cannot be achieved today, it is better to be friends than enemies, provided we do not rely on their help and do not plan anything against our religion. The discord in faith also troubles me, and I know how Ahab and Jehoshaphat fought against the Syrians. May the Lord protect us, not for our sake, but for the glory of His name.</p>

      <p>The situation with Basel and Mulhouse is as follows: They were summoned to the Imperial Diet as if they were to accept imperial ordinances. They questioned the Swiss about this. The Swiss wrote a sufficiently free letter to the Emperor and requested that he not summon either the people of Basel or other allies to his Diets in the future, as he had previously instructed them to remain quiet, promising to respect their freedoms and customs if they did so. Yesterday, the messenger returned from the Emperor with a written and sealed response. Our consul unsealed it and had it read to the senate. It was decided to send a copy of the response to each of the confederated cities and cantons. That is why the messenger is here now. The essence of the response is: It was an error that the cities of Basel and Mulhouse were summoned. They have been included in the imperial register since ancient times. However, since it is our will not to deprive the Swiss of their rights, privileges, and customs, or to exercise any hostility against them, they will not be summoned in the future. "Nor do I want you to believe anything else about me and mine than that we are allies and friends," etc. Good and pleasant words! Let us hope there is no snake hidden in the grass! But let us enjoy peace for now, thank God, continue to pray, and remain vigilant, trusting nothing to these slippery people!</p>

      <p>In Glarus, it is said that a vision was seen by people of not weak faith! Two squadrons of horsemen appeared at night. In the middle, two lions leaped forth, and in the midst of them appeared a bright and illustrious Swiss cross. One lion devoured the other; then it appeared nowhere. Thus, the squadrons of horsemen also disappeared into the clouds. However, the cross shone triumphantly there for nearly an hour. I write this to you, my friend, as I have received it. It is said to be certain among us; how certain it is, I do not know. You should interpret it.</p>

      <p>The Emperor entered Augsburg with great triumph on July 23. On the 26th, the Elector was brought in a carriage, guarded by 500 marksmen. He is treated quite magnificently and kindly. The Landgrave of Hesse is held captive in Werda and is miserably treated by the Spaniards. The Emperor has immersed himself in guaiac wood and is ill.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On August 22, the German League will be concluded. On September 1, the Imperial Diet will begin. It is believed that he will deform the religion. Certainly, he will restore the Imperial Chamber Court and reinstate the bishops and clergy in full.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg is already in his palace. The people of Augsburg do not dare to mutter. They have granted the Emperor the cathedral "Unser Frowen Münster." The Bavarian Duke claims the church of St. Ulrich; the others claim other churches.</p>

      <p>We are expecting Haller in Zurich. Horrible things are being done by the soldiers in Augsburg. I could write much (much), if I had much time. I am forced to stop.</p>
