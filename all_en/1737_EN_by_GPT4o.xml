      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote about the death of Kaleb Bsch√∂rli. Meanwhile, my entire family is doing well, praise be to the Lord! On October 2nd, our brother and fellow minister, Mr. Jodocus, passed away, entrusting his soul to the Lord with great confidence. Now we must think about another. Here, I fear great disturbances; for there will be those who will try to impose our deacon upon us. If this happens, the die of contention and dissipation of this church will be cast; for he is a man of remarkable arrogance, uneducated, raised at home (except for a short time in Strasbourg), with an unbridled and insolent tongue, most hated by Musculus, and of very suspect doctrine. However, we will resist as much as we can; we will declare all the dangers to the senate, although this will not happen without greatly offending many. Nevertheless, this is what the situation and necessity demand. We will all give our votes to Musculus. You, along with all those who are with you, will diligently pray to the Lord to help this church and preserve it in the peace and tranquility it has begun. If you also have any help and advice, please suggest it in time. Farewell. All of mine, as well as Musculus and his, send their greetings to you and yours. Please tell my brother that I am doing well with mine, so that he may inform my mother, whom I know to be very worried. Bern, October 5, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
