    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter, expresses his willingness to serve all Zurichers, and praises Melchior Wirz, recommended by Bullinger, who now lives with him; has decided to return [to Zug] in the summer, although some of his friends advise against it. The learned and helpful Martin [Betschart], who has fallen out of favor with his authorities [in Schwyz] because of his faith, has also decided to return to Switzerland, but will first wait for the repayment of credits; he sends his regards to Bullinger. King [Francis I] is said to have promised that no more persecutions on account of faith will take place. Greetings. Asks for prayers for [Zug] and its pastor [Rudolf Weingartner].</p>

      <p>Salvation from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters, dearest Bullinger, were very delightful to me, in which you commend Melchior Wirz to me, a young man exactly as you described, so much so that he recommends himself to all people with his talents. I regret that there is not more in me through which he might understand how much I value you, his homeland, and the faith with which he is endowed. You all have deserved so much from us and our homeland, and I understand that you continue to deserve it daily, that I would be impious if I did not pursue you and all yours with the greatest zeal. However, Melchior is more learned than to greatly desire my assistance. But if there is anything in which I could help him, I prefer that he experiences it in reality, rather than that I promise it with many words. He lives with me, as he requested, where he will feel my spirit, what it is like towards him, certainly during the time I will be in Paris. For this summer I have proposed to revisit my homeland, how wisely or with what happy outcome, I do not know. There are friends here who advise, there are some there who dissuade, others who greatly wish it. When I weigh the reasons, more and stronger ones seem to me to be why I should leave here. But what I have proposed, the Lord will arrange and either hinder or promote according to His will.</p>
      <p>Master Martin Betschart, once my teacher, is a good and learned man and has deserved much and greatly by helping many, almost ungrateful to no one except his lords for the cause of faith. He also decided a year ago to return to Switzerland; what prevents him from doing so this year is the money still owed to him by some Frenchmen that he needs to collect. He holds your Melchior in the highest esteem and sends his most dutiful regards to you.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new here at present. The King [Francis I] has been lingering near Paris for a long time. It is said that he has promised not to allow any more persecution (Verfolgung) in his land on account of faith.</p>
      <p>Greet in our name Mr. Konrad Pellikan, my teacher, Mr. Leo Jud, Bibliander, and the other friends and brothers. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Paris, in the year 1539, on the fourth day before the Ides of March. I commend to you and your prayers my homeland and its bishop, if he continues to do what is good and proper.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Kolin.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, especially esteemed by me. In Zurich.</p>
