      <p>May the Lord bless you and make this year prosperous and most fortunate for you, I say, and your household. Because I have not received any letters from you today, I am concerned, as in your last letters you mentioned that you were ill.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deign to restore you to your church and to us! We are doing well here by the grace of God; may the Lord continue to bless us! The king's envoy Orbais writes to us from Solothurn on December 26: "My king has called a great assembly, to which all the princes with all the nobility will gather in Blois.</p>
      <p>What will happen, I do not know; I have certainly been invited there as well, I will begin my journey tomorrow and will hurry. The war in England and Scotland, stirred by the intervention of my king, has been well quelled.</p>
      <p>Scotland retains the gospel.</p>
      <p>It is confirmed for certain that the Roman pontiff is dead." So he says.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb writes to me from Rapperswil on December 23 that ten cities, among which Haguenau holds the primacy, are consulting about reformation, etc., and that Haguenau, having already expelled the priests, has replaced them with preachers.</p>
      <p>The citizens of Obernai are said to have followed Haguenau; the same is expected shortly from SÃ©lestat and Colmar. Meanwhile, the Ubiquitarians are raging in Richenweier; Farzbach (as they call him) is shouting loudly in Strasbourg, but is also strongly despised by the wise citizens. The magistrate is concerned and acts cautiously to prevent a riot from arising.</p>
      <p>The Palatinate is progressing very steadfastly.</p>
      <p>The imperial assembly is expected on January 15 in Augsburg, etc.</p>
      <p>So he says.</p>
      <p>I wanted to share these things with you according to our custom and wish you all happiness.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever with all our friends. Zurich, December 28, 1566. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and beloved brother. Chur.</p>
