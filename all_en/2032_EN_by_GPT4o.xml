      <p>S. D. I received your letters, the first through our Fridolin, who has now been called by his own to Zofingen, having accepted a teaching position, the second through the son of our Dasypodius, whom I received together with the count at a meal and was greatly delighted by the humanity of this excellent young man, and the third through Froschauer. You ask that I respond to yours, so here you have it: the lectures in dialectics, rhetoric, and theology are pleasing; in the meantime, see that you do not neglect grammar, especially Greek.</p>
      <p>Listen diligently to the speech of Xenophon, and likewise to the other lectures. Stay with the excellent man Burcher; I do not want you to seek another scholar with whom to stay and live; but see that you are not a burden to him, and see that you conduct yourself well. If he ever leaves because of business, you should nonetheless be diligent, so that you do not neglect any lecture. Get up early in the morning, make yourself diligent by God's grace to be diligent and do right. Do not let him be forced to treat you like cattle. Be respectful and grateful to him and his wife; I have commended you to him as a father; see that you obey him. Now, having read the letters, you will say to him and his wife: "Sir and madam, since I have understood from my father that I should stay with you, which pleases me, I ask that you do the best for me; so I will gladly be obedient to you, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending a dagger; you have a cap, there is no need to make unnecessary expenses; if you do not have a slipper, you may buy one. How would I come to it, if I had to have everything made for you that is customary in every place. Follow the custom and use the clothing, you do not stay longer in one place, and do not think now that you should do what is customary in every place. A hat is a hat; if it is not good for you, then put the hat on it. I will see if I can prepare an elegant New Testament for you and send a dictionary; in the meantime, inquire about the price, how much dictionaries are sold for with you, and write. You may buy the speeches of Cicero; but see that you use the books neatly and that you bring this volume home with you sometime and make it familiar to you.</p>
      <p>Make sure that you wear and keep your clothes clean, be a human and not a pig; for I want to see from your expenses or usage whether you are clean and tidy or not.</p>
      <p>I have written to your master that he should give you nothing else than what the great necessity requires.</p>
      <p>Your mother sends you her warm greetings and tells you to be diligent and use your time well. Do not let your shoes fall apart, have them repaired in time.</p>
      <p>Send me a register, so that I can see what you have spent and why you have given out something, from the time you left Zurich until the date of the letter you will write in the future. By Christmas or earlier, I will write to you again. Let me know all the time how you are doing and how the studies are progressing.</p>
      <p>See that you are diligent; in this way, you will commend yourself to me. The father of Johannes Thom[ani] Wirtzii passed away yesterday at 8 o'clock in the evening; I stood by him as he died and closed his eyes. He passed away happily to the Lord, exhausted by illness. Our relative Heinrich Widerker has also died. My brother is gravely suffering from his leg. The Swiss soldier has returned safe and sound from Belgium. Live and farewell, mindful of the instructions given to you at your last departure; read them frequently and consider them diligently. The whole house wishes you well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 9, 1553.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May Fabritius, Stubius, and Farnerus be safe.</p>
      <p>Josias, Hans Rudolf, and Stoffel are in Ottenbach, where they arrived on Saturday. The little bride sends you greetings.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger the Younger in Strasbourg, in the house of Mr. Burcher, his beloved son.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
