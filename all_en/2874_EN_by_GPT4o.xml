      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our common Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>You are exceedingly kind, most learned lord and brother, to treat me with such benevolence, a man who, although very devoted to you, responds very little to your immense benefits. Great are the things you have shown me privately, yet greater than can be recounted, with all of which you serve the faithful in Christ's common salvation. I have received your books, most adorned with learning and Christian instruction, where I praise those studies that, by their wickedness, continually provoke and solicit the grace with which you have been endowed by God; above all, your most pious facility is to be extolled, by which you gratify the requests of good men for the public edification of the church. Since I can do nothing else in this matter, I give thanks for your inexhaustible labors, indeed, since it cannot be done by all, you will receive a reward from the Lord according to your worthiness. Meanwhile, I pray to God without ceasing, that He may preserve you safe with us for a long time. Furthermore, you desire, out of your humanity, our friendship to be renewed, than which nothing can be more ancient or more pleasant to me, although for some time now the mutual exchange of letters has been interrupted, yet you are with me day and night, and it rises more and more with new growths. You know that saying: The more it is covered, the more the fire burns. Therefore, as you do, I ask you to continue to love me. In this turmoil of affairs, what greater solace is there than to be loved mutually and to supplicate God with joined prayers, that He may have mercy on us and not rebuke us in His wrath and may have the fate of the church most commendable to Himself. In this haste, I have neither more nor better things with which to declare the gratitude of my mind with some signification, than to ask you to accept this small gift from the land of St. Gallen, as he says, from a coarse son. You are not unaware of the wealth of our land. I earnestly ask you to do this; if it seems worthy to you or your dearest little wife, let it serve as you please. Farewell. In St. Gallen. Please convey my greetings in my name to the fellow ministers, the best men and pillars of the Church of Christ, especially to Mr. Gualther and my dear Frisius. March 28, 1556.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, most sincerely devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the servant of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Lord, the ecclesiast of the ZÃ¼richers, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
