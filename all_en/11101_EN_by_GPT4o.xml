    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the news from Bern and requests information about the conclusion [of the discussions there with the people of Strasbourg]; the dangerous conflict should be resolved quickly. While Gervasius [Schuler] had to postpone his visit, Ambrosius [Blarer] has come to [Konstanz] and reported on the removal of images ordered by Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg] and on a harsh writing by the English King [Henry VIII] against the council; moreover, he regrets the poor treatment of some Württemberg pastors but can do nothing about it. Since Bucer and Capito have not negotiated with the people of Zurich, they should declare their agreement as soon as possible, so as not to appear as the last opponents of the Concord.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I am grateful that you have at least written something about the people of Bern recently, and I earnestly ask that if you know what conclusion the matter has reached, do not keep it from me. However, it seems to me that the Bernese should be occupied with other things than these trifles. For since many dangers await them, if one considers the minds and efforts of the opposing parties, they certainly need to be encouraged to have courage and trust in the Lord. But there appears to be no comfort among us, except that we fight each other and each one urges the other, almost with fists, to his own.</p>
      <p>Gervasius was prevented by the church and did not come; however, he has not changed his plan. But our most welcome guest, Ambrosius, has come to us, not with the intention of staying, but to see us. He sends his greetings to you and all the brothers, especially Leo, Theodor, and Pellican. The prince's decree against idols and images is now to be executed, although against the wishes of some. Furthermore, he says he has read nothing harsher than a certain public writing by the King of England against the council's institution. But he does not have it with him; otherwise, I would have sent it to you. Perhaps it was brought from the fair by Froschofer. I have nothing else from him that would be worth reporting to you. He is saddened that some brothers are miserably neglected in the Duke's domain; since not everything can be obtained in order through him, the Lord must certainly be invoked, lest this ingratitude harm the cause at some point.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that Bucer and Capito have not done the same with you as they did in Bern. Make an effort that, if the Bernese have not given anything unfair, you also do not hesitate to give, and that for the sake of unity. And if only you would write to the people of Strasbourg that you have read and considered the action with the Bernese and that you are fully of the same mind with them. This would remove any occasion for discord with you from the people of Strasbourg, and concord would be strengthened among you. For a long time, the people of Basel have had it, and now perhaps also the Bernese; you will now seem to be the only opponents of concord, and the Bernese have undoubtedly given nothing that could not be given through the Lord. I wish you to be completely counted among them.</p>
      <p>But farewell with your wife and all your children, indeed the whole church.</p>
      <p>October 16, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the church in Zurich, his most desired brother. Zurich.</p>
