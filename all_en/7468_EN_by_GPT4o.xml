      <p>Greetings. We have no new news from Italy; however, we are expecting daily updates from Chiavenna. The brothers in Valtellina are inactive, but they will report everything at the fair. We cannot marvel enough at the slipperiness of the serpent or rather the dragon and the Babylonian harlot, who tries to extricate herself and mock all our strongest efforts. If what is written about the deceitful and feigned peace is true, who does not see that the affairs of France will never be safe unless these troublemakers are completely uprooted with all mercy set aside? Who will mourn the grief and destruction of such a powerful kingdom when there is neither peace nor justice among those who should hold the helm? May God Almighty restrain them and bind them in order so that they can never escape, even if they wish to do so greatly. Baron von Hohenlohe writes to us: He has kept his troops in arms, which he will lead against Alba; Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxony, has reconciled with the Palatinate, rejecting the Spaniard; the German cavalry is also ready with 4000 fresh horses, all of which are to be led against Alba. There is also a rumor that Alba has been defeated by the princes of Orange and others previously expelled. What is true, time will tell. - I gladly accept your fatherly advice regarding the increase of the stipend and thank you eternally for it. I would never have dared to think of this, although I suffer from a lack of all things. I know I will face rejection, as everyone thinks I am almost gilded. But I am pained by the levity and avarice of my colleague, who, unbeknownst to me, took the opportunity to consult his fortunes from me.</p>
      <p>We get along well; but he concealed this matter from me while he completed it, fearing, of course, that I might be an obstacle to him, which I could not have been nor would I have wanted to be, even if I could have. Why should I be troubled if the stipends, which are mostly diminished in Rhaetia, were to flourish again? However, by making an unfair comparison of both, he extorted this. The method of extortion and the manner displeases me. For, following the custom of predecessors, he has had estates, namely fields, vineyards, orchards, and even a sum of money, from which he experienced the fortune of the year while living. The predecessors did not want to change this kind of arrangement. But since he is abundant with his own land and occupies estates of all kinds worth 2000 gold coins, he, tired of other goods, handed over the priestly estates to the magistrate, so that by subtracting these, he would receive a certain sum of money for the estates in each quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>The magistrate, when renting out those goods to others for money, could not reach the sum they give me, and it is no wonder, as the estates usually yield or do not yield according to the quality of the years. Seeing this, he immediately began to complain and exaggerate my stipend to me, as if unequal rewards were being given to those running in the same race. What should he do? He did not ask (which he could have) the magistrate to add the rest, but threateningly handed over and resigned the duty of preaching, claiming that he does not feel suitable for it; therefore, he prepared his own house (which is beautifully visible in the middle of the estates), intending to inhabit it.</p>
      <p>I am amazed at this levity. Where is the calling, where is the conscience? Under this pretext, he sought nothing else but an increase in the stipend. With this promise (200 gulden), he quickly became suitable. If this is not acting as a mercenary, then what is it?</p>
      <p>God is my witness that I do not envy him for this, nor do we get along badly. I pretend as if I am unaware of everything. But it is not considered that he is a Croesus, while I am an Iro; add to this that he has joined three filial parishes to his regular one, which he always visits alternately from the urban congregation (they are near the city), from which he receives at least 100 crowns.</p>
      <p>The magistrate does not consider this, nor (I know) will he be more generous towards me; he thinks I have received too much and does not favor the Zurichers (for the council consists mostly of young men) much anymore; thus, the cause of the bishop was commended to yours.</p>
      <p>Your citizens Vogler and Wissenbach feel this, who are miserably harassed against all right, and they embrace, protect, and support Carlin, who has been declared a scoundrel by sworn testimony, so much that, forgetting themselves, they shamelessly overstep the bounds of justice. What should be done, I do not know. On one hand, their filthiness deters me, on the other, poverty incites me, especially when I am overwhelmed with such a numerous offspring. I have 4 sons and a 5th is at the door; of these 4, two cannot stand or walk; the third barely imitates. I will try something with those more known and familiar to me, such as the consul, Pontisella, the chief tribune, my neighbor, etc.</p>
      <p>I already know what they will answer. - Our Flavius has returned from Rome, where he was for a long time, and he tells of the miserable slaughter that the devil exercises everywhere on matrons and nobles; he spares neither sex nor youth. He says the pope's son was found and approached his father with certain signs, by which he was recognized even unwillingly. The pope did not want to have a son; but he was forced to acknowledge him, so that everyone knows of his fornication. Holiness, holiness! I have written all this very quickly. I beg you, my most esteemed lord, to interpret all this favorably with your innate benevolence and kindness towards me and everyone. I have not reread it, nor was there time between sermons and the rushing markets.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally with all yours and my Erni. May the Lord Jesus keep you perpetually safe.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 25, 1568.</p>
      <p>All those greeted send you their most dutiful regards.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli. To the most esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned pastor of the church in Zurich, his most revered father in perpetual faith. Zurich.</p>
