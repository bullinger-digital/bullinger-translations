    <p xml:id="regest1">The purpose of the enclosed explanation by the Zurichers on the question of the Lord's Supper is evident from Bucer's also enclosed letter. Since the Zurichers do not favor the secret consultations as proposed by Bucer, they have preferred to express themselves in writing. The Basel brethren in faith are requested to examine the document and, if they agree, to sign it individually so that it can be sent to Bucer. The Bernese were also asked to do the same.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The purpose for which the brothers are sending you our exposition on the Sacrament of the Eucharist will be explained by the letter from Bucer attached here. We were displeased with that nocturnal meeting. We preferred to settle this matter in writing. Here you have the writings. If there is anything in them that seems to tend to the detriment of the truth, indicate it freely, and we will be most grateful to you. For this is the main reason we are sending these, and also because we have decided to do nothing in the matter of religion without you, our dearest brothers. For you are our members and our innermost parts. Therefore, if we have judged correctly about the Eucharist, add a white stone. Add a letter in which you attest that you agree with us, with the names of each one subscribed. We desire, however, that this be done immediately, and indeed through this messenger. Through whom, I beseech you, also return this exposition along with Bucer's letter. For we will send this copy of the exposition to Augsburg along with what you will have returned, unless you only wish to subscribe, to Bucer. What we write to you, we also write to our Bernese brethren.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 23rd of November, 1534.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger in the name of all the ministers of the word of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius and the other ministers of the Church of Basel. Dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
