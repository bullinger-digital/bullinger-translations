      <p>S. D. Indeed, I have not written to your kindness for 14 days, as I was otherwise exhausted from writing, and since I had nothing worthy to write, I spared myself. And if I should omit the duty of writing in the future, I ask you to take it in good part; when I have something worthy of you or can do so through my affairs and health, I will not neglect it. In the meantime, I wish you to continue nonetheless. I received the letters you sent to me, which were serious; they were made heavier by the thaler enclosed, sent to Mr. Froschauer for books; for I have a friend in Bohemia, in Krumau, Mr. Paul Bramburg, a most distinguished man, who requested some books from Froschauer, which he now pays for and requests others in addition. He writes to me in leafed letters about nothing other than religion; he gave them in Bohemia on February 1st. Not without some effort, I will respond to them; thus, from various places, labor and trouble arise for me.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I was greatly disturbed by the treacherous and deceitful action of certain Rhetoricians, nor do I see how the pious can ignore this; for unless such impious arts and actions are opposed, it will happen that even they themselves will not be able to guard against plots. Therefore, you will privately advise good men not to neglect their duty. The Rhaetian is bold if he succeeds in this matter and will attempt greater things. In the meantime, the Lord must be earnestly prayed to, that He may confound the counsels of Achitophel. As for the bookseller, you will insist constantly and be entirely in this, that he turns the soil. He is most worthy of exile, who has so often violated faith and deceived the most honorable senate. Unless action is seriously taken against him by the magistrate, that man will plant sects and disturbances in your republic.</p>
      <p>The pot always finds its lid. Therefore, in the most dangerous time, the disease must be remedied; medicine is prepared too late.</p>
      <p>For the Italian news, I give great thanks; Mr. Müllner will interpret it for me. You will greet the consuls, Mr. Pontasel, Mr. Ganthner, and the others. I have written to Mr. Charles, as you wished; you will deliver the letters to him; for in all things I wish to serve and be approved by both you and him.</p>
      <p>What news has been brought to us from various places, yet brought consistently, I recount to you as it was brought; you believe what and as much as you wish. The king is said to have no army at all, after he allowed his men to be dismissed and dispersed. His nobility is not very willing; thus, he has lost his best leaders and many of the nobility and gained nothing. The Swiss are still in Burgundy, beginning to die; they are waiting to see if perhaps they are needed in Lyon. The admiral is said to have stretched those from Toulouse for a great good and is now supposed to march with both young princes, Navarre and Condé, into the Dauphiné, having taken Montpellier on the way. His men under Lord Monbrun are said to have fallen upon the enemy, where the governor of the Dauphiné was with a strong force, intending to harm the admiral. But the admiral's forces have struck and driven them into flight before the city of Loriol under Valence and have taken the city. The governor, Lord de Gordes, is said to be badly wounded, his lieutenant killed along with 26 of the best nobility and about 600 who remained on the battlefield. The admiral is also said to have taken Nîmes, city and castle, and the bridges along with the city of Saint-Esprit. It is not known whether he will move on Avignon or Lyon; he is said to be strong in both cavalry and infantry. So much for this news. We are now waiting for the merchants from St. Gallen from Lyon; they may bring more certain news. It is commonly said that they have little more, neither provisions nor money; if no peace is made, hunger may eventually drive them apart. God grant grace. Elsewhere, we have nothing at this time. The Lord be with you and your family. May all brothers and friends be safe. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 5, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
