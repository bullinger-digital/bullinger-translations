      <p>S. P. I received your letters full of kindness, most vigilant pastor, in which, among other things, you complain that not all the letters I sent to you have been delivered. If men had not failed us, you would have understood my eagerness to inform you about the state of the English church. Although I do not doubt that everything that happens here is transcribed by other men of great authority and faith, it is still a pleasure for me to express my gratitude towards you and your church in some way, which I can do in no other way than by faithfully revealing the condition of our church to you, who are undoubtedly very concerned about its safety. It is, thanks be to God, in a better place than it ever was; may God grant that it remains so forever.</p>
      <p>Through the diligence of our superintendent, Mr. a Lasco, we have obtained a church for foreigners (which is divided into French and German) free from all superstition. The church, which the king and his council assigned to foreigners, is being cleansed and repaired. However, since the repair of the church was being delayed daily for a long time, by the singular benefit of God, a certain church was granted to us Germans by the grace of some citizens of London, in which we are allowed to preach until the other church is completed. I, appointed as preacher by the wishes of the brothers, reluctantly took on this very difficult task. But one must not rashly resist a divine calling. We began to preach in this our church on September 21; and now the congregation of Germans gathers so frequently that the church cannot contain them.</p>
      <p>Seeing this happy success of our church, it was deliberated among our people to establish order. Therefore, on the 5th day of this month, we ordained four elders according to apostolic ordination, who assist the minister; not indeed in the ministry of the word, but for the preservation of doctrine and morals in the church. Among them is the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Utenhovius. They were inaugurated with public prayers and the laying on of hands. On the 12th of this month, we also created four deacons, who take care of the poor and the exiles of Christ.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was exactly the same as that used by the apostles for their deacons.</p>
      <p>The number of believers increases daily, praise be to God. If it is allowed by God's grace to continue for a few years, we will attack and conquer our Belgium with fiery darts, I hope, so that with the antichrist driven out or at least broken, our savior will reign there. Regarding the business of Mr. Hoper, there is no need for me to write extensively, as you can have more certain information from his letters, which he says he will send shortly. I will only add this, that the other bishops are causing him great trouble. Mr. Hoper is indeed elected and appointed bishop of Gloucester, but not (as they say) consecrated.</p>
      <p>For the bishops do not want to deviate even a nail's breadth from their prescribed form of consecration. But it is plainly superstitious: and as they are entirely focused on subjecting Hoper to their ceremonies, so he entirely opposes them and refers everything to apostolic ceremonies. Hence arose a very serious dispute about the use of vestments in the church.</p>
      <p>The bishops defend peculiar vestments in the church for two reasons; first, because they are indifferent matters (ἀδιάφορα); secondly, because the royal majesty has prescribed them, who has the authority to abolish or prescribe indifferent matters in the church.</p>
      <p>Here Hoper again denies that they are indifferent matters, as they obscure the dignity of the priesthood of Christ, nourish hypocrisy, superstition, etc. Hoper wrote very extensive letters on this matter to the Earl of Warwick; but he responds that in indifferent matters one must obey the king, avoiding the offense of the weak by the example of Paul vowing, shaving, and circumcising Timothy. Hoper replied to him; but what he has achieved, I do not yet see: indeed, on the third day of this month, he sent other letters to the whole council on the same matter; to which there has not yet been a response. We hang between hope and fear; indeed, the princes seem to incline to the side of the bishops: may God grant that I am a false prophet here.</p>
      <p>The bishops fight for their glory, which they prefer to Christ. Mr. a Lasco, a man of such integrity, humanity, piety, and learning, that it can hardly be said or written, sent his judgment about your concord with the Genevans a few months ago. Mr. Bucer was present last month. They agreed on everything, except the argument of the bodily presence in the supper. Bucer wrote down the main points of his opinion on the Lord's Supper. He left them with Mr. a Lasco to be examined, on which the good and learned man writes annotations, and strongly refutes Bucer's opinion.</p>
      <p>When he has finished, he will send Bucer his main points with the annotations. I pray to God that he may deign to open his mind. We are very sorry that that rascal Valentinus has deceived us so. He left without saying goodbye to us, and we do not know where he went.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bring him back to the right path!</p>
      <p>Musculus' "Prokairon" exists in French, to which the judgments of many good men on the same subject have been added; such as Oecolampadius, Zwingli, the church of Zurich, Mr. a Lasco, Calvin, etc.; all elaborated here. If Mr. Froschouer sent me your chronicles, I will faithfully ensure that he is given the price, wherever he wishes.</p>
      <p>I would wish that with the same kindness he would send me one or two copies of all your sermons at the next fair, if it cannot be done sooner.</p>
      <p>So far I have lived with Mr. Hoper; now my calling has separated me from him. The most distinguished man, Mr. Utenhovius, will live with me; for being elected as an elder of the church, he will not be able to go to Gloucester with Mr. Hoper. However, we will support Mr. Hoper with writings, as much as we can. I am very grateful for your good wishes for my family and marriage. In return, I pray the same for your daughters married in the Lord. Farewell, most distinguished man, and deign to count me, though I have deserved nothing of the sort, among your friends and your church, which is Christ's. Please convey my greetings to my esteemed teachers, Mr. Bibliander, Pellican, Gesner, and Mr. Sebastian. I wrote hastily due to the magnitude of the business with which I am now daily overwhelmed. October 13, 1550. London.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and respectful Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>I did not seal these letters written eight days ago, because I was unaware of Mr. Burcher's departure, and I easily thought that in the meantime things would happen that would be worthy to be written to you. And indeed it happened so. For we discovered that the entire royal council is inclined to the side of the bishops against Mr. Hoper in this controversy about vestments. Moreover, the privilege of our German church is in great danger. By soliciting and persuading, the bishops have achieved with the royal council that we are not allowed the free use of the sacraments, but are bound to the English ceremonies, which are intolerable to all who are zealous for piety. This matter causes great pain to our Mr. Johannes a Lasco and all the pious. I wanted to inform you of this, so that you may deign to commend the business of our church to God.</p>
      <p>While I write this, Mr. Hoper calls me, returning from the court. Here he explains to me that yesterday the bishop of London acted very gravely against him before the royal magistrate, refuted his doctrine, and burdened him with very serious injuries. A copy of the letters is denied to him; for the bishop requested this from the magistrate. But Hoper remains steadfast, opposing all papal remnants. Farewell. October 20.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes a Lasco and Mr. Johannes Utenhovius commend themselves entirely to your church.</p>
      <p>The same as above.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the church of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
