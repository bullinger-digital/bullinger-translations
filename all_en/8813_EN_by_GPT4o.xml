      <p>I have well received your princely grace's gracious letter dated Kassel, June 13th, though only from the past autumn from Frankfurt, and from it understood your princely grace's Christian spirit, that your princely grace in these dangerous times desires nothing more than that the troublesome disputes of this time among theologians be resolved and that the holy gospel be preached with peace and fruitfulness by all parties. This is also my highest desire before God, whom I do not cease to ask to graciously grant His holy peace to His church and to remove the harmful discord. And while the discord is being stirred up more intensely and incessantly day by day by the opposition, which nevertheless allows intolerable writings to be published daily against true servants and, unfortunately, instigates new disputes daily, I have, for the pacification and good of these dangerous matters, let this admonition, which I hereby send to your princely grace, be published through the press to all servants of the church and ask that your princely grace graciously accept it from me, your princely grace's willing servant, and read it at your convenience. Thus, I hope your princely grace will clearly see that, as far as it depends on us, we would gladly keep peace from the heart, if it could be achieved through the opposition's unrestrained demands. There are two booklets, one for your princely grace, the other for my gracious prince and lord, the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, to whom I do not need to write again, but humbly ask your princely grace, if you consider it good and fruitful, to send the other booklet to his princely grace or keep it for your princely grace's pleasure.</p>
      <p>Whatever I could serve your princely grace at any time, I am wholeheartedly willing. I hereby commend myself to your princely grace; may Almighty God keep the entire principality of Hesse in His divine protection and care.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, March 12th, 1572. Your princely grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse.</p>
