      <p>That you have not allowed yourself to be diverted by numerous occupations nor by your now declining age from writing to me your most kind letters, I give you immortal thanks, most reverend man and most esteemed father. For nothing could have been more pleasing, nothing more delightful to me at this time than your letter. I also received the elegant and very necessary writing attached to your letters, the reading of which not only filled me with wonderful pleasure, but I also hope it will be of benefit to our churches, as everything else that comes from you to me. I wrote extensively to Mr. Simler about the state of the Kingdom of Poland and about all the matters that are happening here, which letters I want to be shared with you, to these I have added certain writings that the French envoy, working for Andio to make him our king, spread throughout Poland. The Austrian has few supporters in this kingdom, which makes us think that he will not be elected king of Poland. There are very few who support his cause, and they are indeed papists stirred up by Cardinal Hosius. The Miscovii are influential. Stanislaus recently returned from Lower Germany, Andreas from Hungary. It is uncertain which religion Johannes Miscovius follows, as he seeks to please the Bishop of PÅ‚ock, his uncle. Justus [Szadkowski?] after long travels has finally returned, prompted by your letters to his craft. Laurentius is performing the duties of ministry in the place where he began. Here, by God's grace, we are all well.</p>
      <p>I pray that you carefully consider what I write to Mr. Simler and write back to us about all these matters most accurately and swiftly. Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau on the calends of February 1573.</p>
