      <p>Although at this time I have no subject worthy of writing, most honorable Bullinger, I did not want this bearer to come to you without my letter, a man most devoted to religion and piety, who, having left his homeland, is now an exile in Germany, so that he would not be forced to bend his knees to Baal.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt, the envoys and actors of all the states of the empire are currently holding a convention, from which it is said that the assembly of the electors, princes, and the other states of Germany will be held in Augsburg. Currently, in Frankfurt, a deliberation is said to have been instituted about depositing a just sum of money to preserve peace in the empire and to subdue those who have usurped arms against the decrees of public peace by their own authority, a truly honorable guise of protection and defense; but once the money has been collected and deposited, a thousand pretexts will easily be devised to obtain that money, as if it were of great interest to the empire to strive and insist that the French deceiver and invader of the Holy Empire should not continue to tear away and violently subdue imperial cities and territories according to his own desire and ambition.</p>
      <p>We also hear that it is being arranged there that certain centuries of cavalry should always be stationed throughout Germany as present avengers of all those who dare to disturb the public peace. However, who will compel those very stationed cavalry to behave in order, so that they do not harass anyone, offend anyone, or plunder anyone, I do not yet see. Not far from our city, four hundred cavalry have been stationed under the pretext of averting and restraining the margrave (who, however, is unknown where he is hiding). But these very men conduct themselves so intemperately and imperiously that they differ little in manners from the very enemies, often also making excursions into Lorraine and consuming the inhabitants of its duchy, afflicted by various injuries, and stripping them of all provisions and fodder.</p>
      <p>It is to be feared that we may incite the French to return these services in kind, which I fear many expect to happen, so that even through this occasion the empire may be entangled in war. We also hear that the occupation of the city of Metz is being vehemently accused and disapproved in the convention. What that convention will eventually produce, we will soon hear. The bearer of this letter will faithfully recount to your lordship the disturbances of English affairs. If in the meantime I can gratify your lordship in any way, command and order. Commend me to the best and most honorable men of your family. Farewell well in Strasbourg, the last day of October 1554.</p>
      <p>He whom you know loves you in return.</p>
