      <p>I return, not without the greatest thanks, what I received four days ago during dinner from Elias, my most esteemed and dearest brother, which I would have sent back yesterday if a messenger had been convenient. I hope, however, that you have suffered no loss from such a small delay.</p>
      <p>Ah, how wonderful, yet at the same time most just, are the judgments of the Lord. Truly, truly cursed is he who trusts in man, etc.</p>
      <p>Let us earnestly beseech the Lord for this, that He may either quickly bring back this thrice-wretched man and his accomplices, who will never again stray, or confound and destroy their Ahithophel-like counsels along with their advisors, so that they may not cause any more serious harm to the children of God. Would that all these things might spur us and ours to Christian vigilance and serious repentance, for the gravest dangers are certainly imminent, closer than we, in our false security, imagine, unless we turn to the Lord without delay. I receive absolutely no news from anyone.</p>
      <p>Soon they will break out with hoofs and sharpen the basilisks that have been brooded this winter, unless it seems good to the Lord that all these things should bring forth only wind. Let it be so, let it be so.</p>
      <p>Everything you have sent, I have copied twice with my own hand, and I have given one copy to my brother Thomas, who will then send it to our Matthias Schenck and Hoser, all of whom I know to be good men and skilled in keeping silent. Master Conrad Forer was, four days ago, co-opted into the number of ministers of this church by the common votes of all (as I hear), with no one dissenting, which may turn out well for both him and the church. I will assist my excellent friend and brother to the best of my ability, taking on part of his labors upon myself for a while, until he is more confirmed by greater experience. He greets you very respectfully, commending himself most diligently to your prayers, as does our Matthias, who seems to wish well for the church, and I do so with fervent prayers.</p>
      <p>Our magistrates greet you very courteously. Farewell, my sweetest soul, with your holy family and all the fellow ministers and professors, truly to be respected by me. Winterthur, March 2, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
