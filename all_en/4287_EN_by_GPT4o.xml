      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>There is much talk among us about you and your expedition.</p>
      <p>And yesterday my lords also decided that messengers should be sent from guild to guild and meanwhile armor and weapons should be inspected, and everyone should be advised to be prepared. Likewise, the bailiffs in the countryside are informed first, in case, God forbid, something should rise against the Confederation, that they should also be ready in haste. Provisions have also been made with the armory. May God grant us grace and protection. I hear by the grace of God that no one is either despondent or rebellious. Everyone, as is right, would like peace; but if that is not possible and we are attacked, people are willing to go into defense.</p>
      <p>I received Matthias Schenck's writing against the Ubiquitarians, a monstrous kind of people - I do not say theologians - but I think they are given over to a reprobate mind. For God punishes in them the insult, by which they continually defend such a presence of Christ and his eating, as antiquity did not know. Farewell.</p>
