      <p>S. On the eighteenth day of this month, Mr. Johannes Brunner came to me in Malans, indicating and explaining to me his fate and the reason why he was dismissed by the most pious Elector Prince.</p>
      <p>I certainly (as I should), felt genuine compassion for my old comrade, now so errant, and willingly and benevolently promised him all my assistance in seeking an honorable position with us. Therefore, after completing the function of the sermon, I went with Mr. Pontisella to Maienfeld (for there was a vacancy in the other function, which Mr. Andreas Vögeli held, who, unless he was soon confined to bed, would immediately be dismissed due to his unsuitable life). As soon as we arrived there, we found Mr. Andreas lying at death's door.</p>
      <p>After summoning some senatorial men, no small hope was opened to Brunner, provided the salary seemed ample enough to him. The matter will be settled the next day by those who are appointed on behalf of the entire community for this purpose. The salary amounts to one hundred gold coins or more, but not much more, etc.</p>
      <p>Upon returning to Chur, we found all your letters, most esteemed man and father. From them, we were informed about the most wicked conspiracy of our enemies, and we informed Mr. Consul Willi of everything, so that he might work more vigorously in hindering the soldiers. Indeed, even before (if I am not mistaken, on October 17, the day when the envoy requested three banners from the Confederates and appeared with his interpreter before our most esteemed magistrate, vehemently slandering our rebels as traitors, scoundrels, etc., conspirators against the king and almost robbers), Mr. Consul had been instructed by the tradition of the Bernese Republic and yours about the papist troops and plots, which they had long prepared under the pretense of other matters, but suddenly turned to the peril of the church of God. Therefore, since different things were written from elsewhere than those proposed by the envoy, who pretended to request only a supplement for the king's protection against certain factious people, our senate did not agree to his demands, but sent letters to the Confederates, advising them to carefully consider the whole matter, send their syndics here, and deliberate on what should be done with their help. At the same time, the interpreter disseminated some examples, in which he urged everyone to act without delay; for the king and the kingdom were in grave danger; some were so factious that, unless by divine help and the valor of the Swiss, our king (who was to celebrate the feast of Michael in a place called Plays not far from Paris) would have been thrown into ignominious chains, while gravely protesting that no disturbances were caused for the sake of religion. Moreover, it was decreed by the magistrate that it should be publicly proclaimed in the temple immediately after the sermon that no one should depart; but now it has been omitted in favor of Nicolas Bellizarius, lest his merchandise suffer any harm in return. This silence has only added to the spirit of the opposing parties, so that now drums are also heard, which, however, have now fallen silent by the magistrate's command. Indeed, leaders, captains, standard-bearers, and the standards themselves, along with the rest of the equipment, are said to be ready. But since the calamity of the faithful is suddenly increasing and very different things are reported daily, efforts will be made to impede and suppress everything, if possible. Our magistrate will certainly never agree; the people of Davos have also been informed for a long time; we will hear what the Superiors will do. Papists will undoubtedly support papists; but we also doubt them. Everyone knows that this is a foul war. However, the French are not struck here, but they seize all opportunities, present all pretexts, to persuade our people that religion is not being attacked. Yesterday, too, towards night, an example written by the interpreter on the order of Prince Condé was brought to me, which I believe to be entirely deceptive.</p>
      <p>I will write it here syllable by syllable: The mandate of the Prince of Condé, which he has issued in his name in France: So that no person may bear ignorance of the reason why the said lord has sent such a large number of noblemen and other persons of one and the other religion, he therefore desires that everyone be informed that this assembly has taken place solely for the reason that they may humbly ask the king to convene and assemble the estates of the kingdom, and then consider means by which his poor people may be relieved and freed from the great burdens and impositions imposed upon them by the malice of the Italians and imposed daily, and bring this kingdom back to its former glory and clarity. Therefore, the said lord prince commands and orders all persons, of whatever condition and quality they may be, that they neither speak nor act inappropriately regarding religion and other matters, under penalty of losing their lives, but should live friendly and peacefully with one another, as has been commanded and ordered to them by the king's edict.</p>
      <p>The interpreter spreads these and other things among the Confederates. But who would not smell the deceit, as if these difficulties were to be removed by some force and party dissension. It would indeed be good for the people, miserably flayed by these troubles, to be freed, if only there were no poison beneath. But it is a pretext. I do not want to detain you with more; the merchants are in a hurry.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>All good people send their regards to you. Forgive, I pray, the haste and always farewell with the whole church, my father.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency's most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, Mr. Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned and pious pastor of the church of Zurich, his father to be honored with perpetual faith.</p>
