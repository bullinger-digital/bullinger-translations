      <p>Greetings, which are solid and eternal, brought to us by the only begotten, who is in the bosom of God the Father and now also in the lap of man, but of the virgin mother, Jesus Christ, God and man, whom I earnestly pray to pour out upon you and your household the most abundant blessing of his heavenly gifts from the full horn of his abundance, so that the auspices of this new year may be most favorable to you, and no less happy in progress and outcome. I recently sent to you the letters of M[atthias] Scheucius and Hoser, our mutual friends, which I have no doubt you have received, and four days ago a certain messenger from Augsburg passed through here on his way to you, but he brought me no letters from anyone, nor had I ever seen him before, as far as I know, and yet he addressed me, promising to take care of anything I might wish to write. However, in such a time of fraud and treachery, I did not dare to entrust him with the letters I had prepared and completed, intending to send them to Constance, from where they are usually safely conveyed to Augsburg by men of proven faith. Let me know if he was also with you; for he claimed to have some letters for Zurich; the man's name is Leonard Schnider. I wish to learn from you about the sudden death of the Frenchman, and on what occasion it happened.</p>
      <p>Some fear that Navarre, now brought to the helm, will deliver much less than expected, who previously seemed to meditate on lofty and worthy things of a Christian prince, but was apparently bewitched and circumvented by the Guises before the king's death. But the Lord is the one who alone will mercifully govern all things according to his paternal will towards us, whom we may easily and happily have as propitious through the child born to us and the son given to us, provided we place our entire trust in him and, having put off the old man, walk in the newness of life, lifting up pure hands and supplicating prayers to him who now reigns in the highest goods of his Father; for he can deny us nothing, as he most willingly offers himself entirely to us; to whom be honor and glory forever. Amen. With great desire, I expect to learn from the letters of friends about those movements in WÃ¼rttemberg and Brandenburg, whether and how they have been calmed; for there is now great silence about them among us. If you have any certain news from France, I beg you, do not conceal it from me.</p>
      <p>There are those who say that Cardinal Lorraine, while the king was still alive, sought safety in flight and that his brothers followed him; others, on the contrary, affirm that certain heads of the reformation of France were outlined while the king was still alive, with the knowledge and consent of Navarre, which must still stand by agreement; others, as usual, spread other rumors. Everyone says and gladly believes in these matters what he would like to be true.</p>
      <p>But you either already have or will soon have more certain information; whatever it is or will be, I earnestly beg you to write to me as soon as possible. I will earnestly pray to the Lord that this kingdom, whose king has been adorned with the title of Most Christian by the Roman pontiff in this flattering manner, when nothing was less deserved, may now, with the favor of our supreme pontiff Christ, experience such kings who are not only called but truly are, if not most Christian, yet truly Christian, who kiss the Son of God, recognize him as the Alpha and Omega, the King of kings and Lord of lords, serve him with fear and rejoice with trembling, and extend the boundaries of his kingdom as widely as possible according to their ability. There is great expectation among many about the outcome of the imminent Swiss assemblies.</p>
      <p>We certainly hear that those pagans continue with their usual insolence and have not yet become any milder; but the most gentle lamb or certainly our strongest lion, Jesus Christ from the tribe of Judah, can easily tame their ferocity, if they refuse to recognize the lamb. People speak of cruel raging, raving, storming, spewing with hail and lightning of some who boast defiantly that everything must break or the old faith will soon rise again.</p>
      <p>Would that they, like Caiaphas, not say this from themselves, but, ignorant of what will happen to the religion not only ancient but also the first of all, prophesy that it will soon emerge and occupy all of Switzerland, as far as it extends. Oh, may the dear, kind, faithful, and strong God, who has often and repeatedly not only brought to nothing the plans of his enemies but has also turned them to the opposite, who allowed the fierce, ravenous, and bloodthirsty wolf Saul, who wanted to devour all the believers in Damascus, to be led away captive and delivered to death, to be led into the city as a completely tame, kind, and gentle lamb, so that he now himself desires eagerly to be captured and slain for the sake of the Lord Christ, whom he first wanted to strangle and utterly destroy in his dearest members. It often occurs to me, when everything seems to be tearing itself apart and it looks so terrifying on all sides, as if everything is going to collapse and shatter, like the rag and scrap collectors shouting in the streets: the worse, the better, and that the winds blow most violently when they are about to cease, and when a thing comes to its highest point, it must break and fall. Thus the Lord, when things are desperate, when no human strength, no wisdom, no resources can bring help, usually appears with the most present help as a god from the machine. However, in the meantime, I am greatly terrified by the ingratitude of our people and their lives, which are in no way aligned with the rule of the gospel, which we so gloriously boast of, lest it be ripe for divine vengeance. Therefore, I fluctuate between hope and fear, although the former usually prevails, as I confidently turn my eyes from our wickedness to the goodness of the cause and the glory of God's name, which he cannot but take into account. But farewell now, and take care diligently to be well.</p>
      <p>We greatly rejoice that you have begun to feel somewhat better; however, our prayers to the Lord will not cease until you have fully recovered your health, which the author of our eternal salvation, Christ, may grant you as soon as possible. Amen. Please convey my very respectful greetings to the friends and brothers who love us in the Lord, all your fellow ministers, and the professors of your school, to whom I wish with all my heart all the good beginnings of the new year with all the happiness of that year, which the Lord accepted to proclaim, Jesus Christ came into this world. In return, I earnestly ask you that your blessing may continually help and prosper me at the throne of grace. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of January 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Through my imprudence, it happened that on the previous page I made an error by not turning it correctly.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, much to be esteemed and very dear brother. In Zurich.</p>
