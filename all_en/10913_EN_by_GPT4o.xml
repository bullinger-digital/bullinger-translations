    <p xml:id="regest1">Is kept informed solely by Myconius [about the Concord discussions]; the Strasbourg [Bucer and Capito] are meanwhile negotiating with Basel as if they do not know the [First Helvetic] Confession. The publication of letters by Zwingli and Oecolampadius has prompted Luther to demand a retraction, yet the toleration of the Eucharistic doctrine contained therein is a prerequisite for an agreement. Bullinger wants to await the judgment of the Strasbourg on Vadian's ["Aphorisms"]. While he himself cannot approve the [Wittenberg Concord], Luther will hardly accept its interpretation by the Strasbourg; however, they once made commitments regarding the [First Helvetic] Confession. Erasmus [Schmid] delivers Vadian's book. Bullinger hopes for a visit from Myconius or Grynaeus.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I thank you, most sincere Myconius, for informing me so faithfully about those matters which it is important for us to know. However, the more you send and write, the less I can explain myself from the entanglements of words. Except for you, we have received not even a little about this matter from anyone else. As I hear, the people of Strasbourg write to everyone, but they write nothing to us. They even discuss with your people and inquire what they think about this matter, as if they truly do not know what we have written in Basel or what we have responded. If Luther is pleased with our confession, let him say so freely. If he is displeased, why do they dissemble? Why do they cry peace where there is no peace? We cannot speak, write, or confess otherwise about the Eucharist than our fathers of holy memory, Zwingli and Oecolampadius, have confessed. Luther indeed requested a retraction from Bucer because of the letters of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. But in this, that last dialogue of Oecolampadius stands out, which they so often cite in the exposition of the Wittenberg articles. In the same, there is a letter of Zwingli on folio 127, in which he has testified in clear words to what extent he agrees with Luther. Certainly, to that extent, we also agree with him. What was the need to stipulate that we would further teach according to the Saxon confession? If Luther can tolerate the letters, then indeed we agree with him. If he cannot, I do not see what use there is in the exposition of the people of Strasbourg. It seems to me, my Myconius, that they are continually obscuring a clear matter. We will await their judgment on the books of Joachim Vadian. Therefore, I cannot approve the articles. I fear Luther will not accept the exposition. In short, I do not see why they can press us, since we have once confessed in Basel, which at that time also pleased the people of Strasbourg. For you know what they promised then. I fear danger. More to us. The rest will be explained by our Erasmus. He has what Vadian wrote about the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Would that either you or that dearest Grynaeus would visit us sometime!</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly.</p>
      <p>August 4, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his very dear brother, Master Oswald Myconius, the most faithful Antistes of the people of Basel.</p>
