    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller recently wrote [with No. 2953] and wanted to entrust the letter to a reliable messenger [...], but this person is still occupied in Augsburg. Therefore, Haller now entrusts that letter along with the present writing to Thoman Ruman. He will report on the situation in Augsburg. He was able to secure his leave. Haller encouraged him to do so. He himself would have also applied for his dismissal if there had been any prospect of success. Now he hopes that Ruman can assist him by informing Bullinger and the Zurich council about the situation in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The decision [of the Zurich council] to keep Haller and Ruman in Augsburg was perhaps not ill-intentioned. However, what hurts is the realization of how little Haller's and Ruman's warnings were taken seriously. So if the people of Zurich still care about Haller, Bullinger should ensure that he is recalled as soon as possible, for nothing good can be expected from Augsburg anymore.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The church is virtually dissolved. There are so many Italians and Spaniards in the city that parents hardly dare to leave their homes. Meanwhile, many [Augsburgers] attend mass. Two churches are being prepared for this abomination! Mayor Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot do not know what to do, let alone take care of [the pastors]! They want the sermons and prayers to offend no one and almost give instructions for this. For this reason alone, Haller no longer wants to stay in Augsburg, regardless of whether he is recalled by the Zurichers or not. A recall would, however, be better not only for his own reputation but also for that of Zurich. Although he intended to endure everything in Augsburg, especially since he hoped for interesting experiences from the upcoming Reichstag, he can no longer bear it in Augsburg in view of the behavior [of the Augsburg authorities] and the fact that all blame is placed [on the pastors], even twisting everything in the name of Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is also apparent that the Augsburg [authorities] can no longer provide the promised protection, nor do they want to. When Haller's colleague Johann Heinrich Held von Tiefenau complained to the mayors about having to accommodate foreigners, they referred him to the [imperial] quartermasters. They said they could not change anything about it; that others must endure the same. A Spanish gentleman [...] came to Sebastian Lepusculus and brazenly ordered him to move to the attic because he would set up in the living room and bedrooms. When Lepusculus protested, he replied: "That's how I want it! You must make room for us, who have endured so much for the Emperor!" Such things happen daily. And if you complain, you must expect even greater difficulties. Certainly, the [Augsburg councilors] would like to help the [pastors], but they cannot or dare not!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Therefore, Haller sees no other solution than to leave Augsburg. And the only reason he is not already returning with Ruman is that it is more appropriate to wait for the [official] recall. For Ruman, this is not so important, as he is hardly known in Augsburg. But everyone knows Haller!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Moreover, all colleagues are amazed that Haller and Ruman remain (who have such compelling reasons to leave), while they themselves would give much to be allowed to leave. They even say that the Zurich council has probably betrayed them! Bullinger should therefore ensure that Haller is recalled as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He has endured much with the Augsburg church. And in the future, he is also ready to be steadfast for his homeland and endure suffering. Everyone (including his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and his entire household) can testify that he liked being in Augsburg and only leaves with a heavy heart (which often caused disagreements with his wife). But since the situation is hopeless and one must now also live among the enemies and agree with them, he can no longer bear it! Already Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, Bishop of Augsburg, Cardinal Francesco Sfondrato, envoy of Pope Paul III, and many other princes (whose names Haller did not remember) are in the city! Hopefully, more will be discussed soon in person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should consider Haller's conscience. He eagerly awaits a response. He wrote only very briefly to the Zurich council. Bullinger should inform the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater of everything. Ruman will also advocate with them. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you a few days ago about various matters, thinking I had a reliable messenger. However, he was delayed here due to his own affairs. Therefore, I am now sending the previously written letters along with this one to you through Thoman Ruman. He will inform you about our situation. He sought and obtained leave, not without my advice. I would have requested it myself if I could have succeeded, but I hope that through him, my situation can also be addressed if he explains to you and the Zurich council how our affairs stand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I acknowledge that the decision to keep us here was perhaps not made with ill intent. However, it pains me that our warnings were not taken seriously, despite our diligent efforts. Therefore, if our well-being still matters to you, please ensure that I am recalled as soon as possible, for there is no hope for anything good here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We almost have no church! There is such a large crowd of Italians and Spaniards here that no parent dares to leave their home. Many also attend mass. Two churches are being prepared for this abomination. The consuls themselves do not know what to do (let alone how to advise us)! They want us to preach and pray in a way that offends no one, and they almost prescribe specific rules for preaching, which is the one reason that moves me not to want to stay, whether I am recalled or not! But I would like to be recalled, not only for my own sake but also to preserve the authority of all of you. I had indeed decided to stay and endure anything, considering that this assembly would be an opportunity for considerable experience. But when I see the attitudes of our people and how everything is ultimately twisted against us and against Christ, my spirit is utterly repelled!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Additionally, they neglect the promised defense so much that it appears they neither can nor want to defend us. To our colleague Heldio, some worldly matters were imposed, and when he complained to the mayors, they gave him no answer but referred him to the quartermasters. When he approached them, they said they could do nothing; others must endure the same. A Spanish gentleman came to Lepusculus and brazenly ordered him to move to the attic, saying he would occupy the living room and bedrooms. When Lepusculus said, "Enough of this, sir, for the empire!" he replied, "This is how I want it, this is how I command it! You must yield to us, who have endured so much for the Emperor!" Such things happen to us daily. When we complain, we only create more trouble for ourselves. I do not doubt that they would gladly help us if they could or dared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Therefore, I see no other option than to leave here. And the only reason I am not doing this with Ruman is that I am waiting for a recall, so I can leave more conveniently. Ruman was known to few, while the whole city knows me!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Moreover, all colleagues are amazed that we remain, who have such compelling reasons to leave, while they themselves would give much to be allowed to leave. They even say that the Zurich council has probably betrayed us! Therefore, I ask that as soon as you receive this, you ensure that I am recalled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have endured much with this church. I will continue to endure and suffer in the future for my homeland, whatever the Lord gives to bear! Know this for certain (and all who are with me, indeed my wife and family, will testify to this), that I am reluctant to leave Augsburg, and I have never been here unwillingly (which often caused disagreements with my wife). But since the situation has come to this point, where we must live among enemies and turn a blind eye to all impiety, my spirit cannot bear it. The Duke of Alba, the Bishop of Augsburg, the papal legate, and other princes, whose names I do not know, are already here! I hope to discuss more with you in person soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Now farewell, and keep my well-being and conscience in your care. I anxiously await your response. I have also written to the council, but very briefly. Please communicate all this to the consuls. Ruman will advocate for my cause with them. Farewell to you, your family, and all the brothers. Augsburg, July 22, 1547. You know my hand.</p>
      <p>To his venerable father, D. Bullinger.</p>
