      <p> By the grace of God, Friedrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Archduke and Elector, etc. Our greetings beforehand, honorable, dear, special one, although we are well aware that you do not desire our gifts and presents, but are willing to serve us with all good will to the best of your ability without them, which we have felt to our great gracious satisfaction so far, we cannot refrain from graciously honoring you with this modest drinking vessel, graciously requesting that you willingly accept it from us, and remember us in the best way, especially in your prayers, as we stand in common temptation and Satan now attempts to trouble us more than others, but the Son of God will know well how to defend against him with His power, etc. Thus, you and your colleagues are well inclined with all grace. Dated Heidelberg, Monday, the 9th of September, in the year etc. 66. </p>
      <p> To the honorable, our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, church servant in Zurich. </p>
      <p> Send the gilded doublet. Count Palatine Elector. </p>
