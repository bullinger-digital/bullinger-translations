      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. There is no need, most esteemed brother in Christ, to elaborate on the state of our church and all of us; for I do not doubt that you have heard these things from our man who was with you in recent days. The rest will be pronounced by our Heinius, unless he is tongue-tied. But to keep it brief, here is the summary from me. Satan does not cease among those who hold power, even among our own, but urges that the Emperor's Interim be sent to us as soon as possible, to be imposed on the churches peacefully and with the greatest promises, certainly with wondrous and deceitful schemes.</p>
      <p>Oh the customs, oh the times. Truly he said: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man," etc., and another: "In all courts, folly holds the scepters; and the royal crowd follows his feet." Hence, it will be right to exclaim against that elder leader, who seduces so many souls: "Conspiracy, conspiracy." Pray for us without ceasing, excellent brothers, that our faith may not fail, etc.</p>
      <p>You have heard, I suppose, from others about the most impious Synod held at Saverne. Bishop Erasmus was anointed with episcopal chrism by two suffragans on the feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, offering the first fruits of the masses to Satan, followed by a most celebrated synod of many prelates, as they call them, with unusual pomp. Four abbots were elected to be inquisitors of heretical depravity, among whom that tyrant abbot in Schuttern, Rudolf Garb, will be the leader, the reformer of churches in Alsace. The people of Strasbourg expect nothing else but the mass and would have long since sacrificed, if they had not feared the tumult of the crowd; everything is prepared in the choir of the main church, etc.</p>
      <p>The Count of Hanau has not yet yielded to the urging bishop, but protects his ministers as much as he can and does not even want to send away the lowest, unless the bishop substitutes interim priests. The Duke of Bipontinum does the same, etc. These are about our matters. Saxony is still safe and the maritime cities, etc.</p>
      <p>These are the certain things to you, most esteemed brother; many things are spread everywhere among the people, but they are uncertain. But why do we dwell on the rumors of men? The word of God is certain, solid, and immutable, which will not be exterminated by the tyranny of the Pope or the Emperor, provided we repent. The Lord will preserve some remnants of His Germany. For I hear that many cities, about which there was an outcry, are now breathing again. We will soon see the majesty of Christ, as I hope, much clearer than ever. Farewell and pray for us, as you do, diligently, that wolves may not rush into the fold of Christ's sheep among us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the church and family. I did not want to write; but Heinius persuaded me, from whom you will fish out the rest. Greet all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, April 25, 1549.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother, etc.</p>
