      <p>S. D. I have nothing to write at the moment. For the sake of the debt, I will act diligently with all loyalty, hoping they will get their money; if not, their rights are reserved. I will also act without delay.</p>
      <p>Regarding WÃ¤denswil, the situation is as follows: the castle and estates belong to the Johannitermeister; he sold them to my lords for 23,000 guilders; however, Schwyz and the Five Cantons are involved in the purchase and do not want to let it go. Therefore, a court day was held in Einsiedeln, and the matter has been set for trial. Nevertheless, they will now try to resolve it amicably. May God direct it well. From Italy, we have nothing, except that the Pope is willing to hold a council to his advantage.</p>
      <p>My lords also have enough trouble with the Abbot of Stein and the Bishop of Constance; this rabble does not relent, etc. Today in Baden, all sorts of things will remain.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Zurich, June 15, 1550. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
