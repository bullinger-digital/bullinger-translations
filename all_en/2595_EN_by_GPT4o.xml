      <p>My friendly greetings beforehand, dear brother-in-law, know that I have entrusted everything and that the Duke will also write to you through me, and it is very good that I am in Augsburg myself and staying; I hope, in three weeks, God willing, to be with you. And since it is so expensive, I have not dared to run out of money, remember, if brother Ulrich were to come to an agreement on his own, it would be early enough, it would also be dearer to you and him than for me to suffer lack. Once I am done in Augsburg, I will have to go to Neuburg; there I will receive more money. I cannot write you any fruitful news; as nothing has been negotiated yet. It was only on Sunday that the Antichrist's cardinal arrived, whom the king and bishop of Augsburg went to meet. With this, I commend you to God's protection. Greet my dear wife, your children, sons-in-law, and wherever you have a message, my brother. Dated on the third Tuesday after Laetare in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Jakob Adlischwyler from Nellingen. To the well-learned and highly esteemed my friendly, dear brother-in-law Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
