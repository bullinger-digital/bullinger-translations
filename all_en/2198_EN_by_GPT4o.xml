      <p>Most Serene King, most powerful prince and most gracious lord, I pray to God our Father for all happiness for your royal majesty through Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>Last winter, I wrote four books on the correct doctrine of the justification of a Christian man, in which I discussed the grace of God, the merit of Christ, true faith and that alone justifying, and truly good works and what their correct doctrine is. I wrote simply and calmly, and, as I hope, religiously and orthodoxly. In this work, I aimed at nothing other than the advancement of the glory of God, peace in the church, concord, and the salvation of souls. Moreover, I dedicated these books to your royal majesty, which I also send at present. I seek nothing here from your royal majesty, I ask nothing from it, God is my witness, except that first indeed the virtues of your royal majesty may be commended to posterity for imitation, then that your royal piety may be incited to perseverance in these virtues, furthermore that I may obtain that in the kingdoms of your serenity our doctrine with the Swiss churches may not be undeservedly discredited, and finally that your royal majesty may favor me and have me commended along with all the ministers of the churches invoking and worshiping Christ in truth. Meanwhile, I humbly and promptly offer to your royal majesty myself and all my services. May your royal majesty live, be well, and flourish. I beseech your royal piety to read, when leisure permits, or something in this work, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich among the Swiss, February 24, in the year of our Lord 1554. Most devoted to your royal majesty, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most serene and most powerful prince and lord, King Christian of Denmark, the Goths, Norway, etc., Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, and Dithmarschen, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, my most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Bullinger's writing, sends to the king a book on the correct doctrine of the justification of a Christian man.</p>
      <p>Delivered through Kolding, July 20, in the year 1554.</p>
