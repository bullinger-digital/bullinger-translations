      <p>Greetings. I was about to address our need from another source, which my old friendship with your father requires me to cultivate with you, most distinguished man, lord and teacher to be honored with every kind of respect, than from him, from whom perhaps I may be less able to be grateful. For I am not unaware of how much it matters in forming a friendship at the beginning, if, in addition to the sincerity of minds on both sides, an opportunity is seized, so that we do not seem to want to be bothersome. But I have discovered from various experiences that you are of such candor, and I have noticed from the conversations of the magnificent man, Mr. Johann Feyerthoy of Hungary, my singular benefactor, and finally also from my father's conversations, that even if you could exclude and repel me, unknown and unworthy as I am, from your company, yet for the sake of their favor, with the benevolence you usually show to others, you will embrace me as well. And indeed, I now recall that story of Diogenes in Laertius, that, although he was often driven away with sticks by Antisthenes, who admitted no one into his discipline, he nevertheless did not want to withdraw from his company, presence, and teaching. Therefore, either my persistence will not allow you to be alienated from me, or if there is any benefit in me that I can show to my father's friends, it will unite me to you in such a way that it will appear that I am greatly loved by you, and that you are highly esteemed and respectfully observed by me. I am especially aware that it is incumbent upon me to deserve your favor, if not by many services, at least by honoring and loving you, especially since the learned master Isocrates, as he is accustomed everywhere, has also taught in this way of living that young men should honor their fathers with wood, which I desire not so much as I strive for, provided I can be the kind of person who does not tarnish the authority of such a great man with my memory. However, I fear that you may think I doubt your piety if I continue to describe myself to you in more detail than is worthy of the honor I desire from your friendship. I promise this about my respect for you, which I can easily do, that you will be held in the highest esteem by me at all times and that you will have a young man who does not want to obscure or tarnish the most sacred bonds of his parent with his most faithful friends. One thing now troubles me, that a better time has not been given to me to introduce myself to you than in the recommendation of others, which I should have entirely claimed for myself until I could prove to you that friends should not be made before you have consumed a bushel of salt with them. But what do moments of time matter to the pure union of minds? So much for this; now hear what else I wish. A young man from Bavaria, of noble birth, very learned and of great name with the duke, was to be sent somewhere so that, besides the manners and first rudiments he acquired at home, he might learn greater things abroad. The nearby academy is Ingolstadt, where, without great expense to his wealthy father, he could be supported closer to home; there is nothing to prevent the boy from going there, except that his father wants him to be thoroughly imbued with the sacred and true religion that we hold from a young age. There is none of that in those places, but rather dreadful vanities and deceptions are seen there. It is being deliberated where he should be sent; and while they hesitate for a long time, finally neither my father nor his finds a better plan than for the boy to go to Zürich, since other cities, otherwise flourishing, are now troubled by arms, dissensions, and conquests, while yours, in which I congratulate you and give thanks to God, is always safe and unharmed. The decision is made for him to go to you, a place wisely chosen for its many conveniences. The last thing is to consider how he will live there, whether he should bring a tutor with him or whether he will find such an abundance of teachers there that he can take care of both his living and studies with the same person. I know that Mr. Gessner, a man of eternal memory, who certainly should not die, had with him my closest brothers, namely the sons of Mr. Peutinger, the most famous jurist of our city. Alas, the death of an excellent man does not allow me to explain to you at length, as his death has taken away from me, as it were, another father. If our young man could also live under such a yoke, it would be very pleasing, so that he would not be granted the freedom to indulge in his own license, towards which he has been made more inclined by his mother. For they must be diligently restrained, to whom maternal affection grants more than is due. Therefore, help us in this matter, and let us know as soon as possible what you decide with your wisdom and prudence, either through a convenient courier, through whom you can immediately send, or through a special messenger, to whom we will pay the due for the journey without any detriment to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, 27th of May, 1553. I send many greetings from my father to you and to Mr. Gessner, whom may fate keep safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>If you are going to write anything to Mr. Feyerthoy, include it in your next letter to me, and I will faithfully transmit it to him as quickly as possible. Four days ago, a fever, into which the Lord unexpectedly cast me, prevented me from replying to his matters. Farewell again, splendor and ornament of the learned, and do not refuse to take me into your trust.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness in all things, Raphael Seiler, son of Geryon, the chief physician of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, an eminent theologian, his lord and teacher to be honored with perpetual fidelity. Zürich.</p>
