      <p>Greetings to the reverend men, most esteemed lords, and dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>We received and read your letters with immense joy, although there were many things in them that caused us great sorrow and instilled great anxiety. However, our gracious Father often uses such occasions to stir us to fervent prayers.</p>
      <p>We give you the greatest thanks for your diligence and kindness, and we will reciprocate in all things where it is possible. We love you sincerely; we greatly approve of your care and immense labors for the churches of France.</p>
      <p>We pray to God to keep you safe for a long time, to restore our dear brother Viret to you from his illnesses, and to grant us all the strength to promote the kingdom of Christ. We promise our assistance wherever you may need it.</p>
      <p>Now, since we cannot assist you in any other way, we will pray to the Lord without ceasing for your safety and that of the French churches. Continue steadfastly in the faith and diligence you have shown so far; the eternal praise of the pious will accompany you.</p>
      <p>All the brothers and fellow ministers send their greetings, especially my godfather Mr. Martyr, my relative Gwalther, and my three sons-in-law Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler, my two sons, who are also ministers of the church, Mr. Wolphius and Haller, and Gessner also wish you all happiness and the Lord's blessing. Your letters have just been delivered to me; for the most illustrious prince, the Landgrave of Hesse, sent a messenger with letters to me, in which he earnestly inquires about the welfare of the churches in Geneva and ours, and what is happening in France and Italy, especially in Trent. He thanks me for my books on the councils that have been published.</p>
      <p>He indicates that at the Naumburg Diet, many efforts were made against us, whom they call Zwinglians, but by God's grace, they were unable to achieve what they intended, and the Elector Palatine, along with himself and some other princes, strongly opposed them, etc. He also offers all goodwill to our churches.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, it will be possible to respond to him more certainly about everything, and as I know I must be selective in what I communicate to him, I also understand that I must commend to his excellency your faith, diligence, and church. Yesterday we received letters from London, dated April 22.</p>
      <p>From these, we understand that the state of religion is quite well by God's grace. The most serene queen does not yet have a husband.</p>
      <p>It is written that an embassy from the most serene king of Sweden is present, but nothing certain is known about the marriage. All of Scotland has accepted the gospel, and the affairs of those kingdoms are quite peaceful.</p>
      <p>May God increase His grace to them.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing at all about the Basel Diet.</p>
      <p>For our envoy has not yet returned.</p>
      <p>You will undoubtedly learn everything that has been decided from the Bernese.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, the churches, the main one and St. Peter's, have been returned to Christ and the preaching of the gospel. All ministers and professors have been summoned by the magistrate's deputies, and it has been strictly indicated to the preachers not to publicly denounce the names of Zwingli, Oecolampadius, or Calvin in their sermons, nor should a few preachers conduct ecclesiastical meetings, in which church matters are to be discussed, but all pastors, deacons, professors, and elders, that is, the appointed senators, should do so. For you know what disturbances Mr. Marbach has stirred up against Mr. Zanchius regarding the issue of the Lord's Supper, especially concerning free will and predestination, etc.</p>
      <p>Now we hope, by God's grace, that the strength of these evil plans has been cut off. May the Lord restrain those turbulent spirits. A student of the Schaffhausen church returned from Wittenberg a few days ago.</p>
      <p>He explained to us how much turmoil the Jena people are causing in Saxony, and that the Wittenberg and Leipzig schools no longer oppose us as they used to. Would that they would finally agree with us sincerely.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers, and forgive me for not writing individual letters to each of you. I could barely draft these.</p>
      <p>For the one who was offering your letters to me was doing so in the evening, indicating that he would leave in the morning hours.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and your labors.</p>
      <p>Write back, we pray, when it can be done at your convenience and without any trouble: otherwise, we do not wish to add labors to labors. Zurich, May 29, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>What you, my lord and brother Calvin, write about the king's envoy, I also judge the same, that he is an excellent man and favorable to the cause of Christ, but in the meantime, he is the king's envoy. Let us therefore use him and his services as a faithful one, but let us also apply prudence, praying to the Lord to always govern our affairs.</p>
      <p>Greet all your brothers and fellow ministers most kindly in my name and in the name of all my fellow ministers, as well as friends like Budaeus, Jonville, Badius, Crispinus, and other acquaintances. Let us love one another mutually in Christ so that He may continue to bless us.</p>
      <p>I hurried so that I could not reread what I wrote. Therefore, kindly accept all these things.</p>
      <p>I hope that Christopher Tretius the Pole delivered my letters to you a few days ago. At the beginning of June, a synod of all pastors was convened and summoned at the court of the Rhaetians, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Mr. John Calvin and Theodore Beza, the most faithful ministers of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers. Geneva.</p>
