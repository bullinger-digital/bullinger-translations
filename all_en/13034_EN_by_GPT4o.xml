    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] May God grant success to the [Zurich] shooting festival! Bullinger will see the date of the enclosed letter [No. 2971] to know when it was written. Myconius found no messenger for it. He no longer remembers what it contains. Bullinger should answer any questions on occasion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The [deposed] Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] is forced to seek refuge in Strasbourg and from there (if possible) in Basel. This will probably not happen, as when Myconius secretly advocated for it with the top councilors, he was given no hope. This is confidential.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Mayor Adelberg Meyer was informed by letter that Emperor Charles V will winter in Strasbourg and move the Imperial Diet to Speyer. If this is true, then it is to be understood as a threat against the Confederates. Had Myconius not entrusted himself to the Lord, this would greatly worry him. He does not quite trust the Five Places, as it is always rumored that they are in league with the Emperor. Moreover, the Emperor desires nothing more than to subjugate the Confederates. How does Bullinger trust the allies?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Hanseatic cities refuse to make peace with the Emperor. The people of Bremen are said to hold out bravely under Count Christoph of Oldenburg. But on the opposing side, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and others are not inattentive. The Bohemians are said to be at the mercy of King Ferdinand's arbitrariness, which Myconius never thought possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Allegedly, the Turkish Sultan Suleiman has captured a castle of the Bishop of Gran [Pál Várdai]. Others say that Pressburg has been taken and thus Vienna is lost, and that troops hastily mustered in Austria and Bavaria are moving against the Turks. However, since the King continues to oppose the [nobility] of Bohemia and the Emperor does not deviate from his plan, it seems both have come to an understanding with the Turks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] There is fear that the Antichrist [Pope Paul III] has commissioned the French King Henry II to attack England.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] This as a supplement to the previous letter [No. 2971]. Greetings, also to Theodor Bibliander and Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>May the Lord grant success to this shooting festival. You will see from the date of the other letters when I wrote them. In the meantime, I could not find anyone to deliver them. I do not remember what I meant. If there is anything that requires a response, please respond when you have the time.</p>

      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne is being urged to go to Strasbourg and from there to us, if he could find a place. I fear he will not find one. Indeed, I spoke secretly with our leaders and found a response from which no hope shone. This is for your ears only, so you know.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our consul Meier told me that it has been written that the Emperor will winter in Strasbourg and the Imperial Diet has been moved to Speyer. If this is true, I interpret it as a threat against us. Here, unless I had devoted myself to the Lord, I would be very anxious. For I do not know why I cannot hope well for the Five Places. And it is constantly murmured that they are somewhat colluding with the Emperor, who today desires nothing more than to bring our country under the yoke. I would like to hear from you what hope, after the Lord, you have for the Confederates.</p>

      <p>The maritime cities consistently refuse peace with the Emperor. The people of Bremen, led by Oldendorp, are said to be acting bravely; against Brunswick and others, they do not neglect their duty. The Bohemians are said to be at the mercy of the king, which I would not have thought.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Turk is said to have occupied a fortress that belonged to the Bishop of Stridon. Others add that Pressburg has been captured, and therefore Vienna is at stake, with troops hastily gathered through Austria and Bavaria being sent against the Turks. Since the king does not cease from the Bohemians and the Emperor from his purpose, I persist in the opinion that they are in agreement with the Turk.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>England is feared to be sought by the Roman Antichrist through the French, as is feared.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I wanted to add this to the previous. Farewell with Theodor and Gwalther in the Lord. Basel, August 11, 1547. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
