    <p xml:id="regest1">Kilchmeyer reports from Bern despite his overwhelming tasks, as it concerns Bullinger's honor as well as the salvation of God and the Church, which must be protected by all means!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Beat Gering, in his sermon on Maundy Thursday [March 29, 1548], after lengthy, Luther-like explanations about the bodily presence of Christ both in heaven at the right hand of God and at the Lord's Supper, claimed that Bullinger also represented this in his commentary on 1 Corinthians, chapters 10f. Presumably, by mentioning Bullinger's name, he wanted to gain recognition for Martin Luther's heresy (whose name he omitted in his explanations!) and thus mislead the simple people (who do not know better).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Immediately after the sermon, Kilchmeyer sent one of his students [N.N.] with a letter to Gering and asked, as a sign of goodwill, for a written explanation of how and why he mentioned Bullinger's commentary in the midst of his sermon. After all, he would rather not rely on his old, deaf ears. Gering initially refused this for flimsy reasons, but then sent him the enclosed letter [not received] within an hour with the passages from Bullinger's writing mentioned in his sermon. The thorough reading and discussion with Johannes Wäber revealed very large differences between the sermon and the writing. In Bullinger's name, the Church was more harmed than taught!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Kilchmeyer has considered the following course of action (if he is not mistaken): Bullinger should first present his view on the bodily presence of Christ and his corresponding representations in the commentary on 1 Corinthians in writing to the Bern Council. He should also state the reason for the writing: He had heard rumors that Gering had referred to him in his remarks about the bodily presence of Christ at the Lord's Supper. However, since most rumors cannot simply be believed, he is now politely inquiring with the Bern Council about the truth. If this should be the case, he is, if necessary, ready to defend himself like a faithful servant of the Church and to set everything in motion so that the holy, salvific, and eternal truth does not fall into disrepute in his name and the simple people are not deceived. Thus, Gering is forced to give an account, and perhaps even finally be deposed! And even if it should not come to that, the Bern Church would [at least] have Bullinger's correct teaching and Gering's attempt to spread his own [Lutheran view] in his name made evident.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">In March, [the Bern Council] summoned Pierre Viret and some other church servants of the Lausanne clergy to Bern, as maliciously and contrary to the old order, a review of a church servant [André Zébédée] had been held. Furthermore, these Lausanne people had previously disputed 99 theses posted on the church door and formulated incomprehensibly. Bullinger can easily recognize what these aim at by reviewing the enclosed ten theses [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The Bern Council has ordered a final review of the 99 theses by a commission consisting of the Bern church court, some council members, and all pastors. The pastors were instructed to prepare a reliable German translation of the Latin writings. In addition, the Lausanne pastors should present a justification of their theses. The results and translations developed by the commission are to be submitted to the Bern Council. The [Zwinglian] Bern pastors are prepared for this (to the glory of God!). The council will hopefully end the nasty dispute with a judgment, unless it wishes (instead of peace and harmony) the emergence of a new heresy from such disputes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">As soon as Bullinger and his Zurich colleagues have reviewed the enclosed ten theses, they may return them along with their highly desired judgment on each individual claim as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Kilchmeyer has immediately set out to search for the receipt [mistakenly] sent by Bullinger to Kaspar Seidensticker. As evidence of this, he sends the enclosed letter [not received] that he received from Seidensticker. In addition, he is very grateful for Bullinger's numerous, comforting letters and for the book gift on the Acts of the Apostles [«Series et digestio temporum»], which he received a few days ago from a noble man [N.N.].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Greetings, also to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and family. Bullinger should greet the colleagues from Kilchmeyer, Eberhard von Rümlang, Nikolaus Pfister, and Johannes Wäber. Another greeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">The desired letter from the Bern schoolmasters [Pfister and Rümlang] should certainly arrive in Zurich soon.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. Although I am almost overwhelmed, dearest brother, under the excessive burden of tasks that continually press upon me, yet, because the dignity of your name and above all the glory of the almighty God and the salvation of the Church must be both propagated and defended by all means, behold, as if freed and unburdened from all, I convey the following to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On the day of the Lord's Supper just past, our Beat Gering, while delivering a sermon to the people, after having said much about the bodily presence of Christ both in heaven at the right hand of the Father and in the supper according to Lutheran philosophy, added: "And thus writes also Heinrich Bullinger, a teacher of the Church of Zurich, on 1 Corinthians chapters 10 and 11," wishing, as far as I could understand, to confirm what he had taught from Luther's teachings, though without mentioning Luther's name, by publishing your name, and thus to lead the ignorant and simple into the error sown.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Hereupon, immediately after the sermon, I sent one of my students with a letter to Gering, demanding, by the symbol of eternal peace, that he would deign to instruct me in writing, how and for what purpose he had brought forth your writings with your name publicly: for I would rather trust his hand than my ears, since due to age I might easily be deceived. He first (I know not what occupations he alleged) denied my request. However, after an interval of one hour, he sent me a note, which I send to you, announcing that he had here what he had taught from your commentaries for the sermon. When I had read these diligently and communicated with Johannes Wäber, we could judge no otherwise than that the words thrown from the pulpit differed as far as possible from the writings sent to me and did not agree at all. And thus he offended the church under your name rather than taught what should be taught and inculcated!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I therefore offer you my mind and counsel in this matter for examination. And if it is found that I do not stray from the aim of truth, I pray, by your wisdom, that you would proceed in this manner: First, write to the magnificent council what you think about the bodily presence of Christ, and what your commentaries teach on this matter. Then add the reason why you wrote these: namely, that you had perceived by public rumor that Gering had spread certain things about the bodily presence of Christ in the supper under your name among the people. Since, however, rumor is often uncertain and not to be immediately accepted as truth, you humbly ask that the council enlighten you and reveal the truth to you. Having done this, you are prepared, if necessary, to defend yourself as a faithful minister of the church and to move every stone, lest the holy, salvific, and eternal truth be anywhere discredited under your name and the simple be deceived. For thus I think Gering will be compelled to give an account and hasten the outcome he has long deserved. But if it does not succeed, yet the Bern church will understand how well you have written and taught, and what Gering has attempted to introduce and plant under your name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Then Peter Viret, along with some other ministers from the Lausanne class, were summoned to Bern last month because of an examination held there against a minister maliciously and contrary to the former order. Moreover, they disputed 99 conclusions affixed to the church doors in Lausanne. From these, what they sought and contended with sophistic circumlocutions and embellishments, you can easily understand from the ten I send you to read and examine.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The council has once decreed that the conclusions be first examined by our consistory, with some from the senatorial order joined with all the ministers of the church, whose diligence and labor translated what was written in Latin into the German language. At the same time, it ordered that the Lausanne ministers show their arguments by which they attempted to defend and establish the conclusions as truth. Then it was commanded to us to faithfully report all things discussed and interpreted to the council. We stand now by God's grace prepared and armed, expecting every hour when we may be ordered to offer what has been discovered and translated into German to the council, which, passing judgment on all, will, as we firmly hope, put an end to the cursed contention, if otherwise it prefers peace and concord to Greek glory and from such disputes to see and suffer new heresies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Having read the conclusions and diligently examined them by you and your brothers who labor with you in word and doctrine, return them as soon as you can, adding what you think about each, whose judgment I most eagerly desire to hear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Concerning the investigation of the receipt, I have not hesitated at all. So that you may see more clearly, I send you the letters recently sent by Kaspar attached to mine, offering you immense thanks both for your frequent letters, by which you do not cease to console me, and for your little book on the Acts of the Apostles, which you presented to me in past days through a certain nobleman.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord together with your wife, children, and entire household. And greet all the brothers in my name, Eberhard von Rümlang, Nikolaus Pfister, Johannes Wäber. Again, farewell. From Bern, April 2, 1548.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The judgment you expect from our schoolmasters, you will have shortly, unless I am mistaken.</p>
      <p>Jodocus Kilchmeyer, always yours.</p>
