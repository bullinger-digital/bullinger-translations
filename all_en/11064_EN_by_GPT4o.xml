    <p xml:id="regest1">The invitation of Bullinger and the others to a meeting in Urdorf [Canton Zurich] pleased him; he cannot interrupt his spa treatment, but afterwards - he has also informed his relative Hans Peter Wellenberg of this - he will come to Zurich together with some fellow spa-goers.</p>

      <p>The grace of our dear Father in heaven be with us all.</p>
      <p>Kind, dear lord and brother, I have received your and the other beloved lords' letter, in which you invite me to Urdorf out of special love, and I am rightly delighted by it, as I have always felt your friendliness and goodwill towards me (as indeed always before), for which I thank you sincerely and diligently, offering to earn such from you without reservation. And I inform you and the other lords that it is not possible for me to come to Urdorf on the appointed or any other day because I must attend to my spa treatment and wait for its completion. However, I do not want to hide my good intention from you, that I am willing to travel to Zurich together with some of my fellow spa-goers (spa companions). If this happens (as we have also informed our cousin Hans Peter Wellenberg of the same intention), I will gladly comply with your wishes. Therefore, I kindly ask you not to take offense at this refusal. It shall be more convenient for us, God willing, in Zurich than in Urdorf. With this, I commend myself to your prayers, which I earnestly desire from the heart.</p>
      <p>Dated in Baden, Tuesday, the 17th of July in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Conrad Zwick, your very willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my particularly kind lord and friend.</p>
