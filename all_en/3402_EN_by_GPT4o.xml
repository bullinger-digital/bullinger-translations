      <p>Greetings. I received both of your letters and I am very grateful both for the information about the current state of Italy and for your faithful warning, lest any insidious poison from the books of the Swenckfeldians should creep in here. By the singular providence of God, it happened that recently, while our Oporinus was away at the Frankfurt fair, a book on celestial medicine was offered to me for judgment, and that by the order of Oporinus himself through letters. As soon as I inspected it, I easily perceived from the very beginning that either Swenckfeld himself or one of his disciples was the author, and therefore I seriously forbade it to be printed. And indeed, if it had been established by what means and studies this matter was attempted, the book could have been retained, which was returned after a few days. Regarding the Worms colloquy, apart from what I am sending, I receive nothing, because it is a matter of conscience for friends to write anything after the interlocutors and associates have been bound by oath to the faith of silence. It is certain that it was once interrupted due to the withdrawal of the Genevans, and it is not yet clear whether it has been restored, although the return of Philipp from Heidelberg, where he had departed, to Worms gives hope that it will be renewed, if it has not now begun anew. In Italy, it seems, peace is being negotiated; but what the monarchs will give for the following year, the Lord knows. For there is no mention of peace, and the preliminaries indicate that there will be a grave and prolonged war, in which our neighbors will undoubtedly be involved and perhaps we along with them, so that we may together bear the judgments of the Lord. These things briefly, as I am very busy.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with your wife and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, S[imon] Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
