      <p> Greetings in the Lord. As soon as I received your letter, dearest compater in the Lord, I went to the treasurer Haller and explained to him what you had written to me. After a somewhat lengthy consultation between us, he replied that he would not rest until he finally did something in the matter of Haller, our compater; at the same time, however, he instructed me to approach the chief scribe and explain to him, as I had to him, what your letter suggests. I went, explained; he replied that this matter had been entrusted to the treasurer and to Fenner von Gravenried, and that the delay was due to the fact that the treasurer had not been able to attend the council, but that he wanted to urge Sigifer von Gravenried to expedite this matter. As far as I understand, the matter of WÃ¤dischwyl will hardly involve the Bernese unless it is first requested by your people and the people of Schwyz and Glarus. </p>
      <p> Perhaps these matters should be of no concern to me; however, I wish that these two republics would embrace each other more closely. </p>
      <p> Regarding my home, both mournful and sad, I am grateful for your kindness in consoling us so piously. We know and impose a limit on our grief, but we cannot yet completely shake it off. In time, it will be soothed, as time has great efficacy in diminishing sorrow. We commend ourselves to your prayers. I am greatly surprised about Gervasius, that no provision has yet been made for him. What can I say about the people of Aarau? This pot deserves to find a lid similar to itself. I suppose that even Paul himself would not find a place in such a church for this one reason, that he was a Swabian. How has this vanity crept into Christianity and the Gospel? It is to be feared that this ingratitude will soon be punished by God's judgment with some notable example. Farewell excellently, dearest compater in the Lord, and do not cease to urge the cause of our Haller, or rather not of Haller, but of this miserable church, since there are so few others who seriously consider it. Greetings to your entire household, whom all of mine greet from the heart, and then to all the lords and brothers. </p>
      <p> Bern, December 13, 1549. </p>
      <p> Your Wolfgang Musculus, compater in the Lord. </p>
      <p> To the dearest theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater in the Lord. Zurich. </p>
