      <p>S. I rejoice that you have been restored to us by the grace of God, most esteemed lord and brother. I have refrained from the duty of writing until now, so as not to be a burden to you while you were ill; in the meantime, I have continually shown signs of my most eager affection for you, as I never wrote to our Gasto without instructing him to share each letter with you or convey my greetings, which I am sure he has done fully. Now, since he writes that you have recovered and are teaching again, I proceed to converse with you once more through my letters.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent, instituted by the devil, proceeds in a devilish manner. The Pope has sent there the legate Cardinal of Bologna from the Crescenzi family, a doctor of laws, a man well-versed in the school of the devil. However, nothing changes, not even a hair, regarding the conclusions in the 7 sessions; thus, they have won before the meeting.</p>
      <p>And who, loving truth and eager for the salvation of his church, would subject the cause of religion to the enemies of all piety and honesty? Who would endure being sent away to throw pearls before swine? Who would attempt to convert those who sin against the Holy Spirit? I am therefore amazed at the hope with which it is said that Melanchthon does not object to being sent to the synagogue of wolves; but perhaps the rumors being spread are false. The one who offers this to you is a Fleming from Ghent; he says he is an exile for the sake of the gospel. If you can, help him to learn the art of composition in some printing house; I have found no place for him here where he could stay. Everyone here has enough to do with their own needs. There is great scarcity of resources and an even greater abundance of the poor; I do not know how things will turn out. May the Lord soon look upon us with eyes of mercy. Farewell with all your household. Zurich, the last day of April, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the church of Basel, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
