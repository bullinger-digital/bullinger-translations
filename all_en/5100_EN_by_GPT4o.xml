      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that I have not received anything from you for such a long time. I was worried that perhaps your health was not good, if I had not heard better news about you these days from Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer. I sent the lady of Ribeaupierre some books; but due to the negligence of the carriers, it happened that the last two gatherings in the Apocalypse were damaged; therefore, the lady requests that you send me those two gatherings so that she can complete the deficiency. The lady sends with her letters a small box or something wrapped in paper.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Basel, 20th of December, 1561.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write about.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
