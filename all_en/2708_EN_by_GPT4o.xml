      <p> Greetings. Although I have written to you, beloved son, through Johann Rudolf, since you are about to go to a place where it will not be possible to send letters as I wish (unless you find a way via Frankfurt and from there to Strasbourg to Burckher; you should appoint a certain person who will surely send the letters received to you in Strasbourg and will ensure those received in Strasbourg reach you, about which Mr. Burcher and Mr. Froschauer will assist you), I repeat the old advice. Read frequently the instruction written by my hand, fear God, pray very often, and study most diligently. Be careful not to waste any time, be frugal and thrifty, and remember that you will soon be called back; time flies like an arrow; opportunity is hairy in front but bald behind. </p>
      <p> If, however, which I think is unlikely, you cannot stay in Wittenberg or remain there comfortably, return to Marburg and write to me about all your affairs. If you do stay in Wittenberg, whether with Mr. Philipp or another honest and good host, write as soon as possible what Philipp has replied to my letters, which host you have found, at what price he has taken you in, and what lectures you are attending, what your studies are, and who your companions are. Make sure to answer each of these and also indicate how the students in Wittenberg behave towards you and what and how much... is to be paid for lodging, bed, food, and each item. Prepare a register for yourself, write down everything you have received and spent, in detail, how and for what you have spent or owe, so that you send me such enclosed according to the Frankfurt fair. Now go in the name of the Lord; may the blessing of our God be upon you, may God lead you and bring you back safe in soul and body. I commend you daily to your protector. Your mother greets and blesses you. My dear child, keep yourself godly, honorable, well, and diligent. God be with you; may He protect you faithfully, amen. Have what is imposed from me and your mother. </p>
      <p> Zurich, the last day of August 1555. </p>
      <p> Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, now either in Strasbourg or Frankfurt. </p>
