      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have not written to you for a long time, venerable and most learned lord and godfather, but not without reasons; partly because there was no leisure due to the plague somewhat raging among us, which has brought us considerable troubles, and partly because messengers were not always readily available. Nor was there any particularly necessary matter, since there is nothing new with us that you are not already aware of. I, being aware of your occupations, do not willingly trouble you with empty words. However, it was pleasing, indeed most pleasing, to receive from you those things which were reported to you as new from friends everywhere, part of which I now send back to you through this letter, giving thanks as much as I can.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about the condition and salary of Mr. Musculus, our dear godfather, it seems to you that a response is most necessary at present. This matter presses me greatly, more than anyone would believe. For I know what the dignity and excellence of such a man deserve; I also know what the management of such a large family requires.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I am burned by the barbaric stinginess of our people, so that I hardly know what or how to act in this matter. I have spoken not only with Mr. Treasurer Haller about this, who seems to favor this man and me more than all the other members of the senatorial order. But he, not unaware of the judgments of others, is equally burdened as I am, while he cannot conveniently accomplish what he wishes; for he cannot and is not allowed to do this privately with authority, to add anything to his pension, and publicly he does not see how it can be proposed without much contradiction and offense. For there are some who do not embrace him with a whole heart because he wrote somewhat doubtfully about the sacramental cause (although now he could not speak or think more clearly about it), nor are there lacking among our colleagues those who still criticize him for that reason. Others, not recognizing the benefit that such a man brings to the whole church, since he never or very rarely preaches publicly, think it is almost in vain whatever is spent on him, utterly profane and barbaric men. A third group even hates all foreigners so much that they think it is wrong whatever good is done to them. Therefore, since such are the judgments even among the senators, you would not believe how difficult it is to move this cause, especially when it is said that he now has a greater salary than either Berchtold or anyone else ever had, except me. Therefore, the treasurer hesitates, I hesitate, and in the meantime, we strive to compensate with extraordinary benefits what he does not receive regularly, and at the same time, we seize every opportunity to act, if perhaps a public increase of his salary might be made. And now there is some opportunity at hand, which I hope we will use most conveniently, namely, that he is now dedicating his Commentaries on the Psalms to our senate, through which occasion we will try to accomplish something. In the meantime, however, it might not be useless if you write to the treasurer, Hagius, or others and sharply prick their ears, so that they may appear with more prepared minds for this occasion. As for my increase, it would never have been obtained if they had not been driven by almost the greatest necessity, nor was the least reason why I refused the continuation of my ministry in this church, because I saw that this increase would not be established without difficulty and offense.</p>
      <p>But if another better counsel, another more convenient way of acting appears to you, suggest it to me, and as much as it is in me, I will strive so that this man, more precious than any price, does not lack what is sought. These things about him.</p>
      <p>As for the plague, it is almost always the same, it does not rage, yet it takes away some from time to time. A certain noble matron from Erlach also died these days, the mother-in-law of Christoph von MÃ¼linen, who had previously died with his wife. Mr. Fenner Wagner also died, but not from the plague. This serves us to be more prepared for the coming of the Lord and to gird ourselves, thinking about the good will of the Lord towards us.</p>
      <p>The people of Lausanne have been silent for a long time now. Hear a remarkable fact about Calvin, which Antonius Schorus, a most learned man, who was expelled from Heidelberg and came to Lausanne and resides there, reading with great applause, writes to Theobaldus Niger, minister of the church of Strasbourg, in these words: "Greetings. I forgot what I thought to write to you about Calvin, from which you may infer the constancy and spirit of our churches and ministers. On Tuesday, when Calvin had spoken much about idolatry, he did not want to descend from the pulpit until a certain rich idolater, who had come from St. Claude with a child whom he had brought for baptism, had left the temple and entrusted the task to another. This was accomplished with great contention, because he was one of the best citizens of Geneva, as good men are called today." Thus he. This act is celebrated as Ambrosian constancy. Farellus in his frequent letters to me never fails to make the most honorable mention of you and always asks that whenever I write to you, I greet you in his name.</p>
      <p>That Bohemian prince, whom you recommended to us a few weeks ago, found such favor here that he was honored by the lords with 15 florins. From here he went to Basel; what they think of him there, I do not yet know. He seemed not bad to us; for he found here some who knew the camps and dominions in Bohemia and Moravia, over which he said he had presided.</p>
      <p>My wife has again blessed me with a daughter through a happy birth, making me the parent of five children now. She greets you and yours, whom you should also greet most lovingly from me; all our people also greet you, Mr. Treasurer, with whom I was away these days three miles from the city on an estate of his son-in-law, having returned only the day before, Musculus, Jodocus, Weberus, Eberhardus, and others, especially also Mr. Nikolaus von Wittenbach, etc. Farewell happily in the Lord. Bern, October 22, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
