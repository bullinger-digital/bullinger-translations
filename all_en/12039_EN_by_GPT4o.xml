      <p>Most excellent man and my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>I have received news from Swiss and Italian friends, which follows: That the war in Piedmont will come to a standstill this month at the request of the French. That the war in France was also settled by the most illustrious Don Ferrante Gonzaga and Lord Granvelle on the side of the Emperor, and by the most illustrious Admiral and the great Chancellor of France on the side of the most Christian King of the French, if it pleases both majesties to ratify what was done by their ministers within a three-day period. Meanwhile, in a skirmish or encounter (Geplänkel, Scharmützel), as it is commonly called, Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, a captain of the Emperor, was captured and brought to the city of Paris. It is said that peace has been made between the most Christian King of the French and the most serene King of England.</p>
      <p>I wish to know whether you have similar or different news, and I wholeheartedly commend myself to you always.</p>
      <p>Bremgarten, 19th of September 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Giovanni Domenico Panizzone.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and my most esteemed lord, Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
