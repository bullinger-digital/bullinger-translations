      <p>S. D. in Christo. Reverend man, behold, your stipendiaries return to you with testimony that they lived honorably among us, and if it were not for this unrest in Germany, which I believe is the reason for their recall, it would have been pleasing to us for them to have adorned our lecture halls with their presence for a longer time.</p>
      <p>What is happening in Straßburg and what rumors are being spread here about the warlike movements of the King of France and the confederate princes, they will report more conveniently than I can write at present. D. Sledanus, the envoy of the republic, has returned home from Trento; however, our theologians and those from Württemberg still remain, perhaps until the first of May. It would have been much more pleasing to the adversaries if no learned men from Germany had come at all; so the council would have already had a gap, and they, if it pleases the gods, would have prostituted their anathemas as victors. Our people request that all articles be resumed in order, which the safe conduct also seems to promise, or if they refuse this, that the confession of Brenz presented be examined in order according to the norm of Scripture. Perhaps they will obtain neither. The Württembergers and our people are together in one lodging; no one from Saxony is present. For Philip did not come beyond Nuremberg and wrote to a certain friend that he could write not only letters but entire books about his pains. On the day before Easter vigil, a herald came to Zabern from the King of France and requested provisions for the approaching army; he recounted the benefits conferred on the bishop by the king's parent with an enumeration of the bishop's ingratitude and that he could indeed avenge it with sword and fire and that by right for the received injuries; but when he comes for the salvation and freedom of Germany, he does not wish to at present. This is the state of our neighborhood. May Almighty Jesus turn all things to the glory of His name. Amen. Farewell well and greet the choir of the best and most learned men among you, especially Pellicanus.</p>
      <p>If hereafter our school can do something pleasing for your youth, we offer our service. In Straßburg on the day of the processions, which was the second of Easter in the year 52.</p>
      <p>Your Caspar Hedio.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed.</p>
      <p>The last of Mr. Caspar Hedio of Straßburg.</p>
