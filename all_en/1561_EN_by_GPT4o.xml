      <p>If you are well, I am glad; I am also well, and our prince is in good health. I sent his letter to you on the day before the Nones of January to be delivered by courier to Zurich. Whether they were delivered correctly, I do not know; I certainly have strong doubts, since winter navigation is already unpleasant in itself, and because it is a widespread fault among such people to be either negligent or completely untrustworthy; therefore, I thought it necessary to rewrite them for your sake.</p>
      <p>You will learn much from the letters, which I sent to you three times after Stumphius left us; I do not doubt, my dearest father, that you will find them pleasing and welcome, as they convey the goodwill of the leading men towards you, which I have reported. I will strive and endeavor to ensure that this friendship between you grows and is preserved more and more each day. Indeed, I hold you dearer every day, and your truly great merits sharpen my concerns daily, lest I lose anything from your love or judgment. A persistent rumor has been circulating for several days that John Cheke, a knight of the realm and tutor to the royal majesty, is to be appointed Chancellor of England at this council: the Bishop of Ely is only temporarily fulfilling this office until another is permanently appointed to that honor by Parliament. I would like you to write diligently to him; for he is especially fond of and devoted to you, and is a man of the highest esteem and dignity: you will certainly not lack a topic. He alone, and almost solely with Treherne, has always been the author of our safety.</p>
      <p>Then, having been brought to Cox by your recommendation, he received my people from Ulm very kindly and courteously at the royal court. Afterwards, he willingly affirmed that he would take care to defend and support Alexander's studies with the Earl of Warwick. You have already received the full and complete title of the Earl of Warwick; he now only asks that you fulfill your promises, which I strongly and repeatedly urge you to strive for and accomplish, for I have convinced myself that you can. It is a matter of great importance and weight, which you will easily consider with your utmost prudence. You will have acted most rightly (believe me) if you write to him as diligently as possible at the upcoming fair, in which you singularly offer him your support and effort, and thank him for his benevolence towards you: in all these matters, you will carefully compose what seems to pertain to the dignity of such a great prince.</p>
      <p>So much for this. Peter Martyr is still in London, playing his part in establishing sacred laws. His book has not yet been delivered: the Byrkmanns are most deceitful. The prince's daughter has recovered from a great and dangerous illness. She is now producing wonderful things, which will soon come to light with your praise. A great treasure of excellent books has been discovered in these days: Basil on Isaiah and the Psalms in Greek, and several other writings, or rather fragments, of the same author; Chrysostom on the Gospels in Greek; the complete Proclus; Porphyry and Plotinus, the Platonists. I saw all these books myself today. It remains now that you, most esteemed father in Christ, may be well, and forgive the rusticity of my letters; for I wrote in haste, and was greatly hindered by serious matters. Oxford, 5 February 1552.</p>
      <p>Your disciple and son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>Include all letters with mine, especially Cheke's: if I do not succeed in having you receive letters from the Earl of Warwick, do not trust me any longer.</p>
      <p>Title befitting the dignity of the Earl of Warwick: To the most illustrious prince and lord, Sir John Dudley, the most powerful Duke of Northumberland or Northumbrians, Earl of Warwick, Lord of Lisle, chief counselor and prince of the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and France.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Suffolk, his daughter, Haddon, Elmer, and Scinner have written to you, all of whose letters I have sent to you, as I showed above. Oglethorpe, doctor and vice-chancellor of this academy, eagerly awaits your letters, as does Harding, a man of absolute learning.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Sir Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>From the Duke of Suffolk.</p>
