      <p>Paolo Gaddi of Cremona to Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, greetings through Jesus Christ our Lord. In recent days, most learned Bullinger, I received letters from those citizens of Cremona, whom you know well, and I believe you have already understood that the Lord has favored the business I conducted while I was there. Now indeed, I give infinite thanks to the most good and great God for the great providence and divine guidance, which He has deigned to show us from the beginning and throughout the course of this matter up to this day, and not without some degree of perfection; nor is there any doubt that He, who has begun such a work, will also bring it to completion. On behalf of all those pious people, who so anxiously asked me to do this, I collectively thank you and at the same time inform you that your letters have brought them such great consolation that it can scarcely be expressed in a thousand words. I therefore ask you through Jesus Christ, not to fail, whenever the opportunity arises and it is convenient for you, to both encourage and inspire them to the service of Christ. I especially and repeatedly ask you to do this, if that paternal love, which you have always shown, has any strength in you, and you will have done me a great favor if you write back as soon as possible and also give me letters to those brothers, the content of which should be: that you greatly rejoice that they receive the word of God so cheerfully and with unbroken spirit and that your letters are embraced with open arms; but that this is the sum of Christian matters, that they continue on the path they have begun and keep themselves pure from all impiety. In your letters, you will confess that you are entirely devoted to them, and make them more certain of how much their progress is dear to my heart (of which you yourself are the best witness).</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us with your family for His glory and the benefit of the church. Augustin Mainardi, minister of the church in Chiavenna, with whom I live, sends you many greetings. The rest, which the brevity of the letters does not allow, you will learn from the most upright man Mario. Farewell, most illustrious man, and love your Paul through Him, who alone can grant salvation and immortality. Greet the most learned young man Zwingli in my name. In Chiavenna, 28 October 1553.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, to be honored as a father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
