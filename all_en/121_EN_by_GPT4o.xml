      <p>My willing service beforehand, especially favorable, dear lord and good friend. I have received your letter along with those of the church wardens and the community church members in Schwanden in the land of Glarus and have understood its contents, regarding how the aforementioned community earnestly requests and desires that I release Mr. Lorenz from his duty and service, which he has discussed with me, and not withdraw him from their church service. Now, I have summoned him properly, as is appropriate, and have adhered to his promise up to this point, and have also reassured the church, which he was supposed to serve, to some extent. Therefore, it is most burdensome for me, because it is the opinion in Glarus that he did not inform me of this and did not delay until the time he himself, according to his promise, should have come. Considering all this, I would not have released him from his duty in any way. However, since I have understood from your letter that for the sake of the honor of God and the welfare of the church, it is better and more beneficial that the aforementioned Mr. Lorenz remains unchanged in his position, and since you also, whom I cannot refuse anything, so earnestly request, I will this time release and free him from all his promises and duties, in the hope that the Lord God will appoint another for my church.</p>
      <p>I thank you most sincerely for your faithful compassion and Christian comfort, which you have shown me in the sorrow that has befallen me on account of my son, and I pray to the Lord God that He may strengthen and comfort us all in all adversity and sorrow.</p>
      <p>The recent news, which you have written to me, although not entirely favorable for us, I have nevertheless gladly received. These princes undertake high matters in their counsels; but the Lord God, who sees, knows when He will overthrow these giants. May the Lord God grant us all His grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Brugg, the 14th of May in the year 1548.</p>

      <p>To the faithful, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, etc., my favorable, dear lord and trusted friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
