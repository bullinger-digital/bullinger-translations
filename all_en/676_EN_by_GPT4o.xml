      <p>Grace and Peace from Christ our Savior and Lord.</p>
      <p>We have again received, most distinguished and esteemed brothers, the explanation and declaration of Mr. Johannes Calvin, our most beloved brother, concerning the sacramental matter, which you also rightly approve with your consent. For since he was accused by some of a certain dissension or variation from your doctrine, among whom your authority was more illustrious, he justly and piously cleared himself before you, so that the offense might be removed and troubled minds might be calmed and pacified. Now indeed, since Mr. Johannes Calvin has never (as far as we know) had any controversies against us, nor is he compelled concerning it, we will therefore strive to retain sincere brotherhood and love with him, and no less with Mr. Guillaume Farel and the rest of their brothers in the bond of peace indivisibly through Christ's grace, because we detest and abhor nothing more seriously than disturbances and dissensions in the matters of Christ. We therefore congratulate you and ourselves on the sincerity and agreement of such excellent brothers. For whoever would dissent from you in doctrine, we could not agree with him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we also unanimously approve this explanation of Mr. Johannes Calvin with our vote and support, and we confess, acknowledge, and praise it as pious, correct, and sound. We also urge and pray that they may persist, proceed, and not deviate in this opinion without tergiversation (if they have ever varied from it, which we do not know), which certainly would be most desirable for us for the common growth of the churches of Christ, so that every suspicion of discord, which perhaps troubled and held some weaker ones anxious and in suspense, may be completely removed from hearts. Therefore, we blame nothing in this agreement, we criticize nothing, nor do we censure anything. But as for the publication, we have previously written to you why we do not consider it very fruitful at this troubled time, because it is quite free for the papists to attack anything pious, and we leave it to you to consider how free it is for us to publish exact responses to their vanities. But if your mind is entirely inclined in this way, we defer and permit the publication to your judgment: for we are so far from opposing or prescribing to you that we rather embrace and venerate your judgment, persuaded that you, supported by stronger reasons, will do nothing in this matter than what pertains to the public utility of the churches of Christ. Furthermore, you have understood from our previous letters why we cannot subscribe. Nor is there anything for us to complain or hesitate about any absurd doctrine or any other offense, so you should not suspect anything: for we have indicated in previous writings what hinders us. For it would not be fitting for public ministry persons to publish anything in such a broad matter, which pertains to all, without public consent. But if it pleases you to proceed with publishing, as it pertains only to you, behold, we will neither delay nor impede. As far as we are concerned, I say, it will be freely allowed, nor will we disapprove, desiring that you be satisfied with this simple but candid opinion of ours, whom we will always embrace and venerate integrally through Christ, who may deign to protect and promote you in His grace: whom we will also implore with mutual prayers for the growth of the churches.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed brothers, and hold us in your commendation. Bern, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your devoted pastors and readers, ministers of the Bernese church, most dedicated brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful ministers of Christ and the church, pastors and teachers of the ZÃ¼rich church, our most venerable and beloved lords and brothers.</p>
