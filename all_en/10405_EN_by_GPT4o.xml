      <p>My entire inclined, good will always beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, a community from Rafz has appeared before me and complained that Johann Gumprecht, their preacher, has been engaging in all sorts of excessive behavior. Specifically, within the past year, he once traveled to Schaffhausen, and when he arrived there, he drank so much that on his way home, he lay down by the roadside, and everything ran out of him, for which I fined him 5 pounds on behalf of my lords.</p>
      <p>Secondly, a community from Wil recently transported wood from my lords' forest to Eglisau. And when they were on their way back home, he found a dead bird on the road and said to his companions: "I want to use this bird for something at dinner." And when they got home, they ate together at night, and when it came to the end of the meal, he pulled the dead bird out of his pocket, and one of them made a bet with him that if he could eat the raw dead bird with the feathers entirely and not bring it back up, they would pay for the meal. But if he brought it back up, he would have to pay for the meal. So he ate the bird and kept it down. Then Johann and his companion had to pay for the meal and gave 11 pence for it, for which I will also take action against him at the next court session. Furthermore, he has become a weaver and practices his craft diligently, also buying goods alongside it, for which he has more diligence than for studying, from which such behavior and ignorance cause the church in Rafz more annoyance than they receive benefit and fruit from his teaching. I wanted to write this to you with good intentions and ask you to handle this matter in the best way, as I trust you. If I could earn such a thing from you, I will always be found willing.</p>
      <p>Dated on Tuesday afternoon in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kambli, bailiff of Eglisau.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my particularly gracious lord.</p>
