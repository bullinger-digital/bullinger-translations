      <p>Mr. Johann Hoffman, the colonel with the king and no less esteemed by His Majesty than Granvela by the Emperor's Majesty, to whom the king gave 25,000 florins annually 10 years ago, and perhaps now gives much more, was asked by a person well known to me to read a little in the New Testament every day; the person wanted to give him a very nice gift for it, to which he sighed deeply, looked up to heaven, struck his chest, and said: "Oh, God forbid that I should read anything in such books all my life; for it is not for me and my kind."</p>
      <p>From this, one can well deduce the lord's disposition, since the colonel and dearest servant is so arranged and misled.</p>
      <p>Serious negotiations are ongoing with the Turk for another two-year truce. What is achieved will soon be known; yet the Turk continues with his armament.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's Majesty is having a great deal of artillery cast, which can be moved and, if necessary, also pulled by hand. Someone has brought forth a new invention, and it is such that it can be brought into all the mountains; it is not known whether it is intended against the Turk or otherwise.</p>
      <p>The king's people and household are mostly deranged; the king must remain with the Emperor's Majesty; they say he has become terribly and severely ill, but once in God's name, such a deathly sick man must plague the whole world.</p>
      <p>The king has had all his children taken away from Innsbruck; what that means, there are all sorts of speculations.</p>
      <p>Count Nikolaus of Salm, the king's chief in Hungary, and also three other very prominent Hungarian lords, who were entirely loyal to the king and dearly loved by him, have died, causing great sorrow at the court.</p>
      <p>The monk is in Vienna and very well back with the king, who has caused such great distress in many ways.</p>
      <p>Count Wilhelm of Nassau has now justified the old claims to Hesse for a while and has now won a case, gaining about fifteen tons of gold with principal property and improved rents, etc. The young landgrave must give it up, and yet not all matters have been settled, where it is suspected he will win none.</p>
      <p>Regarding Schertlin, I am written to that it is certainly true that those from Zurich have offered him to withdraw; they want to give him protection and shelter. However, this does not seem credible to me and many other people for various reasons; I ask you to inform me about this, as much is being talked about it.</p>
