      <p>Honorable and especially gracious lord and trusted friend, my diligent services are always at your disposal. I have received your kind letter, dated January 21, along with the enclosed booklet, and I thank you very kindly for it; I will compare it with other matters in due time.</p>
      <p>I cannot inform you with certainty about the death of Mr. Johann Laski, as the person who informed me might have been mistaken and meant Johannes a Lasco. However, I will inquire further into the matter, as I expect Caspar Bauchen's brother-in-law to arrive from Königsberg soon, and whatever I learn from him, I will inform you. During my business trip from Lyon, I had a great desire to visit you, but due to the inconvenience of the weather and company, it was not possible this time. However, when my journey allows, I will undoubtedly visit you, although I have planned this trip in such a way that I hope not to travel there within a year. God has the power, and although I am far from you in person, we are together in spirit, for I feel all Christian love from you; may God keep us in this.</p>
      <p>Know that I have not been attacked for some time because of the Christian faith, although some of our preachers rage and incite the authorities. However, our honorable council has put the examination to rest, as all sorts of evils were to be expected from it, as they have enough examples in other countries. May God continue to share His grace with them through Jesus Christ; there are many good-hearted people here who would like to see a Christian reformation.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Elector and Count Palatine, he has returned home from Amberg and stayed overnight two miles away in our lord's territory, for which two council members were appointed to honor him according to the Empire's order.</p>
      <p>Thus, during the evening meal, the matters of religion were discussed, and our lords kindly requested that they deal with their preachers so that they lay aside all bitterness in their sermons against their fellow brothers in the Netherlands, France, and other places. Otherwise, all sorts of Christian conversations were held, which the mentioned lords particularly enjoyed, given their great and high understanding, hoping that such conversations will bring much benefit and fruit among us.</p>
      <p>As the common saying goes, his Electoral Highness has established some schools in Amberg, as well as appointed his preachers to preach daily and practice other Christian ceremonies. May God have mercy on us and share His Holy Spirit with us so that we may come to true understanding. Amen.</p>
      <p>Concerning the war in Thuringia, there is concern that if it is not settled, a great fire will break out and spread far: nothing special has been accomplished yet. Duke Johann Friedrich insists on his demand, as can be seen in his writings, which have been published. I have managed to obtain such copies with great difficulty, as they have been forbidden to be distributed; therein you will learn the whole matter. The nobility does not want to act rightly and oppose Grumbach and his associates; whatever further developments occur, I will inform you later. On the 25th of the past month, they were supposed to have started fortifying before Gotha, and they are excellently preparing for defense.</p>
      <p>From your letter, I have learned that Spain is heavily arming with Italian and Sicilian troops to take its course towards Piedmont and Savoy, and then into Burgundy and Brabant. It will indeed be close to the people of Geneva and the lords of Bern, for which they must be well-prepared; for I believe that this move is mainly aimed at Geneva, thinking that if Geneva were conquered, the Calvinist faith (as they call it) would completely fall, and thus Geneva would suffer the first blow. But everything is in God's hands.</p>
      <p>That the lords of Bern are preparing for war, they are doing wisely, and I can well imagine that it will be a general Swiss campaign. - King Philip has summoned his provisions in the Empire, and there is enough money available, but whether the princes of the Empire will support such a campaign, time will tell. If those in the Netherlands are defeated, it might also affect us; may God have mercy on His Christian church for the sake of His holy name. Amen.</p>
      <p>I also kindly ask that if there is anything new with you, you inform me of it as time permits. I am ready to serve you again. It is also quietly said here that His Majesty has made peace with the Turks and Weida, but the conditions are still unknown. However, His Imperial Majesty is calling for another Imperial Diet, which is to be held on March 25 in Regensburg, and the common saying is that after the Empire granted him a powerful Turkish campaign at the last Diet in Augsburg, to be paid in three years, he now desires to extend this approval to one year, presumably because once he has the money, there will be peace. Nothing else for now. Please be greeted from me and let me be at your service; with that, I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High. Dated in Nuremberg, February 4, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
