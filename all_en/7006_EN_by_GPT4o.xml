      <p>Greetings. I know you are expecting my letters and wondering why I have not written for such a long time. But it was not for lack of will; rather, it was due to the absence of couriers; otherwise, I would have written long ago. Our courier, who brought me your last letters, although he was instructed by Lord von Bonstetten (who sent him there) to meet with me before he left, did not do so, and I could not find anyone else in the meantime who was traveling to you. Meanwhile, I have received letters from you once and again, to which I will now respond all at once. First, regarding the Scottish letters, I sent them to my friend Blasius in Lausanne along with letters to Mr. Beza, so I believe he has already received them; I had written either to you or to my brother that I had received them. As for Johannes Heinrich Musculus, he is still alive and has recovered from the plague, which he had also contracted; he is diligent, and if he continues in this way, he will not disappoint his father and brother Abraham. As for what you wish to know about Muralto, the situation is as follows: Lord von MÃ¼linen has a daughter, with whom he was so infatuated that he could not conceal it; thus, it was soon on everyone's lips; he also ingratiated himself with the girl as much as he could. After I learned of this, I diligently advised him to be cautious; for he would be dealing not with ordinary people, but with the most powerful in this city, the girl's father and grandfather, Consul Negelin; therefore, he should consider what he was doing and be mindful of his reputation, fortune, and life. He refrained as much as he could until she left with Mr. Anton Tillyer, who also has Consul Negelin's daughter, to the prefecture of Gaien, which is near Geneva. From that time, after she was removed from his sight, the fervor of his love began to subside. Although it is rumored by some that he gave her his word, he denies it and I cannot believe it happened. Otherwise, he performs his duties, and his surgical endeavors, to which he is devoted, are not unsuccessful. Therefore, his mother should not be worried about him.</p>
      <p>Regarding the latest letters, I return to you the letters of Montius, Erastus, and Ursinus and thank you for them. How furiously that Luther-demon rages! I fear he will bring great harm to the Belgian churches and their cause. Please write what was concluded at Ulm; if the Spaniard is prohibited from passing through there, we will have him in our parts. Some here assert with certainty that the Persian is waging war against the Turk and that Maximilian will have peace and send his soldiers to the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>If you have learned anything about Gotha, please share it as well. Regarding the expedition, I do not know what to do; I would gladly suffer if my lords wrote more to yours. But here, they are so pressed and reserved that they do not do what they must for the sake of honor. They also do not like to be reminded of these matters. Steiger would gladly do it; he does not succeed in it; I do not know where else it falls. Perhaps it was thought that Zurich would also be at Solothurn. Whatever I can do to serve the peace of both cities, I do not neglect; but I also often see that it is better not to think much than to stir much. I often thank God that the two cities with their territories do not border each other and have nothing to divide among themselves. Otherwise, there is nothing new about the expedition; it remains as it was; only what has been lost and changed through death has been replaced. The day at Solothurn was short; the Fribourgers never stayed overnight there. The Frenchman has barely made the request in the name of the king for the 6000, and they were willing, and it was thought it would proceed. More than one hundred and fifty captains were there, as I hear, all eager for service; but the Frenchman has not yet appointed any until further instructions from the king. Thus, it is postponed for a month, saving so much money, and it is thought that the request was made so early only to prevent it from going to the Spaniard. My lords have disclosed their expedition, why they are doing it, so that no one thinks they have something else in mind. Now they are meeting at Fribourg; Bern, Valais, and Fribourg are together regarding the new land.</p>
      <p>I do not yet know if Geneva is also there or not, and they are negotiating an understanding and agreement regarding the land, how they will conduct themselves on all sides, whatever may happen. I cannot yet know what will be decided. Otherwise, we have nothing special. On the 6th of this month, the wife of my lord Schultheiss Steiger died, after being ill for almost a year and a half; he now lives alone without wife and child. The lord intends to remarry. He sends you many greetings, as do my other lords in general, also young lord Ludwig Zehender, my brother-in-law, mother, wife, Musculus, and others. I commend to you my son, whom I hear has come to you; please add your admonitions to encourage him towards virtue and diligence. I will allow him to stay with you for some time to study theology; afterwards, if the Lord wills, I will send him to France, provided it is at peace.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Mr. Gwalther and all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 24, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
