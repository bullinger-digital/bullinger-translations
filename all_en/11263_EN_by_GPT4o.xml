    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings. Hopes that Euander remains in Kempten despite difficulties. Bucer has returned from Hesse and Saxony; further details are not yet known. Zwick has not yet seen Thomas [...] from Leuven, recommended by Leo [Jud]. That Michael [Back?] is doing well in Austria is also confirmed by [Balthasar von] Kuenring, but the spread of the Gospel is being hindered by the princes. Requests to share the news about Michael with Leo [Jud] as well.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write to you beyond greetings; however, these greetings are from all the brothers, especially Ambrosius, Konrad, and our consul Thomas. They all wish you well.</p>
      <p>I heard some time ago that Euander would not remain in Kempten; I did not hear the reason until now from you, and I can easily believe that the good man is troubled there, yet I would not want the school in Kempten to be deprived of him.</p>
      <p>Bucer has returned from Hesse and Saxony these days; we do not yet know what news he brings with him.</p>
      <p>Leo recently recommended to me a certain Thomas from Leuven; but I have not seen the man anywhere.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote about my Michael being well in Austria; in the meantime, Kuenring also writes the same. But what hope is there for the progress of the Gospel when kings and princes persecute it? But what am I saying, as if the kingdom of Christ does not advance despite the opposition of emperors!</p>
      <p>But farewell with the whole household. January 27, 1539.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo in many ways in my name and inform him of what I wrote here about Michael.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest of brothers.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
