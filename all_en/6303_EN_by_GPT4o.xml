      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, dearest father, and they would have filled me with the greatest joy if they had not been mixed with the mention of your new sorrow at the end. For I was rejoicing that I received your letters again, which I had once despaired of ever receiving again; but I was grieved when I learned at the same time of the death of your dearest daughter Margaretha and the new wound you received from her funeral.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I deeply sympathize with you and pray to the Lord that, content with these, He may continue to protect you and yours and not add other sorrows to these henceforth.</p>
      <p>As for us, we are still safe in our family by the grace of the Lord; concerning others, the plague is moderately spreading throughout the city. Two of your townsmen were also seized by this disease the day before yesterday, who were living with Mr. Valentin Ampelandrus, Musculus' son-in-law, namely Amandus Fischer and Samuel Fattli. We do not yet know what the Lord intends for them; they lack no care otherwise, and they are well convinced of the salvation and grace of God in Christ. Along with them, two other fellow townsmen are also ill in the college.</p>
      <p>May the Lord help them all! Whatever I can do for them, I do. No one else of note has been seized yet.</p>
      <p>Many are dying throughout the countryside.</p>
      <p>May the Lord turn away His wrath from us and thus be propitious to our sins.</p>
      <p>I have carefully handled all your letters and all those to whom you wrote express great thanks and congratulate themselves, you, and the church on your recovery. Diesbach himself wrote; Treasurer Haller wants me to inform you that he deeply sympathizes with you for the loss of your Christian wife and daughter and gives you the greatest thanks for remembering him so diligently in this illness of yours and in your prayers, and he prays that you do not cease to commend him to the grace of God; he will likewise do the same for you.</p>
      <p>I sent your letters to Beza through Liner from St. Gallen. As for the copy of Lafater's sermon, I thank you; many copies of these were sold here at this fair.</p>
      <p>May the Lord also continue to protect him! As for new matters, we have nothing. All is silent; there are hardly any conversations except about the plague raging everywhere.</p>
      <p>We hear that the French will hold another assembly in Freiburg to renew the alliance; however, we have not yet heard what day they have set.</p>
      <p>What our people will do, I still do not know; however, I am in good hope that they will be cautious, especially since they see the Lord already waging war with us.</p>
      <p>I have also written down my thoughts requested by some and send them to you to inspect and correct; I refer to your arguments everywhere else.</p>
      <p>My father-in-law, friends and brothers, my wife, and mother all greet you and yours. Pray to the Lord for us; we will also pray for you.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 15, 1564.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>Fischer died last night; Fattli is still ill; may the Lord have mercy on him! To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, lord and compatriot, to be honored by me with the greatest respect always.</p>
