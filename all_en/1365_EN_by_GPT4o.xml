      <p>Strasbourg, 3rd August 1551.</p>
      <p>Greetings in the Lord and a blessed life! Two days ago, I arranged for letters addressed to you, which I had received from England, to be sent to Basel via the merchant Valentin Nußboum through a messenger from Constance. Yesterday, I safely received the ones you sent through Frisius and forwarded them to Mr. Hooper via the courier. However, since it is not without expenses to send letters back and forth, it would be considerate of you to take this into account. Five ounces are charged by the cross-bearers from Speyer to Antwerp; not to mention the messenger's fee from here to Speyer, which, if the letter is slightly larger, is usually not less than a batz. Thus, people here are so devoted to profit that they forget about generosity and duty; they will do nothing without immediately shouting for money, money: so much so that they sometimes disdain a fair reward, and unless you give according to the whim of the demander, they will refuse the letters. I would not want to trouble you in this matter if there were not such a great volume of letters being sent from all sides. I promise my service, faithfulness, and diligence, and I will not refuse any effort in finding a messenger. However, in the future, I will include the expenses in the accounts, which I will send to you when convenient. I know you do not wish for my loss. Therefore, I will gift you the cost of those I sent, gladly, knowing that you have considered my country and its good. For those you send in the future, I will note the weight and cost if you wish them to be sent by courier. But if you write that I should send them by the next opportunity without cost, they will be kept longer; however, they could be sent at most once a month.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you receive letters from others to be sent by courier, accept the courier's fee along with them. This is what I thought to write to you about the letters: now to other matters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Martyr has published a book on the Eucharist, to which he has added his disputation with our Oxford colleagues. If I can conveniently do so, I will send this book to you. Our English have celebrated the praises of the late Bucer both in verse and prose.</p>
      <p>Would that you had seen the zeal and piety in whatever merit; and so that you may see, I have enclosed a booklet for them. Bucer's death brings a great benefit of concord to England. The English nobles desire a man no less learned than he to take his place: I desire one more sincere and stable than he. If you know someone worthy of such a burden, let me know. I do not doubt that he could easily be promoted to such a height with the help of some whom I know and who have spoken with me on this matter. Whoever it will be will not lack friends and honor; however, as truth usually has hatred as its inseparable companion, he will expect nothing but evil from the wicked. Consult for our country and religion, if you can. There is a place for a learned man, if he is on our side. Truth has prevailed. I hear nothing certain about the Magdeburgers. England is peaceful. A pestilent sweat, called the English sweat, has invaded the Londoners. Over nine hundred have died in a single week: but by God's favor, the plague and divine wrath have now ceased. May the Lord grant us His grace! Greet your wife, children, and all learned and pious people diligently.</p>
      <p>Yours, J. B.</p>
      <p>A friend from Cologne wrote to me today that the Magdeburgers have broken out and achieved a great victory; so much so that they have obtained a great supply of all kinds of food from the enemies.</p>
      <p>It is certainly reported here that the Magdeburgers deceived the enemies with a marvelous stratagem on June 15th. They sent out young men dressed in women's clothes to gather herbs: they added a garrison of soldiers. The opposing side, believing they were truly maidens, made an attack, as if certain of the prey, and made an incursion. The maidens feigned flight: the garrison hurried to defend them. Finally, the young men, casting off their disguise, revealed themselves as armed: they attacked the enemy and drove them into flight. Eight hundred of Maurice's soldiers fell. After this victory, somewhat emboldened, they attacked the enemy again; where they brought back the bodies of the Magdeburgers killed, filling three or four carts into the city. However, it is reported that no less than five hundred of the enemies were killed. This is reported by a messenger who came here from Magdeburg. Please share this with my friend Mr. Sebastian.</p>
      <p>To the honorable wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my kind lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
