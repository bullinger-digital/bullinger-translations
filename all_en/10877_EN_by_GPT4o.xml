    <p xml:id="regest1">Is surprised that Myconius does not let anything be heard from him. Complains about the greed for money among the Swiss; Zürich has indeed taken measures against mercenary service, but Bern, through its support for the French king, antagonizes the emperor. Inquires about the meeting in Eisenach. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have either become an enemy from a most friendly person, which I fear less, trusting in your humanity, or you are unwell and cannot write. For how else could it be that you have not written for such a long time? But the messengers are hindered, the occasion, leisure, and business impede. Indeed, I have nothing to write at present, except that I am miserably tormented by the grave sorrow over this sacred hunger for gold, by which I see the Swiss people suffering. Our freedom, homeland, religion, and what not, are for sale. The people of Zürich are taking utmost care and excessive expenses to ensure that neither the French nor the Emperor's parties are followed by our city or countryside. Indeed, few have yet surrendered themselves to military service with violated public faith. What will happen, I do not know. I hope for the best. As for the people of Bern, I do not know what to expect. I know this, that they will have the Emperor as their most hostile enemy, and they would have had him more placable if they had not joined the French parties.</p>
      <p>What do you have to say about the meeting in Eisenach?</p>
      <p>Farewell now, most sincere of friends.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 8th of June, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You will greet the most outstanding man, Simon Grynaeus, who is very dear to me.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the Basel church, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
