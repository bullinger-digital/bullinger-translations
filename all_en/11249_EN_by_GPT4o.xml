    <p xml:id="regest1">Received a letter and scholarship on December 9th through Bernhard Setzstab and thanks for it. He himself is also surprised by the expenses he incurs in Strasbourg. He is touched that Bullinger wants to take him in, but he would like to stay in Strasbourg until the [spring] fair because of Sturm's lectures on dialectics and hopes for his advice afterwards. Martin Peyer wishes for him to accompany him to Wittenberg; looking at Otto [Werdm√ºller], one can see the benefits of staying at this flourishing university without fearing higher costs. In Basel, he could probably live more cheaply, but the teaching there is inadequate, and a longer stay in Strasbourg would not be good for his health; he would be better off going to England only after a stay in Wittenberg and in the company of Peyer, who is already familiar with Wittenberg. He hopes for Bullinger's consent and asks for a reply by Christmas. He has heard with joy that the promotion of education in Zurich is taken so seriously. He is reluctant to remain silent about criticism of Zurich, which is considered pro-imperial here; the people of Strasbourg sympathize with France, but not with England - perhaps because Bishop [Edward] Fox never responded to Bucer's letters; now he is said to have died. Bucer has not yet returned from Wittenberg. Gwalther sends as a gift a portrait of Sturm cast in lead and suggests having a corresponding silver medal made with the help of Reiffenstein. Greetings. He asks for the forwarding of a letter from Peyer. In return for teaching, Peyer promises him financial support; currently, he is working with him through Urbanus' grammar and Hesiod. Higher costs would only arise during the journey. Capito sends greetings to Bullinger and wanted to inform him of something, but he himself has no reliable news yet.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>On the ninth of December, most esteemed father, Bernhard Setzstab came to me, bringing your very kind letter along with a stipend of seven and a half florins. For which I give immense thanks, and there is nothing I regret more than not being able to express my gratitude adequately at this time.</p>
      <p>You complain with me about the unbearable expenses I incur, which I also recognize and often wonder how it happens that I spend so much money in such a short time; but when I calculate everything with reason, I find that what I had has vanished, even if I spend nothing in vain. I do not fear to cite as witnesses those with whom I live. For I always stay at home, never going out except for public lectures and sermons.</p>
      <p>But now I finally experience in reality, as the saying goes, "a struck fisherman is wise," and I have learned things I never believed before, namely how much expense those who intend to acquire the necessities of life among foreigners at their own expense are forced to incur. I never knew that the possession of money was so fleeting, barely momentary. For nothing is found for free in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>No one is ashamed to ask for a high price even for the smallest thing. But I have discussed these matters extensively in the letters sent to you through Quirinus, so there is no need to trouble you further now.</p>
      <p>You offer me your most friendly home with a truly paternal affection, and I cannot express how much this has moved my heart, seeing this fatherly affection burning with such ardor towards me. However, I hope to be able to stay in Strasbourg until the next Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>For I absolutely wish to learn the principles of dialectics from Sturm as my teacher. I await your advice during the fair. Now, however, I will openly reveal my plan to you, as I consider it entirely wrong to hide anything from you.</p>
      <p>At Bedrot's, I have Martin Beyer as a companion at the table and in the room, about whose integrity and sincerity of character I say nothing; for Melchior Wirz and our Otto can describe these in more detail. He, I say, intends to go to Wittenberg at the next Frankfurt fair and would like me to accompany him. I now await your advice, which I hope you will not deny me in this matter. As far as I can judge, it seems to be the best course of action for me. For when I survey the examples of others with the eyes of my mind, I find that all the students in Wittenberg, who have not allowed their talents to be ruined by neglect, have reaped a considerable harvest of studies in that academy. This is demonstrated by the admirable learning of our Otto, which he achieved with great praise through the teachings of the same school. I am inspired by Philipp's tireless diligence in lecturing and his restless zeal to help students. The study of the arts flourishes there as nowhere else, and the study of purer theology thrives and grows more and more every day. The expense, which I do not doubt you dread the most, will not be greater than in another German academy; for I can obtain annual sustenance for eighteen florins, a room for five or six, and a bed for two gold coins. Thus, calculating everything precisely, I see that the expenses in Wittenberg will not be greater than elsewhere. Therefore, these do not seem to be a concern for me.</p>
      <p>In Basel, I could perhaps live at a lower cost, but in the meantime, I would make much less progress in my studies. For there, inconsistency reigns; you will hardly find a lecturer there who either follows a certain path or continues well-begun lectures. I consider it not only useless but also harmful to stay longer in Strasbourg after the new spring; for I can hardly see how I can endure both the living conditions and the harsh climate. Nor can I see any place now that seems equally useful to me and my studies. Going to England would not be inconvenient in terms of expenses; but I know for sure that I could stay in England with much greater benefit if I first spent a year or two in Wittenberg, immersed in the study of the arts and theology, before going there. Then also my companion Martin promises to accompany me to England if I now accompany him to Wittenberg. He was also in Wittenberg before, when our Otto was engaged in studies there, so there is no danger of me arriving as a stranger with a stranger in a foreign city; for he knows the state of the city and the school, the customs of the scholars, and the institutions of the academy.</p>
      <p>Now, most beloved patron, after considering all these things, please indicate your advice to me; I hope, however, that these matters, carefully examined by you, will not displease you.</p>
      <p>Martin and I would like to have a quick response so that he can arrange his affairs with certainty. Therefore, I ask you, esteemed patron, to write your advice to me about these matters by the time of the Lord Christ's birth; for at that time, some people from Zurich will come to us for the sake of the fair, so you can have a certain message sent to me then. I am very glad that literary studies are held in such high honor and are flourishing among you, and rightly so, as I see that the most fortunate talents of the youth of Zurich are not lacking excellent cultivators.</p>
      <p>I do not contend with anyone in the name of the people of Zurich, but I press my lips with an inviting finger. But I do not think you hate them for the sake of the emperor, but rather because you seem to favor the emperor so much; for it is amazing how almost everyone here sympathizes with France. I cannot understand the reason. They have little or no favor for the English, perhaps because of Bishop [Edward] Fox, who never replied to Bucer's many letters; but he, as I hear, has passed away. Bucer has not yet returned from Wittenberg, but we expect him daily.</p>
      <p>I send you a cast image of Johannes Sturm, which I ask you to consider favorably. I send lead, for I do not have silver. But Johannes Reyfenstein can - and I hope he will not refuse - make a coin of smaller form from this image in stone, which you can then have made in silver.</p>
      <p>Consider these matters of mine favorably and receive these writings, penned with a flying pen, with a friendly heart. Please convey my most familiar greetings to your wife and mother, who have never concealed their maternal affection towards me, and to your entire family, as well as to Theodor, Pellican, and Steiner, to whom I wish that the new year may begin with happy omens and end with great joy.</p>
      <p>Please forward this letter from Martin Beyer to Schaffhausen as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most beloved father, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time. Always have your Rudolf, who loves you dearly, commended to you.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, from the house of Mr. Bedrot, who wishes you the best, December 13, 1538.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>Martin also promises me his assistance with expenses if I teach him something in Wittenberg. For now, I am teaching him Urbanus' Grammar and Hesiod.</p>
      <p>All the expenses that will be greater for me than elsewhere will only be for the journey; but if we reach there after the journey, I live there as cheaply as elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Capito also wishes you well, who would have written to you now if what he wishes to write were certain.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
