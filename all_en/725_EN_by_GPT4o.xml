      <p>Greetings. I am glad that our letters have been safely delivered to you, venerable and most beloved lord and brother Calvin.</p>
      <p>We are now awaiting your response to them. I truly understand what you feel, and I congratulate us on agreeing so beautifully in all things.</p>
      <p>It remains for the opinions of others to also be added, those of Mr. Farel and Viret. However, relying on their piety, we promise ourselves nothing less than from you yourself. May the Lord preserve us, united and joined in the most holy and complete agreement, in unanimity until the end.</p>
      <p>Mr. Robert was most commendable to me, both because of your recommendation and also because of his own virtues, which are indeed exceptional. However, I could not confer any benefit upon him.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he saw that the most ready willingness was not lacking. However, through my intercession, the young men were accepted into the trust of Mr. Johann Wolff, a fellow scholar, a man learned in Greek and Latin, liberal, civil, and diligent. I would entrust my own sons to him if I wished to trust them to other guardians or tutors. Therefore, I hope that your young men are well provided for. Each pays 20 crowns for board and all expenses, including beds, etc. But your people will explain these matters more precisely. I have also offered all my assistance to the young men. Mr. Laelius sends you his most dutiful greetings. He has written you letters and posed several questions: he therefore begs your kindness through Christ to deign to respond. I also beg you through my friendship to assist him in this matter, and to spare a little time from your studies.</p>
      <p>All the colleagues diligently greet you and all yours, wishing you all happiness, and commend themselves to your prayers.</p>
      <p>In my name, give many greetings to all yours, especially to the distinguished Mr. Jakob von Burgund, whom I ask to be commended to me. Farewell, most learned and dearest to my heart. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 29th October, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You have undoubtedly received the letters I recently wrote to you about your writing against the Interim, and what the brothers from Friesland have written about it.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most vigilant leader of the church in Geneva, his most beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
