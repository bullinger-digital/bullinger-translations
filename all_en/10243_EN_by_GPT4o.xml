    <p xml:id="regest1">The unity with the people of Strasbourg on the issue of the Lord's Supper was confirmed by the visit of Bucer and Fonzio in Basel. The people of Zurich will be able to convince themselves of this. Myconius recommends both, especially Fonzio, to the people of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Greetings. How we reached an agreement on the matter of the Eucharist, there is no need for me to write at length. You will hear abundantly from Bucer and his companion, Mr. Bartholomäus. However, I will say this one thing: Neither did they ask for anything that would deviate from our opinion, which we have held until now regarding the bread and wine of the Lord, nor did we accept anything that we had not previously held. Thus, the suspicion was removed, by which we thought the people of Strasbourg had somehow defected from us to Luther, and it became clearer with more open instruction that we truly and piously held before.</p>
      <p>It remains, therefore, for me to say who and what kind of person this companion of Bucer is: He is a Venetian by birth, formerly a Minorite and a doctor of theology, now an exile and servant of Christ, indeed learned, pious, wonderfully eloquent, and such that I do not wish to describe him to you in every way now, as you will hear him openly. Furthermore, after he came to Germany, well instructed in the Gospel, he was not satisfied with knowing what the papists now boast against the word newly restored to men, but he also diligently investigated the Lutheran faction. After he found things that did not satisfy his spirit's judgment, he turned to Strasbourg and has remained there, skilled in divine matters, in every way until now. I say this only so that you may treat the man as he deserves. He has given me cause to think and assert many things more easily and certainly. In my judgment, he is so adept at discovering and teaching, even those things that are otherwise more abstruse. Therefore, I ask you and all the brothers to act towards him in such a way that he understands I have not recommended the man in vain.</p>
      <p>You ask about Bucer, whether I also recommend him to you? I would indeed recommend him, if I did not know that he is already more than recommended to you. Indeed, I did not know the man before except from his writings. Now I honor and revere him as a known pious and learned brother and will continue to do so as long as he remains as I have now experienced him. Love good and just men and ensure that they return to us soon with joy, which will happen if you are towards them with piety and acts of charity, as we certainly do not doubt you will be.</p>
      <p>About our affairs, another time, although I cannot remain silent about this: you have never done anything more pleasing to us than what you have done. Greet all the brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 16, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger, especially for Mr. Bartholomäus the Venetian.</p>
