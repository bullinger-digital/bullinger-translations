      <p>To the illustrious and truly noble lord, Count Ludwig von Wittgenstein, lord of Homberg, my most esteemed lord. Greetings. Count, you have indeed posed so many and such great questions in your last letters to me that I cannot fully respond to them in a complete, just, and lengthy volume, even if I could. Therefore, I ask your kindness not to take it too harshly if I am briefer than you might wish.</p>
      <p>I wanted to respond at least somewhat so that you would not think that you and your matters are neglected by me. My various, numerous, and troublesome affairs, my heavy and slow old age, and the illness of the body, which I have suffered this summer, as God has so arranged, do not allow for more extensive correspondence.</p>
      <p>Should it be considered adultery if a married man has relations with an unmarried woman? I know it has been debated by those who judge adultery more lightly and wish for some allowance for their desires. However, as he said, the speech of truth is simple and neither requires nor admits embellishment. All who think rightly define adultery as a sexual act with a body that is not one's own but is bound to another by the law of marriage, or when a body is mixed with one that is not its own. An unmarried woman is not one's own when a married man cannot mix his own body, which belongs to his wife, with one who is not his wife. Therefore, adultery is committed. If she is not unmarried but married, the adultery is doubled. The rule of truth is pronounced in one word and is pronounced by Paul in 1 Corinthians 7: The woman does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Similarly, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Therefore, if a man gives his wife's body, which is his own, to another, he has committed adultery.</p>
      <p>Thus, truth judges simply.</p>
      <p>From this very sentence of the apostle, one can answer another question. Should husband and wife be judged unequally? For the apostle grants no more to the husband than to the wife, just as the Lord calls them both one flesh.</p>
      <p>Jerome seems to judge more sincerely than Ambrose, who in the Epistle to Oceanus says: The laws of the Caesars are one thing, those of Christ another; Papinian commands one thing, our Paul another. Among them, the reins of impurity are loosened for men, and with only rape and adultery condemned, lust is permitted everywhere through brothels and maidservants, as if dignity, not will, makes the fault. Among us, what is not allowed for women is equally not allowed for men, and the same severity is judged with equal condition.</p>
      <p>This is what the apostle says, because elsewhere he denies that in Christ there is male or female, that is, woman in those things that pertain to God, piety, salvation, and the duties of life, should be regarded as having her own man.</p>
      <p>Now, concerning adulterers, the punishments of adulterers, accusation, and reconciliation, in chapters 11 and 12 of the second book of Samuel, and finally in the book of Judges chapter 19. I refer you to his writings more freely, because I cannot provide better than he, and because you modestly added in your last letter to your questions, although here I do not require a full and absolute treatment of them, which perhaps have long been explained, but you will have done enough if you briefly expose your opinion or demonstrate approved authors from whom these matters can be more fully sought. The same Peter Martyr discusses learnedly and piously about the prohibited degrees of kinship in the first chapter of the book of Judges folio 14. I also wrote something about these in my German book on Marriage published long ago. In our church and republic, we live by these laws, which I have attached printed in these letters, if perhaps I have not sent them to you before. Furthermore, what should be thought about witches and sorcerers and their arts has been excellently discussed by Dr. Thomas Erastus in his Antiparacelsica and Dr. Peter Martyr in chapter 28 of the first book of Samuel. As for the punishments to be taken, the Lord expressed in one word what he wants when he said in his law: You shall not allow a sorceress to live. And Saul is praised because, when he was still in God's favor, he did not spare this accursed kind of people. He is criticized because he not only spared the witch but also is read to have impiously used her counsel and arts. In other capital crimes, the punishment is never relaxed, although it is sometimes intensified or mitigated according to the quality or quantity of the matter and circumstances. This is what political and prudent men do at present. From whom I prefer to hear the method of investigating this crime, as they are practiced in such matters, rather than to discuss matters not only difficult but also unknown to me. I wanted to respond briefly to your questions. I ask, however, that you consider this fairly and kindly.</p>
      <p>I hope you have long since received my last letters and booklets, namely on the Psalms and the Response to the Seven Heads of the Adversaries. I have accommodated myself to the capacity of the listeners in this matter, speaking most simply about it, while others speak about the same matter intricately and say very little with many words.</p>
      <p>"Our entire republic is engaged in sending an envoy to the King of France to seek peace for the kingdom." I am so exhausted and broken in strength that at present I write or draft nothing. It suffices for me if I somehow satisfy the ecclesiastical duties entrusted to our church. For in these, too, I find much lacking in myself, while the church, as far as I know, does not complain but most kindly, by God's grace, takes care of all my matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, noble count, and my most esteemed lord, continue to love your most devoted and most ready servant to serve you, I pray.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and yours and protect you from all evil. I also ask that you commend me to the illustrious Elector Palatine at your convenience; may God keep him safe and sound for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich on the 26th of August in the year of our salvation 1574. Your Excellency's most devoted.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
