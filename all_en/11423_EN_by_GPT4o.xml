    <p xml:id="regest1">Summarizes the following letters from Nicholas Partridge, Bartholomew Traheron, and William Peterson, which [Christoph] Froschauer [from Frankfurt] brought to him - if they were not written in English, he would simply forward them to him -: Partridge asks Bullinger to compensate Christian [...] with the Angelot sent or exchanged through Butler for the sent writings, and wishes that Christian, as promised, also delivers [the lectures] of Theodor [Bibliander] on Proverbs and Job to him; he expects to receive the Gospel commentary by Zwingli, gifted by Bullinger, through Reyner [Wolfe]; he has not yet been able to procure the gloves from Oxford, as he is very busy as a private tutor in the house of [Anthony Aucher] in Kent. Peterson, whom Butler expects around Pentecost, asks Bullinger to ensure with [Rudolf] Schinz that the woods are made smooth, square, at least three fingers thick, and as long as the sample. [Traheron] shares a sermon of the cunning Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner], which Butler has already sent to Bibliander through Froschauer. The enclosed coin from [Simon] Gryn√§us is a gift for Bullinger's wife [Anna]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Peace and a tranquil conscience through Christ! Most accurately, your kindness, most esteemed man, is greeted in the letters which I received from those through the sweetest friend Froschauer at the last fair, by your Nicholas Partridge, Bartholomew Traheron, William Peterson, a merchant not as fortunate as he is a good Christian, and they give immortal thanks to your benevolence for the benefits you have bestowed upon them. I did not send their letters to you because they are written in English; otherwise, I would have done so gladly, not so much because you would have seen their requests and other matters (which, for their sake, now necessarily fall upon me to report to you, unless I wish to be called ungrateful) from their own writings, but because I would have relieved myself of the burden of writing, which, to speak frankly, is my greatest torment. Therefore, if I can, I will briefly report what each writes. Partridge's writings indeed report that he sent you an angelot, an English coin, through Reyner: but this excellent man had given other monies (for what reason, I do not know) to Froschauer, which I received from him to satisfy Partridge's mind, to whom I gave the only angelot I had for the same German coins: he earnestly asks you to satisfy your disciple Christian for the writings given to him by the same. He further says that he desires from the same that the works of my godfather D. Theodor on Proverbs and Job be sent to him (if possible): he asserts that Christian promised this. Your gift, the works of the venerable memory of D. Zwingli on the four Gospels, has not yet been delivered to him: but he expects it from Reyner, who is now arriving. The people of Oxford will send the gloves as soon as possible; for until now it was not possible to procure them there (your letters were delivered rather late) nor to write, let alone ride: so intent is he on his duty, which he performs in teaching the sons of a certain hero of Kent. I omit what he writes about uncertain matters until I see the outcome. Certainly, with God's guidance, Peterson, whom I expect to arrive around the feast of Pentecost, will inform us in person. He earnestly asks you to remind Schinz in the meantime to polish and adorn the bow woods beautifully; to make each piece (as much as possible) square, and at least three fingers wide on every side: to observe the length of the sample he left with him. Bartholomew writes about the sermon of the cunning Bishop of Winchester, which I sent to my teacher D. Theodor through Froschauer. This coin enclosed here is given as a gift to your excellent wife by D. Grynaeus, whom I ask you to greet along with your mother and the whole family in my name. I earnestly ask you to convey my greetings to my host D. Pellicanus and all your colleagues. Farewell happily in the Lord always, and I beseech you to pray that He may have mercy on me. Basel, 4 April.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as possible, J. BUTLER.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
