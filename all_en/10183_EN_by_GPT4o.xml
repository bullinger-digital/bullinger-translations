      <p>Joachim Vadian to Bullinger, November 20, 1532.</p>
      <p>I send to you, dearest Bullinger, a suggestion, which I wrote in a sudden fervor, when I noticed what the attitude of our pagans was towards the people of Zurich, indeed in appearance, but in reality against the sanctity of our Gospel. In this, in my judgment, we must rely, that we who have sincerely given our name to Christ according to the understanding of His word, although stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with steadfast minds and with that love with which we have proposed to cultivate the truth, we may promote the faith once received and known and clearly seen with the most harmonious wishes. Induced by this, I preferred to carry owls to Athens, as the saying goes, rather than to fail either in duty or in charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care especially, O Bullinger, dearest brother, to inspire, inflame, and exhort your people in this, that they may not allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then at last they will seem to have embraced Christ, when, after enduring so many hardships, they will be no less zealous in maintaining His honor when defeated than they were when victorious, so that I may not mention that this is indeed the truest victory and indeed proper to the Christian profession, by which, exalted in spirit in straits and tribulations, they are one, not by strength, in confession, not by arms, in the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. Certainly, by this path, it is pleasing to go through the midst of Satan's troops with patience, provided that nothing is done against the decorum of piety. For we love the use of arms, as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and defending the truth. In this very thing, if those who fight perish, they win with great glory, since they have no more celebrated use than that by which they meet death with Christ, not with the Accii or Brutii. They are eager not for shedding blood, but for retaining the word of the Lord. However, the Lord will also give strength to those who trust, whether of arms or of forces, provided that the purpose we are striving for is right. "For I will not leave you nor forsake you" [Joshua 1:5], said our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua when he was about to go against the enemies and undertake a very difficult task. Therefore, there is no reason for any tyranny to seize us adversely. This is the nature of our profession, that we are exercised by evils and thus, battered as if by storms, we do not trust the world, but Him who has overcome the world. Our Antronio has succeeded well, indeed relying on his own skills. He has long hands and a rich flock. There are those who crawl into this trap of their own accord, provided they obtain the bait, although with the danger of their souls, as foolish fish often do. But oh, glory to God, who has made us victors in truth, attacked by so many evils! He prevails, but by art and deceit, that is, by Satan. We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in hand, by which we cover the forehead of this one with shame. Finally, although he may have achieved much to fulfill his folly, we, however, are allowed to act unharmed according to his desire, not only for ourselves but also for the field and the subjects. For to them, the free choice of faith is left by the grace of the Lord, nor will they lack ministers to be supported by their own means. Such is the love for Christ of those who have truly believed. But indeed, we have suffered more grievous things. God will also give an end to these. You will make an effort that the ministers of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen are also reminded not to apply slack hands to the common cause to be defended. You would not believe how little those who have been washed with the dew of the spirit are shaken by these tricks. Meanwhile, the flesh acts in its own way and triumphs womanishly, truly unaware of how ridiculous it is to acknowledge what you can give no evident reason for. We have in our possession that Davidic saying: The plans of the wicked will perish. Selah, etc.</p>
