    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 2483] containing important news for Konstanz and the [allies]. He forwarded Bullinger's [bundle of letters] for Augsburg [not received]. He fulfilled his duty by also sending many letters to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In Konstanz, inquiries are also being made about the Spaniards and the Italians. The Bishop of Trento [Cristoforo Madruzzo], the Viceroy of Naples [Pedro Álvarez de Toledo], and [Ippolito II?], the brother of the Duke of Ferrara [Ercole II. Este], were sent to Rome to procure money and troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Pope [Paul III] is said to be gravely ill or even already dead. With God's help, the resulting interregnum could be advantageous.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A bloody star was seen in Innsbruck, which likely indicates something significant. May God assist His own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In Saxony and Hesse, preparations are being made. The Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] has proposed to the Protestant estates that he either remains in Hesse or makes arrangements to come to [Southern Germany]. The latter was endorsed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Blarer thanks for Bullinger's response to his question [about the military duties of the Zurich pastors].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Georg von] Reckerode is indeed leading the troops that were previously in [French service] to the Landgrave, so that at least there will be no shortage of [soldiers], and one can hope that the plans of the priests will be thwarted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Should the Confederates not wish to join any party, their decision will be more tolerable if they neither grant the enemy passage [through their territory] nor support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger should report whether the former bailiff in the Rhine Valley, Martin Im Hof of Uri, belongs to the [Protestant] side.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- From Italy and other countries, it is heard that resistance against the unpopular Pope is to be organized in Italy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Emperor [Charles V] and Pope [Paul III] are said not to have agreed on the stated reason for the planned attack against the [Schmalkaldic League]. The Emperor wanted to cite the disobedience of several estates and conceal the religious matter, whereas the Pope wanted to openly state religion as the reason. It was finally decided to cite the disobedience of the estates as the reason in [Germany], where Lutheranism is very widespread, but religion [south of the Alps]. Thus, in several places, mercenaries are said to have been recruited by calling them to a war against the Lutherans and promising them an indulgence as well as the wealth of the Lutherans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger's assessment of the Emperor is correct. Vigilance is required. The [Schmalkaldic League] is in good spirits, as Blarer has learned in writing from Lindau, Isny, Kempten, Memmingen, Biberach, Ulm, Augsburg, and Esslingen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Thomas Blarer] and K[onrad] Zwick send their regards. [For forwarding] Blarer sends his letter to the Konstanz city clerk [Jörg Vögeli the Elder].</p>

      <p>Especially trusted, beloved brother. I have well received your faithful letter and sent one of the writings, as you requested, directly with the messenger to Augsburg, where I have otherwise sent many letters. I would gladly, as much as it depends on me, not neglect anything. I also thank you for your faithful concern for us and ours, although it applies to everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the Spaniards and Italians, our people are also constantly informed. For the Bishop of Trento, also the Viceroy of Naples, the brother of the Duke of Ferrara, have been sent to Rome to raise money and troops. Care will be taken to ensure they do not enter the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Pope is said to be mortally ill. Some worry he is already dead. The interregnum might also bring something if God the Lord grants heart and fortune to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is certain that a bloody star stood over Innsbruck for a short time, which many people have seen. It signifies something significant. May God fatherly preserve His own in the blood of Jesus Christ!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Saxony and Hesse are in great preparation. The Landgrave has proposed to our estates that it should be up to them: If they wish, he will remain in his land and be there, or he will occupy his land and make arrangements and then leave and move up here. Thus, they wish to have him here above for many compelling reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I thank you for your decision on my question.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is true that Reckerode is also leading the French campaign to the Landgrave. In summary: There will be enough people if there is no shortage elsewhere. I hope the priests will be well salted and the hail they have long brewed will hit them themselves. May God grant that it all turns out to His praise and our improvement.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>If your Confederates do not wish to join any party, it is all the more tolerable if they do not grant our adversaries any passage or support. It is enough and perhaps much better than the other for many reasons, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Report to me next time and do not forget whether Martin Im Hof of Uri, who was the bailiff in the Rhine Valley, is held in favor because he is favorable and loyal to the word of God. There is a reason why I would like to know. Our people have much good and various information and warnings from notable people from Italy and elsewhere, all of whom are enemies of the Pope, some of whom suggest ways in which resistance could be organized against the Pope in Italy, which would cause him trouble. For no one is inclined to the devil's head.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Our people have information that the Emperor and the Pope have argued with each other about what reasons should be publicly given for the attack on the Lutherans. The Emperor thought it best to cite the disobedience of several estates and remain silent about religion; thus, the matter could be pushed through better. On the other hand, the Pope wanted to take up religion without any pretext, etc. Finally, it was decided that here outside, where Lutheranism has spread so widely, the disobedience of several estates should be cited so that the others remain quiet. Inside, however, it is more plausible to cite Lutheranism and religion, as there is credible information that in several places a call has gone out that they want to march against the Lutherans, and what the servants conquer should all be theirs; whoever then perishes shall have grace and absolution for punishment and guilt and go to heaven with the devil without any means. But God be praised in eternity that all these things are being revealed. May He grant that we have timely insight, for the enemy is diligent, vigilant, and swift (dangerous).</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What you write about the Emperor is all true, and one must be vigilant if one does not want to be willfully blind. Our people are brave and undaunted. This is written to me from all sides, also from Lindau, Isny, Kempten, Memmingen, Biberach, Ulm, Augsburg, etc., Esslingen, that one is well comforted in God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Praying for us and greeting all good lords and friends. Greeting you, my dear brother and cousin C. Zwick with others. I send this letter to our city clerk. I do not know how soon it will reach you. Dated July 3, etc., in the evening at 5 o'clock, 1546.</p>
