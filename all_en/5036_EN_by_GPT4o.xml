      <p>S. D. I was unable to reply through your syndic, a truly distinguished man, because I was still occupied with the affairs of our synod; indeed, I am compelled to be brief even now. However, this is more beneficial for you, who are occupied with more useful matters than reading my lengthy letters. I received a copy of Beza's letters and I give great thanks for it, but I give the greatest thanks to our God for His singular grace, with which He favors France. From those actions, you understand what those obstinate Lutherans are plotting and how far they have advanced their Augsburg Confession in France, which, as it can be tolerated by the papists, shows its nature. You find that I did not write extensively about this matter in vain recently.</p>
      <p>The boastful voices are still heard: "Soon our confession will be accepted in France, Calvinism will be expelled." Therefore, I think we must be vigilant. I wrote about this to Mr. Martyr.</p>
      <p>I see that those perverse men prefer to act with the papists in this matter rather than with us. I shared this account of Mr. Beza with Mr. Blaurer, and I will also share it with Haller.</p>
      <p>For the copies of those you sent to Poland, I give thanks and I return them here. I also wrote in the same sentiment and rejoice that we speak the same from one spirit; however, I explained more extensively to the prince what Blandrata did here and how disgracefully he lied against me to the prince. Since I consider Balduin, although I have not seen his book, to be a craftsman of Samaritan religion or faith, I judge that you have done a worthwhile work in exposing his worst arts.</p>
      <p>Perhaps they use this man in imposing their Augsburg Confession. May the Lord strengthen your resolve, so that you may be able to benefit the church with useful writings for a long time! Let us diligently pray to the Lord to bless the affairs of France and to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel. Recently, we were given the worst possible neighbor, Cardinal Empsensis, who has become the Bishop of Constance. He will trouble us abundantly.</p>
      <p>Our confederates only yesterday began legal action with the people of Claron; perhaps they will be forced out of it or break it off according to their desire. If I learn that the envoys of the Prince of Savoy are plotting something either in those assemblies or here, etc., you will not be unaware; I will inform you promptly. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Greet the fellow ministers and brothers, especially Mr. Roset, Mr. Bud√©, and Jonville, Badius, Normand, and Crispin.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 23, 1561. My fellow ministers and brothers greet you. Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
