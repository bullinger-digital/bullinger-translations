    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Bullinger is advocating for their relative [...] (which is proof of his friendly attitude towards them), Meinrad and Ulrich again request that Bullinger continue to show goodwill, that he treat the relative strictly as if he were his own, and that he ask the potential [teacher] to also be strict with the boy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should also inform the future [teacher] that Ulrich will travel to Zurich as soon as possible to arrange the dates for the salary payments with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger's efforts are rewarded. He should prove himself to be a good Schodoler as before, and Meinrad and Ulrich will behave like good Bullingers towards him and his family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He is commended to God, and his family is warmly greeted!</p>

      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear lord and faithful father, our most willing service and all good things to you beforehand. As you are advocating for our relative, from which we recognize a true friendship (for which we thank you most kindly), we again earnestly request that you continue to show goodwill towards us and ours, and to treat our relative strictly as if he were your own, and to ask the one he comes to, to do likewise towards him, on our behalf, in a friendly manner.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And as soon as it is convenient for Ulrich, I will arrange to travel over and, regarding the salary, when I satisfy the teacher about it, I will hold a conversation with him, which you may report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We are always ready to repay you for such and all good things. And as before, you wish to be a good Schodoler towards us, so we wish to be a good Bullinger towards you and yours in return.</p>

      <p>With that, may God commend you, greeting your family is a joy to us. Dated on the day of Saint John the Evangelist, in the year 1546. Your most willing servants and friendly fathers Meinrad and Ulrich Schodoler in Bremgarten.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, our special, dear lord and faithful father.</p>
