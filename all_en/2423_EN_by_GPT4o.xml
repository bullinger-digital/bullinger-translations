      <p>S. D. I have been suffering for several days from a severe head cold, dizziness, severe toothaches, and other discomforts; therefore, I write sparingly; for I could hardly manage to write this.</p>
      <p>I received the expense sheet, and I am pleased with your frugality; continue in this way and you will be approved.</p>
      <p>Here I send letters, some addressed to the most illustrious Prince of Hesse and Mr. Andreas Hyperius, others to Mrs. Hopper, others to Mr. Wolfgang Waydner in Worms; I beg you to ensure they are delivered promptly and safely. Use the help and advice of your master Mr. Burcher, Mr. Martyr, to whom you will give these addressed to him. Mr. Garnerius will also advise, etc. Keep the ones addressed to Vergerio; for he will soon come to you; unless he is already with you. If he has left, send them back to me with the first available messenger; for these letters are of some importance, having been sent to me by the royal envoy, who has just left Solothurn; another has succeeded him in his place.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, our affairs are in a fairly happy state, thanks to God. May the Lord grant stability and an increase in happiness.</p>
      <p>Anna has now been blessed with a goddaughter, Anna, from Zwingli. All the other children are well. Johannes Otmar Wipf has been excused, and as far as I understand, he has a fairly comfortable position. We wonder if Zellia has moved to the Lord.</p>
      <p>You will greet Mr. Zanchus, informing him that I have received two letters from him along with the preface; I would have preferred to see the treatise on punishing heretics, but nevertheless, I thank him most diligently for this elegant gift.</p>
      <p>You will greet Mr. Jacob Haddon, the Englishman, diligently; inform him that I will ensure nothing of that booklet he wrote to me about will be published. I have nothing else to write now. Farewell together with your whole household; all of ours greet you. Zurich, October 12, 1554.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the house of Mr. Burcher, the Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
