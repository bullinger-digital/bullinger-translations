      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ. I received your letter through my relative, most esteemed Bullinger. You accuse our audacity, and not without reason.</p>
      <p>First, I excuse myself: I had recommended to Johann Tscharner, when he was going to Bern, to discuss with you whether I might dare to send my goddaughter; he replied in writing after his return that he had settled this matter and that I could send my daughter.</p>
      <p>I therefore pray that you forgive my presumption. What shall I write about Brother Johann Blasius? Grief compels me to shed tears; he departed to Christ on July 18th, leaving behind great loss and sorrow for our entire church, along with four children from two wives. From the first, Paul and Titus survive, from the second, a one-year-old boy and a girl of a few weeks. For Titus, Lord Consul Haimius and I ask that he be kept in Zurich until such time as he comes to the surgeon; we both pledge ourselves as surety, each for the whole, to keep you unharmed.</p>
      <p>However, care should be taken, if possible, that he does not incur debt out of order or secretly. He has clothes at home; but they should not be taken from the sick house immediately, lest they infect others with contagion; if only there were enough left from the ducat to buy one or two shirts. Do not take it badly, dearest brother, that we press you so heavily. Necessity and calamity have overwhelmed us; the plague rages most cruelly. Pray to the Lord for us, that He may deal more gently with us. Such an elegant youth of men and women, young men and virgins, is swept away by the plague as if by a whirlwind, that it is pitiable. For ten days I too lay ill, but not severely, and by God's mercy, I recovered from this disease. I give thanks to God.</p>
      <p>Regarding my daughter, I ask to know how she is doing and with whom she is staying and what his name is, so that I may send letters to him, lest I trouble you daily. She should not be sent to school, but taught to spin (that she may learn to spin well); for your matrons surpass ours greatly in this art. I gave her very little wine, after dinner or lunch, after giving thanks, I gave her a small measured draught. But now I would like her to drink twice at lunch or dinner, especially during August, lest foreign and unfamiliar water cause her fever or be the cause of some illness. The matron with whom she is staying should buy her two shirts. When better times present themselves by God's grace, I will send her clothes. Farewell, dearest man.</p>
      <p>From Chur, July 29, 1550. Greet the pious brothers in my name, and let them pray for us.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
