      <p> Greetings. I have, dear and honorable godfather, received your letter and copies of the persecutions of the holy Christian church today and thank you most sincerely for them. I have already sent some copies to the gentlemen to whom you addressed them, and I still have some; for the messenger is in a hurry. I thank God that He has once again allowed and helped you to complete this work in good health, and we hope for much fruit from it; for it does very well in the hearts of the believers, a blessed, friendly, and favorable encouragement in the face of persecution and contempt. The church has always experienced this well, as the books of the fathers and all ecclesiastical history testify. </p>
      <p> As for the enclosed letters, I have communicated them to my lord mayor Steiger, who, as I understand, has presented what he found good to my lords, as my lords have let me know, they intend to send their own messenger down to Zürich. What they write, I do not yet know. I hereby return your letters to you. The lord writes nothing else this time except to Lochman, whom he has chosen as godfather for his son, who is eight days old today or on the 1st of March. He has also asked me to thank you most sincerely for your little book, and to let you know soon when the wine can be sent to Glarus. Otherwise, we have nothing special to report this time. Many things are being said; but there is always nothing behind it; therefore, we cannot rely on it. It is true that all of France has been turned into a place of turmoil; no one can walk safely in Paris, neither this side nor that; it is as if everything is in turmoil on the streets, except for those who travel in groups. This has helped the wicked; they take comfort in the example of the king. May God destroy him and them! Meanwhile, the pious are dismayed and do not know where to turn. Arise, Lord, and help them! </p>
      <p> I was about to send you a copy of the theological problems of our Aretio; but apart from three or four copies signed by us, we do not yet have any in our city. </p>
      <p> However, I will send one or two as soon as I can get them. My father-in-law especially greets you and thanks you for your booklet; he is not in very good health, both because of his age and because of the harshness of the winter; however, his spirit is not lacking in fervor. </p>
      <p> Hagenberg is also bedridden with gout. The councilors and treasurers, along with Diesbach, are well and greet you. Dr. Gwalther has also sent us copies of his sermons on the testimony of John given to Christ. If not now, then soon, after I have distributed the copies and have more leisure, I will respond and give thanks: in the meantime, you will greet him in my name and give him my greatest thanks. </p>
      <p> Bern, March 9, 1573. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, yours, as much as he is. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather. </p>
