      <p>S. The health of my wife distracts me so much, most venerable father, that I can rarely and only briefly write to you, if at all; therefore, I ask for your forgiveness. The matter that torments me most vehemently at this time is not private, but public.</p>
      <p>We hear that the most esteemed Swiss envoys will return to us on July 5th, and in this regard, a certain public courier B., an old man dressed in the colors of Zurich, at this very hour, which pushed out these of mine, brought letters to the senate and at the same time presented new demands to be quickly referred to the Rhaetian communities in the name of the Swiss consul. What the argument is, cannot yet be known, except it is certain that some things were weakened in Baden, which in our exact judgment were concluded about certain fugitives. I see great danger looming for both sides. For if others wish to break the decisions of the communities and protect and free those whom the Rhaetians have proscribed not without grave reasons, I do not see with what ease our peasants will swallow this; rather, they will rush to arms.</p>
      <p>But what misery it is to bring war upon the country for the sake of a very few, to trample on religion, which is a more important cause for many. A certain distinguished man recently warned us that when he stopped at the Bear in Solothurn, he heard from some of the leading men at dinner that they had several reasons to subdue the Rhaetians, especially because they were Huguenots.</p>
      <p>They would not have erupted into these words if they had recognized such a man. What spirit or counsel is here, we must consider together, lest we, who wish to appear as Christians, under the pretext of other causes, draw the sword into our own bowels and against our brothers or join common efforts with others who have long since begun to think of this. The Swiss command that the opinions of all communities be gathered, which are to be brought together by July 5th and await them here on the same day. I will communicate the new demands to you at another time; for the courier has just now arrived. Mr. Campell also urged me to write this to you, which I could hardly do, and I wrote as ineptly as I could.</p>
      <p>Most quickly, June 18, 1573.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your greatness.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To Mr. H. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
