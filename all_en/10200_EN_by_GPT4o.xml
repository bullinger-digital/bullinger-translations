    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter from Bullinger, in which the dispute between Zurich and the Five Cantons was explained. Meanwhile, the second Basel scribe was in Strasbourg and explained the position of the other reformed cantons. Bucer is not too worried about the verbal dispute between Strasbourg and Zurich and hopes for a resolution through oral discussion. He continues to work on mediating between Lutherans and Zwinglians, convinced that Christ is with both. He asks the people of Zurich to first settle privately with him if he expresses anything unchristian in future writings. Critical judgment about Leo Jud. Greetings. Asks Bullinger to report on the further progress of the mandate dispute. The people of Strasbourg have therefore approached Philip of Hesse and view the situation of the people of Zurich optimistically.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>We give thanks, both on our own behalf and on behalf of several pious senators, for your diligent and straightforward account of your conflict. Meanwhile, the second scribe of Basel was here, who reported that the people of Bern, his own, and those of Schaffhausen have joined you in ensuring that the matter of religion is not left to the discretion of the other cantons, as is the case with secular matters in your confederation. Hence, we hope that the Five Cantons will now lower their spirits.</p>
      <p>Regarding our dispute, which is also yours, I am not overly concerned. For how could I be separated from someone who remains in Christ, who is a living member of the same body? However, as I see it, this entire matter cannot be adequately and conveniently discussed through letters. Perhaps the Lord will grant that we may teach each other our opinions more successfully in person. I have openly expressed what I disapprove of in the Lutherans, and I strive for concord for no other reason than to prevent either side from persecuting Christ in the other. Since both sides proclaim the same Savior of believers, it is my duty to indicate that Christ dwells in both, as Cyril uses the term "σωματικῶς," meaning that Christ dwells in us in such a way that we are His members. Hilary calls this "naturally"; I know you will not disagree. But there are more aspects to this matter, as I said, than can be adequately addressed in letters. Otherwise, an apology would have been prepared long ago. Even if my letters contained something you did not approve of, when we write to you, we do not write to just anyone, but to those who are more discerning and take things in a better light, which others might take in a worse light, and who are of such candor that if anything seems unworthy to you, you would ask us about it before making any decisions even among yourselves. Indeed, we cannot rashly condemn what a true Christian professes, which conflicts with this profession. I do not write this to complain about what has happened, but to request that if we write anything to you in the future that seems less Christian, you would privately discuss it with us before publicly manifesting among the brothers, even among the fellow ministers - for there are some common people among them - what you disapprove of in us. Leo is indeed very dear to me and is considered among the foremost ministers of Christ, and is exceptional in this very gift of gentleness. However, he seemed to me to be less accepting and to seek new quarrels without cause. But perhaps this seemed so due to my own fault, not his. Truly, you are all great to me.</p>
      <p>I was more troubled by the thought that I might appear to you as I perhaps already seem to myself in your letters. I will pray to the Lord about the matter itself and I pray that we may discuss it in person. In the meantime, let letters speak of other matters, which are, I believe, more necessary and worthy of us, and let there be a certain and solid friendship of spirits.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with all our brothers there and the esteemed fellow ministers, Pellican, Bibliander, and the others. I have written to Leo.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 5.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>Make sure to write to us as soon as possible about your affairs. Our people are truly concerned about you, but the reason they do not write now is that they hope your situation, after the Bernese and others have joined you, is better. They have informed the Landgrave about your affairs and are vigilant. If anything is attempted, they will always warn you in time. This is their firm opinion, that no one will wage war against you unless an opportunity is taken from you, and this only if you conduct yourselves in such a way that the enemies think they can overcome you by fear alone. Therefore, they think you need nothing at present and are firmly convinced that with constancy in the Lord, you will respond to the enemies with the dignity worthy of you, indeed with modesty, but at the same time with a clear indication that you will not depart from Christ, and then with vigilance against civil plots. When they read your letters, so pious, so referring everything to the Lord, and that the just people still study the word of God, they are in the best hope.</p>
      <p>We have uncertain news about the Emperor.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Be strong in the Lord. He who previously raised you alone to such a height will not reject you now that you are humbled and returning to Him. More on these matters later. Greet all who belong to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the people of Zurich, esteemed brother.</p>
