      <p>Greetings. Since I wrote to you more extensively the day before yesterday, I have nothing to add to that now, except that I am returning your writings to you and I give great thanks for them.</p>
      <p>I have received nothing yet, neither from Geneva nor elsewhere. Here are some captains from Valais with the abbot of Saint Maurice, with whom I have spoken; but they themselves have nothing of particular note. Therefore, I do not wish to trouble you with more words now.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Bern, March 20, 1572.</p>
      <p>Mr. Steiger sends you his careful greetings and thanks Mr. Gwalther for the booklet sent to him.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
