      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I received the letters, which I am sending to you, along with the booklet, which I have devoured myself.</p>
      <p>Recently, I wrote to you that I consider the royal letters to offer the best opportunity for the Genevans to clear themselves of slanders. The envoy of Savoy stayed here for three days, hoping that the most honorable council of Z端rich will follow what the Five Cantons have agreed with him. He will consider everything more carefully.</p>
      <p>On this matter, I will write more at another time.</p>
      <p>As for me, I will not stand in the way of the formation of a most honorable, beneficial, Christian, and useful alliance between the most honorable council of Z端rich and the crown of France, which one might judge almost necessary for serious reasons, which I currently withhold. Before the next diet, I will visit you.</p>
      <p>Now, since nothing else occurs to me to write, I will end by asking you to greet Mr. Martyr, Mr. Walter, your son-in-law, and other friends along with the most honorable council.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, February 5th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Z端rich. In Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Letter from Mr. Matthieu Coignet, the king's envoy.</p>
