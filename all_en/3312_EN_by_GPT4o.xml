      <p>Greetings, dearest godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the seventh of this month, I received your letter along with the Apocalypse, which, we hope, will be read with a happy beginning and understood better than before by the churches of Christ. I give you as much thanks as I can for this gift.</p>
      <p>I would have sent you our Isaiah, if I had any copy of it besides the only one I possess. The elder Hervagius used to send about ten copies of my works soon after the edition was completed. Now, after he has become unfit for business, his son and son-in-law pursue their duty towards me more lightly and tepidly than I would like. However, I will urge them again to send; when they do, I will ensure you receive it, not because I think you will gain any benefit from it, but so that you may occasionally inspect it and, if you desire anything, you may kindly advise me. Regarding the Worms assembly, considering the current state of affairs, I feel the same as you write. Last week, I received letters from the chief preacher in Augsburg, dated the first of September, in which he does not write a word about this assembly, although he is one of those who were to be sent to Worms and was recently at the Frankfurt assembly, where most of the future colloquy was arranged, and I had earnestly advised him to write about it if he had any information. However, as everything is uncertain and unstable, it may happen that what has been once destined by the princes may be brought into effect when least expected. Whatever the case, it is our duty to pray to God that He may finally remove this grave, long-lasting, and deep-rooted scandal from His churches. Farewell excellently, dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours, also the lords and brothers there, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Ochino, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, and the others.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you, especially our little Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Bern, 13th of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his godfather, lord, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
