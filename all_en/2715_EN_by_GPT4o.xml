      <p>My willing service and all good things, etc. Friendly, beloved brother-in-law, after your departure, as you have seen on the date, Hans Jacob from Brugg sent a boy to me with this enclosed letter. Inside was the prince's letter and two reports from his servants, with which they informed the prince about what they had achieved for Hans Jacob in his dealings in Augsburg, etc. I have copied them quickly, solely for your service, so that nothing is hidden from you and you know all the dealings thoroughly as they are. I send them to you here, but you must return all this enclosed in your letter to this messenger when he comes back from Richenweiler.</p>
      <p>I have responded to him in writing; I know well that it will displease him. However, I have done what I am obliged to do before God and would be well if he followed; but he follows no one but himself. He intends to return soon and settle at home. I consider that impossible and have also written to him: he will now find in practice what I have always told him would happen, namely that the king would let those in government remain in their ways and judgments and would show him again for them. That has now happened. Even if they give him support at this time, what will he accomplish? Even if he were a hundred times the governor, which he is not, he could not carry out the matter. He no longer has his royal freedom and should start the right against it. How? For what purpose? Or where does he think he will succeed? The king has thus pointed him to the clover field, and I fear he will not be able to hold the prince. He has wasted and squandered the money given to him for the herbs and has not accomplished anything. He has kept the prince waiting for a long time and promised him with empty hopes; when he realizes this, he will not be safe from anyone, etc. Therefore, my advice is that you do not burden yourself with him in the future, as you have done so far, since you can neither advise nor help him. My wife sends you, yours, and your children friendly greetings, as do I. God be with you. Dated Zurich, 4th of September, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
