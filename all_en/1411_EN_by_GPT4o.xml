      <p>Greetings. I wrote immediately after the letters that Vogler brought; however, because he delayed, I entrusted another with them; I heard that you received these. I wrote a little later through Vergerius's nephew; I believe you have received these as well. Now Vogler has finally returned; so that he would not leave you empty-handed from me, I am compelled to write these present ones; although I do not know what I should write, I will invent something.</p>
      <p>I am very surprised that you write that you know nothing about the council. They are surely attempting something evil; for the devil, while feigning tranquility, often breaks out more perniciously. So too do the sons of the devil, of which Charles is the clearest example. Come, we will wait to see what it is; may our Lord only watch over us.</p>
      <p>We speculate about the diets just as you do: the evil one will not allow us to teach the gospel in peace. But what will you do afterward, what will we do? If the Septempagicus wins, we will be expelled. But where to? There will be no place to receive us. If we win, which is unlikely, we must expect war and other evils. Meanwhile, I am of this mind: if our people wanted to be good men, they would have an abundance of arguments with which to contradict. Among these is this: let the Confederates use their power to ensure that a general, free, Christian council is held, in which it is permitted to contend for the truth through the truth, and security is promised before and after the council and in the council itself, free speech drawn from the letters of God, and let all human things be silent, and what is promised, let it be fulfilled: thus they will have us, who will defend the truth of God fearlessly against the pope, against the world, and against the devil, their prince and leader.</p>
      <p>Let the response be heard, and after the response, let there be deliberation on what more should be done. This alone I wanted to indicate to you, so that you would have a small portion of my deliberation and so that I would not write nothing. Unless your affairs hinder you, I would ask that you also instruct me with your advice; but I spare you.</p>
      <p>The Wittenbergers defend themselves as not being among the adiaphorists and claim that these have acted wickedly against them, as they have thus exposed their name to many; they still stand firmly by the Augsburg Articles and will stand to the end with Christ's assistance.</p>
      <p>Pomeranus mentions this matter in the preface to Jonah, etc. I almost forgot to mention what you perhaps already know: Farellus is said to have preached something, which the people of Freiburg interpret as a violation of public peace. There are those who speculate that the diets have been called because of this. Farewell in Christ with all yours. Basel, September 20, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, in his Lord</p>
