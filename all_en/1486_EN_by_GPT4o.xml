      <p> Greetings. I returned home safely from you recently, but I found many inconveniences, which took me almost two months to mend. The situations were so difficult that I was forced to move my residence from Kaufbeuren. Therefore, I went to my friend Jakob Rehlinger in Leeder, located two miles towards Bavaria from Kaufbeuren. I indeed intended to come closer to your region, but the approaching winter dissuaded me. I am now here, completely uncertain about where I should finally turn, so that I might have a more stable residence for myself and my family. The papacy here is gradually regaining its strength day by day, yet it cannot fully soar because the impending wars hinder the spirit invoked by the Council of Trent. When I was in Zürich and nearby, I consulted with some good people about a suitable residence for me and asked some to inform me as soon as possible, at their own expense, if they discovered anything beneficial for me; but so far, I have received nothing. On my way back, I recently spent the night in Rheineck, which, although not very appealing otherwise, seemed satisfactory to me, as it is a place shared by the Zürichers and other Swiss in terms of governance, and I would have spent my days there if I had not been repelled by the neighboring monks. Certainly, I would have settled there until I had the opportunity to stay longer. If you can find out anything through others that you think would be suitable for my stay, please write back to me. Hieronymus Papius from Lindau will receive letters and send them to me. </p>
      <p> Many rumors about the Confederates' dissension are spread here; I wish they were unfounded. Our guests are approaching Lake Como, either pressed by hunger or by treacheries... Our Emperor Charles is staying in Innsbruck, where it is said he will also spend the winter. Regarding war rumors, we have so little information here from Italy and France that we are even unaware of what is happening in Magdeburg, whether the siege still continues or not. </p>
      <p> I am very eager to know from you what will happen with Abbot Joachim, who was left in your house. </p>
      <p> Caspar Schwenckfeld has published a book in which he discusses passages of scripture, especially about the letter and the spirit, to which many common people subscribe; for it is written in the vernacular language, which seems to require an apology for the Christian republic. Furthermore, it smells of new theology, hopefully not heresy. </p>
      <p> If that book has not yet reached your eyes, let me know, and you will receive it. </p>
      <p> Extend many greetings to Lord Gwalther, Zwingli, Gessner, Frisius, Gwalther, and all the good people, especially the lords, the councilors, and the chief scribe. Farewell with your most honorable household. November 27th from Leeder, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours as his own, Georg Frölich (Laetus), etc. </p>
      <p> To the venerable and highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed leader of the Church of Zürich, my most gracious and dear lord. Zürich. </p>
