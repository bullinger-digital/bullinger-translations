      <p>When I was about to leave the baths, most learned man, our Théodore de Bèze informed me that you are very eager for a certain doctor, who is staying with you, to obtain a privilege from the royal majesty for his publication on all animals. Although such privileges are rarely granted to foreigners and I have seen many be rejected in similar cases, I was able to obtain this through friends. The royal majesty responded that I should send the title of the book to them, and upon seeing it, they will order the patent letters to be expedited. However, I cannot write how long the privilege will last. If the doctor wishes to come to the next assembly, I will inform him of the whole matter.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Paulus Vergerius told me about your benevolent attitude towards his majesty, which is sufficiently testified by the letters you wrote to him. I diligently informed the royal majesty about this, who instructed me by letter to thank you in his name and assured that he will never forget your enthusiasm towards his affairs. Now, a serious war has openly begun between the Emperor and us, and on the 8th of this month, the royal majesty occupied four towns in the Piedmont region along with several camps, thus extending his domain by more than forty Italian miles, one of which was very strong and recently fortified. I ask that if you learn anything in these tumultuous times, you inform me; I, in turn, will not fail in my duty towards you. I wish to render you grateful service in every way, whenever time and opportunity demand. Finally, I ask that you understand me better than I can write; for I rarely write in Latin. Farewell. May the Lord keep you safe for his church. I commend myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Maurice Morelet de Museau.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in every kind of discipline, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
