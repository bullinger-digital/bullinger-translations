    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should please report to Vadian once again about the current [Badener] Diet, which seems to be of importance for St. Gallen. The [Zürcher] envoys [Johannes Haab and Hans Bleuler] will surely not hide anything from him! Vadian requests on behalf of the St. Gallen council only [communications] that may be shared with the St. Gallen councilors at the council table without hesitation. If Bullinger can report even more, the people of St. Gallen will be even more grateful and will repay him. His reports will be treated with the utmost confidentiality by the St. Gallen council!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Apart from the plans of the power-hungry Emperor Charles V, there is no news to report from Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">For Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, a court date was set in the legal process over the possession of his duchy by his accuser, King Ferdinand I. A panel of judges was appointed for this. Ulrich has no prospect of success from the outset. All righteous people are asking themselves how long God will tolerate the unbearable arrogance of these people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Vadian has not learned anything about the interim committee. However, he received from [Hieronymus] Sailer a list of those who were selected by the imperial estates with the emperor's approval to find a possibility for reconciliation of the religious disputes. Whether they are good or bad people, Vadian does not know. He sends the list along with a sheet he received yesterday from the citizen of Constance, the Englishman John Butler. He claims to have received it quite confidentially from [the imperial residence in Augsburg], the Fugger House. The [news transmitted therein] probably only consists of insignificant war rumors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Vadian was more pleased with the enclosed epigrams and epitaphs that his friend Sailer sent him. He does not want to withhold these amusements from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings, also to the Zürcher colleagues.</p>

      <p>Dear Bullinger, I kindly ask you once again, if anything happens at the current Diet that you think is important for us, to write to me and act with your usual candor. The envoys will not hide anything from you, nor do I seek anything hidden on behalf of our council, but only those things that can be safely shared with the councilors at the council table. If you can report anything more, we will all owe you even more gratitude and will repay you. Do not doubt that everything will remain within the sacred walls of the council (as the saying goes).</p>

      <p>There is no news from Augsburg, except that the Emperor is pursuing lofty plans.</p>

      <p>A court date has been set for Duke Ulrich of Württemberg by Ferdinand as the accuser, and judges have been appointed to examine and pronounce on the possession of the Duchy of Württemberg. He has lost the case from the outset. All good people are wondering how long the Lord will tolerate the more than excessive arrogance of these people.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Not a jot has been written to me about the colloquium of scholars. Sailer sent a list noting certain individuals (I do not know if they are pure or impure) who have been selected by the estates with the Emperor's support to deliberate and consult on some means of mitigating the controversy in the cause of religion. I am sending this to you along with a sheet given to me yesterday by Butler, an Englishman and citizen of Constance. He claimed it was sent from the Fugger House with much confidence. But I think it is mere idle gossip.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The epigrams and epitaphs sent by my relative Sailer pleased me more, and I am sending them to you, most excellent man, so as not to hide any of my domestic trifles from you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell and convey my greetings to the college in my name. St. Gallen, March 12, in the year of our Lord 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, my lord and esteemed friend.</p>
