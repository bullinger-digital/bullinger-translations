      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, H. LÃ¼thi wishes grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>As I am about to travel either on horseback or on foot, it is certainly not possible for me due to my poor health, as I spent the last night almost entirely sleepless. My illness, which is commonly called das gesuchty (Rheumatism), has attacked me so severely and fiercely, and it continues to torment me miserably. It lurks around the joints and connections of the limbs, exerting its force vigorously. This is why I must remain at home, even against my will. Therefore, I earnestly beg and beseech you to present this just cause of my absence before the synod, if you deem it necessary, so that none of the brothers may think me to be disobedient.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I believe it is worthwhile to diligently exhort the brothers to treat the sacraments with a little more dignity and honor. For you do not know, my dearest brother, how indignantly and contemptuously some speak and think of them, and how ridiculously and with what contempt they administer these most sacred mysteries. You will find some, for whom it is enough - to mention just one of many inconveniences - when a child is brought to be baptized, to use only the essential words and immediately take the child in their hands and say: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, etc.," as if it were a sin to clothe and adorn the sacraments with any form of pious prayers. In many things, by Hercules, I miss great vigilance. They do not visit the sick. They make no mention of the brothers who have fallen asleep in Christ, according to the church's constitution, for whom the departure of a man and a cow is almost the same. They do not openly preach the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the commandments of Christ, the summary of the law to the uneducated public in their sermons. How few observe the catechism according to the synod's constitution? Most are solely focused on constantly innovating something or completely abolishing it, meanwhile, they are little mindful of how much vigilance and prudence our function requires here and how circumspectly we must act here, so that we not only demolish but also build, and God is praised in all things.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>May you receive this admonition of ours in the spirit in which I made it, that is, pious and good.</p>
      <p>In the year 1534, on the nineteenth of October, suddenly at the break of dawn by lamplight.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zurich, his dearest lord and brother.</p>
