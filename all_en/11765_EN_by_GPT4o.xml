    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Bullinger allegedly did not understand him, he explains once again how much it hurt him that Bullinger only sent his commentary on Matthew to [Johannes] Gast. The rumors about the death of Emperor [Charles V.] come from outsiders - according to another source, he is said to have arrived in Italy - the summons of Basel before the Imperial Chamber Court does not rule out that he might have died; disheartened Basel [councilors] are considering preparing for a possible victory of the French [King Francis I.], which Bullinger should keep to himself, and even among the pastors there are false brothers who secretly agree with the opponents. The council has been demanding from the pastors for a year now not to criticize misconduct from the pulpit, but to report it to the authorities, yet the pastors do not want to be involved in legal disputes as informers, but rather admonish according to their office; they ask for a statement from the Zurich theologians or Bullinger, but no one in Basel should find out about this. [Johannes] Sturm, who stayed overnight in Basel, knew nothing new about Bucer; a rumor says he had a dispute with the inquisitor [Tilman Smeling] in Andernach; Bucer's wife [Wibrandis Rosenblatt] gave birth to a son [Martin]. From Austria, it was written to Theobald Nigri that the Hungarians were expecting their downfall [by the Turks] next summer; nothing is known about the negotiations [at the Imperial Diet] in Nuremberg - perhaps because the princes keep their resolutions secret -; the only thing heard from the council is that many clergy were in Trent; the Seven Places are said to have met with foreign envoys. Has not written earlier due to lack of messengers. Bullinger never answered his question regarding [missing parts of an edition of] Appian.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am indeed so easy in writing that even a blind man could see what I mean, and this ease is perhaps blamed on me by some, because imprudence or barbarism runs alongside it. What is the reason, then, that you do not understand me? I wrote in, I believe, November: "It's strange what you say: 'I didn't want to burden you with a large book,' etc. Do you not know that books are compared to gold? The heavier it is, the more precious. Therefore, there must be another reason, because you sent nothing, even though you have published nothing so far that you have not sent, etc." To this, you remain completely silent and leave me to my - perhaps wrong - thoughts. You have, therefore, what you asked for; but you want me to clearly reveal my mind to you. From a sincere friend (as I judge and have and will have you, as long as I live) nothing ever happened that I took more unfairly than that you preferred Gast over me in giving your commentary, and the pain would perhaps have been less if some friends had not reproached me: "Why to him? Why nothing to you?" For I had said that I had not yet seen the book. This matter vexed me so much that I cannot say. For although you long ago dispelled the causes of suspicion, I accepted it rightly; nevertheless, it remained, which forced me to say that to be silent is to respond. Recognize, I beg you, my candor here, from which I am so clear; for I cannot bear that you retain any scruple about me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you write among other things, as if the people of Basel say or hold something about the death of the emperor. If you gathered this from my letters, I wonder what slipped from me; for not even I here about his death. It came to me from elsewhere, especially from Worms, then through a certain merchant from Lower Germany and most recently from Strasbourg, that indeed everything said about the emperor is ambiguous, although it was recently certainly reported that he had come to Italy.</p>
      <p>But could not the people of Basel be summoned by the judges of the chamber, even if he himself had died? You know what those people do when they hope for some profit or where they can cause trouble for evangelical men. But whether the emperor lives or has died, I grieve the calamity of the times; so much so that wherever I look, everything is savage. And we here are certainly more than anxious enough. Men also secretly dispute, for whom the Lord is not hope and refuge: "If," they say, "victory favors Charles, well for us; but if the Frenchman, where will we be? The Frenchman will oppose, those from the villages who stand with the Frenchman will oppose, and here we disagree somewhat; it is not clear where we should turn." They say this among themselves, but secretly; they do not know that I am aware of their discussions, which is why you will also keep them to yourself. What do you think the minds of such disputants are? First, as I said, they do not have God for refuge. Then they would gladly turn the cloak, so to speak, to the wind, so that they themselves might be safe. Will the gospel bear fruit among such people? But what do you think my mind is among such, unless I were devoted to the Lord? And the grace of brothers is also rare; therefore, I am more disturbed. For there are those to whom whatever those who oppose us establish is not displeasing, although they greatly dissemble. I do not know where they look, what they think, what they have in mind; for they cannot be such by chance. I have learned for some time now how this kind of people, I mean false brothers, heavily burdens good men; but about these another time.</p>
      <p>I return to those timid ones, about whom I began. They have been annoyingly troublesome to us brothers for a whole year now because of the correction of offenses, indeed not this, but because of the manner of correction; for here they dare to prescribe to us in this form: If any preacher is reported for a sin worthy of correction and punishment, it should not immediately be thundered from the pulpit, as has been done so far; for by this importunity both the senate and the people are wearied and disturbed, but it should first be referred to the heads, so that they may refer it to the senate and an investigation be made and the offense found be punished or penalized as it deserves. For this is the mind of the senate: to prohibit, punish, suppress offenses at all times as much as possible. Here, I say, we have contended for a whole year, although calmly and with good reasons; we do not want to be informers (kalthansen), we do not want to be called to court by the accused, we do not want the authority of the gospel to be diminished in this way. But we want to use our office, to rebuke, to exhort with all gentleness and doctrine, lest the blood of the neglected be required of us. I have explained these things more fully so that you may understand what they persistently want and what we oppose, and so that you may write your opinion to us; for all the brothers ask for this. I would have written to all of you; but I do not dare to trust.</p>
      <p>If it pleases you, communicate with those whom you consider faithful and silent. But if it seems otherwise, respond alone. For among a few, the matter will be conducted more safely.</p>
      <p>If ours were to know anything of this, they would judge us as traitors. Enough about these things.</p>
      <p>After what I recently wrote, I have received nothing about Bucer. Sturmius was here overnight, but he did not know anything either, except that he was still in Bonn and that the number of objectors was very large. I had heard from a citizen of Strasbourg that there was a dispute in Andernach between Bucer and the Dominican master of Cologne, the inquisitor of heretical depravity. But Sturmius was not certain about the truth. Meanwhile, Bucer's wife gave birth to a son at home. There is no news, except that a certain doctor writes from Austria to Theobald Nigri, a brother from Strasbourg, that the Hungarians are inconsolably mourning their certain downfall next summer, unless the Lord mercifully prevents it. His writing made me anxious after I understood the man's despair; for it seems that the Lord has taken away counsel and strength from the Germans. Thus he deals with those whom he wishes to destroy. What is happening in Nuremberg, even those who know everything are ignorant. It would be strange if the princes want their plans to be secret. Which indeed is not bad if they are good. Not a word about the council, except that a huge number of monks and priests were in Trent. There was a rumor here that the imperial, French, Venetian, and papal envoys were gathered with the Seven Places; we wonder if it is true.</p>
      <p>I wish you and yours well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 15, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I would have written earlier, but there are no messengers.</p>
      <p>You never responded about Appian.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant shepherd of the Lord's flock, his dearest brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
