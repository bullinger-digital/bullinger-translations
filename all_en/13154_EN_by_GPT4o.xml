      <p>When I had already sealed your letter, the prince came to me and instructed me, through a note, to write to you the following matters.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Matthias, you should write to Bullinger that it is not the intention, as he might understand it, that we are withholding something necessary to know due to business matters at this time, as you know. For it is not possible for us to write to him; because we sometimes have to neglect our lords and friends. If we were to write back and forth, we would need our own chancellor for that, or we would have to neglect other matters that are more important and most desired, namely, new news, which cannot be delayed at the moment. We have also recently written to him for the second time through the market messengers, who sent us the letter safely, indicating as mentioned; but whether it reached him, we do not know. We would like to be in a position where we could send him and others joyful news and letters. However, it remains in old friendship."</p>
