      <p>I received your letters, most illustrious man, through the present courier, but the previous ones, which you say you wrote to me with Schertel's letters, I did not receive. Certainly, as you write, it would have been well for us if the king had invaded Brabant, and that was the advice of the master of the horse, when he saw the enemy nowhere in sight; but others dissuaded him, as they saw diseases increasing daily, and indeed not a few are gravely ill. I do not know whether Cardinal Lorraine has recovered; he was suffering from a pestilential fever. The king has accomplished not a little this year; for he has taken many other fortresses, of which no mention is made, and our peasants of Champagne are glad to see the borders extended so far. The Lord of Sedan, who is called from the march, took a very strong castle, which Caesar had once taken from his parent; it is called Bouillon, not far from Sedan. I hear from your letters of the remarkable expedition of Caesar, which begins late; for only two months remain until winter. The princes must take counsel for themselves; for what they have accomplished is little, unless they can counter Caesar's efforts. What you write about the Italians and Spaniards is most certain; for the same is reported from Italy. The king's affairs in the Piedmont province are going well; the very strong fortress of Verona in the marquisate of Montferrat has been occupied by our forces against the hopes of the Spaniards, who had erected a stone pig over the gate, from whose mouth hung a stone grape, and in their vernacular language they had affixed two verses, which meant the same as if you said: when the pig eats this grape, the French will enter the castle.</p>
      <p>However, it was not captured by our Italians without cunning; for the governor of Piedmont pretended to want to go elsewhere and invade another castle and ordered some large cannons to be sent up the Po. Immediately the governor of Milan rushed to defend that castle. But at night our marshal ordered the cannons to be brought down the Po, so that they arrived at Verona at dawn and our Italians attacked so furiously that they entered the castle and killed all the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>This matter was taken very hard by the governor of Milan; for that castle is of great importance. Therefore, he is considering by what means he can have it again, which will hardly be done with the help of the Lord; for it has what is necessary and is entirely situated on a rock only eight miles from Vercelli, where the Duke of Savoy has his seat. Molineus, a truly simple man, greets you in his manner. Farewell. Basel, July 29, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
      <p>July 29, 1552.</p>
