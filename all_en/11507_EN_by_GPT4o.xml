    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes von Bekensteyn reported about a letter circulating in Lower Germany [Capitos], which declared participation in the High Mass to be unobjectionable, causing concern regarding the stance of the Upper German theologians. The Zurich church rejects this opinion; Mass, images, and the like do not belong to the [Adiaphora], as God's law forbids any cult not ordained by God; Cyprian, Elijah, and Zephaniah condemned alterations to the form of the Lord's Supper instituted by Christ or the mixing of the religion instituted by God with man-made rites; under this verdict falls every kind of papist Mass. Furthermore, the Holy Scripture demands an open confession, and thus - contrary to the doctrine of the Elkesaites - merely outward participation in sacred acts that are inwardly rejected is forbidden; Bullinger has elaborated on this in earlier writings. This stance includes the willingness for martyrdom. Bekensteyn will report more precisely orally about the conversation with the Zurich theologians. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Our esteemed brother Hermann, the distinguished and pious man, Johannes von Bekensteyn, has informed us that a letter is being circulated among the churches of Lower Germany, which openly teaches that it is permissible for Christians to attend the High Mass, as they call it, and that this is causing considerable disturbance among some, while others suspect that all the ministers of the churches in Upper Germany share the same opinion. Therefore, it pleased the church of Zurich and our ancient and orthodox doctrine and faith to clear ourselves from that unfortunate suspicion and to openly confess to you, a minister of the churches of Lower Germany not least in learning and holiness by the grace of Christ, that we neither hold that opinion nor approve of it. We truly believe that a Christian man can freely use those things which are called indifferent and neutral everywhere and always, provided that everything is done knowingly and out of charity, namely for the glory of God and the edification of the church and neighbors; however, we do not count the papal Mass, whether it be high or low, idols, and other things of this kind, which openly fight against the word of God and sincere faith, among the neutral things. For an indifferent thing is that which is "neither good nor evil; for whether you do it or not, you will have neither righteousness nor unrighteousness"; for thus Jerome also defined indifferent things to Augustine. But who in their right mind would not say that the High Mass and the use of idols in temples are evil, who would easily concede that they are good? By the law of the Lord, every foreign worship and rite of sacred things, that is, either not instituted by God himself or invented by men beyond the word of God, is once and manifestly condemned. What else is the High Mass than a rite not instituted by God, but by men beyond the word of God?</p>
      <p>For we are not ignorant of what the Lord's Supper is and by what rites Christ commanded it to be celebrated. It is also not obscure that those who celebrate the High Mass condemn the Lord's Supper and its rite as barbaric, uncultivated, and even heretical, while in the meantime, the holy martyr Cyprian says that nothing else in the Supper should be followed or received than what the Lord himself has handed down to us. And again: "It is adulterous," he says, "it is impious, it is sacrilegious, whatever is instituted by human madness, so that the divine disposition is violated." What, moreover, did Elijah, the most holy prophet of God, who is believed to have been carried up to heaven in a fiery chariot, forbid the mixing or combining of the religions or institutions of God and men? "If the Lord," he says, "is God, follow him; if Baal is God, follow him. How long will you limp between two sides?" But also Zephaniah: "I will destroy," he says, "those who swear by the Lord and by Melchom." Certainly, if the one sacrifice of Christ, once offered for the sins of the world, perfects the faithful, what need is there in those High Masses to daily offer the body and blood of the Lord for the sins of the living and the dead? If those who die in faith pass from death to life, if those who die in unbelief come into judgment, what, I ask, do they sacrifice for the dead? If the Lord is to be worshiped in spirit and truth, why do they connive at the doctrine and deed of those who command God to be worshiped in bread? Therefore, with Elijah, it is permissible to cry out: "How long will you limp between two sides? If the sacrifice of Christ is complete, believe that you are perfected forever by a single offering, but if it is offered daily in the Mass, believe that you are purified by daily sacrifices." These things do not agree or fit together, nor is it that anyone should allow themselves to be blinded by the High or Low Mass. In the High Mass, those same impieties are present as in the Low; in both, the institution of Christ is dislocated, in both, Christ is offered for the living and the dead, in both, he is worshiped in bread, in both, idols are served, in both, creatures are invoked, especially in the offices celebrated for the saints, in both, the most impious canon is the chief part of the Mass. There is nothing in it of ancient antiquity, nothing of apostolic simplicity.</p>
      <p>But it is also especially fitting to observe here that the scripture requires from us not a hidden, but an open confession. And we confess our faith most of all by sacred rites and the use of sacred things. He who stands by Gentile or Turkish rites, when asked, confesses that he is a participant in Gentilism and Turkishism. He who assists at the Mass, when asked, openly testifies that he acknowledges the Mass and the religion of the Mass as true. Therefore, by his presence, he confirms all the errors of the Mass. He who refuses to assist at the Mass is considered by the adversaries of sacred things and all of papism as a despiser. And so, by this very reason, we believe that the faithful are repelled from the communication of the Mass, by which we know a clear confession of the doctrine and faith of Christ is expressly demanded from each one of us. Nor is it enough to believe in the heart and to confess God secretly, unless a sincere, full, plain, and true confession of the mouth also accompanies it. Origen is the author that there was a heresy of the Elkesaites, which taught that in persecutions, if anyone denied (I use the words of Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, book 6, chapter 28), he would have no crime for it, because he who is fixed in his heart, even if he denies with his mouth out of necessity, still remains in faith in his heart. But I do not intend now to dispute this question fully. I have noted some things about it in my commentary on 1 Corinthians 8, 9, and 10, also in the epistle to the Hebrews, and again in the books On the Origin of Error, recently revised and enriched by me.</p>
      <p>I have written these things so that your piety may understand that we are clearly not in the opinion of those who open access to the Masses for the afflicted. Rather, we believe and teach that the truth must be confessed boldly, and error must be fought against, detested, and fled from, indeed souls must rather be laid down than to communicate with those profane sacred things. We know that in much patience our souls must be possessed; we know that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. But if it will be permissible henceforth to simulate and dissimulate religion according to the time, to mix and dislocate, surely the most holy martyrs of God were foolish, who refused to apply themselves to the most significant rites. However, integrity and constancy pleased the Lord; therefore, the holy pertinacity of those who prefer to endure all extremes rather than to communicate with the impious papal sacred things will not displease. You can freely testify these things about us among the good and those afflicted for the truth and pray that they commend us to God in their prayers.</p>
      <p>More will be explained by Johannes von Bekensteyn himself; for he has heard our colleagues disputing on this same matter, Leo Jud, Caspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the others, who all send you greetings. Farewell, esteemed brother in the Lord, love me and commend me to Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 18 February 1541.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers. The brothers also greet you.</p>
