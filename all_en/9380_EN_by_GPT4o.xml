      <p>Greetings in Christ. Reverend Father, I have received your letters, in which you commend to me the martyr Saint Terentianus, whom I am unsure whether I should hold in esteem due to your kindness and the memory of the most holy man, Mr. Peter Martyr, or because of your services towards me and mine. He is indeed a young man of good character, but one who needs guidance. I will certainly do what Christian charity demands of me, and what our old friendship requires, as long as the hope I have conceived is not disappointed. This concerning our Saint Terentianus. As for me and my studies, you should know, most reverend father, that I am very busy with the public work of the clock, which is being erected in the main temple of our republic, and I hope, with the help of the best and greatest God, to complete it soon. It will indeed be a work neither small nor of little expense or without skill; but the astronomical globe will revolve with the motion of the prime mover in a daily motion, and the wheel, which will contain movable feasts and others, will revolve for a hundred years with a perpetual calendar showing the mean motions of the planets with the illuminations of the moon. Moreover, the statues of the four ages will strike the quarters of the hours; finally, the statue of death will indicate the true hour of day and night with the strike of a bell. And all these things are so arranged that I believe I have fulfilled my duty and worked so much for the love of my country that I might achieve praise or at least some recognition; which praise, however, I would have gladly left to others, had the magistrate not ordered me to do so.</p>
      <p>These are briefly my studies to you. I love your Lavater, a good, pious, and studious young man of letters. I would write more, if I had the time, especially about that litigious and malevolent man, who has introduced ruin to the school and church and still does not cease to be troublesome to us. But about these things another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell in our Lord and Savior, and greet all my diligent ones dutifully, and whatever service there will be that I can provide to all of you, I will be ready and prepared. I wrote this hastily and distracted by various thoughts; therefore, forgive me. July 11, 1573. Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Yours, Konrad Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and singularly revered Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord to be honored with all observance. Zürich.</p>
