      <p>To the noble and virtuous maiden Agatha Zoller, his dear goddaughter.</p>
      <p>The wise elders have, many years ago, used paintings well and rightly, not to promote extravagance and immorality or pride, nor to plant superstition and idolatry, but to depict and present all kinds of virtues, especially honorable deeds, our salvation and blessedness. Therefore, they did not place them in churches, but kept them in their homes, and one can still find many beautiful artistic paintings and images that were usefully conceived and made in earlier times, one of which is this: your dear sister, Mrs. Verena Escher, of blessed memory, not long before her marriage, worked very artfully and beautifully with much effort and labor, and thus made a precious tapestry. At that time (while your honorable and beloved mother, who was indeed a crown of all discipline, honor, and virtue, was still alive), you heard from me the interpretation of the painting, and therefore, as the cloth fell to you by inheritance and you held it dear and valuable because of your sister of blessed memory, you requested of me to explain and summarize the meaning of the painting in writing for your honor and pleasure, which I willingly accepted and hereby send to you out of love and honor, with the request to receive it kindly from me. May God protect you eternally.</p>
      <p>Dated, Zurich, July 6, in the year of our Lord 1561. Summary of the cloth.</p>
      <p>This worked cloth is a depiction or an image and encompasses the entire summary of the incarnation and redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ, how he was born of a virgin, redeemed us poor sinners from eternal death with his death and shedding of blood, and became our one and only eternal savior. And so that it may be rightly understood, I will give a straightforward report of all the pieces.</p>
