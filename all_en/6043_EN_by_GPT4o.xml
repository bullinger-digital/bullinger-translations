      <p>Greetings. I have indeed received your letters, dear brother, along with the excerpts of the Claron case; but now, I have nothing to write. The messengers will go to Lucerne on Sunday, then to Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, to see if they can persuade them to agree to peace just as the people of Lucerne and Zug have. May the Lord grant that all things may turn out happily to the glory of God and our peace for the salvation of souls! There is a rumor that on February 23, the Cardinal of Lorraine will arrive at the court of the King of France.</p>
      <p>If this is true, I do not promise myself anything good or peaceful. He is a fury and infernal demon.</p>
      <p>What consoles me now is that our Lord is also the Lord of the devil, who can remove those demons in an instant.</p>
      <p>He rightly wears the purple, who is entirely sprinkled, indeed drenched, with innocent blood and stands in the blood of the faithful up to his neck, indeed above his head.</p>
      <p>Some Thomyris could treat such a bloody, I meant to say, revered lord with dignity. But the judgments of God are true, who is just and truthful.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express how much I desire to see the 9th session and the conclusion of the council. Therefore, you will tug the ear of everyone from whom you expect something.</p>
      <p>The 60,000 ducats will sink into the insatiable minds like a lead block in Lake Constance, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 18.</p>
      <p>Why is it that Zanchi does not even write? Do you not suspect that Ochino is hiding elsewhere among the Rhaetians; I cannot know where he has gone. All of mine greet you. 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
