    <p xml:id="regest1">Although ill, he wants to answer Bullinger's three letters. The documents from Bern requested by Bullinger regarding the events of recent years can probably only be partially procured and copied, because some had to be handed over to the Five Places according to the Second Landfrieden. Bern has offered the Duke of Savoy, citing the verdict of Payerne, the mediation of the Swiss places in the dispute between Savoy and the city of Geneva. The Genevans, who are divided among themselves, live in fear of the "bandits" exiled from the city and their episcopal and Savoyard-minded helpers. A Bernese troop of 4000 men under the leadership of Wolfgang von Wingarten and Peter Im Haag is ready; nevertheless, they hope for a peaceful solution. The dispatch of a Bernese delegation to Zurich as an attempt at rapprochement between the two cities is useless because there is no longer a Secret Council in Zurich. The envoys from both sides keep spoiling the matter. Johannes Haab is said to have behaved awkwardly in front of the deputies of the Catholic places. Haller requests the sending of Bullinger's work on the two natures of Christ, the "Assertio utriusque in Christo naturae".</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I am weighed down by my illness, dearest Heinrich, I did not want this messenger to return to you empty-handed, without at least responding to your three letters.</p>
      <p>What you ask, to have transcribed, I will diligently do, provided they are at hand and I am allowed to share them by the secretary. These are not with Valerius, since he is now writing about what happened in the year 1519. The documents concerning the Silvanus affair, along with the letters denying passage to Bremgarten by the Five Places - as the peace agreement required - were handed over, and I can hardly believe we have copies of them. The rest, if they still exist and are entrusted to me, you shall have.</p>
      <p>Regarding the business of the Genevans, the situation is as follows: We hope for peace. To obtain peace, envoys have been sent to the Duke of Savoy on the condition that if he has any grievances against Geneva, he should address them to the Swiss Places, who had previously settled the war, from which this also arises, with the verdict of Payerne.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the Bernese will ensure that the Genevans obey. There is a certain fortress not far from Vienna, inhabited by exiles, bandits, along with the bishop's family and some of the duke's ruffians. They attack anyone leaving the city, but it is nowhere heard that an army is at hand. The day of fear is so bad for them; they are excellently divided in the city. Scarcely a third part embraces the word of the Lord. The rest are papists and devoted to the Duke of Savoy, which you will find among us as Savoyard and Genevan. A levy has been made: 4000 foot soldiers with a banner, captain Wolfgang von Wingarten, lieutenant Peter Im Haag. Meanwhile, the envoys ride around the whole region and explain these matters to them, so they do not think the magistrate is acting rashly and more inclined to war than is fair. In summary: In ten days, no war has ever been thought of. We are waiting for the envoys to come from Piedmont from the duke.</p>
      <p>What you write about forming a friendship between the two cities and sending envoys to you: It is in vain; you have no secret council with whom one could consult on how the matter should be approached. Thus, our and your envoys spoil much for days, which would be better spared. Habius behaved poorly, and it would have been a small matter, as I hear, if he had not been resolved by the envoy from Freiburg, Vogt Bschiesser from Glarus, and Isenh√ºtt from Appenzell. I can write no more. Dear friend, send me "De duplici natura" as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the day of St. Michael, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
