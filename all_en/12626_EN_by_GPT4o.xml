    <p xml:id="regest1">In haste, Blarer forgot to enclose [Georg] Frölich's letter with his letter from September 10 [No. 2577], which he is now sending along. On the 10th, Bullinger also wrote his letter [which Blarer has received] [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He is pleased that [the people of Zurich] are sending three zealous [preachers, Rudolf Schwyzer, Lorenz Meyer, and Thoman Ruman] to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- If only the [Schmalkaldic League] had been wiser and listened to the good advice! But God will turn everything for the best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The [Schmalkaldic League] wants to oppose [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren. They have withdrawn from Ingolstadt because they could not achieve anything there. The Bishop of Würzburg [Melchior Zobel] supported von Buren and is said to still be assisting him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- A fire broke out in the [camp] of Emperor [Charles V.], from which the Emperor barely managed to escape.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Upon withdrawing from Ingolstadt, [the Schmalkaldic League] left several barrels of gunpowder in an estate they had vacated, which they blew up from a distance with the help of a fuse when the Spaniards had entered the castle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- May the [Schmalkaldic League] understand the seriousness of the situation and devote themselves to repentance and prayer, which only the Holy Spirit can bring about in them! God is surely on the side of [the Schmalkaldic League], even if they must be [chastised] through suffering.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The godless villain in Rome [Pope Paul III.] will probably not succeed and will only bring others into misfortune with him. May God soon strangle him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger should pray. Blarer must break off, as the messenger [...] wants to depart. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I truly see how true it is what is said: haste is the mother of error.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I sent my letters. What Lętus had written, I did not send in my haste, although it did not matter much for you to receive it, yet I am sending it now. I wrote to you on the 10th of this month, that is, on the very day your letter was dated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wholeheartedly rejoice that you have sent three such zealous soldiers of Christ to Augsburg. May the Lord be with them with the most present power of His spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If only our people had been wise in time and had heeded good advice! But the Lord is the one who graciously governs all these things according to His best will.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is no news, except that our people are trying to oppose or defeat the one from Buren. They have withdrawn from Ingolstadt because they could not achieve anything. The Bishop of Würzburg has given him great support, and he is said to still enjoy it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>A fire broke out in the Emperor's camp, in the barn where he was staying, and he barely managed to escape.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Our people used a good stratagem in their withdrawal from Ingolstadt against the Spaniards, who had taken over a pleasure house there right after our withdrawal. However, it had been filled with several barrels of gunpowder by our people, and a fuse was set up far out in the field, which is called a running fire. They then set it on fire; it blew up the castle and the Spaniards along with everything to the heavens. God have mercy on their souls! We are waiting for news at any moment.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>May our people be vigilant and seriously consider the severity of the situation and apply a present remedy to the present danger! However, there is no more present remedy than genuine repentance and fervent faith in sacred prayers, which the wisdom of the Lord's spirit will bring about in their actions. I am well and highly comforted, God is on our side, but He will let us suffer for it, yet we will not be put to shame: It must be earned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The godless, shameful murderer and villain in Rome, I hope, can have no luck and will bring others into misfortune with him. May God soon overthrow and strangle him!</p>
      <p>Pray for us faithfully! May He govern you and yours eternally! The messenger wants to depart. I must break off. May all yours and your people be well. 12th of September, early afternoon.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
