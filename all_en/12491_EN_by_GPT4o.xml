    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer returns the copy of the letter from Bullinger addressed to Philipp [Melanchthon] [No. 2404] and is convinced that Melanchthon will not incite unrest, even if others provoke him to do so. Blarer will fulfill Bullinger's wish as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He recently entrusted the former Stammheim pastor Lorenz [Meyer] with a letter [No. 2437] for Bullinger, which Meyer himself hoped to deliver or promised to pass on to someone else if necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Everything is calm in Konstanz. Emperor [Charles V] is taking care of his health [during a spa treatment]. There is nothing to report about the Diet [of Regensburg] and the Council [of Trent]. If Bullinger learns anything relevant, he should share it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings, among others, to the mayors [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and [Johannes] Haab.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer thanks [Rudolf] Gwalther in writing for sending Theodoret's work ["De providentia sermones X"].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Likewise, Bullinger should deliver the enclosed letter to Jakob Ruf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [people of Konstanz] send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Through [Ruf], Bullinger will learn about the girl [Magdalena...] tormented by the devil. [The people of Konstanz] hear that Ruf can heal such afflictions and hope that God will reveal Himself through him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I now return the copy of your very modest letter to Philipp [Melanchthon] and I am more than extremely grateful that you wanted to make me a participant in it. I do not doubt that Melanchthon, with his Christian candor and exceptional sincerity, will not be disturbed (no matter how much he is provoked by many). I will ensure that what you recently advised is done at the first opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I recently wrote to you through that Laurenz [Meyer], who acted as pastor at Stammheim. He thought he would greet you there; if that did not succeed, he affirmed that he could easily ensure, through another trustworthy person, that it would be delivered to you as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Everything is calm with us and among us, and we receive nothing from elsewhere at the moment. The Emperor [Charles V] is taking care of his health. Nothing is happening at the Diet [of Regensburg] that we hear of. There is persistent silence with us about the Council. If anything is decided by your people that is important for us to know, do not hide it from me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Commend us diligently to our common Savior. Give my regards to your household and to those closely connected to you, especially the fellow ministers and your mayors [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and [Johannes] Haab.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I write to our Gwalther, giving thanks for the recently sent sermons of Theodoret, which delight me exceedingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You also receive a letter addressed to Jakob Ruf, your surgeon, which I strongly request be delivered to him immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Our people commend themselves to you very dutifully and bid me to send you many greetings. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. From Konstanz, May 11, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You will hear from the surgeon about the strange tricks and deceptions of the devil, by which he torments a girl among us beyond belief and almost kills her. We hear that your Ruf can heal such afflictions with natural and lawful means. If this is so, he will certainly have done a very great work if he shows himself as a divine presence in the severe torments of the afflicted virgin. You will understand the matter from him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and in every way greatest friend and brother in Christ, most dear. In Zurich.</p>
