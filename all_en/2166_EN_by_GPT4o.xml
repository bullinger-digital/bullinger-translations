      <p> S. D. Farewell to the Mercuries, farewell to the Vertumnuses, farewell to the Suffenuses and all of that kind. The Lord, the examiner of hearts and minds, knows what kind of spirit each person has; He will reward each one on that day according to their deeds. I pray to Him, that He may bless us mercifully and graciously through Christ. Although Rizzius, a clever man, is about to come here, I dare to assure you that he will find no less Hispanizing people in any Swiss republic than in this one, unless some unknown spirit has turned the minds of some. May the Lord protect us from evil and preserve us in His holy peace for His holy name's sake. - Concerning the margrave and the German princes, such varied reports are sent to me by friends that I am reluctant to report such diverse and almost trivial matters to you, who are otherwise endowed with the sharpest judgment. </p>
      <p> D. Vergerius sent his own messenger to me with this packet, beseeching that I send it to you wrapped in my papers in good faith. </p>
      <p> Therefore, I sent the messenger with my letters to Vergerius. I give this packet to the host of the Stork, a fellow citizen, imploring him to take care of it faithfully. With equal diligence, I also entrust to the same host the letters addressed to the most illustrious man, d. Bassafontano. I believe d. Vergerius has written more certain things about German affairs than I have. I have communicated to him what you instructed in your last letters; for I wish not to be ungrateful for your perpetual benevolence towards me. Live and farewell. ZÃ¼rich, 21 January 1554. </p>
