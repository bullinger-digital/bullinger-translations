    <p xml:id="regest1">Can now, after the return of [Joachim Maler], report on the Frankfurt meeting. A standstill agreement [“Anstand”] was concluded for 15 months, with the approval of Emperor [Charles V.] reserved and the following conditions apply: The Protestants may not take on any new allies; the opposing side also refrains from expanding alliances and using military force; starting August 1, a religious discussion will be held in Nuremberg; the agreement only applies to the Protestants of the Augsburg Confession; these offer assistance against the Turks. Blarer is outraged by the leniency of the Evangelicals; a religious discussion will only worsen the matter. Wants to have more written down for Bullinger; is in a hurry because the messenger wants to leave. The people of Konstanz are worried because the bishop has acquired the monastery [Reichenau]. Calls for prayer and trusts in God. Values Philipp [Melanchthon's] recognition of Bullinger's [“De origine erroris”] highly; hopefully, he will not become the author of a false reconciliation. Wants to advocate for the messenger. It is planned to involve only compromise-ready theologians in the religious discussion.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>When I see that you are greatly desirous of these matters, which are now commonly talked about regarding the Frankfurt assembly, I have decided to write to you what I have found out, until I can learn more precisely about the whole matter from our people.</p>
      <p>Our envoy returned three days ago; he was heard by the senate yesterday, but in a tumultuous manner, because it could not be done with the diligence required due to other business.</p>
      <p>What could be learned from these matters is as follows: A standstill agreement of 15 months has been granted, but in such a way that the Emperor may either confirm or annul it within the next six months by his authority. The conditions are as follows: First, our side may not take on any new allies, but likewise, the opponents may not take anyone into their alliance nor move arms against anyone in the name of the Gospel. By the first of August, scholars from both sides will gather in Nuremberg to discuss these controversial articles of religion; from them, fewer will then be chosen, and finally, very few, that is, six, will be appointed to expedite this matter, with some laymen, as they call them, sent by the Emperor to be present. If they happen to agree among themselves, then the Emperor will ensure that there is one religion for all. Furthermore, this peace is now offered only to those who teach according to the prescription of the Augsburg Confession presented to the Emperor at the assembly, excluding all others, Anabaptists, and whoever does not acknowledge the Roman pontiff. Our auxiliaries will bear arms against the Turk, they themselves being so insecure that, unless I am completely mistaken, they have never been in greater danger.</p>
      <p>Ah, what am I writing, my heart, my dearest and best Bullinger, I am so distressed, so nearly consumed by grief, that I cannot fully grasp what I have heard. The indignity of this matter so completely torments me. Those whom you feared might be excessively confident are now so soft and broken. But this is our merit. I hear that to some ministers of the word, this outcome of the assembly seems entirely plausible. But it pains me so much that nothing has affected me worse since we first heard the Gospel; for I see what these monstrosities portend. Our senate has always been of a lofty spirit and has taken the utmost care not to designate anything unworthy after receiving the grace of the Lord. Some others have done the same, whose opinion, however, could not prevail. Almost a decade ago, when this very thing was requested of us, that we should not join anyone to ourselves, after the most serious consultation on the matter, this was boldly denied to the adversaries; now all these are so disheartened at the whisper of an effeminate bishop. The conference of scholars will further exacerbate everything and will be the most effective cause of discord among us. This you can easily understand with your prudence. Would that the Lord would take me away from here soon, so that I would not be forced to live through these evils! And indeed, it is certain that I would rather die ten times, a hundred times, even a thousand times, than depart into this opinion. Let the authors of these evils see how they will excuse themselves to the most severe God of judgment, and to all the pious.</p>
      <p>What I write is truly so. But there are moreover many things which I have not yet been able to read in the acts, since the senate has only heard all these things in passing.</p>
      <p>As soon as there is certainty about them, we will take care to describe everything to you in order, as much as possible. This good brother is here and leaves at the same time, and the letters from Augsburg press me to respond. Therefore, my venerable brother, I beg you, through Christ, to forgive this insipid and most negligent writing; for I preferred to write something rather than nothing at all.</p>
      <p>This bishop of Constance, if it pleases the gods, has also obtained the monastery of Reichenau, which they call wealthy, which our people will by no means be able to bear as a neighbor for many reasons, and they are not moderately disturbed because of this.</p>
      <p>Ah, Savior Christ, for the glory of your name, deliver us, since outside of you there is nothing left from which any help can be hoped for. Oh, how much better it was to trust in you alone and only than to be a disgrace to your holy name with such accomplices! You, my soul, with the others who are there, the good and Gospel-loving brothers, prostrate yourself at the feet of the Lord, that he may raise up those who have fallen so disgracefully with the strength of his spirit, and graciously preserve even the very few, among whom may we also be, in whom he may declare the strength of his arm to the whole world. How much better it is to meet a glorious death than to live a disgraceful life! It is indeed a most grievous cross with which we are now exercised, not so much because of the present loss, which we already feel, but because of those more atrocious things which we see are to follow. But the Lord lives, to whom we also live and will always live, even against the gates of hell. May he keep you and yours with us for as long as possible. With fervent prayers, I would now like to say something in your ear, which I pray to Christ that you may not only hear but also see come to pass someday. Again and again, I beseech and implore you to forgive the most negligent writing, since I cannot do otherwise.</p>
      <p>That your work is so approved by Philip should rightly seem great. Would that the man, who is supreme in many respects, may not be the author of a false reconciliation.</p>
      <p>Do not be anxious about the messenger; nothing bad will happen to him on account of this matter, which I will indeed attempt.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, and pray diligently for us, almost dead, that our spirit may revive in Christ. Greet all the brothers; for I can do nothing else. May 2, in the year 39, around the third hour in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Ah, true God, how all men lie in filth when you withdraw your hand! Eccio, Luther, and those of stubborn minds will have no place here in the conference, but only those who are most modest, that is, those to whom anything can easily be persuaded. We hope that Luther himself will paint this assembly and its ill-conceived plans with his colors.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother. [Zurich].</p>
