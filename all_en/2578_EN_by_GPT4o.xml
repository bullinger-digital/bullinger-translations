      <p>S. D. Please forgive me, most kind and learned Bullinger, if I, unskilled and inactive, disturb your holy studies and pious labors once again. For what I do, I do not so much for myself as for the brothers, and for some pious ones, indeed for the cause of asserting the truth of Christ. The brothers and some pious ones have asked and even implored me by Christ to write to you and to earnestly request from you that you defend or illustrate the simple truth of Christ concerning the Lord's Supper, which has been obscured or rather attacked by that pastor Westphal from Hamburg, with a brief response from the sacred scriptures that is clear and firm, as you can by the grace of God. For no writing of Calvin has reached us, whom I hear has opposed this Westphal. There are those who interpret your silence as a desertion of the cause or a disgraceful flight, who nevertheless want to appear to favor the cause. The remaining theologians, or rather "flesh-logians," triumph among their own. Let it be, let them rejoice, and even celebrate before victory, but let it not be to the injury or diminution of the simple truth of Christ. I beg you, my most kind Bullinger, with your pious learning and holy prudence, to think of remedies. Therefore, for your faith, skill, and prudence, faithfully and bravely apply yourself, lest this carnal swelling dangerously recrudesce to the ruin of the body of Christ, that is, his holy church.</p>
      <p>I will add one thing, if you do not know: In recent days, another little book was published, the title of which was sent to me by the deacon of the church of Kempten as follows: "Collected Sentences of St. Aurelius Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, on the Lord's Supper." A refutation is added, vindicating from corruptions many passages which the sacramentarians falsely cite for themselves from Augustine, by Mr. Joachim Westphal. Regensburg, from the press of Johannes Carbo. Year etc. 55. The previous little book of this Westphal, translated into the German language, is zealously recommended by the carnal clamors, which, if I am not mistaken, they will consecrate into the canon.</p>
      <p>These things, most learned Bullinger, I wanted to suggest to you so that you may see to it and beware lest the simple truth of Christ, and the stumbling block to the church of Christ, suffer any harm. Farewell, most excellent and esteemed in Christ Bullinger, and kindly consider my childishness or impudence. From Memmingen, the day before the Nones of March in the year of the birth of the Savior Christ 1555.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Bartholomäus Bertlin, minister of the church of Christ there.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the church of Zürich, his lord and friend to be esteemed in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
