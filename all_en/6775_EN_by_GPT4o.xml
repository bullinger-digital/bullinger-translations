      <p>My gracious lords understood, yet through the Landammann's (chief magistrate's) way, since they have no knowledge or written report that there is great discord or disunity among you because of the two elected bishops and that one of them, by the recognition of the two leagues, is supposed to take office these days, but the Gotteshaus (House of God) is dissatisfied, challenges the two leagues, and is dissatisfied with all matters in several places, and a Gotteshaus day has been scheduled for May 5th, etc. If this is the case, my gracious lords would be deeply saddened, and although they are inclined to send two council envoys to you, ready to speak and act for peace and unity and to seek the welfare of the common Confederation, they have, for the time being (since there is much talk), decided to delay this letter, sending Flury Gerstern, their citizen and trusted one, to you beforehand with a friendly request that you thoroughly inform my lords, the mayors, of all matters concerning this action. For whatever my gracious lords can do that serves the welfare of you all and the good peace of the common Confederation, they are sincerely and willingly disposed. You can discuss all this with my gracious lord, Mayor Ambrosius Martin, and let us know your prompt response. Zurich, May 4th, 1566.</p>
