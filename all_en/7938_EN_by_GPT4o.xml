      <p>Greetings. D. D. Haller, my dearest and closest brother, has delivered your letters to me, dear brother, and it has been agreed between us that, when I am unable to write due to illness or business, he will take my place, and I, in turn, when I can, will write on behalf of both of us, which I am doing now, and I greet you most kindly on his behalf. The disaster of the Italians, who are said to have been slaughtered to the point of annihilation, is also confirmed among us.</p>
      <p>However, since false reports have deceived us so many times, I am uncertain what to believe about this as well, until I have more certain information. If they have been slaughtered, it is a double sin, both because they fought under the pope's blessing against the heretics and because they considered themselves alone capable of exterminating the crowd of heretics. They say the queen mother appears more sorrowful than ever before, evidently because the pope sent these select sons of hers to France at her intervention, and because men of great renown are said to have been killed. I am sending enclosed here information about the state of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and the Netherlands, not as doubtful, but as quite certain; for I received it from Mr. Mont, a most distinguished man who lives in Strasbourg and is the secretary of the Queen of England, who regularly receives messengers going to and from England. He is a singular friend of mine and a most prudent man, whom the Lord bless.</p>
      <p>You can present or share this with the consuls, Karl, Pontasella, Mr. Ruinella, Ganthner, and our other friends, whom you will greet in order.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you with your dear wife, children, and your whole household. My Aernius sends you his most friendly regards and wishes you all good things. If you have any news from Italy, please write, I beg you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 29, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
