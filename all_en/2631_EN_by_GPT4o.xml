      <p>Greetings. By chance, having returned home from my reading, dearest godfather in the Lord, I encountered the bookseller from Aarau, whose services I was pleased to use to send my Romans to you.</p>
      <p>He, out of his kindness, willingly provided this service. I am sending, therefore, what I would have sent long ago if it had been possible by some convenient means. I pray that, considering the spirit of a brother more than the gift itself, you may regard whatever this is of my gratitude towards you kindly. If you find anything while reading that requires refinement, either correct it yourself or let me know.</p>
      <p>I hope that your household, by the grace of the Lord, is safe and continues its course without hindrance in a comfortable and peaceful state. Mine, by the same grace, is not inconvenient. Let us commend the state of the churches to the Lord. The ministers of them continue to be so spirited that, unless the Lord changes their minds, they themselves may not bring more harm than those who, with united minds, were most eagerly intent on storming the enemy camps. If peace is established between the Emperor and the French, we will see great disturbances of affairs.</p>
      <p>The bishops, along with Ferdinand, are striving for the continuation of the Council of Trent, and the Emperor is entirely focused on imposing his son on the empire. May the Lord scatter the plans of the princes. Amen, amen. Farewell excellently, dearest godfather in the Lord. Greetings to your household, to the lords and brothers there, to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalther, and the others.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you, especially Johannes Heinrichulus, your godson in the Lord. Bern, 1555, May 6th.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
