  <input>Volcatio Ionero, abbati et moecenati [!] dignissimo, gratia et pax multiplicetur. De loco Mathei 20 [1 ff] quae citra praeiuditium sentimus quaeque tu a nobis efflagitas, paucissimis sic accipe.

Audierat Petrus apud homines non esse possibile ut quisquam salvus fieri possit [Mt 19,23ff], apud solum deum id plenissime collocatum depositumque esse, hoc est salutem non contingere ex hominum meritis, sed tantum ex gratia, munificentia et liberalitate dei. Qua re motus Symeon Petrus ait: Quid igitur, domine? Nunquid frustraneum, quod te sumus sequti omnibus relictis? Nunquid ceteris excellentiores erimus [Mt 19,27]? Putaveramus profecto nos multo amplissimum praemium recepturos, igitur nunc primum audimus, quod omnia hominum opera sunt frustranea?

Huic respondet Christus principio esse et contingere sanctis praemium, sed id quidem non ob opera aut merita, sed tantum ob gratiam, quae omnes ex aequo aequali praemiat praemio et monet, ne ob vocationem sive fructus vocationi dignos sive Symeon sive alius quispiam efferatur, eo quod multi deiiciantur, qui sibi firmissime stare videntur, et rursus multi abeuntes vocentur iacentesque erigantur ad dominum. Verum ista quam dilucidissime et copiosissime prosequitur similitudine, ne qua verbis inesset obscuritas; et sic docuimus in «Propheta» nostro adhiberi parabolas. Est ergo paterfamilias deus, qui ceu diligens et fidus paterfamilias providentia sua omnia regit et adornat. Porro vinea regnum est evangelicum, quod ut in Christum palmitem unicum innititur, imo vitem veram, sic a patre in hoc putatur, ut in fide, charitate et patientia vitaeque innocentia pulcherrimos ferat botros. Iam quemadmodum paterfamilias primis et novissimis idem praecium pendit, imo et primos acriter carpit, postremos benigne adloquitur, sic deus omnes ex aequo vita aeterna donat et aliquoties primos et fideles et qui sibi ceteris videbantur fortiores corripit, in peccata trudit, penitus confundit, ut sese agnoscant nec efferantur, postremos vero in atiem producit, ut misericordiam dei decantent et nos gratiam laudemus et agnoscamus. Illius exemplum est David et Petrus, huius vero Magdalena et Zacheus. Proinde nemo desperare, nemo debet efferri. Et quemadmodum praemium non contingit iuxta laborum quantitatem, sed tantum ex patrisfamilias pacto, sic iustitia nobis non contingit ex merito, opere, aut labore nostro, sed tantum ex pacto, hoc est ex providentia et gratia. De qua re vide Roma. 9 [6 ff] et Ephe. 1 [4ff]. Quod si murmuras, iam respondet dominus: «Amice, non facio tibi iniuriam» etc. [Mt 20, 13]. Quemadmodum etiam Paulus: «Quis prior dedit illi?» etc. [Röm 11, 35]. Et rursus: «Nunquid dicet figmentum ei, qui se finxit» etc. [Röm 9,20].

Porro similitudinem illam elegantissimam gemina claudit γνώμαι (sententia). Prior: «Sic novissimi erunt primi» etc. [Mt 20,16]. Quasi diceret:Discite ergo hac parabola non sperare in opera, quando unum est omnium praemium aequale, discite non sperare in vosmet ipsos; nolite efferri, si quid boni fecistis, sed timete, nam deiici potestis: Roma. 11 [20]. Posterior: «Multi enim sunt vocati» etc. [Mt 20,16]; quae priorem interpraetatur, ut geminarum sententiarum mos est, quasi velit dicere: Nam certissime vobis dico, quod non omnes, quibus verbum praedicatur quique se credere putant et multa operantur, salvi fiunt, sed qui electi sunt ab aeterno et qui in corde trahuntur. Roma. 8 [29], 9 [6ff], Ioan. 6 [44], 2. Thessalo. 3 [5].

  <output>Greetings to Volcatio Ionero, most worthy abbot and patron! May grace and peace be multiplied to you. Regarding the passage from Matthew 20 [1 ff], which we discuss without prejudice and which you request from us, accept it in a few words.

Peter had heard that it was not possible for anyone to be saved among men [Mt 19,23ff], and that salvation was placed and laid up with God alone, that is, salvation does not come from the merits of men, but only from the grace, generosity, and liberality of God. Therefore, moved by this, Simon Peter said: What then, Lord? Have we followed you for nothing, having left everything behind us? Shall we be more excellent than others [Mt 19,27]? Surely we thought we would receive a most abundant reward, but now we hear for the first time that all human works are in vain?

To this, Christ responds that a reward is given to the saints, but not because of their works or merits, but only because of grace, which rewards all equally with the same reward and admonishes not to be puffed up by the call or by fruits worthy of the call, whether it be Simon or someone else, because many are made to stumble who seem to stand firm for themselves, and again many who go away are called and those lying down are raised up to the Lord. But He explains this very clearly and copiously with a similitude, so that there is no obscurity in His words; and so we taught in our “Prophet” to use parables. So there is a father of a household, which is God, who governs and adorns all things with His providence as a diligent and faithful father of a household. Moreover, the vineyard is the evangelical kingdom, which is put by the Father in this way, so that it may bear beautiful clusters in faith, charity and patience, and in the innocence of life, as it relies on the only true vine, that is, Christ. Now, as a father of a household pays the same price to the first and the last, and even sharply rebukes the first, while speaking kindly to the last, so God grants eternal life to all alike and sometimes severely corrects the first and the faithful, who seemed to be stronger than the others, and casts them into their sins, utterly confounds them, so that they may recognize themselves and not be puffed up, while He brings the last forth into eternity, so that they may sing of the mercy of God, and we may praise and recognize the grace. The example of the former is David and Peter, and that of the latter is Mary Magdalene and Zacchaeus. Therefore, let no one despair, and let no one be puffed up. And just as the reward does not come according to the quantity of labor, but only according to the agreement of the father of the household, so righteousness does not come to us from our merit, work or labor, but only from the agreement, that is, from the providence and grace. Regarding this, see Romans 9 [6 ff] and Ephesians 1 [4 ff]. If you murmur, the Lord already responds: “Friend, I do you no wrong” etc. [Mt 20, 13]. Just as Paul says: “Who has first given to Him?” etc. [Röm 11, 35]. And again: “Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it?” etc. [Röm 9,20].

Furthermore, He closes this most elegant similitude with two gnomes (sentences). The first: “So the last shall be first” etc. [Mt 20,16]. As if He wanted to say: Learn then from this parable not to hope in works, when there is one equal reward for all, learn not to hope in yourselves; do not be puffed up if you have done something good, but fear, for you may be made to stumble: Romans 11 [20]. The second: “For many are called” etc. [Mt 20,16], which interprets the former, as is the custom of double sentences, as if He wanted to say: For I tell you for certain that not all those to whom the word is preached and who think they believe and do many works are saved, but only those who are elected from eternity and who are drawn in their heart. Romans 8 [29], 9 [6ff], John 6 [44], 2 Thessalonians 3 [5].

Farewell.</output>
