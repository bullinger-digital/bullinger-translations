      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, has been delivered to us; I am very glad to hear that you are all well. I sent what I had received from Italy in the meantime with the relative of Mr. Gesner, and I have no doubt that you have already read it.</p>
      <p>I also sent that writing and shared it with those with whom you wanted it to be shared.</p>
      <p>What I had written more obscurely about the island was reported to me as follows: there is a certain island, which is a day's journey from Genoa, and it is being occupied by the Turk. I could not quite guess which one it was, as I have no maps at hand.</p>
      <p>It is not likely that he holds the Sacconese promontory. There is anxiety in Genoa and Rome; this is certain.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have nothing except that the pope has imprisoned Carafa on June 7th, and indeed it is written that a cardinal ensured his arrest in the consistory. The reason is said to be that, when the pope had dined with his men in the garden of Julius the day before, Carafa's men were seen armed in the same garden. Rumors of Emperor Ferdinand's death are continually brought to us from Innsbruck. This is all for now.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and all yours safe. Chur, July 8th, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius Montanus. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
