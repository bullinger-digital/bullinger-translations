      <p>Greetings. The papal nuncio, if it pleases God, has not yet arrived; it is said that he is ill, but nevertheless he will come soon, once he has recovered. We have informed our lords here; however, we have not spoken harshly against him, lest the papists might perhaps say that we fear his presence. Nevertheless, the Lord of Bayonne has warned the lords of the Three Leagues that the mission is insidious and that his faith is not as sincere as something else, which might disturb us; that the Emperor (whose faction this mission belongs to) has often, under the pretext of faith, contrived and introduced great and pernicious things to the world; therefore, our compatriots should be cautious and not allow this papal envoy to reach our borders. - Vergerius has greatly offended the brothers, especially those in Clavenna, by sending Brentius's interpreted pamphlets to Italy, since all Italians have a good understanding of the sacrament, but he now offers them something else, by which they might indeed falter. Wishing to remedy this, he is considering another edition to be printed there. I would like to meet with the envoy here, so that he might forge more serious matters, leaving aside such papers that contain almost nothing but exclamations. The Lord of Bayonne sent me his letters three days ago, which I should send to you; receive them here. We hear nothing from Italy, except that a truce has been agreed there between the Emperor and the French for one month. Farewell, most esteemed man, with all good things. Father Comander and Tscherner greet you, who diligently inquire daily about the merchants from Como known to them. From Chur, on the 12th of September, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your kind Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>We give thanks for the English catechism. I had heard about Servetus's blasphemies before; if only they were not in the Valtellina!</p>
      <p>To the great man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother, preacher of the divine word, etc., in Zurich. To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and brother in Christ.</p>
