      <p>Although on the 19th day of the month of February I wrote to your excellency through Rodolphus Keller from Zürich, nevertheless, for the sake of declaring greater love and devotion, I did not hesitate to add these as well.</p>
      <p>And indeed, I understand it to be my duty to write to your excellency as often as possible, so that I may thus testify to my gratitude for your excellency's infinite merits, but this my will and zeal are hindered by severe and prolonged illnesses, from which I am not even now able to escape. Our boys of Mr. Czikovius also enjoy adverse fortune here.</p>
      <p>However, we hope to return to our homeland shortly. Our Tretius arrived in Poland at the very time, as he writes to me, received with great congratulations by the more sincere church of Kraków, and immediately sent in the name of the Christian assembly of Kraków to the diet, to resist those disturbers of religion, who had already gathered there with the intention of drawing the rest after them, and furthermore to carry a mission to the king and the very orders of the kingdom concerning the matters of the Kraków ecclesiastical assembly.</p>
      <p>When he came to his own at the diet in Warsaw, the opposing party immediately began to riot and attempted, as it were, by certain skirmishes to test the strength and arms of Tretius against them.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the kingdom, who have given their name to Christ, later ordered them to descend into a conference. There I hear Tretius stood most beautifully together with his remaining colleagues.</p>
      <p>Tretius himself also adds in his letters to me that the opposing party outnumbered us, but not in truth.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, on the very day of Christ's nativity, those wolves rushed to disturb the sermon of the pastor of the Christian assembly. However, the men of the primary nobility soon restrained them, and from the sermon, a conference was again held, but in such a way that the gentile party departed confused and no longer came there for the sake of conferencing. The king also, when he hears these things are happening and learns the cause, immediately orders the table of Gregor Paul, the minister of the Kraków apostates, publicly for sale, to be torn from the bookseller in the market place, where the executioner flogs the notorious, and to be burned.</p>
      <p>And this was done not without the ignominy of the enemies. Tretius hopes that by the edict of the diet, those heretics, especially the foreigners, will be banished.</p>
      <p>I would indeed wish for them sulfur baths, but not those which are in your Baden, to which I myself would now gladly be sent in exile, if it could be done in any way, for the sake of curing the scabies, with which among other things I have been greatly and for a long time afflicted. I would add more about Tretius, but since I do not doubt that he himself will write more copiously about everything to your excellency, therefore, leaving these aside, I will touch on the rest very briefly... Today again, before I began to write this line, letters were brought to me from Tretius, in which he indicates that day by day there is a greater accession or edification of the nobles in the diet, so that we now have palatines, as they call them, in the Christian assembly, and fourteen castellans, an infinite number of other nobles. However, the opposing party has seduced none of the magnates except for Radziwiłł the Lithuanian.</p>
      <p>No one is a supporter of their synagogue except this one alone. Furthermore, Tretius says that the king supports our side and has already given a certain church in Kraków for the assemblies to gather.</p>
      <p>For until now, sermons were held in the halls of the nobles. The same Tretius says a messenger will come to your churches after the Easter festival on the business of the church.</p>
      <p>The king has especially prohibited the printing of Arian or gentile works in Kraków. These things were written hastily and in illness, so I earnestly ask that your paternal piety may consider them fairly and kindly.</p>
      <p>May your excellency deign to greet all our people there most dutifully.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, most excellently and happily.</p>
      <p>In Leipzig, on the very Sunday of judgment 1564.</p>
