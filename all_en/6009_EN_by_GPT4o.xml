      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless you, your dear wife, and your entire household, and grant you a most prosperous year!</p>
      <p>I am deeply troubled; I hear something about the betrayal of your city, though I do not know what.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, others assert that by God's grace the betrayal has been uncovered and many have been imprisoned.</p>
      <p>I pray and beseech you to relieve us of our anxiety and explain what is happening.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if you have any news about French affairs, how Admiral's matters stand, and how the business of the churches is proceeding, please inform me.</p>
      <p>Various rumors are disturbing us.</p>
      <p>They say cardinals are being summoned from Italy, pressing and entangling everything with their schemes and causing confusion.</p>
      <p>Then, in the king's court, it is said that Cardinal of the Cross and Cardinal of Ferrara are attempting many things: from the city of Reims or Nancy, the Cardinal of Lorraine is also said to be providing his counsel.</p>
      <p>I believe these are the three frogs mentioned in the Apocalypse.</p>
      <p>May God destroy them and preserve the king with the church.</p>
      <p>If only the king would hang those imprisoned troublemakers from the trees.</p>
      <p>Then even in the middle of winter, the trees would bloom beautifully.</p>
      <p>You will read the history of Ochino from the enclosed letter. I ask you to return this and the one I sent in my recent letters to you, both safely and quickly.</p>
      <p>We hear that Ochino has reached Schaffhausen, and there he encountered the Cardinal of Lorraine, who was hurrying from the council to Lorraine, and offered him his Dialogues to read, which he called the 30 truths.</p>
      <p>Lorraine received the book from him, but with the condition that if he did not like it, he would burn it immediately.</p>
      <p>Ochino added that he had observed 24 errors in the Evangelical churches, which he would be willing to demonstrate to him if he wished.</p>
      <p>Lorraine replied: it would be too much if there were four at most, then you would not add twenty, and turned away from him.</p>
      <p>It is said that he is heading to Plurs, which is in Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>To neglect nothing, I immediately wrote to Chur, Samaden, and Chiavenna to the magistrate and ministers, and advised them to be vigilant and beware of this wolf expelled from Zurich and Basel.</p>
      <p>I added the entire history and now receive letters from Chur that the magistrate does not want him to remain in Rhaetia, etc.</p>
      <p>They say that Darius and Camillus have left here for Constance and that Ochino has also gone there; for we did not want to tolerate Camillus Socinus and Darius living here. On December 28, Castellio died in Basel, which the good rejoice at, and the perverse minds are saddened; but the Lord always watches over his own and the church.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent has been dissolved.</p>
      <p>They celebrated the eighth session on November 11; decrees were made about marriage that are considered rotten.</p>
      <p>Cardinal of Lorraine recited blessings on December 3 and 4, to which he added curses against heretics, with the council acclaiming and approving with a voice of assent; he ordered in the name of the council that no one should leave before the conclusion, though he himself had to leave soon for very serious and unavoidable reasons.</p>
      <p>Therefore, on December 3, the council was concluded, and the ninth and final session was held, with decrees issued on the invocation and veneration of saints, on relics and holy images, on purgatory, on indulgences, on observing the decrees of this council, as well as on catechism and the missal and breviary.</p>
      <p>They also confirmed the index of the Roman Church published on heretics; in it, the names of Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, etc., are read.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Como sent these to the Bishop of Chur. A good man (which I want to tell you) read and wrote the summary of things to me. They say they are now consulting on the execution of the council and the suppression of heretics.</p>
      <p>While I write this, I receive letters from the illustrious Count Ulysses Martinengo.</p>
      <p>He indicates that their plans for the execution of the council will proceed with difficulty; for the unrest in Calabria has not been settled, but is growing more and more.</p>
      <p>The Turk is preparing a fleet, and Naples greatly fears his incursion.</p>
      <p>The Venetians are also said to be preparing, as their envoy was forced to return home from Constantinople and could not speak to the emperor or the first pasha.</p>
      <p>These things are perhaps being pretended by those scoundrels, so that we may not be on our guard.</p>
      <p>I wrote this very hastily and did not reread it. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 6, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Jonvill, Budaeus, Crispin, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Th√©odore Beza, faithful minister of the Geneva church, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
