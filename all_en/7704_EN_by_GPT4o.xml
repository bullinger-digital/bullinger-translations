      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I thank you and Susanna for the veal, sausages, and birds; there are too many birds. The meat and sausages, as I understand, you raised yourself; but the birds you must have bought expensively. I do not like it when you have expenses with us, I would much prefer you save and be frugal in small and large matters.</p>
      <p>I can well recognize your love and loyalty in this, thank you truly for it; yet I am always concerned when I must worry that you have expenses. We are otherwise quite beggars here, we find neither in the butcher's shop nor at the fish market anything proper; one must offer 3 shillings for a pound of veal next to the butcher's shop, and even more expensively, and yet one does not find it, even less so the fish. But it must go this way where there is anarchy, as in the Confederation, where everyone does what they want.</p>
      <p>We have not yet heard anything substantial here about the great battle in France; if they have won, we will soon have to hear it with great pomp. The Turk also wins everything, and yet he is the Turk and remains the Turk. If God wants to give and allow us to endure it, we should take it patiently and remain steadfast in the truth, caring little for worldly pomp; Babylon will also receive its judgment in due time. If I hear anything substantial about the battle, I will let you know with the first messenger.</p>
      <p>The evangelical cities have not agreed and will not agree, as I trust in God. The alliance cannot do it either, and no help is owed. I have not heard anything about the uprising in WÃ¼rzburg. Your godmother's situation is very bad; for the disease is incurable and completely hardened; she also has many attacks with fevers; if she becomes restless, the man will completely ruin her. As much as I can, I want to do the best for her, but I will not involve myself in the matter of the property and inheritance; it is not my place. She has friends who are better suited for this than I am. Return the letter to the Palatine about the excommunication and the booklet about our ancestors and family, etc. Young Hans von Ulm, along with his wife, is traveling through here (as I hear) to Lucerne; from there he will probably bring the news of the famous victory of the giants. You have sent so much wine there that it is not possible that you still have 80 loads belonging to you; yet whatever you have, keep it well together and be frugal. God be with you; greet Susanna and Elsili, your household. All our people greet you.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a piece of cheese here; take it as a gift. I will now distribute the sausages, meat, and birds as you have written and send the letter and part of it to your godmother, where she will gladly receive joy and work; may God grant her grace. Dear one, what did Stoffel Margstaller say about my letter? Do you think he also takes it well?</p>
      <p>God be with you all.</p>
      <p>Given on Wednesday, December 15, 1568.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
