    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast thanks Bullinger for his letter [not received] and his gift of a book [the commentary on Luke]. Unfortunately, he cannot adequately reciprocate for the latter. Currently, he can only send a small, poorly printed gift in return [Oecolampadius's "Conciones in Epistolam ad Colossenses"].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- There are many rumors circulating, and everyone tells things as they wish them to be. However, the following is certain:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The authorities in Ensisheim have imposed a tax of 12,000 guilders on their clergy. To pay this contribution, the clergy were allowed to pawn church property. The clergy are cooperating because they support the eradication of the Protestants. Ensisheim is being fortified with bulwarks made of tree trunks. The peasants were obliged to do this work. Furthermore, each of them must have at least two sacks of flour as a reserve in their house. One can imagine what that means! Hopefully, the people of Basel will still find flour [in the region's markets].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A man from Worms [...] reported that the [Dutch] cavalry intended for Emperor Charles V still could not cross the heavily guarded Rhine as of August 27. This army is also said to be not as large as claimed (only about 1,600 horsemen and 2,000 foot soldiers). What is it supposed to achieve? It can only be a burden on the Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Margrave [Bernhard von Baden-Durlach?] is said to be mustering in Rötteln. For what purpose is unknown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The city of Freiburg [im Breisgau] is working on its fortifications.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letter along with the book, a most welcome gift. However, it pains me that I currently have nothing with which I could express my gratitude for your generosity. Perhaps there will soon be an opportunity for mutual exchange. I am also sending a gift, but it is small and poorly printed, so that you may recognize my love for you.</p>

      <p>I have nothing new; I see that these rumors flying around are very vain, and as each person is inclined, so they speak. But this is certain: The authorities in Ensisheim have imposed a tax on the clergy, that they should pay 12,000 guilders in a short time; they are allowed, so that no one complains of the burden, to pawn and mortgage the church properties. The clergy are quite satisfied with this, so that the Protestants are eradicated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The people of Ensisheim are bringing many trees to their little town, with which they want to make a bulwark. All the peasants must work with great damage. Also, they have ordered that the peasants have their grain milled. Each must have at least two sacks of flour in his house. What that means can be well understood. I hope, however, that when we go down, we will have enough flour.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have also heard today from a man from Worms that the cavalry had not yet crossed the Rhine as of August 27; there are many lies. There are also not so many of them, for it is credibly written that there are not more than 1,600 horsemen and not more than 2,000 foot soldiers. What do they want to accomplish? They are a burden on the Archbishop of Mainz, consuming what is there; the church property must endure...</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Margrave of Rötteln has had his troops mustered. Where he wants to go, no one knows.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The people of Freiburg are also preparing with bulwarks, so that they may stand firm. May God send all things for the best.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet Dr. Theodor and the other brothers in my name. I wanted to write this to you, so you do not accuse me of negligence.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 5, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, G.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful bishop of the church in Zurich, etc. Zurich.</p>
