    <p xml:id="regest1">Continues his report on the Worms Religious Discussion [see No. 1455]. Until January 13 [1541], the struggle was not about the individual contentious articles, but about the distribution of votes and the mode of negotiation; [Philipp] Melanchthon and [Johannes] Eck were appointed as colloquents of the two parties. The individual points were treated in the order of the articles of the Confessio Augustana; there was quick agreement on the first article [concerning the Trinity]; the discussion ignited over original sin, a point to which both parties attached great importance; underestimating the influence of original sin, according to the Protestants, leads to justification by works, which found - differently accented - opposition from Eck and [Ambrosius] Pelargus. Adjournment of the discussion on January 18 to the upcoming Regensburg Diet; departure of the participants on January 20. The majority of the estates are closer to the Protestant position; the Catholics are divided. Request to Comander to spread the news and forward it to Johannes Travers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have explained in previous letters what happened at the Diet of Worms up to Christmas Day. Now the assembly has been dissolved; therefore, it remains for me to add the conclusion. The debate continued until January 13, not about the controversial articles or doctrines, but about the casting of votes and the manner of negotiation. The opponents moved every stone to dislodge and oppress our people from their safe position with tricks and traps; however, our people, standing firmly in their place and order, overcame the adversaries with their sincerity, constancy, and determination. Finally, Melanchthon and Eck were appointed to speak on behalf of both parties, with others present only as listeners, unless a commissioner granted someone permission to interject. The essence of the debate was this: after presenting the Augsburg Confession to the Emperor, the opponents began to examine the articles in it in order. There was less agreement on Christ; for in the common formula of faith and the doctrines of the Trinity, no one raised any objections. The debate began on the third article: what remains in the saints after baptism from the original stain and the corruption of nature, whether it should truly be called sin, etc. This debate seemed to both parties to serve as a foundation for the confirmation of their doctrine. For if this power of contagion is not so great that it infests us throughout our lives, ready to destroy and overthrow as much as it exists in its nature, a very great doubt can arise about the merit of humans and the excellence of good works; on these matters, the greatest disputes exist between the parties. Therefore, our people believed that this matter should be handled with the utmost care. However, the adversaries did not have the same opinion on this matter. Some confessed that the remaining original sin and the sin it generates, and its natural opposition to divine law, and that the apostle speaks of this matter in this way, and therefore it is called sin; others openly opposed this opinion and testified that they would not concede this to us. Eck was in the former opinion, Pelargus in the latter; the other leaders followed them. While this was happening on January 18, a sudden mandate from the Emperor arrived, ordering everyone to hasten to the next Diet of Regensburg. Therefore, the Emperor's envoy, Lord Granvella, having now dismissed both the debate and the confirmation of opinions, and having returned the mandate to the parties, was the first of all to depart with great speed the day after, as soon as it was light enough. On the same day, which was January 19, with all public meetings omitted by both parties, everyone prepared for departure. Finally, the next day, everyone left. Thus, this assembly had a debate of three and a half days, while the preparation for the debate lasted almost three months. This was the end of this assembly. Therefore, the greater part of the imperial estates either stands with us or has now so detected the tricks of the adversaries that they are more favorable to us than to them. For it is incredible to say how confused the adversaries are with confusion. It is reported about the Emperor's envoy that not without frustration, when he saw our people holding together more strongly day by day, and the adversaries continually splitting and quarreling among themselves, he said: "I do not know what to do or where to begin; for just as no one can separate the evangelicals, so no one can unite my people." This is what I had to write at present, most learned Comander; you will share it with the brothers, and then send it to the most illustrious man, D. Johannes Travers, with the next available messenger. For being entangled and hindered by business, I could not write separately to each. Farewell and pray to the Lord for us. Greet the brothers. ZÃ¼rich, February 18, 1541. Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, D. Johannes Comander, Bishop of Chur, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
