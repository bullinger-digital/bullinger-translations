    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If Bullinger possesses the writing about the Spanish Inquisition ["Newe zeytung auß dem Niderland"], it is the one that Myconius means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Italian [...] described the person he encountered [from the Five Places] (whose name he did not mention) as slender, long-bearded, and with a thin voice. Therefore, Myconius suspected that it might be Nikolaus [probably Jost von Meggen]. But no matter, the behavior of the [Five Places] is indecent! The Lord will punish them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] According to [Johannes] Gast, Wilhelm von Fürstenberg is said to have pursued a convoy of 200 men from Emperor [Charles V.], killed all but the last man, and brought the equipment to the camp [of the Schmalkaldic League]. Allegedly, he also drove many of the Emperor's men from a hill. Yet everything seems questionable, as Bullinger reports nothing about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Myconius initially also believed the rumor that the troops of [King] Ferdinand [I.] stationed at Bregenz had crossed the Rhine, set villages on fire, and plundered Rorschach. But after some consideration, he no longer believed it. For if there had been an enemy attack, the storm bells would have been rung immediately, and such a crowd would have gathered that something would have happened about which more precise reports could be made.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It was said that the Bohemians are armed and threatening [Electorate] Saxony. When someone [...] asked where King Ferdinand was, the present [Francisco de] Enzinas replied: "With his wife." Everyone had to laugh, despite the sad mood.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger, who is very well informed, should report whether [Sebastian] Schertlin is still in Augsburg. The people of Ulm have behaved with strong faith! It is strange that no one can successfully resist the schemes of the inhuman, even devilish Emperor! Myconius recently said that if the Emperor is not resisted head-on, he will completely devastate Germany, even if the [Schmalkaldic League] conducts the war ever so skillfully.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger writes nothing about the resolutions of the long meeting [of the Four Protestant Places in Zurich]! If there were good decisions that must be kept silent, Myconius submits to this decision. But if others have learned something about it, he would like to know as well. Unfortunately, only Bernhard [Meyer zum Pfeil] and the city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] share news with him. Some councilors even openly hold the opinion that nothing should be told to the [Protestant] "priests" because they would otherwise blurt it out from the pulpit and thereby only frighten the people or drive them crazy with joy, which is of course not true. Recently, the councilors did send a document through the city clerk to the [preachers], which was to be read from the pulpit to encourage the people to pray. But since then, nothing more has been heard...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] May the Lord put an end to the present misery! Greetings, also to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>If you have the Holy Spanish Inquisition, you have what I mentioned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Nikolaus the Italian described him as follows: He is a tall man, with a long and ample beard and a thin voice. He did not add a name. From the description, I guessed it was him. But truly, whoever it is, they are acting indecently. The Lord will avenge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Gastius said that the Emperor had sent ahead, I don't know where, his equipment along with 200 Spaniards; that Wilhelm von Fürstenberg received it and followed, found them, attacked, and killed them to the last man, and took the equipment to the camp. The same Wilhelm is said to have bravely driven a large crowd from a hill occupied by the Emperor's men and earned praise. But since you are silent about these things, they are suspect.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, a rumor came so consistently that at first, I was persuaded that Ferdinand's troops had crossed the Rhine at Bregenz, set villages on fire, and plundered Rorschach. But then I could not believe it, as I know the habits of those people; for as soon as an enemy attack is known, the alarm bells would have rung, and such a number would have gathered that the matter would have been known not by rumor, but by truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Another rumor now flies: the Bohemians are armed and threatening Saxony. While this was being told, Dryander was present. And when someone asked where Ferdinand was, he immediately replied: "With his wife." It made everyone laugh, even though we were speaking sadly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We wonder if Schertlius is still with the people of Augsburg. I think you know everything, so I ask this too. But the people of Ulm have acted excellently, so we see that there are strong men in the Lord there too. It is strange that no one can adequately counter the schemes of this man. I believe he is a devil, not a man, or at least claimed by the devil. Therefore, as I recently said, unless he is faced head-on, he will devastate Germany most miserably, no matter how successfully our people fight. Come, the Lord will make the schemes finally cease! We will therefore pray to Him that He does not withhold His hand and strength from us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You say nothing about this meeting. Strange! For I think something was done, as they lasted together for so long. May the Lord have been present with the consultants! If they consulted successfully and wish it to remain silent, I agree; nor do I wish to know, whatever it is. But if otherwise, I would like to know what others know. I learn nothing from our people, unless I come alone to Lord Bernhard or to the scribe. There are those among them who dare to say openly: "None of this should be told to our priests; they immediately proclaim everything from the pulpit and either terrify the people or drive them mad with joy." And although they say this falsely, they have brought the matter to the point that nothing is disclosed to us by the council. Recently, moved by some spirit, they sent certain things through the scribe for us to read, so that we could better rouse the people to pray. Afterwards, they again remained silent and are silent until the Lord commands otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ put an end to the present evils at some point, I pray! Farewell in Christ with yours and Gwalther. Basel, October 29, 1546. Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, a great man, his lord in Christ, to be honored. Zurich.</p>
