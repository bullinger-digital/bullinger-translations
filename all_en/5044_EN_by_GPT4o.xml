      <p>Greetings. If you are unaware: The King of Navarre requested that some learned men be sent to him by the German princes. I know for certain that the Duke of Württemberg sent Beurlin, the Elector Palatine sent Diller and Boquin; about others, whether they sent anyone and whom they sent, I do not know. I hear that the Synod of Lüneburg condemned the Wittenbergers and especially Peucer.</p>
      <p>What I wrote to you in previous days about the efforts of the Lutherans and the Augsburg Confession being imposed on the French is confirmed more and more every day. I have good hope regarding the Elector Palatine and the Landgrave of Hesse; various reports are made about others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I think we must again be vigilant and pray. The Rhaetian Diet has concluded.</p>
      <p>The envoys departed with great indignation; for they wasted their oil and effort. The Rhaetians remain steadfast in their religion.</p>
      <p>The Diet of the Hermits between the people of Glarus and the Five Cantons has also concluded. Certain terms of peace were again offered by the four judges, which cannot be accepted by the people of Glarus without the ruin of the true religion. I therefore think that the case must be settled either by the legal judgment of the judges or, God forbid, by arms. Some princes in Germany had begun to enlist soldiers, whom they are now dismissing again; we have not yet been able to clearly ascertain the reason for this. I commend to you, my esteemed lord, Christopher Trecius of Poland; he is upright and there is great hope for him. He loves and respects you; he will winter with you to hear you.</p>
      <p>If you love him and support his studies, you will serve all of Poland; he is loved by the best, etc. Farewell, dearest brother, along with your fellow ministers and brothers, especially Mr. Roset.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>If you have any news from France, share it; I have heard nothing since your last letter. Zurich, October 31, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
