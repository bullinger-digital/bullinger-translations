    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast can only send the book catalog once he has scoured all the printing houses. Bullinger will receive the edition of Boethius' works with the book shipment for [Christoph] Froschauer. Gast will also enclose a letter from Gilbert Cousin to Bullinger and to [Rudolf] Gwalther with the shipment. [Any] replies to Cousin can be gladly forwarded by Gast, as Cousin's brother [Antoine?] will be back in Basel by Easter [April 25].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- According to reports from some merchants, [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa has captured the King of Tunis [Caliph Ahmed III]. "Algeria" is occupied, and the Spaniards are in danger. Therefore, Emperor [Charles V] is hurrying to Regensburg to settle the religious matter and from there to proceed to Italy and Spain. If only he would never return! He is also plagued by physical ailments, and he has poor advisors who, out of fear that they might miss something, do not accept good advice.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am not sending the catalog of books now because I have not yet scoured all the printing houses. However, I will soon send not only the list of books but also anything else you wish. I have included the works of Boethius in a container, which you will receive with the books for Froschauer. You will also receive letters from our Gilbert both to you and to Gwalther; if you wish to write to him, you can send your letters to me before the Easter festival. For on the very day of Easter, Gilbert's brother will return to us to purchase newly printed books.</p>

      <p>I have nothing new except some uncertain news. Some merchants have spread the word that the King of Tunis has been captured by Barbarossa and that the island of Algeria is besieged, and the Spaniards are in danger. Therefore, the Emperor is hurrying to Regensburg to settle the church's business in some way, then he will proceed through Italy to Spain. If only he would never return with the same mindset he has had so far! He is overwhelmed by various calamities, burdened by the cross in his very body, yet he makes light of all God's threats and plagues. He has the worst and impious advisors who do not accept good counsel; they fear that something might be taken from them. May the Lord illuminate them with the light of truth, so they do not perish in perpetual darkness. Amen.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Basel, March 7, 1546. Greet Theodor with Pellican and Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent pastor of the church in Zurich, his friend and perpetual lord to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
