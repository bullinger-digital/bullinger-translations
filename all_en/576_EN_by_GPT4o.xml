      <p>Greetings. As soon as you recommended me to Mr. Hochholtzer and indeed to Mr. Haller, I want you to know that shortly before my arrival at the Aargau school, a certain young prefect from Basel [Lienhard Meyer?] was appointed. Therefore, having set out for Bern, I was recommended to the magistrate by the brothers. The magistrate, moreover, promised to look out for me at the first opportunity; Mr. Haller, however, undertook to send my letter of appointment to you. Therefore, I ask you, my lord, to add this to your other favors towards me: if the letters reach you, please ensure they are delivered to either Bischofszell or Konstanz to my brother Lütfrid Jung.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve both you and your church along with your family in His peace. These few words to you for now from the journey; otherwise, I hope there will be an opportunity to write more extensively. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, July 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Johannes Jung, now of Bischofszell.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious Antistes of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
