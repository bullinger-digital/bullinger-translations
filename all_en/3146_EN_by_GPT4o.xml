      <p>Greetings. We all wish, dearest brother in the Lord, that you have arrived safely in Chur with everything in order, and we hope to soon understand this from your letters. By God's grace, we are all well here; may you and yours also be well. Oporinus has published these two orations of mine, which I had given to him as a gift. He sent me a few copies; therefore, I am sending one to you and to Mr. Philipp, and another to Mr. Friedrich von Salis, which you would kindly send safely to him in Samaden, wrapped and covered with these my letters. It was announced the day before yesterday from Augsburg that the imperial diet has concluded and that a colloquium to settle the conflicting religions is to be held in August in Worms. I think it will either be held with no benefit or not at all; for King Ferdinand, with his Spanish disposition, gladly uses postponements; and the foolish Germans, having been deceived so many times, do not even now understand. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet most diligently our Mr. Gallicius, the consuls, the treasurer, Pontasella, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius Montanus, minister of the church in Chur, compatriot and dear brother. To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
