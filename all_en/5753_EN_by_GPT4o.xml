      <p>Greetings. I wanted to add these few words hastily, most illustrious man, so that you may understand that Mr. Calvin is still tormented by colic and kidney pains.</p>
      <p>How grave and bitter this is to me, I cannot express in words; my sorrow was truly increased when I saw how distressing it was for him that he could not write to you, nor even dictate due to the severity of his illness, and I know how much he values you, as you deserve.</p>
      <p>I can hardly write this without tears.</p>
      <p>For me, nothing can be more pleasing than when he is able to dictate something that I can convey to you, because I am convinced that you take great delight in his letters.</p>
      <p>You, most humane man, forgive your Jonvilliers if he adds this; for I preferred to pour out whatever this is rather than remain silent, oppressed by grief, before you.</p>
      <p>I could have, I confess, remained completely silent; but I was compelled by your singular humanity to burst forth into these verses.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, commend him and all of us to God in your prayers and those of your entire church; in turn, we will commend you and the others to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man; I pray to God from the heart that He may keep you safe for a long time, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Brother Budaeus greets you reverently.</p>
      <p>If our Trecius has already left, I will be surprised that he has not written to me, especially since he has not responded to my last letters.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before the Nones of June 1563.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zurich church and most worthy of my respect.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
