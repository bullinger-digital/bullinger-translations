      <p>Greetings. It is incredible to say, venerable father in Christ, how much this matter torments me, to satisfy you; but I achieve nothing and I do not know what hope there is from me with those ceasing, who have promised their service both to you and to me. You know that Mr. Julius, Mr. Gadius, Balingketum, Traversium, and Frideric have taken this care upon themselves; but they have accomplished nothing yet. I earnestly ask you to consider this my excuse favorably; but I will not cease to do what I can. The young man whom you recommended to me and whom I assisted with letters as diligently as I could, I have earnestly entreated with prayers to take on this care; he has promised his efforts diligently. We hear nothing from Italy.</p>
      <p>The Pellizari, prominent merchants, stayed here; they did not say a word. Our consul Tscharnerus from St. Gallen and Feldkirch did not say a word about the council.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since I have nothing, I would not trouble you with my writing, unless I at least strive to prove my diligence to you in some way. About your diligence, my father, I have never, as far as I know, complained, which you seem to fear in your letters; that would be an impudent crime; indeed, I am ashamed that I do not cease to be a burden to you, whom I have no means to repay. If I ever complain about my fate, do not take it as if I am calling you to share in the blame. You write about Mr. Coignet, that he wrote letters to you from Solothurn, which surprises me, as it is certainly said among us that he is not safe. Our consul from St. Gallen saw the letters that Frölich wrote last month to a certain Tschudi, the prefect in Liechtensteig; in them, he boasts greatly about how much he has brought Mr. Coignet into disrepute with Guisium with words, and that Guisium said he was convinced of Coignet's treachery and would ensure he pays the deserved penalties. Therefore, I greatly fear that he is too credulous and may fall into the hands of his enemies, etc.</p>
      <p>The same consul brought very joyful news, which he received from the consul of St. Gallen, his relative, and which was said to have been announced from Antwerp by post to Isenacum, then written to the St. Gallen senate at the same time, while the consul was there: that Rogendorff with his men had defected from Guisium and, according to agreement and convention with the garrison of Orléans, had attacked the Guisians, who were preparing a siege, and had defeated 5000 of them. The story is long with all the circumstances, so that if it is fabricated, it had a sufficiently ingenious master; but since you have heard nothing, we do not believe it.</p>
      <p>It is fabricated, etc.; but the people of St. Gallen completely believed it. Now, as night falls, I go out and see that Finer, the old prefect, has returned from Milan, who had already returned, but stayed in Milan for almost a whole month. When I inquire extensively about his health and the state of Italy (for we were alone), he says that it is certain and well-known: the pope is in great danger in Rome; he has understood this from the magnates of that place. The pope is in great concern and great discord with the Duke of Ferrara; they are also greatly frightened in Milan by the arrival of the English in France.</p>
      <p>The provost, who was recently on a mission in our leagues, also complained (for they consider him a papist; but he is of neither kind); he fears that if their people lose in France, all the war will be drawn into Italy. Otherwise, it is remarkably expensive in Italy, everything is burned in the fields; it is thought that it has not been so expensive in 50 years. He knows nothing about the council, except that those coming from there say how godly and orderly it is proceeding and that they are looking towards France.</p>
      <p>Although these things are of no importance, I wanted to add them here so that you could see that I would like to write if I had anything. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and as long as possible. I do not write to Mr. Haller; I wish him and all yours well and to be excused to him; there was nothing to write. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, 21st of September, in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tscharner greets you respectfully, as do all other friends individually. Yours respectfully, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his reverend father in Christ.</p>
