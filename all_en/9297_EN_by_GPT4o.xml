      <p>S. P. The frequent and daily recollection of your merits in our affairs concerning Gaspar Coligny, the French admiral, most illustrious man, which comes to our mind day and night, has kept me so concerned that I thought I should not rest until I showed my grateful and appreciative spirit for their benefit with at least this token. For such was your kindness towards me and such was the great eagerness and readiness of spirit in managing and recommending their business, that I truly do not know what more effort and diligence could have been added to the utmost zeal I observed in you. Therefore, they attribute to you alone, above all, whatever kindness and hospitality was bestowed upon me there, and they pledge not the French faith indeed (for I am ashamed of the detestable treachery), but the faith that children born to pious parents, educated in the school of truth, and striving for the praise of paternal virtue ought to give, that their soul would sooner be freed from the bonds of the body than they would allow the memory of this kindness to be erased from their minds. As for me personally, indeed, as I had nothing more important than to see and greet such a renowned pastor of the church, most excellent in intellect, piety, and learning, so nothing was more pleasant to me than to converse with the same through letters as soon as it was possible. For although I know I must fear that, while I immoderately abuse the humanity and leisure of a most refined man and one most abundantly endowed with every praise of learning, I may sin against public interests, yet, being secure about other matters, I only thought about what my private duty impelled me to. Therefore, it will be your part, most distinguished man, to consider my zeal favorably and to grant me the pardon I request for my perhaps too hasty eagerness to testify my respect for you. There is a strange silence here about French affairs, unless perhaps it is true that the forces of the Dauphiné evangelicals are making excursions into the fields everywhere without opposition. The people of La Rochelle always conduct themselves vigorously, whom I hear have recently been relieved with supplies. Indeed, it is grievous to me that, when I came there, I presented some things to a most serious man as truths, about which I now see there is partly doubt; but the apparent trustworthiness of the messenger deceived almost everyone.</p>
      <p>The people of Sancerre have indeed been freed from a tight siege, but they are prevented from making excursions by the garrison soldiers, who are said to be stationed in the neighboring villages and towns. The brother of our king, or rather the king himself (it is not likely that the brother did not aspire to this), has fallen short of his hope among the Poles. The affairs of the Netherlands are in the best hope with us. The Venetians (unless the letters delivered today to a certain Italian are lying) have made peace with the Emperor of the Turks on these terms, that he should keep those towns which he extorted from the Venetians by right of war, along with the island of Cyprus, and receive several thousand ducats from them. There is a rumor of renewed tumults in Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn what benefit the letters written to the Duke of Savoy by the most honorable s. s. have brought us, I will inform you as soon as possible. The noble children of the most illustrious hero greet you most dutifully and earnestly request that you would have them commended to God in your prayers. Farewell, most distinguished man, and love me, if you consider me worthy of your affection.</p>
      <p>Basel, 9th day before the Kalends of May 1573.</p>
      <p>Most observant of your virtue and excellence, St[ephanus] Gracilis. I ask you, most esteemed man, to ensure that the French letters, which you will receive attached to yours, are delivered to the chief secretary of your most honorable senate, who so diligently wrote them for me.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Delivered on April 24, 1573 [... a]dmiralliorum.</p>
