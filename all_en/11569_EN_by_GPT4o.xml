    <p xml:id="regest1">Needs instructions, as the Prince [Philipp of Hesse] will depart earlier than expected, while the Constance delegation will likely remain as long as the Emperor [Charles V] is here; therefore, Gwalther's further stay in Regensburg threatens to become costly and of little benefit. The Emperor seems to be upset with the Protestants; the [Hessian] Prince has laid down his position in written form; the [Swiss] doctrine of the Lord's Supper is gaining more and more acceptance, and the unity of the German churches seems to be solidified; Melanchthon will issue a writing on the Eucharist, and even Luther is said to have moved away from his rigidity. Corvinus has departed and sends greetings, while Dionysius [Melander] and Draconites will write themselves. It is said that Elector [Ludwig V] will come to the Imperial Diet, but this is unlikely. [Elector] Ottheinrich is having evangelical preaching in the Minorite monastery; the number of [Protestants] would increase even more if [the Emperor] did not show his true disposition again. In Augsburg, wells and probably also meadows were poisoned. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I sent you a letter, most esteemed father, from which you can easily perceive all the noteworthy events happening here. Now, however, since I understand that our prince's departure will be sooner than I thought, I am compelled to write to you again to seek advice. A few days ago, messengers were sent to Marburg to bring back the horses previously sent from Regensburg, so that the prince plans to depart on the eighteenth day. Here, I would like to consult with our people about what I should do. Certainly, the delegates from Constance will likely remain here longer, perhaps until the Emperor's departure, so it will hardly be possible for me to wait for their departure unless our people are willing to support me here at great expense, which I do not see as worthwhile if those with whom I could be informed about the affairs of the princes and the empire have left. The cost of living here is extremely high. I can barely feed a horse for five bazons a day, nor myself for less. From this, you can easily infer how much expense would be incurred if I were to stay here longer. Therefore, I wanted to inform you of this in time so that I can receive advice from you in time.</p>
      <p>I will wait after the prince's departure until I have received a response from you. The Emperor now seems more upset with our people. Our prince has committed his opinion to writing, which he will leave here, but I have not yet been able to see the summary, as it was presented to our people only a few hours ago. Everyone now seems to incline towards our opinion on the Eucharist; they realize how difficult it is to assert their doctrine against the papists in a debate.</p>
      <p>Nor do I see any reason to doubt the true concord among the German churches. For Philipp is about to address the matter of the Eucharist in a public writing. And they proclaim that Luther has greatly retreated from his former rigidity.</p>
      <p>Corvinus departed today, in whose name I send you many greetings along with the other fellow ministers. He would undoubtedly have written if he had not been overwhelmed by a storm of business. Dionysius and Draconites will write this week, the former being hindered by business, the latter by poor health.</p>
      <p>There are those who proclaim that the Elector Palatine is coming; however, it does not seem likely to me.</p>
      <p>Otto Henry, Duke of Bavaria, has recently arranged for an evangelical sermon to be held in the Minorite monastery. The number of the pious would increase daily if he, on whom the highest matters depend, had not returned from hypocrisy to his true nature. May God illuminate his heart so that, recognizing the pure truth of God, he may walk in the Lord's way, leaving behind the thorns of the Antichrist. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, poison was found in the wells, the author is unknown. Many also suspect that the meadows are infected. For in the same city, twelve cows suddenly collapsed and died while grazing. Certainly, these are dangerous times, and people are slippery, with few who either love good or punish evil.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you. I also wish well to the leaders of the Zurich church and school, my most esteemed teachers, especially your mother and wife, along with all your children and the rest of the family. Farewell, my father, and continue to take care of the affairs of your Rudolf as you do, I beseech you.</p>
      <p>Regensburg, hastily, from the court of the most illustrious Prince of Hesse, the day before the calends of June 1541.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my particularly kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
