      <p>"The arrival of our Lord Tobias, a most learned man, was as expected by all, so also most pleasing and acceptable to everyone, nor did the hope we had conceived about him deceive us; for his manner of teaching seems elegant, especially pleasant, clear, and effective for all classes of people, and we hope, indeed we most certainly promise, that both his life and also the doctrine of Christ, our Lord, will be of the greatest ornament and use to the church. And although he pleases everyone greatly and is approved and satisfies, he alone does not satisfy himself and seems to seek reasons for leaving. But perhaps your authority and that of other learned men will cause him to cease further opposing his legitimate calling."</p>
      <p>"If any decree of the senate, which concerns the cause of our bishops, is made among us these days, I will faithfully describe and send it to you." "lest we be oppressed by those who wish our religion to be eradicated and completely abolished; for it is not at all doubtful to us that something monstrous is being nurtured by certain men."</p>
