      <p>Greetings. In my last letter to you, honorable brother, I wrote about the assembly to be held in Zürich on July 26.</p>
      <p>Our magistrate had indeed called for it, and the people of Basel and Schaffhausen had agreed, but only the people of Bern refused. As a result, our magistrate also canceled the assembly with the others, so that our adversaries would not rejoice in seeing us gather without the Bernese. The Bernese believe that nothing further should be discussed about the council, as they had agreed two years ago on a general, free, Christian council, in which decisions would be made for the glory of God solely from the canonical books.</p>
      <p>But our people did not want this to be changed, but wanted it to be declared that the Council of Trent was not such that it could be conveniently dealt with by the neighboring allies. For both the Emperor and the Pope are inciting them against us, and they wish to create open discord among us.</p>
      <p>There were also other reasons why the cities would not have gathered uselessly. But since the Bernese made themselves difficult, the assembly dispersed. I did not want you to be unaware of this for many reasons. I am very sorry that offenses continually arise among us: I strongly doubt it is due to malice and imprudence. May the Lord prevent the disagreements of our people from detracting from the good cause. And I write this only to you: I do not want this to be shared with others.</p>
      <p>I finally received your letter written in Geneva on April 10 yesterday from the city of Venice. I do not know to whom you entrusted it. However, I understand from it and your other letters how much you value and love me. Continue in this way, my brother. For I will not allow you to be the victor here. Let us serve our Lord God faithfully. Let us not look to the world and the powers that are in the world. These always oppose the truth.</p>
      <p>Let us continue to build the church with sincerity, faith, and humility. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with us for a long time. May the most distinguished brothers from Burgundy and brother Gallasius with the remaining fellow ministers and brothers be well. Zürich, July 17, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that although I have written to you once and again about the book by Martin Peres published on divine traditions, and indicated how useful it would be if you responded to it, you make no mention of it in your letters. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, honorable lord, and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
