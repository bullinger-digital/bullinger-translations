    <p xml:id="regest1">The opponents are still preaching falsely, but deny it when confronted. [Precisely] for this reason, negotiations took place on December 5 [1544], and a good result was achieved. Nevertheless, Beat [Gering] continues with his misdeeds: On Christmas Day [1544], he spoke of a threefold meal [in the Lord's Supper]; on New Year's Day, he taught falsehoods about circumcision and baptism; last Sunday, he finally connected the passage Isaiah 21 [16f] with the misuse of the sacraments. Subsequently, Wäber identified clear parallels between Gering's sermon and Luther's [“Short Confession”], which he reported to [Peter Cyro] and the councilors. If the sacraments continue to be used in the sense of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, according to Gering, this will lead to the downfall of the evangelical churches. - Erasmus [Ritter] was so affected by Gering's sermon that his health condition worsened. - The main reason for Wäber's letter, however, is the fear that Gering might have interrogated the messenger [...], whom he hosted, about the Zurichers or might have downplayed his actions against the Zurichers to him; therefore, the Zurichers should inform the Bernese councilors and citizens of this, also advising them to adhere to the [Bernese] Disputation [of 1528] that is still valid today, and [warn them that they] are being deceived by Luther and his advocates. - [Any] letters from the Lutheran priests [in Bern] are not to be trusted. - Wäber could not reread the letter written at three o'clock at night, as he has to preach [in the morning] for Ritter, who knows nothing of the present letter. Wäber was driven by the concern that Gering might seduce the messenger and perhaps draft a misleading letter to the Zurichers. - [P.S.:] Gering had Luther's book long before the other Bernese.</p>

      <p>Dear sirs, the shameless audacity in preaching, and then denying it when confronted, remains just as great among our opponents. Thus, the matter was negotiated on December 5th, and the judgment of our lords, councilors, and citizens, who were truly very zealous, was pleasing to us. Since then, Beat [Gering], as usual, has not changed his misdeeds at all, boldly hoping to cover them up with lies or otherwise, to escape when required, especially on Christmas Day when he again established a threefold meal, although so obscurely that he did not dare to openly share it with his members. On New Year's Day, he was completely inept about circumcision and baptism; now, lastly on Sunday (for I suspect that Sultzer is ill because of this, so that in Beat's preaching he could be represented), he presented this standpoint with great pomp from Isaiah chapter 21 [16f]: 1. The Kedarites are punished by God because they misused the sacrament, 2. because they separated themselves from the people of God; 3. it will also happen to some Evangelicals who hold the sacrament too lightly. This was the summary of the mentioned sermon. I immediately compared it before breakfast from Luther's book and showed it to the city scribe and some of my lords. Thus: 1. Zwingli perished with 5000 men from the terrible judgment of God (says Luther); 2. because they misused the sacrament, they separated themselves from the Christian church; for Luther boasts of having kept the sacrament with the pope and the church for 1500 years. 3. It follows: If we continue to use the sacraments as Zwingli and Oecolampadius maintained in the praiseworthy Disputation against Luther's and the pope's opinion, it will happen to us and all the upper evangelical churches as it did to the Kedarites and Zurichers; yes, it will go even worse, threatens Luther, etc.</p>
      <p>Such suspicious and questionable preaching affected Master Erasmus so badly that from that very day, slightly touched by his illness, his mouth and one eye became very narrow and crooked; he also spoke somewhat more offensively than is usually his habit. And so we cannot know what God intends to do with us; whether it will be better or worse for him; for he otherwise dictated the other letter himself, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear sirs (and this is the reason for this writing), when the messenger arrived, he took Beat into his lodging, either to learn about your actions or to complain against you, I fear. Therefore, I ask, as well as for the next, if it is for your business, that you inform our lords, councilors, and citizens of the previous proceedings as briefly and thoroughly as possible, especially since they have so far dealt with Zurich and other churches in the Concord, always remaining steadfast in their praiseworthy Disputation (as also happened at the last assembly in Zurich), as you see from the shared judgment, and thus are just as deceived by Luther or his advocates as other churches, etc.</p>
      <p>Do not trust any writings that may be sent to you by the Lutheran priests. If they change their intentions, I will inform you without delay. You do not need to send me any messenger's fee. With that, I commend you to God. Watch over our churches with faithfulness; I hope God will grant grace.</p>
      <p>Done in Bern on January 7th, at three in the night. And I must preach for Erasmus; therefore, I could not reread the letter. I also wrote it without Erasmus's knowledge; only moved at night, fearing that Beat might have seduced the messenger, perhaps attempting to write something friendly to you, thereby causing you to bear even less concern for us in this danger.</p>
      <p>Johannes Wäber, yours always.</p>
      <p>Beat had Luther's book long before us, etc.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned sirs, Master Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Caspar Grossmann, preachers in Zurich, etc.</p>
