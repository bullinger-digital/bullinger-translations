      <p>Greetings. I return to you everything you recently sent and express my immense gratitude to you, most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>There remains a small sheet of a pasquinade, which I do not return because it is not currently at hand; however, I will send it soon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with great sorrow, I have learned that Christoph, your son, has died in the recent expedition of Prince of Orange, for which I deeply sympathize with you and all your family. However, since you are not unaware of how these matters should be received, it is not for me to teach you this.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new that is of any significance. Our people have returned from Strasbourg, where they delivered money; but they bring nothing except that the forces of Orange have all dispersed and are causing great distress to the areas neighboring Strasbourg; he himself is said to be walking around the city almost as a private citizen. We hear that the people of Lucerne are restless; they have ordered all their men to be ready. What they are planning, I do not yet understand. I would write more, but I must go to the sermon, and I fear that this messenger, who informed me of his departure too late, may precede me. Therefore, farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 2nd.</p>
      <p>Diesbach has set out for Burgundy; he will bring back something.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
