    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Bullinger, according to Richard Hilles, is interested in news from all countries, especially England, Hilles urged him, despite his hesitation and reluctance, to inform Bullinger of the disgraceful events in his homeland; knowing the enemies of the Gospel and their tactics allows for better combat against them; may Christ free the Church from these evils! He sends an edict ["Act for the Advancement of True Religion"], which allows Bible reading only for the upper class; he has translated the first part into Latin, but due to time constraints, could only paraphrase the second part - the print only arrived on [July 5] -; he apologizes for any language errors. Greetings from Hilles and his wife [Anna], who sends a pair of knives for Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] through Heinrich Falkner.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in the Lord! When I received from Lord Richard Hilles how you, most humane man, are sometimes seized with a desire to know what is happening among foreign nations, and especially among our English, he urged me to inform you by our letters of the most disgraceful events that have recently taken place among our people. At first, I indeed hesitated much to do this, not unaware of how rash this endeavor was, for me, a most unskilled man of almost no talent, to address you, who have long been engaged in such a high position of learning and reputation among men, with our writings. However, after your kindness and gentleness towards people of even the lowest rank and condition were extolled to me in many words by him, and indeed you yourself in your last letters to him (while greeting me so kindly) gave a sufficiently clear testimony of your courtesy; finally, by his encouragement and the very event that occurred, I was overcome and impelled to undertake this task. For the matter itself seemed not unworthy of being known to both of us, and I thought it was of great interest for you and those like you to have knowledge of it, especially for our people and the whole church. Since we have excellent defenses from the Lord, commended to the Almighty God, against all storms of all times, one being your preaching, the other the invocation of divine aid, the indication of this tragedy might perhaps contribute not insignificantly to kindling both more conveniently and effectively: since, with the enemies of the Gospel indicated, and the arms and manner of battle of our enemies more deeply inspected, it will be easier to decide in deliberation how our battle line should be arranged against them; and we will also be more vehemently inflamed for the fight when we know that such fierce and shameless enemies remain for us: and again, when we see the recent calamity of the church from the opposite side, we will be greatly incited to implore from Christ liberation for it from these evils and hardships: which may the Lord grant to it opportunely according to His good pleasure! Amen.</p>
      <p>But now to descend to the matter itself, you will receive enclosed in these letters a certain edict publicly posted, in which the reading of the Holy Scripture is forbidden to a certain class of people. This edict I had indeed decided to set forth verbatim in Latin words, which I did up to the 13th section, except that I omitted certain flattering titles: for when I came to this, I finally saw that due to the constraint of time and my slowness in conducting affairs, I could not pursue the plan as I had decided; for the printed copy did not reach us before Thursday, when we were already so occupied with other matters because of the fair, that there was scarcely any leisure granted for transcribing these; therefore, in those that remained, I was forced to extract only the summary. Now it is up to you, with your usual sweetness of character, to consider these things favorably, and if there is anything uncultivated, obscure, and that smacks of a solecism (as there perhaps are many), to forgive it. Farewell. You are greeted very much along with your wife by Lord Richard Hilles and his wife, from whom you will receive a pair of knives for your wife, which Heinrich Falkner will deliver to you. Hastily. In Straßburg, July 8 [1543].</p>
      <p>Yours, FRANCIS WARNER, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Christian flock, these letters are delivered, in Zürich.</p>
