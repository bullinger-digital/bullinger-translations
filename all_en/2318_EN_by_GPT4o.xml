      <p>Greetings. You will not take it amiss that, in our sincerity, we acted in good faith as friends and fathers with our Maximilian, your son. He brought us letters from the noble Wilhelm von Bernhausen, from which we understood that there is a discussion about the ordination of your son and his succession in the ecclesiastical office of the church in Göttingen. We would have gladly undertaken this task for the sake of the excellent man N. von Bernhausen, to examine him. However, it seemed to us, who have educated your son and perhaps know him better than you do, that it is neither in the interest of the church nor in the welfare of your son, and therefore not in your benefit, for him to be appointed to that church.</p>
      <p>He is a young man who has not yet perhaps exceeded his 20th year, having acquired the rudiments of letters, but scarcely progressed to the middle, and has not at all reached the end. You know, however, what the Lord requires and threatens in Ezekiel, and you know what the apostle requires from a pastor of churches. Again, you cannot be unaware of how Maximilian is not equipped for such great matters; he has not yet been trained in such matters nor does he have the ability from himself without the necessary training to govern a church. Therefore, you can see, unless you choose not to see, with what danger both to yourself and to the public church he would be appointed.</p>
      <p>We remain silent about the good and hopeful being thrust into great straits and certain dangers, the opportunity or chance for study being cut off, and thus being cast into certain misery. He has a patron; his studies will be taken care of. After a few years, he will serve you with greater glory and more abundant fruit, indeed the church, and will more liberally benefit his brothers and sisters. There are many other things we have recited to him, nothing necessary to repeat here. We therefore urge you to consider the affairs of your son, finally the church of Göttingen and the noble von Bernhausen, and allow your son to pursue his studies, and that a mature person be appointed to that church, if you can, assist. Farewell. We write these things with a paternal spirit hoping you will accept them as they are written.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 20, 1554.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, in the name of the ministers of the church of Zurich.</p>
