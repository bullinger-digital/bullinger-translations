      <p>You indeed requested in your recent letters to me, most excellent man, that I should inform you of something regarding German affairs. However, since at that time I had nothing worthy to report to your kindness, and Mr. Peyer had not yet returned, from whom I hoped to hear everything, I have thus far delayed responding to you, most learned man.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when he returned, I inquired about everything, so that I might write to you about them; Mr. de Font... immediately replied that he would write to you about everything he had narrated, from which I... refrained from describing and narrating these things, which I would not have done unless I had understood from Mr. Peyer that nothing of those matters would escape you. Moreover, as for what new things I might write, I have nothing, for you have long since understood from the letters of others about the miserable disaster and destruction of the Schweinfurt people inflicted upon them by the Nurembergers and the bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg, etc., namely the holy fathers. Then, regarding the army and soldiers recently conscripted and gathered in Weingarten, I have nothing to say or write about where or against whom they should go; they lack money and wages, and there is no one to pay even a penny; therefore, the Landsknechts have already dispersed, each returning either to his own or, if possible, to the French. Nothing certain is known about the Emperor. Our soldiers have indicated through letters the state of Picardy, hoping for the end of the war to be near, etc. But I do not doubt that you have been informed about these matters by others. I have nothing further to write. I ask your kindness, if you have anything regarding English or other matters, indeed even of Germany, to inform me and to keep me and other colleagues with our entire church commended in your prayers to the Lord, which we also do most diligently in return.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with your whole family, and in my name greet the learned and pious men inquiring about me. There are clandestine rumors and various opinions about the Seven Cantons; some foretell something bad; whatever it is, we are ignorant if anything is to be said at the moment; I ask you to inform us secretly about these matters.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 17th July 1554.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Jakob Rüeger, minister of the church of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
