      <p>Greetings and blessings. I pray, grant me, venerable father, that, although I recently burdened you with that long and ungraceful letter, I am compelled to trouble you again. But no harm is done to the willing. For you yourself instructed that if we receive anything in the name of alms for the wretched brothers exiled from their homeland for Christ's sake or fleeing from France, we should send it to you (if, however, this more than sufficiently humble gift is worthy of the name of alms). For Johannes Concius, also known as Bisatius, minister of the church in S-chanf in the Engadin, sends here 10 Rhenish florins and 42 cruciates according to the value of the currency usable here, which he collected from I don't know how many members of his church. Likewise, Andreas Rudolphus, minister of the church in Lavin, also sent a small sum, which he collected from a few there, namely ten Rhenish florins or gold coins with half or a little more of the currency usable there until now. Finally, Thomas Thoenlichius, a novice preacher of the newly converted church in Scuol, sent such a sum that I can hardly express the number or price in words, namely 1 1/9 florins or gold coins, that is, ein gl. und 6 oder 7 cr. Oh shame! Whether other churches are going to send anything, I do not know. But if the remaining Engadiners would at least send as much as one of the two mentioned, a small sum would result, which would amount to more or less 200 gold coins.</p>
      <p>What if others then joined in? But my hope is very thin, whether due to the fault of the preachers or rather the idlers, or the listeners or rather the neglectful, or finally both (which I am more inclined to believe), I do not know. Thus we are Christians today, almost only in words, who do most promptly and diligently what avarice, not piety, dictates, not what Christ the King, but what the god Mammon or Pluto commands, always pretending and excusing this perpetual poverty of nefarious avarice, by which we pray even the most wealthy, etc. Thus, I say, we are members of the same Christian body, which do not feel the pain and affliction of the other members nor are affected by any sense or sympathy of it, indeed we are nothing less than such a flock, as the spirit, which animates the true and genuine members, says through Paul, to remember the prisoners as if bound with them and those who are afflicted as if we ourselves were in the body. But why do I lament the unhappy state of our times in vain, when shortly we shall all experience what we are.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell eternally.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur on the 19th of January, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Huldrich Campell. To the most reverend father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my ever most observant lord.</p>
