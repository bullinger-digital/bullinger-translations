      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I ask two things of you, brother. First, that you inform Ulrich Dürst that I have requested a meeting with Mayor Röist and it has been set for August 26, which is the Tuesday after the feast of Bartholomew, where he can present his case to those in charge of finances. Secondly, that you call brother Wolfgang and present him with the letters from the people of Matt in Glarus. Additionally, include my letters of recommendation and tell him it is my wish that he travels to Glarus, delivers my letters, and sees if he can settle in that church. For I have written to the church in Matt to send Wolfgang and asked them to see if they can understand and commend him to themselves.</p>
      <p>Farewell and return the letters from the people of Glarus after you have read them to Wolfgang. August 15, 1539.</p>
