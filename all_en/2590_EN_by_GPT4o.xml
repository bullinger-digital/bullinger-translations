      <p> Greetings. Upon reading your letters, most illustrious man and dearest brother, my otherwise always depressed spirit is uplifted, indeed it revives, something your relative could clearly recognize from my expression while I was reading your letters. Your well-being is part of my life. If I were not somewhat forced to endure the troubles of the court, I would now consider myself quite happy, except for the movements of war, without which this summer will hardly pass; for the priests are always the same and do with us what they do among the Five Swiss Cantons, secretly carrying with them the fuel to pour oil on the fire, ready whenever the opportunity presents itself. Indeed, it is certainly reported to us that the Pope, the Emperor, the King, and the entire papacy have conspired to the ruin of all the pious, and unless the French are an impediment, they will attempt arduous things this spring. Mercury has induced too long a sleep in our princes or, if you prefer, has almost blinded them, so that they see dimly and seem to perish while alive. Now would be the time to reclaim freedom, homeland, and open the way to peace; but there is no one to lead the erring. However, there are some who are pleased with the Augsburg Confession, which they think will remain inviolate for them. My thoughts, however, are very scattered. </p>
      <p> It would seem most advisable to me if the princes themselves would visit the assemblies only through envoys. You would be surprised if you heard the reason for my opinion. </p>
      <p> In Saxony, several neighboring princes are gathering at Naumburg in large numbers to renew the alliances observed among those families since ancient times, although others suspect otherwise, and I am one among the suspicious; for the priests are somewhat saddened by these rumors. </p>
      <p> For the book and thus your offspring, I give you the greatest thanks, even before I have seen it; for when your relative came to Lauingen in my absence, he left the book there. </p>
      <p> That you have made my confession more refined and enriched it, you have done according to my request something most pleasing to me, and I pray that you ensure it is submitted to the press as soon as possible and send 50 copies at my expense to our Papius; he will then transmit them to me; you will indicate the price along with the booklets. </p>
      <p> I offered my services to your relative and hope that the prince will accommodate him as much as his ability allows. The prince made a good mention of you, recommending a copy to the library. Farewell and diligently greet each of the friends and lords. In Neuburg, hastily, March 17, 1555. </p>
      <p> Yours, Georg Laetus. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief ecclesiastic among the Zurichers, lord and brother to be honored with perpetual faith. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
