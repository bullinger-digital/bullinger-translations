  <input>Ambrosio Blaurero, sanctae constantiensis ecclesiae doctori fidelissimo, Heinrychus Bullingerus gratiam optat et vitae innocentiam a domino.

Scripsi, dilectissime frater, ante annos aliquot per privatam exercitationem nonnulla ad Lactantii illius imitationem de erroris origine deque uno vero summo deo, eius providentia et cultu, item de multis ac falsis diis et superstitione, ad quae nunc primum redii ac nonnulla retractavi, posteaquam a missarum origine vidi fidelibus conatus nostros non admodum displicere. Atque eo etiam libentius feci istud, quo frequentius pontificii nobis ingerunt sacrosanctam et longis retro saeculis observatam religionem, ut vel temporum supputatione et eorum scriptorum convincantur authoritate, quibus plurimum fidunt stolidissimi. Si enim saperent, satis superque iam olim adversus vanissimam esset superstitionem disputatum etiam ex prophetarum ac apostolorum oraculis, ut ac nostra instructione minime opus haberent. Sed sacra aut in dubium vertunt miseri aut depravationem obiitiunt invidi, tandem vero ad catholicos et vetustissimos, ut aiunt, ecclesiae ritus tanquam ad sacram confugiunt ancoram. In qua tamen re non minus peccant, quam cum ipsa domini dei verba torquent, lacerant penitusque conculcant, quippe cum sacrosancta fidelium ecclesia neque divos coluerit unquam neque simulachra habuerit neque iis initiata fuerit sacris ac ceremoniis, quibus interim illi se omnino christianos videri volunt. Id quod hoc nostro opusculo luculenter demonstrabimus ad gloriam ac laudem dei coeli et domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui una cum patre et spiritusancto unus solus ac verus deus regnabit in sempiternum, amen. Hunc autem nostrum conatum nunc quidem post quinquennium fere recognitum, at in ipsa pene incoeptum pueritia certe ardentissimo in deum animo, uni tibi, Ambrosi dulcissime, dedico, ut dignum habeas amicitiae ac societatis pignus, lucubraciunculam videlicet, qua unius dei et domini nostri Jesu Christi gloriam propugnamus, per cuius charitatem ineffabilem in christianam coivimus societatem; neque enim is es, qui alias nostra egeas institutione ipse in rebus summis eruditissimus et in gloria dei vindicanda fidelitate ac fortitudine ex aequo suspitiendus, id quod etiam testatur constantissima constantiensis ecclesia fide, patientia, puritate ac dilectione clarissima. Iamque vale et pietatem, ut facis, doce nosque ama, frater charissime.

  <output>Henry Bullinger wishes grace and innocence of life from the Lord to Ambrosio Blaurero, most faithful doctor of the Holy Church of Constance. 

I wrote, dearest brother, some years ago for my own private exercise some things in imitation of that Lactantius about the origin of error and about the one true highest God, of his providence and worship, and likewise of the many false gods and superstitions, to which I have now first returned and reconsidered somewhat, after I saw that our efforts among the faithful were not much disliked concerning the origin of the Masses. And I did this the more willingly, since the pontificals continually press upon us the most sacred religion that has been observed for many ages past, that they may be confuted either by computation of times or by the authority of those writers in whom the most foolish put the greatest trust. For if they were wise, there has already long ago been sufficiently and more than sufficiently disputed against this most vain superstition even from the oracles of the prophets and apostles, so that they had no need at all of our instruction. But the wretched men either call the sacred into doubt or obscure it with malice, at length indeed they fly for refuge to the catholics and, as they say, the most ancient rites of the Church, as to a holy anchor. In which thing however they sin not less than when they twist and tear to pieces and utterly trample the very words of the Lord God; for the most faithful Church of the faithful has never worshipped gods, nor had images nor been initiated into the sacred rites and ceremonies by which they now wish to appear altogether Christian. Which we shall in this our book most clearly demonstrate to the glory and praise of God of heaven and of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall reign alone and true God with the Father and the Holy Spirit for ever and ever, amen. This our effort now indeed reviewed after almost five years, but in the infancy itself, and certainly with an ardent spirit towards God, I dedicate to you alone, sweetest Ambrosio, as a worthy token of friendship and fellowship, namely, this small treatise, in which we defend the glory of the one God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whose ineffable charity we are come together into the Christian fellowship; for you are he, who otherwise stands in no need of our instruction, being most learned in highest matters and to be equally reckoned among those who defend the glory of God in faith and fortitude, as is also testified by the most constant faith, patience, purity and most illustrious love of the Church of Constance. And now farewell and teach piety, as you do, and love us, dearest brother. 

From Zurich, fourth of June, in the year of the redemption of the world 1528.</output>
