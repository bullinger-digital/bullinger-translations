      <p>Grace and innocence from the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Add, I pray, to your Christian prudence the necessary considerations, so that the efforts of the bearer of this letter may lead to salvation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in memory of your Gervasius, send to us more quickly what you are secretly commenting on in the Epistle of Paul to the Romans. I say secretly, because we have learned of it through the reports of others, not your own, which is a testament to your singular humility.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my delight; greet your parents in my name with great respect, and in the meantime, refresh your wife, as you are accustomed, with my many greetings. Farewell again and again (love speaks and repeats), half of my soul.</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th day of February in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, yours, Gervasius, if anyone is yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To my dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
