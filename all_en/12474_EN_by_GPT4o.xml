    <p xml:id="regest1">Hochholzer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Gabriel [Meyer] is diligently working on his record of antiquities [in Aargau].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The author of the song [about the Lord's Supper] sung in Bern with the knowledge of [Thomas] Grynäus and some councilors is named [Peter] Zeller. He is about 20 years old and a foundling. The Bernese council covered his studies. What will be undertaken in this regard is still open. The good-for-nothing will hardly get away unpunished.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Hochholzer returns Bullinger's notes on [Theodor Bibliander's] Genesis [lectures] with thanks. Unfortunately, he cannot reciprocate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf] sends greetings to Bullinger's family. Greetings also to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Meyer] also has a lot of material on other castles in the [Bernese] Aargau, namely Lenzburg, Liebegg, Trostburg, and Aarburg. If he knew it would be of use to Johannes Stumpf, he would also send it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Regarding your letter, there is no need for me to respond at length.</p>

      <p>M. Gabriel will be diligent in recording antiquities.</p>

      <p>As for the song you wish to know about, here is the information: It has not been printed. The author is a student named Zeller. He is a foundling. Our gracious lords of Bern have raised him and taken him into the monastery. He is about 20 years old. The boys in the monastery sing it in four voices to the annoyance of others, and this is not unknown to Grynaeus. Some of the senators also have that song. What they will do with the author, I do not know. Many are very displeased with it. This is all about that. Certainly, there is nothing more, nor do I write this because I believe you care about these matters, as insignificant people do many things, say, and write against the truth. Without a doubt, the worthless, bold, and reckless will not go unpunished.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I send back your notes on Genesis. I thank you very much. Although it is in no way possible to repay you, I will always be mindful and grateful. The will to repay is not lacking; however, no deeds are given according to my means and fortune, nor are you the kind of person who would expect anything from me that could increase your fortune or fame. Nevertheless, no oblivion will ever erase the memory of your innumerable benefits to me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell with your entire household, which my wife wishes to remain safe. You will convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther in my name. Aarau, April 21, 1546.</p>

      <p>M. Gabriel also has much from other castles in Aargau: Lenzburg, Liebegg, Trostburg, Aarburg. If he knew that you lacked something, he would gladly share it with you. If he were ever (occasionally) with you or with Mr. Hans Stumpf, he would be able to show much. Most devoted to your kindness,</p>
      <p>Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful preacher of the divine word in Zurich, my most revered lord as a father.</p>
