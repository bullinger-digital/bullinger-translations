      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I wrote to you before, but I now doubt whether they have been delivered to you or not, not because I wish to interrupt you, who are occupied with very serious matters, much less to distract you by responding to me for a moment, nor were the matters of such importance about which I wrote that they would require a response. They informed you about those messages we then had from England; now, however, there is much less that I have to write to you that is worthy. Yet I send these to you because it seems to me a long time since I have conversed with your kindness or heard from you yourself. Our Burcher, returning from you, told me when I inquired about you that you were not well; but since I have heard nothing yet, I am very eager to understand from you yourself how you are doing. I ask nothing further, nor indeed unless it is at your leisure. There are many reasons why I would very much like to hear about your health, nor is it surprising if I am almost privately concerned about you, since I have perceived your disposition towards me to be such as I have understood from the conversations of some of our people about you. I do not doubt that these times can cause you, as they do all the pious, to generate sorrow and to bring forth many and deep sighs. But what can you do? He who sits on high looks upon the lowly in heaven and on earth; He who wishes His own to be exercised will not allow His church to be entirely forsaken, but as that man of sin is now in some part revealed through you and your kind, so he will finally be destroyed by the spirit of the Lord's mouth, amen, amen. May God be with you by His spirit and protect you for the benefit of His church.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 12, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>I wish all good and favorable things according to God's will to Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, and Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and most esteemed (in Christ) father Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
