      <p>S. I am very surprised at what such deep silence about the state of German affairs will eventually bring; for never before have we received so little from Germany for such a long time. But there is no doubt that the emperor is nurturing some kind of monster, and Albert will not easily rest with Heinrich of Brunswick, unless the Lord's hand breaks both their spirits. From France, I received yesterday from the son of Gabriel Arnold that a man distinguished in learning and piety was taken away by a horrible burning, but he endured with unbroken constancy of spirit to the end. Many others also tell similar stories. The same Frenchman also reported that since the departure of the Swiss, fires have spread far and wide, almost to Brussels, consuming, they say, two thousand villages and such a quantity of provisions and grain that it would have sufficed to feed all of Switzerland for a year. Hence, the miserable farmers are forced to winter in the forests with their families, and some perish from hunger, while others turn to robbery and plundering, so that there are no longer any safe roads over very long stretches of land. These are the fruits of war, from the commerce of which I wish we were free. Furthermore, while I am writing this, I receive from Augsburg that Albert's forces, which he had in the town of Liechtenfeld, 9 banners, have surrendered and come under the power of Heinrich of Brunswick. Two captains were beheaded, and the rest, stripped of their arms, were forced to swear that they would never again serve Albert, nor against the emperor, Ferdinand, and the confederates within a year. With this matter observed, Albert fled with 2000 horsemen to Schweinfurt and is reinforcing the town, previously garrisoned with 12 banners, more strongly and preparing to resist again. Heinrich of Brunswick proceeded to occupy Albert's territory, in which he has already taken Bayreuth and besieged Blasemberg, which is considered invincible unless it is conquered by famine rather than arms. Suitors for the Queen of England, or rather the kingdom, are said to be the emperor's son, Ferdinand's son, and the Duke of Savoy; but the English are said to resist and will never concede that a foreigner should hold power among them. Copus said he had nothing to say about the Turk and Vercelli, so I wish you would write if you have any news. But farewell with your family. Basel, December 13, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
