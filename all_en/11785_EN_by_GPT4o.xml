    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] During their last conversation, Bullinger showed such kindness towards Pfister that there can be no doubt that he really likes him very much. In the name of this special friendship, he now allows himself to call upon Bullinger's help in all his affairs. Now to the matter at hand!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Deuteronomy Chapter 23, Moses forbids bringing money [into the temple] that was earned through prostitutes or dogs. Bullinger should inform Pfister by letter what this means and how it should be understood. He is already familiar with what the Bible commentators have gathered on the matter, but it seems to have nothing to do with the issue. Not even Augustine knew how to solve this problem in the 38th question of his notes dedicated to Deuteronomy. What does Bullinger think about it?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Nicolaus Artopoeus Balingius to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings. Our last conversation, most learned man, revealed to me such a character in you (I do not lie!) that I can in no way be led to believe otherwise than that you are most affectionate towards me. Therefore, I seem to have the right now to use your friendship as a special privilege in all my affairs, both in work and duty. But to the matter at hand.</p>

      <p>Moses, most friendly man, in Deuteronomy 23 forbids bringing the price or exchange of a dog, etc. I earnestly pray that you teach me by letter what Moses means by this and in what sense it should be understood. I am not unaware of what the interpreters have gathered on this passage, but in my judgment, it is οὐδὲν πρὸς ἔπος (nothing to the purpose), as the Greek adage goes, nor does Saint Augustine seem to have beautifully resolved this question in the 38th question of his book on Deuteronomy. I await your opinion.</p>

      <p>Farewell, most learned man, and love your Nicolaus, as you do. Brugg, 16th of the calends of May.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man both pious and learned in many ways.</p>
