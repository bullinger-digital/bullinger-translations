      <p>Greetings. Together with your letter, most illustrious and in the Lord most closely connected to me, I received the apologetic book, which you have crafted with utmost piety and sincere doctrine. I read it all with eager mind, partly to comply with your request, partly for the sake of learning; for I never engage with your writings and those of your peers without leaving much more learned. As for what you ask, indeed urge, that I candidly express my judgment of the book to you, I recognize your ancient modesty and humility, by which with a Christian spirit you flee pride and arrogance with utmost zeal, and you entrust your learned writings to be examined and evaluated by the opinions of your brothers. I also recognize your outstanding goodwill towards me and, to speak truly, your excessive respect; for I do not attribute to myself the role of being a judge of your most holy labors. However, lest you suspect that I was unwilling to comply with you, I will summarize my thoughts briefly: What you have written has pleased me wonderfully, I greatly approve of the doctrine, piety, and gentleness you have employed in writing; for you have so moderated your style that neither strength and firm sinews were lacking in the defense, nor could anyone reasonably complain that Christian leniency was abandoned by you. I omit the clearly presented opinions of the fathers, I also omit the clearly revealed sense of the ancient church, and I focus on this one thing: that the apology is so well-mannered in all its parts that the reader, unless he is stupider than stupidity itself, plainly understands that you and with you all of us are most devoted to fraternal peace and the tranquility of the church. For you frequently show that schisms displease us and that it is only through the adversaries that peace and fraternal goodwill are not cultivated. You have, most illustrious man, as you requested, my judgment. What remains is that I wish for the expected fruit from the published book, which know that I ardently do and with all prayers ask from God.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to report on other matters; for a few days ago I sent you a letter; therefore, there is no reason to repeat the same things now. A young man left here fifteen days ago and went to Marburg, and if I am not mistaken, he is called Johannes Bernhard Bertschi, to whom I willingly, not reluctantly, bear testimony both of diligence and of good conduct, whom I now consider to have advanced so much that the best can be hoped for from his fruit. Farewell and love me as you do; for I hold you in high regard in the Lord and pray to God that He may preserve you for His church for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy of my respect, most faithful minister of the word of God to the church and school of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
