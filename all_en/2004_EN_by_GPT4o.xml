      <p>I wrote to you three days ago and now I write again, as I see Mr. Celio returning to you. Listen to what happened to that messenger, who was traveling to Venice in the name of the most illustrious Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg for the release of a captive. When he reached the gates of the city of Brescia, behold, there were the officers of Cardinal Durante, the bishop of that city, who were watching him and immediately arrested him and threw him into the inner prison. You fear, Heinrich Bullinger; you await what the outcome was. But I order you to be of good cheer; for when the most illustrious Lords of Venice learned of this, they immediately wrote to the cardinal and ordered him to release him, and so it was done. Therefore, he went straight to Venice and is working on the matter; we do not yet know what he has achieved, but we will know shortly. Indeed, when he returns, I myself will come to you immediately, which I solemnly affirm to you, and you can safely affirm to others; for with the plague spreading in the Valtellina Valley, I am useless here. I have begun to translate your sermon on the supper, which pleases me wonderfully. I have already prepared a preface to be attached, from which good men (for I care nothing for the wicked and envious) will easily understand what I think about the sacrament of the Eucharist, that is, entirely with you, my Bullinger. I will bring the translated booklet with me, which I hope will be very useful to the churches of Italy.</p>
      <p>Send the enclosed to Mr. Bassafontaneus. I beg Josiah, if he has received anything from Basel that pertains to me, to take care to send it here and also to send my writings. I would like to have them here before I leave. I greet him and Mr. Zwingli and Mr. Lavater and the other brothers. Pray for me. May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. In Chiavenna, September 10, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
