      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Although the messenger was about to leave quickly, I managed to find a little time to write these greetings, etc. - We have not yet seen the captive preacher.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel have written on his behalf; likewise, our own sent a delegation to the noble prefect from Montbéliard to request the release of the good man, but nothing has been accomplished. Rumor certainly grows more and more that he has been sent to Besançon. If this is true, his life will certainly be in danger, etc. Pray for him, that he may become a steadfast martyr of Christ, etc. Pray for him, that he may become a steadfast martyr of Christ, etc. Thus one goes to the stars. - You will receive more detailed information from our Heinius, after he, being weary, has sent back that long bident to the following year, and perhaps more certain information. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily, March 30, 1536.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man and lord Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich churchman, brother and esteemed patron.</p>
