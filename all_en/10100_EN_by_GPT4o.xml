      <p>Grace and peace from God increase at all times, gracious sir.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I discussed with you, a letter was received this past Sunday; it was read to us according to old custom, as follows:</p>
      <p>«We from the Five Places have been informed that you in Bremgarten eat meat and eggs during forbidden times according to the order and decree of the holy Christian church, and also do not confess, nor wish to perform the holy sacraments and other Christian ordinances. Therefore, we urge you to desist from your undertaking and act according to the order of the old divine true custom; by doing so, you will greatly please us. If not, you should expect our punishment, for you should know well that we have kept our hand open against you. Depending on how you conduct yourselves, you will have gracious lords».</p>
      <p>In response, my lords have commanded to uphold this, and those who transgress should expect punishment, and whoever intends not to do so, the gate stands open for them; they may thus move away. I inform you of this in good faith, so that you may be aware of the matter. With that, may God be entrusted to the lord.</p>
      <p>Dated on the fourth day of March in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant</p>
      <p>Hans Mutschli.</p>
      <p>To the honorable well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my gracious lord.</p>
