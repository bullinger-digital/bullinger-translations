    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas stayed with the bearer of the present letter, the Englishman John Hooper, for a few days in the house of Simon Grynaeus. After his return from Zurich, he moved there because during his absence his former residence with Johannes Oporin had been occupied by Bernardino Ochino.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger does not yet know Hooper personally, but he has already heard of his righteous efforts for the Gospel. Therefore, no special recommendation is necessary, especially since he often welcomes pious people even without letters of recommendation. Nevertheless, Hooper is recommended to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A few days ago, he married a woman [Anne tâ€™Serclaes] from Belgium in Basel. Hopefully, Bullinger will also get to know the virtues of this almost supernaturally gifted and wise woman! She will undoubtedly be an asset to her future place of residence. She is firmly determined to follow God and wants to live where the public practice of her faith is permitted. For this reason, she also left her significant family of origin and her still-living parents. She is a treasure of true piety! Bullinger should take care of her. This way, she will be able to see that he is indeed as kind as Enzinas has described him to her.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. D. The bearer of this letter to you is Mr. Johannes Hooper, an Englishman, with whom I lived for a few days in the house of Simon Grynaeus; for after I returned from Zurich, I stayed in this house because Bernardino Ochino had occupied my residence with Johannes Oporin, from which I did not wish him to move.</p>

      <p>You know the man's spirit and integrity, even if you have not seen his face, whose piety and zeal for the doctrine of religion are such that, proven by his own integrity, he needs no recommendation among good men. I also know your virtue, who are accustomed to warmly welcome pious men excelling in faith and religion without anyone's recommendation. And yet, if my recommendation will have any weight with you, I commend this man to you as very zealous for piety and right opinion.</p>

      <p>A few days ago, he married a woman in this city, indeed of Belgian descent, but in character, learning, dignity, constancy, and true religion, plainly celestial beyond the lot of women. Oh, how I wish you could fully know the virtues and piety of this woman! I am persuaded that she will be an ornament to the place where she will reside, and she has a mind prepared by her own strength to follow God courageously and to live where she perceives there to be a public and free profession of true religion. She is indeed born of a great family and has both parents surviving; but she has left all to follow Christ. Therefore, I commend this woman to you as a certain treasure of virtue and true religion. I pray that she may understand that the praise of virtue is stored with you and that I have spoken truly to her when I commended your piety and humanity to her.</p>

      <p>Basel, 15th March 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Franciscus Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
