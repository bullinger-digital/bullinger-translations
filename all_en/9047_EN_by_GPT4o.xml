      <p>Our Hotman has finally escaped safely, whose letters I send along with mine.</p>
      <p>Other brothers are also arriving continually, but most are almost naked, and there seems to be no end to the cruelty; indeed, whoever they suspect to have any worth either in intellect or in action, they either immediately execute as conspirators or keep in the most savage prisons. Some have even been killed on the rack, tortured with every kind of torment, to extort something from them to prove their accusation of a new conspiracy. Countless numbers, terrified by such cruelty, are fainting, which is the most miserable of all; there are those who are hiding and are being protected for a while by some adversaries, either in hope of gain or because they dislike this brutality, until a way out is found. Behold our current condition, indeed more miserable because we do not have the means to support so many utterly destitute people, and yet the price of provisions increases daily. Only the Lord our God can remedy so many and such great evils, and indeed He will heal them in the way He knows. La Rochelle and other towns here and there, especially among the Occitans, are still held by our people, but with little hope, unless the Lord raises up some avenger out of the ordinary. The King of Navarre indeed entered the church together with the king, but in such a way that he showed no honor at all to either the priest or the mass. Condé still resists strongly; but Sorbonne doctors have been employed for both, to gradually turn the young men not so versed in sacred matters away from the truth.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with them and shut the mouths of the false prophets. Many proclaim the victory of Orange; would that it were true enough; for there are others who affirm that Mons (as they call the city in Hainaut besieged by Alba) has been captured. It is indeed certain that Orange's attack on Picardy is greatly feared, and therefore Strozzi has been recalled with his troops with great speed, and soldiers are being gathered to oppose him. Meanwhile, we steadfastly await the coming of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, together with the whole college of brothers; may the Lord have mercy on us all and restrain the rage of Satan.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 3, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich and my much-respected father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
