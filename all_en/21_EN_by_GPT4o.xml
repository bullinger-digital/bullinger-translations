    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to lack of time, Blarer can only briefly respond to Bullinger's letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">First, endless thanks for Bullinger's support on behalf of those [young married couple, Hans Rutishauser and Dorothea Diethelm], whom Blarer had entrusted to him so confidently. They reported candidly how much Bullinger's assistance had helped them. Blarer hopes to be able to support Bullinger in the same way one day!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The bailiff in Thurgau, [the Zurich native Leonhard Holzhalb], has not yet recognized the judgment of the Zurich council, stating that he is not only the bailiff of the Zurich people but also of all other Confederates. On occasion, however, he will carefully examine the federal decision on the marriage of blood relatives and then inform [the young bridal couple]. It was negligent that Blarer and Bullinger did not ensure that the Zurich council issued a written confirmation of the judgment to the couple. Thus, the bailiff may not be able to simply approve [the oral] report of the couple.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Enough of the Federal Chronicle! If any error has occurred somewhere, Blarer openly takes the blame.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">He is very worried about the sick Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz and his also ill wife [Anna, n√©e Zehntmeier], and asks Bullinger to greet them warmly. May God heal them! Blarer would have written to them if he had more time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The [people of Konstanz] cannot assess their situation in the face of so much human treachery. King Ferdinand I and Nicolas de Perrenot are said to be well-disposed towards them, as it is heard. Meanwhile, however, any response from Emperor Charles V is absent. This is highly suspicious! Hopefully, the people of Konstanz and their concerns will prove to be pleasing to God! For then it can be assumed that everything will soon turn out well for them! The people of Zurich should pray for the people of Konstanz so that they continue to do nothing that would contribute to their ruin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Johannes Gisling has fled from Konstanz with his wife [Barbara Sumenberger(in)] without saying goodbye and without settling his debts. The people of Konstanz will probably have to give him a bad report. When the city guard wanted to arrest them, they had already disappeared! May God have mercy on this dishonorable couple and improve them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings and a request for prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[Enclosure:] There is no news from Konstanz, only circulating rumors, with which Bullinger should not be bothered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Last night, Blarer heard from someone [N.N.] from Gottlieben that last Sunday [Swabian] lads from Hemmenhofen marched over the ice [of the frozen Lake Rhine] towards Steckborn [in Thurgau] to the beat of a military drum in the manner of the Landsknechte. The Steckborn lads came towards them and shouted at them not to beat the drum in this way on their territory. Thereupon, the Hemmenhofen lads insulted the others and challenged them to a fight. The Steckborn lads then went over the ice to them and beat them so brutally into flight that even one lad is said to have died. They were only armed with sticks. These are strange omens.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Through a letter from a reliable and distinguished man [N.N.], it is known that Pope Paul III has rejected all demands of Emperor Charles V. These were: 1. the personal presence of the Pope in Trent or Bologna, 2. the submission of the Pope to the council, 3. the Pope's agreement to a [premature] papal election in the event of his death during the council, 4. the immediate dispatch of envoys to Augsburg for consultations [about the Interim].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">The Emperor is repeatedly recruiting soldiers. What he intends with this is uncertain due to the contradictory rumors. It will soon become apparent.</p>

      <p>S. I have finally received your letters, to which I can only briefly respond due to the lack of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>First, I extend great and indeed the greatest thanks on behalf of those whom I had entrusted to you with such diligence, who candidly admit how much they have been helped by your assistance. I hope that one day I may be able to do the same for you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The bailiff of Thurgau has not yet subscribed to the judgment of your council, affirming that he is not only the bailiff of the Zurich people but also of other Swiss. However, when he has time, he will more diligently inspect the mandate or decree, if you prefer, which declares from the Swiss how far blood relatives are to be admitted to marriage, and then he will indicate what is permissible for them to do. We have erred through some negligence (unless I am mistaken) because good men did not request any letters from your council as witnesses of this matter. Hence, it may be that the bailiff considers what these sincere and honest men have reported from your side to be in vain. But the matter itself will soon teach what needs to be done.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Enough about the chronicles! If any error has occurred here, I openly admit it was my fault.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am deeply sorry for Marcellus and his wife, whom I ask you to greet warmly on my behalf. May the Lord restore them to us healthy in body and mind with His healing hand as soon as possible. I would have written to them if I had not been excluded by the lack of time.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>No one among us can clearly guess our situation amidst such great human treachery. It is written that the king and Granvela are well-disposed towards us, etc. Meanwhile, there is no response at all from the emperor, which is not free from grave suspicion. But if only we would rightly prove ourselves and all our matters to the Lord. For then everything would soon be happily accomplished for us by Him. Therefore, you will pray with all good people for us, so that we do not attempt anything prematurely and therefore without success (as we see happening so far), to our great detriment.</p>

      <p>Gyslinger left here in haste with his wife without saying goodbye, not having settled the debts he had accumulated here. I fear that a letter of reproach will have to be sent after him. The city guards searched for them both at home, intending to arrest them, but they were gone! May God have mercy on these wretched people and improve them with grace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Our people greet you as reverently and dutifully as they can, commending themselves most diligently to your sacred intercessions with the Lord. May your household be well with all brothers and friends, whose faithful prayers we greatly desire and hope to be aided by in Christ. Farewell again and again. January 24, 1548.</p>

      <p>Last night someone from Gottlieben told me that last Sunday the lads from Hemmenhofen marched over the ice towards Steckborn to the beat of a military drum in the manner of the Landsknechte. When the lads from Steckborn heard this, they also went towards them. They shouted at them not to beat the drum in this way on their territory. Thereupon, the others gave them harsh words and challenged them to come to them and fight with them, etc. Thus, the lads from Steckborn finally dared to cross the frozen ford and set upon the others, beating them badly and putting them to flight, so much so that one lad is said to have remained dead on the spot. They had nothing but sticks, etc. These are strange and unusual omens, etc.</p>

      <p>The emperor is continually recruiting many soldiers. What he has in mind cannot be known for certain, as so many different and contradictory things are said about the matter. But it will not remain hidden for long.</p>
