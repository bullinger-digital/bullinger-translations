      <p>Greetings, my Tobias. Today, I did not receive any letters from you in our market. However, I attribute this to your business and perhaps the lack of reliable and trustworthy messengers. Now, I am sending you what I promised in my previous letters. I do ask, however, that after you have used them, you return them to me. I now add this: yesterday, letters arrived here from Poland, indicating that Greater and Lesser Poland, Lithuania, and other nations of the Polish kingdom, that is, the faithful among them, have accepted our confession published in the year 1566. For the princes and ministers convened in a synod on April 14th in Sandomierz and unanimously agreed on this. Furthermore, in the public assemblies of the kingdom that began in May, they will present this to the king, translated into the Polish language. They sent us a printed copy. An agreement was also made between them and the adherents of the Augsburg Confession, the Waldensians, and the Stancarians, so that they can now freely testify before the king that there are no longer any dissensions among them, which the king had decided he would not tolerate in the kingdom.</p>
      <p>They collectively abhor the Arians and other sects, as expressed in the confession. They hope the king will not reject it, as it is known that the greatest kingdoms of the Christian world recognize this very confession: Transylvania, Hungary, France, England, Scotland, etc. To God be praise and glory. In Bavaria, under Joachim, Count of Ortenburg, there was abundant rain on June 15th. The Heidelberg wedding was successfully concluded, attended by about 4000 horsemen. Many princes were there, 42 counts, etc. The Emperor came to Speyer for the assembly on June 18th. With the death of Fridolin Brunner, the people of Glarus are asking us for a minister to appoint for them.</p>
      <p>Due to business, I could barely write this; take it in good spirit, live well, and farewell. July 7th, 1570.</p>
      <p>Greet the lords and brothers, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
