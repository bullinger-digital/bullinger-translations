      <p>Greetings. I received your last letters, in which you write that you have received three from me, most reverend father. In return, I am sending you what I recently received from Italy, thanks to Mr. Lentulus, who is still gravely ill.</p>
      <p>I would write nothing more to you about Gantner, if it were not for his obstinacy and such arrogance, which cannot be suppressed by our senate. The day before yesterday, I had lunch with Prefect Dieteg, at which Mr. Consul Ambrosius was also present. Speaking about the man's obstinacy, he said: "He has become superior to us and stronger than everyone. He was ordered to leave the land; he refuses to do so.</p>
      <p>He was handed over to our prefects and lictors; no one wants to touch him, etc."</p>
      <p>And this is God's just judgment, that the growing weeds eventually choke the wheat; they rightly entrusted the sheep to the wolf or rather the wolf to the wolves. It is a local custom that the city officials or prefects approach the condemned, capture them, and hand them over to the lictors to be thrown into chains; but these are the best friends of Gantner.</p>
      <p>They conspire among themselves; but it is to be feared that this game and joke will have a harsh outcome. - Here a whole regiment of mercenaries is being raised from the sea through Feldkirch and further to the Netherlands. Last Sunday, they seriously forbade, under penalty of life and property, that no one should join any foreign lord; for the Spaniard also had an agitator. But as soon as the Frenchman desires, whom they do not consider a foreign lord, this prohibition is nullified.</p>
      <p>I ask you to ensure that this letter is sent to Mr. MÃ¼ller in Basel at the first opportunity. Perhaps Mr. Simler or others will have messengers ready.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, April 27, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
