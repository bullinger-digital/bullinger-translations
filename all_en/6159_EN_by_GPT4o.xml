      <p>The time allotted to us is too short for the other three cities to be informed about your affairs, much less for a council to be convened regarding the envoys to be sent to you. I wrote through our Vogler that such serious matters should not be undertaken unless they are communicated through legitimate letters from the magistrate or the consuls.</p>
      <p>The princes expect little good from the Spaniard, who is more papal than papal and intends to uproot our faith. What if the emperor were to die? Wouldn't it be possible for him, with the help of the pope, to aspire to the empire and thereby cause great persecution and wage war against the French anew? For the Spaniards have not yet ceased to reckon in France. Do you now want to make the pope's anger and the rod over your hindquarters, making all Christians and Christ your enemies? When he has incited you to war, he will take the Valtellina from you again as a reward.</p>
      <p>Do not let the vile money and your poverty lead you to submit to one who does not love you. Rather, how did the Spaniard and the Swiss or the Confederates stand together? What love have they ever shown us? Why does he need the pass in Germany? Why does he not move like Charles V through Ferdinand's land, unless he perhaps has in mind something against the Ferdinandians with the empire and against the Germans? Therefore, we must be vigilant and pray. - Meanwhile, it is reported that the emperor is dead.</p>
      <p>Others firmly deny it... - The king is expected in Lyon and perhaps is already there. May this turn out for the good of the church.</p>
      <p>In Provence, otherwise, punishment has been inflicted on those who harassed the pious; churches are now also being established there. June 2, 1564.</p>
