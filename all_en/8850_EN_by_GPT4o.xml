      <p>At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the head of the Rhaetian was cut off, mainly because he invaded the provostship against the letters of the Rhaetians with his own authority. The remaining charges are of lesser importance. He was shown great mercy; otherwise, the initial judgment was to be executed under the gallows and buried. This was mitigated by the great pleas of several envoys and friendships, so that his head was taken by the city to the usual place, March 31, 1572, as above. His entourage was a cruel people. He was allowed to call upon a preacher or a mass priest. He did not want us, but he did employ sacrificial priests in the court. Later, rumors and messages came to the colleague, the Rhaetian desired his. He was allowed to go to him by the judge's permission. The first word was that he accused him of having brought him there.</p>
      <p>He asked: "Did you not send for me?" The response: "No." Then he excused himself and us before all the elders and showed how we warned them and were despised by them. He brought the man to the point that he finally offered him a drink, as he was already expecting the executioner's hand.</p>
      <p>He objected to the friendship.</p>
      <p>The response: "Because we were relatives, we warned you. Therefore, excuse us to your relatives." He denied that they were admitted to him. The response: "Then have us excused to the others, namely to the people." He had indeed departed in great haste.</p>
      <p>I gave the charges to the treasurer through Achilles Kerer. He wanted to go to the execution alone.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to God for us. I beg you, do not forget me in the name of change; for I am not safe. In the place of execution, relying on innocence, he said he wanted to die as a good man, with the sword hanging over him; but truth is victorious. March 31.</p>
