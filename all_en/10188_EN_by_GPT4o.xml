      <p>May God increase His grace in you.</p>
      <p>Dear sir, I wanted to send this enclosed writing to a trusted friend in Zurich. However, since I have no acquaintances there, as all the old ones have been taken by God, I know no one to send it to except you, whom I trust now, or Leo. Please open and read it, and if you think it might bring some benefit, let other trusted and God-loving men read and hear it as well. But if not, keep the letters with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the dealings with the Five Cantons, exhort the people to earnest prayer, patience, and strong trust in God; for God is mighty on our side and often takes away temporal means so that we may hope in Him alone, otherwise our gospel would become too carnal, and we would eventually succumb, even in this time. For Christ, who is in us, will remain Lord and King against all the defiance of the world. If we suffer or even die for it, it is our gain. Yet God is faithful; He provides a way out in trials and does not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear, etc.</p>
      <p>I have not been able to write to you further for a short time. Take from this little what I mean well towards all believers.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo, Pellican, and other brothers who love the Lord from the heart. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the fourth of December, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer, mayor of the city of Basel.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my kind dear sir.</p>
