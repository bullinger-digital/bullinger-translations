      <p>Greetings. I commend to you, my most esteemed lord, my son-in-law, who has been held by a remarkable eagerness to visit you, and now indeed fulfills this desire of his. He has joined himself as a companion to a most excellent man, whom I also hope will be most pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>I entrust to you, my old friend and most esteemed lord, a token of friendship, these my discourses on the Lord's Supper, and I wish you well in Christ with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 9th of July, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Thomas Blaurer, his most esteemed lord and friend in Kempten.</p>
      <p>10th of July, 1553.</p>
