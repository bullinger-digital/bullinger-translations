      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most excellent man, and I thank you for your kindness and diligence in writing. I have nothing to add now to what I have previously written, especially those things I wrote through the merchant Lumaga. I was anxious about my son because I had heard that he was ill.</p>
      <p>Now, since I understand from you and elsewhere that he is in better health, I give thanks to God. I sent... money in the month of September.</p>
      <p>I would not want to give him anything unless in necessity, lest he squander it, nor am I so endowed with resources that I can give as much as the foolishness and excessive and unnecessary use of such young men sometimes consume; they do not care where the money comes from, they only desire to receive it. If that friend of yours gave him anything, he will receive it with thanks, and I ask you to return these two gold coins to him and thank him in my name; you will soon receive those two gold coins from me. In these days, I gave a crown to someone from Augsburg, two crowns to someone from St. Gallen, and other things to others, all of which he received as a loan. I attribute this to his illness, although I understand it was not very long-lasting.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, as you understand necessity to demand, provide sufficiently; it will be repaid in good faith. Do not give him anything that does not pertain to necessity; for I want him to work and live by the labor of his hands. May the Lord bless him.</p>
      <p>I ask you to ensure that this letter is delivered to him promptly. By God's grace, we are well and in good condition here, except that the price of grain is continually increasing. May the Lord our God have mercy on us and not punish our incurable luxury and drunkenness with a lack of all things!</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet your parent and father-in-law, my always esteemed patrons, our Johannes, your entire household, and our fellow ministers, the minister of Christ, etc. I wrote in great haste.</p>
      <p>October 13. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, most worthy commissioner of the County of Chiavenna, esteemed and always beloved lord and friend. Chiavenna.</p>
