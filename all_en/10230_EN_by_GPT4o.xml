    <p xml:id="regest1">Praises and thanks for the letters and writings from Bullinger that have reached him. He extols the mutual friendship and apologizes for not responding to everything immediately. There seems to be a lively correspondence between Jud and Megander. Haller inquires about the biblical justification for the punishment of Anabaptists. The Bernese preachers can offer each other little help in such matters; Kolb is too old, he himself is too ignorant, and Megander is too stubborn. Haller asks for indulgence due to his frequent questions, as he relies on Bullinger's advice. With God's help, he has been able to fulfill his preaching duties so far - even alone for four years - despite his inadequate theological education. In connection with the publication of a writing on school and church in Bern, which was rejected by the councils, Megander and Rhellikan have behaved uncollegially towards Haller and Kolb. He thanks for Bullinger's commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, which he appreciates even more than the dedication addressed to him, and urges the publication of further Bible commentaries. Megander plans to publish a commentary on the Epistle of James, which Haller critically assesses, and another on the Epistle to the Ephesians. Haller is waiting for Zwingli's commentary on the Epistle of James. By Easter, they hope for the election of Jakob von Wattenwyl as Schulthei√ü. There is bitterness over Zurich's leniency in the mandate dispute. Rumors about a change of mind by Luther. A Bernese colleague claims that, based on the Old Testament, the Five Places should be attacked like the Canaanites once were. What does Bullinger think about this? Greetings. Haller misses a part of Pellikan's commentary work.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Everything you have sent me so far, dearest Heinrich, is so pleasing to me that I have received nothing more pleasing and do not believe I will receive anything more pleasing, as you are my entire soul and life. I know many flatterers and less sincere brothers, and I experience more of them every day. I embrace you above all, so that you hold the first place in the count of brothers and friends. After you, I can truly persuade myself of this about only a few. Therefore, even if you send me the most worthless pebble, it will be more pleasing and dearer to me because I know I have received it from the best and greatest of friends. So do not be troubled, even if I do not immediately respond to everything. Many are traveling from here to Zurich, about whom nothing is certain, and many bring letters to us from Leo Jud, who also remain unknown to you. Meanwhile, my spirit towards you remains most sincere. May God grant that what I often promise you in writing about myself may someday be experienced.</p>
      <p>I have nothing at all to inquire about regarding the punishment to be inflicted on the Anabaptists. I had requested a comparison of the passages Deuteronomy 13 [1-5] and 18 [9-20] about killing false prophets and Matthew 13 [30]: "Let both grow together," etc., to Titus [3,10]: "A man that is a heretic," etc., which I would still very much like to hear from you. We are three, to confess plainly, who can hardly help each other in comparing scriptures. Francis and I lack the gift of languages. He is already an old man and continues daily to build up the inner man, while I, as Eck accused Zwingli, am "a self-grown theologian," who has not used any teachers for a long time, who has had no method of study, nor any person with whom I could confer. Megander is such a person who has both judgment and the gift of languages, but is so tenacious of his own purpose that I am either forced to contend or leave without fruit.</p>
      <p>I have raised many issues in letters sent to you and daily inquire as a disciple from a teacher, which I know you either admire or suspect, as if I am testing you. But far be it from you to ever think this of me. Your writings and those of other pious brothers please me so much because they are candid, clear, true, and so open and simple that the darkness of our ignorance is completely removed. Therefore, do not regret, you in whom the Lord has bestowed so many gifts, occasionally helping me, your footstool, with your dexterity in the scriptures. You cannot believe how scant my resources are. For sacred sermons, the Lord has given so far, to whom alone I attribute it, what our church testifies, when I alone for four years, often exposed to many dangers and even death, many times to exile, ministered the word of the Lord. To the Lord be praise and glory forever! From the booklets and annotations of many, when I had no teacher, I gathered much with the greatest labor. I did not know how to use the sacred letters, except as others provided the occasion and the necessity of the church required. I wrote to you long ago, who I was from the egg. I repeat now again, so that you may more willingly continue to help me with your learning, as you have begun. As for your fear that there is any enmity between us, know that there is nothing of enmity and envy in me towards any mortal. If some, however, overcome by ambition, seek their own glory, I care not at all, at least with contempt for my name. I am sorry that my name has ever been printed, unless I could someday present the traces of my name to the world.</p>
      <p>On the 14th of this month, while I was sitting with Megander in our censorial court (in the Chorgericht), he said he would ask the senate for consent to print a certain apology of Rellicanus.</p>
      <p>I asked what kind it was. He gave it into my hands. I saw there encomiums of schools, teachers, and sub-teachers, and also of Megander. Therefore, when he went to the senate, they did not want to consent unless it was first read to them translated into the vernacular. On the 15th, the next day, when both the diacosii had also convened, the senate, with the arch-scribe indicating the summary of the apology, refused and did not want to consent. If Megander compiled a catalog of parish priests in the preamble letter, as far as I am concerned, I do not care nor am I troubled, except that it gives the parish priests an occasion either for enmity, since not all are counted, or for a perverse suspicion, since we two are not counted. I leave that to you. It will be enough to be commended to the Lord. I would have believed that Leo had warned them as he did about others. Do not be anxious about this matter, lest they think I am ill-disposed. However, I would like you to believe your judgment about those commentaries. For if he writes nothing else than what he taught openly, they can easily be judged by anyone.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that you, to whom I have done nothing to deserve it, have deigned to dedicate such an excellent work on the Epistle to the Romans to me, when do you think I will be able to give thanks as I should? When will I be able to repay this benefit, with which you have abundantly nourished my spirit? Moreover, in many things that I have touched upon in my weakness, you have borne witness to my spirit. For on the 26th of February of this year, I had finished the same epistle for a sermon. I have received all the quires up to the 5th inclusive. If the rest have been printed, that boy of our bookseller will bring them. Since I can neither give worthy thanks nor repay this gift with another similar gift, I will ensure that you receive at least a sign or witness of my gratitude, however small. I truly confess that I have received more joy from your pious meditations on the same epistle, knowing how much they will benefit many brothers of the Christian world, than from the fact that you have deigned to ascribe them to me. Your love and generosity towards me are great, but I revere the gift of God, from whom these have proceeded, much more. You promised on the Epistle of Peter, but I wish that what you have on the Gospel of John and the Thessalonians would be published someday. Megander promises on the Epistle of James, and I wish he would publish it as he taught. It would testify how excessive he sometimes is in commending, since he preferred it to all the epistles of Paul, and nowhere is the account of faith and piety more accurately described than in it. Also on the Ephesians. For he recently treated this from the pulpit. I am waiting for Leo's commentary on the Epistle of James from you.</p>
      <p>Our public affairs are otherwise well. As long as no one persecutes us, we are steadfast, but indeed cold in helping brothers exposed to dangers, exile, and idolatry from all sides. By Easter, the magistrate is to be appointed. There we would desire Jakob von Wattenwyl as the mayor. But the Lord will give leaders, provided he does not do so in his wrath. Our spirits were inclined towards you because you agreed with that opinion; but now everything is silent, and we do not receive a word about how your affairs are. If it seems convenient to you, write.</p>
      <p>I will send back the foolishness of the Noricans, as long as you cannot do without them, though they are enticing. They said Luther had revoked his opinion in a booklet on human error. I understand otherwise from you. We would also like to see this booklet.</p>
      <p>Finally, one of ours contends that we are also the carnal Israel, to whom the promises and threats of the law and the prophets pertain, so that it is also permissible for us, as you understand, to attack the Antronians no differently than the Canaanites with the tumult of wars. He also contends that the judicial laws bind us to this day and that it was done wrongly that the imperial laws are preferred to them, and he contends as if he had brought an oracle from heaven. He admits that the ceremonies are abolished and that Christ cannot be preached without the law. Capito disagrees with this in our synod. I now repeat what I prayed above: Do not regret indicating your judgment in this matter. They tell me you are too lenient when there is so much need for counsel; would to God that a trick would happen to that. What more? I fear I will never see you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>March 17th.</p>
      <p>And may you be safe forever with your wife, children, and brothers dear to you.</p>
      <p>Many are expecting Pellican's work. May the Lord grant him to complete the work he has begun. In the second volume of Pellican's commentaries, I am missing the first quire. I have the rest up to LL. inclusive.</p>
      <p>Yours whom you know as your own</p>
      <p>B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
