    <p xml:id="regest1">Count Georg gathers from Bullinger's letter [not received] that his own letter [18002 from January 4, 1548], which was sent by Pastor Matthias Erb from the lordship of Reichenweier [hbbw XX, No. 3098, from December 22, 1547] and his treatise on Judas's participation in the Last Supper, have arrived and that Bullinger agrees with Erb's view. [Also] the Count approves of it. May Erb remain with them for a long time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Count Georg can only report the following news about the Interim, which Bullinger may already know: Since the members [of the Interim committee] could not agree, the matter is again with Emperor Charles V. He appointed those electors, Frederick II the Wise of the Palatinate, Joachim II of Brandenburg, and Maurice of Saxony, whom he believed he could most easily win over for his schemes. He persuaded Frederick II and Joachim II with promises to leave [the drafting of the Interim] to him. Maurice is said to have agreed only after long resistance. This gives cause for concern about religion. May God judge it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Many reputable people have assured (as Count Georg has learned by letter) that the Interim provisions will turn out more favorably than expected, mostly in the manner of the Saxon or Brandenburg-Nuremberg church order. Hopefully, it will not get any worse!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">This should not be withheld from Bullinger. He can gladly share this news with the Zurich council with Count Georg's recommendations. Also, greetings to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">According to credible reports, the Emperor is said to have made tolerable conditions to the people of Constance regarding their request for reconciliation and has summoned a delegation from the city [to Augsburg]. This delegation is to submit to him there. Bullinger should report what he knows about this.</p>

      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard, etc. Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear friend. We have received your letter, in which it is mentioned that you have received our and our preacher Matthias Erb's letter and are always satisfied with the teachings of this preacher (especially regarding Judas's participation in the communion), etc., and have understood it. And as far as Erb's teachings and conduct are concerned, we have found great satisfaction and pleasure in him, sincerely praying to God the Lord to keep him with us for a long time.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for news, we currently know nothing special that is not already known to you, except perhaps the matter of the Interim, about which you may not yet be informed, namely that the appointed members could not agree and thus returned the matter to the Emperor. In response, His Majesty has appointed the three electors of the Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Saxony (as he believes they are most involved) and desires that they should assure His Majesty that they will not arrange it otherwise than in an imperial, Christian, and fair manner and will recognize it with all grace. The Palatinate and Brandenburg have soon agreed to this. However, Saxony is said to have resisted for a long time but eventually also agreed. Therefore, there is great concern for religion. May God direct it to His praise and glory.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, we have also been written to that some reputable people have indicated and assured that it will not be as bad with religion as one might think, and that the majority will remain with the Saxon, Brandenburg, and Nuremberg religion and order. May God grant that it does not get worse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We did not want to withhold this from you, in case you were not aware of it before, which you may well disclose to your superiors on our behalf and convey our friendly and gracious greetings to them, along with your fellow brother Gwalther. Dated Basel, April 10th, in the year, etc., 48.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We have also been credibly informed that tolerable conditions have been granted to the people of Constance regarding their reconciliation, for which they are said to have dispatched their envoys to make submission. Whatever you learn about this, please let us know.</p>
      <p>G. Count of Württemberg, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear friend Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
