      <p>The bearer of this letter, the messenger, is Alexander Marschalk's (this Saul, who persecutes us, whom I also mentioned in my letters) liege man and is often and much used by my gracious lords and young lords, because he is accustomed to running errands, and knows the paths and ways better than others, etc. I wanted to inform the lord of this not without reason.</p>
