    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In two hours, when the city gates open, a courier [...] will depart. Haller wants to take advantage of the rare opportunity to write a letter. He has not had a messenger available for a long time, otherwise, he would have written long ago.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger's extensive letter from December 11 [not received], which Haller received on December 21, was encouraging! The people of Augsburg are quite despondent due to the difficult situation, so much so that Haller hardly knows where to begin his report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The people of Ulm have reached an agreement with the Emperor [Charles V]. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is also in negotiations with the Emperor, who is now supposed to be in Stuttgart. Most of the Upper German cities are following the example of Ulm and the Duke. The enemy only has Augsburg left. [Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse] have withdrawn and are pursuing their own interests. Now the traitors have free rein, and everyone's true intentions are revealed! The Augsburg councilors are deliberating on their further actions. They fear a popular uprising more than the Emperor, for while the council is contemplating a [peace] treaty, the clergy is calling the population to steadfastness. The people of Memmingen are also toying with the idea of peace. Yes, disputes are arising everywhere. There is debate about whether it would not be better to come to an understanding with the Emperor without giving up the Gospel, rather than risking the salvation of the fatherland, especially since they have now been abandoned by everyone. Haller fears that reconciliation with the Emperor will occur because no one wants to suffer for the Gospel anymore! Those who disliked the war from the beginning now feel strong, while the brave ones of yesterday are beginning to fear. Indeed, the situation is extremely dangerous! May Christ grant the strength to suffer! Undoubtedly, the bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] will be allowed back into the city unless the Lord prevents it. The people of Augsburg have been betrayed and abandoned by the princes! Consequently, it is likely that, if not immediately, an understanding with the Emperor will be reached, provided it can be negotiated on good terms.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Haller asks Bullinger for advice because he hesitates. He sees no way out. He takes refuge in the Lord and exhorts the people to steadfastness, which, however, brings the danger of an uprising, while others counter that only two princes remain, a bigamist and an opponent [of the Zurichers] in the matter of the Lord's Supper, and that these cannot come to the aid of the people of Augsburg. The people of Augsburg would have no choice but to starve, as neither bread nor salt from Swabia and Bavaria, nor wine from Württemberg can be delivered to the city. It is well understood what such considerations aim at, even if no official negotiations have yet taken place. May the Lord keep us firm in faith and grant us the grace to strengthen others!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger writes about the recall of the [Zurich] colleagues [Lorenz Meyer (Agricola), Rudolf Schwyzer, and (Hans) Thoman Ruman] working in Augsburg. But now is really not the right time for that, even if they wish for nothing else. A recall would cause offense, indeed, it would arouse suspicion that the pastors had complained about something, whatever reasons the [Zurich councilors] might give. Moreover, each of the three pastors has already received 80 guilders in salary from the Augsburg council, so they would feel cheated. Haller has also spoken with Frölich and [Michael] Keller about it, and both advise against a recall. Currently, there is thought of sending one of the two pastors [Meyer or Schwyzer] to Kaufbeuren to join [Thomas] Naogeorg, as the people of Kaufbeuren have requested a pastor. However, permission would be sought from Zurich first. Instead of recalling the pastors and thereby embarrassing the Augsburg councilors, they should be admonished to obey their superiors and thus be given a check. Furthermore, Haller would not dare to demand travel money for the recalled ones. The authorities might object that the travel money previously paid to them was hardly fully spent on the journey, or that the Zurichers should have held back their pastors earlier [namely when they were back in Zurich]. The fact that the [three pastors] were not assigned a parish cannot be used by the Zurichers as a reason for a recall, for many in Zurich are also waiting for a position, and yet they are useful in the meantime by serving various parishes! Furthermore, [the three pastors] receive the same salary as Haller and the other colleagues. Since they are also alone, they can support themselves even better. Finally, it would rightly be wondered why Haller is not also recalled, especially since he is exposed to even greater dangers than they are.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] With his previous letters [No. 2685 and No. 2701], Haller did not intend to effect the recall of the Zurich colleagues, but to inform Bullinger like a father about the situation. For even if [Meyer and Schwyzer] cause Haller trouble, he would much rather endure some difficulties than cause offense in the church or thereby damage Zurich's reputation! If there were really a reason for their recall, Haller would inform Bullinger and the council. The current incidents, however, are limited to the private sphere and do not provide grounds for a recall. Haller's admonishment of [Meyer and Schwyzer] comes from the fact that he cannot always remain silent in the face of their audacious rudeness. Haller has never encountered such stubbornness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Currently, [Meyer and Schwyzer] seem to be plotting something (and presumably against Haller), for they are provoking. Haller, however, goes about his calling undeterred, seeking the salvation of the church and striving for its edification. In his free time, he devotes himself to study at home. They, however, carouse daily with their acquaintances. The day before, Meyer and Schwyzer, along with two others [...], went to a neighboring village to drink with a priest [...]. If the council knew about it, they would be shocked!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Haller reports this not to betray [Meyer and Schwyzer], but to keep Bullinger informed so that he may assist him with his advice in the interest of the church. Haller also does not want Bullinger to reveal his source of information. He should [simply endure] the situation, and Haller will [also strive] to endure it. If the [two] are separated, they will no longer be able to behave so obstinately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [Hans Wilpert] Zoller is doing well. He and Haller have reconciled. Yesterday they dined together with the [former] mayor [Hans] Welser, who sends his regards. Haller will attend to the matter of [Hans] Vogler [the Elder or the Younger] later, as Frölich cannot currently devote time to his friends. [Francesco] Stancaro is very grateful for the honorable mention [in the letter addressed to Haller] and for the [book] gift from Bullinger and his colleagues [i.e., for the "Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae ministrorum confessio"]. He would have written as well if he had known about the messenger. Bernardino [Ochino] fears falling into the clutches of the Pope [Paul III] again. Bullinger should encourage him in writing, as Ochino holds him in high regard. Musculus is as timid as a mouse. [Pankraz] Mötteli [vom Rappenstein] was released [from prison] but lost his position. Zoller, however, continues to receive four times the pay. When peace returns, he will surely find a good wife. Haller will help him with that. Zoller is being courted by a daughter of Frölich [Anna?], but a marriage with her would be disastrous. Haller refrains from mentioning the reasons out of respect for the honorable father.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The discrepancy between Meyer's letter and Haller's letter [No. 2701] is explained by the fact that the slanderer, [Georg] Caesar, left Augsburg eight days later than Haller thought. However, it is not true that he behaved threateningly towards the Zurichers. Rather, he avoided them. Since the discussion with him, Haller has not seen him again, and the incident has been settled. There are many Lutherans in Augsburg who cannot be easily gotten rid of. Their stubborn error can only be dispelled by the Spirit of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] According to Stancaro, the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is preparing. Similar reports have recently come from Venice, as Haller has already reported [with No. 2712].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The Landgrave is supposed to negotiate peace between the Elector and Duke Maurice in Leipzig. The Elector has plundered the Bishopric of Mainz for 40,000 florins. He did the same in the Bishopric of Würzburg. It is claimed that the princes, after reaching an agreement, will join Maurice in marching against the Emperor next summer. But what the people of Augsburg will do until then, only God knows, who may direct everything for the good of the fatherland and the preservation of evangelical freedom!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Haller already senses what is to come: Although the Emperor claims not to have waged war against the Gospel, and still allows free preaching, once he has subdued everything, he will end the Council of Trent and condemn all heretics to the stake. Then the great persecution will begin! Then the chosen ones will be tested!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] But it is God's matter. May He direct everything for our soul's salvation! Bullinger, his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], and the children are commended to Him. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther. Early in the morning, before the city gates open.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. I am told about someone who will leave in two hours when the gates open. Therefore, I cannot refrain from writing at least a few lines on this occasion. I have not been able to have any news for many days, otherwise, I would not have delayed writing for so long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Your letter dated December 11 was delivered to me on the 21st of the same month. It was all the more welcome to me because it was so detailed. It greatly cheered me up in these troubles. For we are pressed by no small evils, which I do not know where to begin to describe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The people of Ulm have reached an agreement with the Emperor. They want to be neutral. The same is done by the Duke of Württemberg. The Emperor is said to be in Stuttgart today. Most of the upper cities follow them. Only Augsburg is now left to the enemy. The princes have left. They seek their own interests. They neglect the safety of the cities. Traitors now act freely, doing whatever they want. Now the true intentions of everyone are revealed! Our people are also deliberating on what to do. Sedition is more to be feared than the enemy. While the magistrates contemplate a treaty, we exhort the people to steadfastness; hence the fear of a popular uprising. The people of Memmingen are also being tempted. Disputes arise everywhere from everyone. There is debate about whether it is better to make peace with the Emperor while preserving the Gospel than to be abandoned by everyone and expose the salvation of the fatherland and souls to present danger. I fear, I fear, that within a few days our people will also attempt something! No one wants to suffer for the Gospel. We look to the nearest things! Those who disliked the war from the beginning now boast the most. Those who have been brave until now are afraid. Thus, our situation stands in the greatest danger. May the Lord Jesus, who suffered for us, strengthen and comfort us with His Spirit, so that we may also suffer with Him! I do not doubt that the bishop will eventually be received back into the city unless the Lord graciously averts it with reasons far removed from human reason. We are betrayed and sold! Princes and lords, to whom we have entrusted honor, goods, and blood, now leave us in the lurch. It is now up to Augsburg. Therefore, I believe they will eventually make a treaty with the Emperor, even if not immediately, if they can obtain any fair conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What should I do here, I ask for your advice, please. I am completely stuck. I see no way out or plan. Therefore, I turn to God alone, to whom I humbly commit all matters. I strongly exhort the people to steadfastness. In the meantime, however, some tumult is to be feared, which causes me a lot of trouble. Others object that there are only two princes left: one a bigamist, the other an enemy of ours regarding the sacrament of confession. Moreover, they cannot bring us aid. We are to be starved to death, as we have neither bread and salt from Swabia and Bavaria nor wine from the Duchy of Württemberg. In short, I see what they are contemplating, although nothing has been publicly done yet. I have conferred with Dr. Laetus. He is also very concerned about our safety. Thus, Satan is trying to sift us! May the Lord grant that our faith does not fail, but that we may also strengthen other brothers. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>You write about recalling the brothers, which I do not think is advisable now, even though they seek nothing else. It would be a great offense if they returned so soon, and there would be suspicion, whatever might be pretended, that they had complained about something. Moreover, it would be inconvenient, as each has already received 80 florins from the lords. If they were now recalled, the lords would think they were being mocked. I have conferred with Laetus and Cellarius. They do not advise it in any way. It is intended to send one of them to Kaufbeuren to the very learned and excellent man Naogeorgus. For the people of Kaufbeuren have requested one from our people. Neither of them will accept the condition without consulting you. I therefore ask that, to avoid scandal and bad suspicions, you do not recall them, but rather order them to obey those lords on whose expenses they now live. So they will be a little deposed. It would be ridiculous to my lords. Nor could I obtain travel money for them with an honest title. The lords would object, if it had not been of any use. It could have been done before. For it is not, as they pretend, that they are not needed. How long have they often waited in Zurich, who nevertheless have so many parishes to provide for! Moreover, they have the same salary as I and other pastors, so they can pay their debts better, as they are alone. But if these reasons, which they use, are sufficient to recall them justly, why should I not also be recalled, who have the same causes and reasons and much more and greater than they, who have more business, more dangers, who have served longer than they? I do not see, therefore, how you can recall them, leaving me alone in these troubles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Nor did I write the previous letters to you to wish them to be recalled, but only to inform you as a father how their affairs were. For, although they cause me much trouble and are a great burden, I will rather bear this, whatever it is, than put a stumbling block in the church or make the name of Zurich be heard badly through this. If they have done anything worthy of being recalled and deposed, I will not hide it from you or the most honorable council. Most of the things that are happening now are private. I faithfully warn them, although I know they are very hostile to me. For I cannot always remain silent about their rash rusticity. I warn them to be provident; but I do not know if I have ever seen more headstrong men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Now they are plotting something (unless I am mistaken, against me). For they do not want to open up, but only touch with pointed words. But I do not care about all this. I seek this, for which I was sent: the salvation of the church and the edification of all. I spend all the time given to me for leisure on studies; I stay at home. They feast daily. They have their companions, who flock to them in the inn. The day before, Laurentius and Rodolphus, with two others, went out to a certain neighboring village to drink with a priest. If the council knew about it, they would be very offended, and not without reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I write this to you, not to slander them, but so that I do not hide from you, as part of my duty, those things that contribute to the salvation or detriment of the church, so that you can more easily assist me with your advice. I also do not want you to betray that I wrote this to you. You too should endure a little longer, and I will endure. If they are separated, they will no longer behave so obstinately.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Zoller is alive and well. He has reconciled with me. Yesterday we dined together at the consul Welser's. He sends you many greetings. We will take care of Vogler's business sometime. Now, in these troubles, there is no time given to Dr. Laetus, which he can fully devote to friends. Dr. Stanggarus gives you great thanks for the honorable mention you made of him and the friendly offering of your services. He would have written if he had known about this messenger. Bernhardinus is very anxious. He fears that he will eventually fall into the hands of the Pope again. I wish you would write to him and comfort him. For he is very devoted to your name. Musculus is a mouse. He is very afraid. Mötelinus has been dismissed, but deprived of his condition. Zoller has four times the pay until a future time. I do not doubt that, when things are settled, he will easily find an honest wife. I will do my duty. The daughter of Lord Laetus courts him. But she is by no means to be married to him, unless he wants to perish utterly. I could indicate reasons known to the whole public among us, which I pass over out of respect for the honor of the most distinguished man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The reason for the discrepancies between Laurentius's letters and mine is that Caesar, that slanderer, left eight days later than I thought. But it is not that he behaved threateningly towards us. Rather, he avoided our sight. For I have never seen him again since I spoke to him in my study. So that heat is calmed. We have many Lutherans, but they cannot be suppressed in this way. Therefore, their fanatical error must be removed by the Spirit of God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Dr. Stanggarus told me about the Turkish expedition being prepared. The same was also recently written from Venice, as I wrote to you in previous letters, which I assume you have received in the meantime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The Landgrave is now in Leipzig to arrange peace between the Elector and Duke Maurice. The Elector has plundered the Bishopric of Mainz for 40,000 florins, and likewise the Bishopric of Würzburg. It is thought that if they reach an agreement with Duke Maurice, they will march against the Emperor again in the summer. In the meantime, what our people will do, God knows. May He direct their plans for the salvation of the fatherland and the preservation of evangelical freedom. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I seem to see the outcome of this matter: the Emperor does not attack the Gospel, nor does he claim to have undertaken the war for this reason; he allows free preaching. But after he has subdued everything, he will conclude the Council of Trent and condemn all those heretics to the fire. Then the true persecution will begin. Then the elect will be tested.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>The matter is the Lord's. May He direct this to the salvation of our souls! I commend you to Him with your wife and dearest children. Greet the venerable lords and brothers Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gwalther, etc. Augsburg, December 23, early in the morning, before the gates were opened. I. Haller, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and venerable father. Zurich. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
