    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received Bucer's letters [above No. 2028 and No. 2031] with his lengthy comments on Luther's [„Short Confession“]; Bullinger - who has not yet seen this polemic - has also received a letter from Melanchthon regarding this matter, expressing regret over the rekindling of the [Lord's Supper] dispute; other scholars are also annoyed by it. The [Confederates] have long known how Bucer interprets Luther's view; they had already discussed this matter in detail with Bucer at the 1538 meeting in Zürich; they also know how Luther condemned their stance in his „Letter to the people of Frankfurt“ [from 1533] and in his confession [on the Lord's Supper, 1528] supported the position of the sophists and their condemnation of Berengar [of Tours]. Together with Bucer, [the Confederates] rejected Luther's stance at the Bern Disputation [of 1528]; they continue to reject it: Christ at the right hand of the Father retains his body with its physical substance and nature, even if Schwenckfeld disputes this; Christ's body corresponds to that of the resurrected (1 Cor 15 [35-53]); this was believed by the early Christian community, later also by scholars and pious people down to Oecolampadius and Zwingli, while Luther shares the opinion of the papists. [The Confederates] regret that they now have to enter the arena; if necessary, they reserve the right to mention Bucer's failed concord efforts. Bucer believes they are opposing an extraordinary servant of God; Bullinger rather has the impression that the excessive honor that Bucer and his like show to Luther, revered like a demigod, has spoiled him; certainly, God has accomplished extraordinary things through this man, but his writings reveal evil vices; posterity will probably be able to judge this better. Bucer rightly regrets the unworthy dogma of redemption for idolaters for learned Christians; however, Bullinger can only marvel at Bucer here, since in his commentary on Romans he holds the same opinion as Zwingli regarding the heathens and the uncircumcised! May Bucer give up his hope for concord, after he himself will have realized that his efforts are in vain; if only he had never started it!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I have received and read your two letters, dear Bucer, in which you extensively comment on that furious writing of Luther; but since I have not yet seen it, I do not respond to you. Indeed, Philipp Melanchthon warned that he wrote very bitterly against us and lamented with much sorrow in a recent letter to me that the disputes among the pious are rekindling. Other learned and pious men who have read the book have also written, strongly disapproving and expressing indignation that he so confidently assumes the role of both author and judge, forging new thunderbolts in the manner of a pope.</p>
      <p>You interpret Luther's opinion in many ways; but we have already heard that from you long ago. To us, who carefully examine his writings, it seems otherwise.</p>
      <p>We discussed this matter with you in detail at the last meeting in Zürich in the year 1538, and we recognize no other presence of Christ than the spiritual and effective one, not a bodily one. Luther, in his letter to the people of Frankfurt, condemns that opinion as heretical and insists on one that is perceived both by hand and mouth. In his last Confession, he states that, except for transubstantiation, he agrees with the sophists and approves the canon "I, Berengar".</p>
      <p>However, we rejected that opinion with you at the Bern Disputation, and we still oppose it today. Christ is at the right hand of the Father with his body; his body retains the substance and nature of a true body, although Schwenckfeld denies and contradicts this; his glorious body corresponds to our glorified bodies according to the apostolic doctrine in 1 Corinthians 15 [35-53]; he is present to the church in spirit, effect, power, and virtue, not in body. This was the belief of the early church, and later of learned and pious men in the church, both ancient and modern, among whom are Zwingli and Oecolampadius, etc. We will remain in this confession, and since it is certain from Luther's writings that he asserts a different opinion and agrees with the papists, we commit him to God's judgment and will do what we think is in the interest of the glory of Christ, truth, and the church.</p>
      <p>You urge us not to drag you, a lover of peace, into conflict. Indeed, with sorrow, but with a mind trusting in God's grace, we enter the arena. We are far from wishing to drag others who resist along with us. But I do not think you demand that we make no mention of you; for if the matter itself requires it, we will explain how amicably we have conducted ourselves in the matter of concord, which was indeed begun under your auspices, but not happily concluded, etc.</p>
      <p>You proclaim to many that Luther is a singular servant of God. You add that we are entering into conflict with an excellent servant of God. But I, dear Bucer, fear that you and those like you have made him so insolent with excessive praises. Certainly, the Lord has worked extraordinary things through him; but the same man has shameful vices in his writings, as we are all inclined to worse. Many seem to almost worship this man as a demigod; but truth, time, and posterity will judge better about him and about us. I would not wish all Christians to be such as Luther presents himself to us in his writings; I say nothing now about the man's morals and life.</p>
      <p>You are miserably tormented by that doctrine, certainly unworthy of Christian teachers, about the salvation of idolaters, etc. But you compel me to marvel at this, knowing that Zwingli felt no more or less about the heathens and the uncircumcised than you yourself do in the 2nd chapter of your Commentary on the 2nd chapter of Romans. However, I do not intend to dispute this matter with you now.</p>
      <p>I respond briefly to your matters and pray you to abandon the hope of concord and the effort to reconcile those very different opinions, after you have experienced that you are wasting your effort and expense. Luther cannot be tamed by any arts; and I wish the business of poorly patched concord had never been started!</p>
      <p>I speak freely with you and pray that you take my freedom in good part. Let us pray to the Lord, that having mercy on us, he may keep us in his holy will. November 24, 1544.</p>
