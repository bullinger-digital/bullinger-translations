      <p>Many good years, and whatever serves us for the health of body and soul.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious lord and brother, I have, through Master Heinrich Luti and Mr. Curate Schreyvogel, presented the letter you sent from Bern to Michael, and informed him of your intentions, and it was expected that he would come to me in Töss, since I, being hindered by gout, could not come to him.</p>
      <p>However, nothing has happened so far, but instead, he dismisses the matter to everyone with somewhat awkward words, etc. Recently, he was offered a benefice or a preaching position near Fischingen, at the far end of the Hörnli, but he also declined it, as I fear his wife wants to be the master in that place, wanting to move with him nowhere other than to Winterthur, Zurich, or nearby, etc. I write to you thus, in case he wants to make excuses to you in another way, so that you can deal with him better, and also, so that I can excuse myself for the rejection he has received from Töss, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated in haste, as the messenger was ready to leave, January 2, 1533.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Brennwald, caretaker in Töss.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and brother.</p>
