      <p>Our illustrious and great Palatine of Krak√≥w, and also the chief captain and prefect of this city, to whom you wrote letters at our departure, while he was still in lower ranks, that is, only the captain of Malbork, you wrote, however, at our request, because you had learned from us that he was a patron of the church.</p>
      <p>Now he writes back to you out of his respect for you, for he esteems you, as he is a most prudent and serious man, and he loves you wonderfully, believe me, and he desires to become very familiar with you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most esteemed father, you will write back to him, with the ease and kindness you show to all, and you will write as to a patron of the church, who has now been appointed by God and the king to the highest and most ample dignities that can exist in our kingdom, and you will encourage him to diligently study the edification of the church and to strive to expel Anabaptism and Arianism from this city, to which he has been given by God as a magistrate, for the consolation of his church.</p>
      <p>For never before has the church in this kingdom had a Christian man as a magistrate, he is the first, and may he be the most fortunate. Finally, I also earnestly ask you, my father, to say something about me in the same letters to his magnificence, from which he can seriously gather that I am loved by you. For even though the doors are always open to me with him and I speak more frequently than all others about church matters with him, which both Dlusius knows and the boys themselves, and I have two of his nephews in my company and under my instruction, yet relying on your testimony, I would more boldly handle the affairs of our afflicted brothers with him and perform duties for the church, on behalf of which brothers I earnestly and repeatedly ask you, my father, to diligently commend this very thing to the Palatine from you.</p>
