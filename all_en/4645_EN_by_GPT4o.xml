      <p>Greetings. I have written to you twice from Baden.</p>
      <p>I sent some small cheeses and a papal bull printed in Rome. I also mentioned the interest, but I did not know that the arbitrators had approved a rate of ten percent. When I understand the king's will on this matter, I will write to you more extensively about it, and what I myself think. The letters I received on the journey, you will deliver to Mr. Gwalter, and you will see what has been written to me from Italy and from France through Mr. Martyr or Waldung as interpreters; afterwards, you will send them back to me.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received the last pages of your treatise on the council; I will not share what you sent with anyone, unless you write that it is timely. Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 28.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
