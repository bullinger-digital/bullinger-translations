      <p>Greetings. I am entirely occupied with writing books, which I am preparing and working on in the German language against all the sects of the Anabaptists. For a long time, many good men from Lower Germany have requested this; but also, in these regions, the Anabaptist plague is re-emerging. Indeed, I wrote four books against them 29 years ago; but in the meantime, many other things and the Anabaptists themselves have provided us with much to refute. The work is immense.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I think I can hardly finish, and yet I have been engaged in it for 14 days now, during which I completed the first book; for I am hurrying, if I can, to publish by the next fair.</p>
      <p>You pray to the Lord, that I may do what is for His glory and our salvation with abundant fruit, and that strength may be sufficient for me, otherwise weak and exhausted by many labors and sorrows. At the same time, I continue in Jeremiah and do not omit any of my sermons.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this will be my last labor.</p>
      <p>But, let what the Lord wills be done! The treasurer Edlibach was buried yesterday with a great crowd of people; he returned his spirit to God with admirable faith and cheerfulness.</p>
      <p>Our elders are gradually failing; may the Lord be with us. My son will write when he has recovered; he is receiving some treatment.</p>
      <p>I have given letters to Mr. Pellican and the widow of Leo and your father-in-law to be delivered, and I have no doubt about his faith and diligence, etc. We are waiting to see what the assembly, which will begin on the 10th or 11th of December in Baden, will produce. Farewell and do not be surprised if I write more rarely and briefly.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, you continue to write to me frequently. May Mr. Philipp, the consuls, and other good men, friends, brothers, Pontasella, etc., be well. December 8, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Church of Chur, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
