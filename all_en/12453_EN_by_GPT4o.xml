    <p xml:id="regest1">[On March 23] Haller sent a thick letter [No. 2389], before receiving Bullinger's letter from March 12 [No. 2377] two days later. Since he had already answered almost all of Bullinger's questions contained therein, he can be brief here. He thanks Bullinger for the admonition expressed [in No. 2388] [“Oratio de persecutione ecclesiae”?], especially since persecution is imminent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In recent days, a Spaniard [Alfonso Diaz] had his brother [Juan Diaz] cruelly murdered by a servant [Juan Prieto]; more about this in Georg Frölich's letter [No. 2405]. This example urges one to pray, and it is recognized what [the Protestants] are facing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Some say that the bishops gathered in Trent want to unanimously depose the Pope [Paul III.] because he is allegedly selling off the papal inheritance, supposedly to suppress the German heretics with the money, but actually to distribute the money to his own. Consequently, he is robbing the Apostolic See. In this corrupt world, one is truly no longer safe from anything!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Emperor [Charles V.] is feigning; the [Protestants] are pretending. Good words are exchanged on both sides, but internally they are enraged against each other. Sometimes war is reported, other times peace; but only war is to be expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Charles V.] is not yet in Regensburg, but will soon arrive there. Last week he was in Speyer, where he was supposed to meet Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], which displeases all good people, for they fear the deceitfulness of this Spanish braggart. Haller has heard nothing about a meeting between Duke [August] of Saxony and [Franz] of Lüneburg in Augsburg. Also, what Bullinger wrote about the false Frederick was unknown to him. [Georg] Frölich also wants to know more about it. Our true Frederick is Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller has reported extensively about [Hans Wilpert] Zoller in his last letters [No. 2364 and No. 2389]; he has now written to [Rudolf] Gwalther about [Hans] Vogler [the Younger].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Haller is well. He awaits Bullinger's response to his last letter [No. 2389].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Best wishes for [Konrad] Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander]. Haller is glad that Erasmus [Schmid] has passed away peacefully. Greetings from Haller's wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Enclosure:] Copy of a letter addressed to a citizen of Augsburg [...] from Neuburg [an der Donau]: For about four weeks, a learned Spaniard [Juan Diaz] who had turned to the Protestant faith stayed in Neuburg with the preacher [Adam Bartholomäus]. When his brother [Alfonso], living in Rome, heard that [Juan] had decisively represented the [Protestant] standpoint against the papacy during the [Second Religious] colloquy in Regensburg, he hurried to [Germany] and came to Neuburg, where he was accommodated with [Leonhard] Rehlinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Alfonso tried to dissuade his brother from the Protestant faith, promised him a bishopric, and also tried with kindness; but all in vain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Finally, he gave his brother money for better clothing, kissed him like Judas once did, and had himself brought to Augsburg to the postmaster [...] by Rehlinger's coachman Jörg [Knittel?].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- When on Friday [March 26] the coachman, accompanied by Sininger's son [...], reached Pöttmes [on the return journey], he was quite surprised to find [Alfonso] in the company of [Juan Prieto and a mounted messenger from Augsburg] at the butcher's [...] in the inn. Alfonso invited the coachman and his companion to spend the night in Pöttmes and promised to cover the costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Alfonso] then acquired an axe in Pöttmes, rented new horses, and reached Feldkirchen the same day, from where he and his accomplice [Prieto] went to Neuburg early the next morning and knocked at [Rehlinger's] door. When they were let in [the courtyard], the accomplice knocked on [Juan]'s apartment and declared he had an important letter from his brother for him. While [Juan] was reading, [Prieto] struck his head with the axe and immediately fled the city with [Alfonso].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- They were pursued hastily to Innsbruck. There, the chamberlain [from Neuburg, Michael] Herpfer was able to arrest and imprison them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [In Bullinger's hand:] The murdered Spaniard was named Juan Diaz, his rich and powerful brother, a judge of the Roman Rota, Alfonso. The murder was committed on March 27 between 5 and 6 in the morning.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [In Haller's hand:] Bullinger should also give the letter to [Ambrosius] Blarer to read.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord. Two days before I received your earlier letters, which are dated March 12, I sent a large bundle of letters, in which I responded to almost everything you wish to know in your letters; I assume you have received them by now. Therefore, I will be brief at present. I thank you very much for that holy exhortation of yours, which will certainly be a great comfort to me; for the die is cast for persecution.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In recent days, a Spaniard in Neuburg, a doctor of the papal court, cruelly murdered his own brother through a servant, as you will understand in detail from Mr. Laetus' letters. We should indeed be stirred by this example to constancy, vigilance, and frequent prayer. For we see what threatens us all, what we should expect from these scoundrels. Everything they sweetly sing is false.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Some say that the bishops gathered in Trent are unanimously going to depose the Pope because he sells the cities and patrimony of St. Peter as if he wants to suppress the German heretics with this money, while in fact, he distributes and confers all this money to his heirs, thus defrauding the apostolic see of its goods. There is no doubt, however, that all this and everything else is done deceitfully. The age is so perverse that I cannot sufficiently lament the immense treachery that is everywhere. But nothing is certain, nothing, so that even friends are not allowed to write anything that cannot be accused of falsehood after a few days, and one regrets having written it. I wonder what the outcome of such great fraud and treachery will be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor pretends, our people dissemble; good words on both sides, but with minds so mutually embittered that nothing surpasses it. Now war is announced, soon again peace, yet in the greatest peace, nothing but war is to be hoped for. May the Lord strengthen us, that we may conquer with Him who conquered the world by dying.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Emperor has not yet come to Regensburg. He was still in Speyer this week. He will finally come there shortly. The Dukes, as you write, of Saxony and Lüneburg were not in Augsburg, nor have I heard anything about them. They say the Emperor will meet the Landgrave in Speyer, which pleases no good people. They fear the deceit of that Spanish braggart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What you write about the false Frederick is unknown to me. Some nonsense is spread, but only by children. I would like to know on what occasion you wrote this. Laetus also wants to know the same. Jesus Christ is our Frederick, the true anti-pope, who, rich in peace, gives peace to all who believe in Him; yet not in the way the world gives, but through many afflictions, we must enter the kingdom of heaven. The foolish world constantly invents something new to support its treachery and unbelief.</p>
      <p>As for Zoller and Vogler, I wrote extensively about the former in my recent letters, and now I have written to Gwalther about the latter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>As for my affairs, everything is well. However, I am expecting your response to my recent letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell. I wish Mr. Pellicanus, Mr. Theodorus, etc., well. I am glad that Erasmus has passed away peacefully. Soon, if it pleases the Lord, we will all follow.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you. Augsburg, April 1, 1546. Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his ever-revered lord and father.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Copy of a letter sent from Neuburg to a citizen of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings, etc. Dear brother-in-law, I inform you that a Spanish doctor has been here for about four weeks and has been in and out with the preacher. He was a very learned, pious evangelical man. He could not speak any German. Now, he had a brother in Rome. He found out that he was in Regensburg at the disputation and that he was very much on the evangelical side and very much against the papacy. The murderer was sent out of Rome for his sake in 9 days to here. He was quartered with Rechlinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>He stayed there for four or five days and dealt with his brother very friendly, trying to persuade him to abandon the evangelical sect and go with him to Rome. He promised to arrange a bishopric for him, so that he would have 10 or 15,000 florins a year. But he could not persuade him. He said he would not deviate from the gospel and the sacrament in both kinds; he would rather give his life for it. Now the villain dealt with him very friendly, and so well that one was amazed. But he could not move him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Finally, when he saw that he could not achieve anything, the villain took leave of him and left him 20 crowns, saying he should clothe himself, for he was very poorly dressed. He also kissed him like Judas did to the Lord, and left on Rechlinger's carriage, saying he would write to him soon again. And the coachman Jörg took him straight to Augsburg to the postmaster. There he paid him and let him travel on.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>And when Jörg traveled back on Friday and came to Pöttmes, he found the villain himself with two others at the butcher's in the inn. And Sininger's son traveled with Jörg. And when they wanted to leave, the villain had them told to stay that night in Pöttmes. He would arrange the provisions for them. They agreed to that.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Then the villain borrowed other horses and rode to Feldkirchen that same day, and early on Friday morning rode into the suburb of Neuburg, and tied the horses to a fence. And the villain went in with his servant and gave the servant a letter and a carpenter's tool that he had bought in Pöttmes. And he knocked at the inn and said he had a letter that he must give to the Spaniard. They opened for him, and they both went in, and the servant knocked at the chamber and called to him to get up, he must give him a letter. He got up and went into the room. And as he was reading the letter, the villain, the servant, pulled the tool from under his coat and struck him on the head from behind, so that he had to leave it stuck. And his master, the murdered brother, stood in the stairway and heard the blow. Then they both jumped down the stairs and out of the house and the city, and got back on their horses and rode away.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>They were pursued, but could not be caught. They thus escaped to Innsbruck. There, the chamberlain, Harpfer, threw them down and brought them into prison. He pursued them on the post and then captured them. How it will go with them, we will hear later.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>The murdered Spaniard was named Juan Diaz, his brother Alfonso Diaz, judge of the Roman Rota, a powerful, rich papist. The murder took place on March 27 in the morning between 5 and 6.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Also give this to Mr. Blaurer to read.</p>
      <p>How Diaz was murdered in Neuburg.</p>
