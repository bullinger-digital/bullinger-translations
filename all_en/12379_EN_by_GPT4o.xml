    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received the letter from Blarer [No. 2319] delivered by the butchers. He has not reported anything about [Joachim] Mötteli's [alleged statements about Zurich's handling of returning mercenaries] to anyone. The [actual informant Wilhelm von Peyer] simply told something. - Bullinger thanks for the transmission of the news sent by [Thomas Blarer from the Bundestag in Frankfurt] and is interested in further information as well as in the opinion of Luther, Melanchthon, and [Johannes] Bugenhagen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [Regensburg] religious discussion will end as passionately as it began.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Emperor [Charles V.] is allegedly having projectiles manufactured in Belgium for a war. It is to be expected that [the Reichstag in] Regensburg is merely [a tactical war maneuver]. [Charles V.] is indeed worse than Diocletian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- It pains Bullinger that the church in Isny [with Benedikt Burgauer] is receiving a preacher who has already caused unrest in many churches.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger is pleased with the positive reception of [Johannes] Haller in Augsburg and the excellent testimonials issued to him by the council and private individuals. Haller will return to [Augsburg] in a month, or when [the cold winter] permits.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Luther has allegedly written another defamatory pamphlet against the [Zurichers]. If Blarer hears anything reliable, he should report it. The angry Luther has also published a writing [“Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum”], with which he destroys more than he builds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Konrad] Curio [Hofherr] and [Jakob] Metzler are recommended to Bullinger. He places great hopes in Hofherr, who sometimes preaches. Metzler is somewhat complacent. Recently, the schoolmaster [Johann Jakob Ammann] asked him to give a lecture in German on a theological topic before the scholars, which he refused to their displeasure. Out of consideration for Metzler's esteemed hometown [Constance], leniency has been exercised so far, although such behavior is not tolerated at the Zurich school. Therefore, Metzler should be strictly admonished in writing; Ammann should also be written to in this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- In the last two months, Bullinger has written the work “De sacramentis,” from which he sends a table of contents that Blarer should return with the next messenger. Blarer will probably also see the actual work later when it is copied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to [Thomas Blarer], [Sebastian Gaisberg], and [Konrad] Zwick.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I received in good faith through the butchers what you sent, honorable and most beloved brother Ambrosius. I have said nothing to anyone about Metellus, so there was no need for retraction or clarification. Certainly, the one who has a name from the Bavarians said what he wanted, not what he should have. It was most pleasing what you wrote about your brother. Continue to share other things that he will send, which indeed are important for me to know. I am not curious about other matters. I await the advice of Luther, Melanchthon, and Pomeranus, if you think it useful for me to read.</p>

      <p>The colloquium will end as it began. Passion has started, passion will end; excessive affectation will arise. May the Lord turn it for the good!</p>

      <p>We hear that the Emperor is preparing projectiles (Geschosse) in Belgium and is preparing for the game of Mars. Meanwhile, he is expected to offer sacrifices to Minerva in Regensburg. I know the Emperor to be worse, more atrocious, and more cruel than Diocletian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It also pains me that a man has been appointed to the church in Isny who has served many churches and left none in peace. May the Lord protect His own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But I also give thanks to the Lord Jesus, by whose spirit it has come to pass that Haller has been received by the renowned church of Augsburg with such great consensus and concord. You can hardly believe how many testimonials he brought, both public from the most distinguished senate and private, especially from the learned. He will return there after a month or when the tranquility of the sky permits. Pray to the Lord that what has begun happily may be completed most happily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Luther is said to have written another book against us, in which he surpasses himself in reviling; you might say it is full of wagons of insults. When it has been brought to you, I pray that you send it promptly. He also wrote against the most putrid propositions of the Louvain theologians; certainly, he destroys more than he builds.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You commend Curio and Metzler to me. They are indeed most commendable. And Curio obeys and conducts himself in such a way that I have conceived great hope for him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8">
      <p>He preaches occasionally. Metzler is a good young man and quite studious; however, he attributes more to himself and pleases himself more than is beneficial for a student. Recently, the schoolmaster ordered him to declaim in German and to present a specimen of theological study before the learned; however, he refused and boldly enough said he would not do it. This displeased both the schoolmaster and the college prefects. They have so far overlooked the rebellion; but indeed, more has been given in this matter to his homeland, most dear to us, than to him. For we have not tolerated disobedience in our school until now. I write this to you freely. For I think it is my duty to point out the errors of the younger to their elders. I wish it would be written to the man, otherwise dear to us, not to attribute too much to himself and to please himself. For he has not yet reached where he thinks. And that he should obey the schoolmaster in holy and useful matters, but a serious written admonition will be needed. It would also be beneficial if the same matter were written to the schoolmaster Johann Jakob Ammann. But here you will do what seems best to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>In the past two months, I have written a book on the sacraments, the main chapters of which I send to you on paper, asking that you return them with the next messenger. You will probably also see the book itself when it has been copied. Farewell with all yours. May your brother, the consul, and Zwick, most esteemed men and friends, be safe.</p>
