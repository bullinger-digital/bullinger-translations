      <p>Our friendly willing service with the offering of all honors, love, and goods beforehand, highly learned and venerable, especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
      <p>Since we have been informed by our faithful, dear servants in the word of God, the venerable gentlemen Tobias Egli and Ulrich Campell, that due to the lamentable uprising that has occurred against the Christian believers and evangelical persons in France, they are forced to wander in great poverty and misery, whereby some Christian authorities are moved to offer them some assistance, therefore, in demonstration that such cruel persecution is also truly and heartily distressing to us, we did not want to hide the works of Christian and brotherly love and have allowed the collection to be gathered by our community and our council, which we hereby send to you, in the sum of fl. 122, through our citizen Martin Kobler.</p>
      <p>And although we cannot assume otherwise, then that this is insignificant and small, nevertheless, as far as your reverence is concerned, our very friendly request and concern is to excuse us in all places and ends, that one may consider the difficult and expensive times, which have been endured for many years now, and hereby take the will, which is otherwise inclined and always willing, for the remaining works. With which we can show your reverence love and service, we are always ready. Entrusting you and us all to Almighty God.</p>
      <p>Dated Chur, the 29th [28th?] day of December in the year 1572. Your reverence's willing, good friends, the mayor and council of the city of Chur.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and venerable gentleman Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of God in Zurich, our especially gracious, dear sir, to hand.</p>
