    <p xml:id="regest1">An English delegation is at the Bundestag in Schmalkalden and possibly conducting admission talks - like Württemberg, Augsburg, and Pomerania; the meeting was extended due to the delay of Johann [Frederick, Elector of Saxony]. [Gerwig] Blarer, the abbot of the Weingarten Monastery, is said to have been abducted by Hans Thomas [von Rosenberg]. Preparations are being made around Milan. Kaspar [Nasal] and [Ulrich] Stoll have advised his wife to wait a little longer before transporting to Zurich. [Ulrich] Eisenhut, who is staying at Vogler's house in Altstätten, wanted to bring the foot iron to Einsiedeln. The Appenzellers will hold a Landsgemeinde on December 14; Landammann Broger and Weibel [Bernhard Tanner] will likely remain in office. The enclosed letter for [Theodor] Bibliander is coming through [Eberhard] Zangmeister from Augsburg. Hopes to be in Zurich at Christmas; wonders about Bullinger's silence. Would like to hear news about Geneva. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My service, as much as I can offer, to you beforehand, etc.</p>
      <p>My lord and brother, first I think you are already aware of the frequent discussions about the day in Schmalkalden, etc. However, a council friend from Constance told me that the King of England certainly has his delegation there, possibly also seeking admission. The day is said to be for further execution (extension) of the agreement, also for the benefit of those who were not previously involved but now wish to be, like Württemberg, Augsburg, Pomerania, and other cities. It is also certain that the day was extended solely for the sake of Duke Hans, so that he could come from Vienna himself in person, etc. May God deliver others and grant that it is used in His fear, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is certain that the abbot of Weingarten, beyond Ravensburg, etc., has been abducted by Hans Thomas and captured; where to, is unknown, but it is said that he is always the rightful handler against some. He is said to have recently ridden to Vienna with 20 horses, much dealt through him. Some think he has a hiding place in Württemberg; perhaps he will also visit Hesse. It is indeed the abbot whom the Landgrave struck on the shoulders during the war, saying: "Little Abbot, what would it have been if we had come to you?" This abbot is a Blarer from Constance, as I hear, related to the abbot of Einsiedeln.</p>
      <p>In Milan, preparations are certainly being made secretly and quickly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Master Kaspar and Master Stoll have advised my wife so much to wait a little longer before going to Zurich, until they inform her. She has declined the journey, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Appenzeller situation is as follows: Eisenhut is in my house in Altstätten, ready to go to you. When he wrote to the council of Appenzell that he wanted to carry the iron to Einsiedeln; when he came here to St. Gallen to me and wanted to stay for a few days, I, with God's help, persuaded him with earnest words, that he should know how God keeps the mountain churches, and whether he wanted to hang the iron there for the eternal testimony of the land or his own, etc., so much that he wanted to leave the writing unfinished. I asked him to secretly give me the iron to keep. That he did, etc.</p>
      <p>And on this Tuesday, the Appenzellers are again holding a large assembly, earnestly; for many things seem too difficult, especially the excessive playing allowed; they do not want it. Although it is thought that the Landammann Broger and the bailiff, who are now in office, will remain. May God direct it to His honor. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this enclosed letter comes from Memmingen, from Zangmeister, from Augsburg in response. It belongs to Theodor. I promised to give the boy 1 batzen; I have promised.</p>
      <p>If God wills, I will look around at Christmas to see what you are doing. I am surprised that you do not write to me, although the last messenger said you had ordered to come back; you were not at home. If you are my enemy, then tell me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, how things stand in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greet my wife and all my household, also my lord Rösten, Master Kaspar, and others.</p>
      <p>In haste, St. Gallen, on Monday, the 13th day of December in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
