      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, I wrote more extensively through Sprüngli, to whom I assisted in his business as much as I could, so that he could accomplish something. However, I will now add to this what seems most necessary for you and also for the lords of the council to know.</p>
      <p>The man whom you recommended to me, who presents himself as a Bohemian nobleman, is said to be a great traitor. The people of Basel have captured someone who was supposed to wait for Schertli and murder him at the instigation of some priests and Bollwyler from Konstanz. This person has also accused him and indicated that he was sent here to wait for Schertli. He has been here for more than two months, but now he has made a pact with them. The people of Basel have sent a message here and have let my lords know about it among other things.</p>
      <p>I brought him 15 guilders from afar. Now his case has turned out in such a way that I have not taken his side. He claimed that he was captured and robbed at Ensen; my lords had it investigated and found it to be a lie. Therefore, you can keep an eye on him if he happens to come there. Farewell. December 16, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your [faithful] Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
