      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Celio Secondo Curione, his brother and singular friend in Basel.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I am responding to your letters later than I would have liked, my dearest and most esteemed Celio. For due to my affairs, I could not do so sooner. Nor did I think there was a need for a laborious or swift response. I do not doubt that this brief writing of mine will not be unpleasing to you.</p>
      <p>We are pleased that you clearly admit that heaven is a name not only of condition but also of place, and therefore that Christ our Lord ascended not only in degree of dignity but also in spatial distance. I deny that Christ ascended in the same way he descended. I wish our writings to be moderated so that even the simplest may understand the more obscure parts. But you object: what would you say if I had said, following the master: No one ascends into heaven except he who descended from heaven. I, my dear Celio, would have said nothing other than what the blessed Augustine said long ago (in On Christian Doctrine): that the Scriptures propose themselves to be explained, but their expositors should speak in such a way that they do not propose themselves to be explained with similar authority, but that they may be understood without difficulty even by the simplest.</p>
      <p>You rightly refer to faith and the very presence of Christ: you rightly say that faith does not contain divinity in one place and humanity in another, but that Christ, God and man, is contained in one view. Nor do we feel otherwise, but in the meantime, we confess that the properties of the natures remain separately, namely unconfused. For Christ is everywhere according to divinity: according to humanity, he is not everywhere. For the body of Christ is in heaven, it is not on earth. This I have explained more fully in the sixth sermon of this Decade which I send to you. The Lord indeed said: I am with you until the end of the age. To which you add: Behold, he says, not only in my spirit but as much as I am in my own, as our people say, person.</p>
      <p>As for what your people call the person, I leave it to those skilled in that language to examine more deeply. Meanwhile, it seems to me that such speech is quite dangerous. For if anyone wishes to speak clearly, he will say that Christ is present to his church in the way he can be present, and in that substance in which his presence is salutary. Although he did not say: I am with you in my spirit until the end of the age, the mystery of faith commands the place to be interpreted in this way. For it is certain that Christ is not present with us in the flesh. And when the body is opposed to the spirit and you say that Christ is present to the church not only in spirit, see that they do not compel you to a confession you do not wish to make, namely that Christ is present to the church in a manner other than spiritual, namely corporeal.</p>
      <p>However, when you conclude the whole matter and admit that Christ is spiritually united with his church and is spiritually present to the church, you indeed satisfy us. But see in the meantime that others do not say that your words contradict themselves because of the inserted more unusual expressions. From us, certainly, there is no danger to you. Nor did I wish to contend or dispute with you by writing a letter to you, but only to admonish you out of the duty of charity, and today I would prefer some things omitted in your writings rather than inserted. But since what is done, as they say, cannot be undone, it will be of your candor to take this my duty in good part and to act circumspectly in all things. Farewell.</p>
      <p>My dearest relative, Mr. Gwalther, greets you. May your whole family be well, as my household also wishes you well. August 13, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
