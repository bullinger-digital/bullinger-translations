      <p>Greetings. As I write this to your excellency, most reverend sir, I have not yet received any letters from Zürich, because our merchants have not yet returned; however, we have faithfully received all previous letters and even those common ones that had caused you some concern and anxiety, and we give you, our most venerable sir, the greatest thanks, who, amidst so many studies and the troubles of ill health, never forgets us, but always writes something and holds us in the highest regard. May God, the best and greatest, grant that we may have you, the most illustrious ornament of the Christian churches, safe and sound for a very long time. I do not cease to send you various news, which we have thanks to our Lentulus, since I understand that you take no small delight in this kind of writing and sending.</p>
      <p>Today I dined with our citizens, who, using hand-held cannons, annually host the magistrate and pastors at a public banquet. At this banquet, since the royal envoy was also present, I recited before everyone what had recently happened in Constantinople by those confessors. The envoy affirmed that he had received letters and confirmed it to be true. A rumor, I do not know from what source, spread yesterday that the people of La Rochelle, having broken the peace, erupted again and inflicted great damage on the royalists, especially because they did not trust the king and solely aimed to reinforce the city with new supplies after lifting the siege; our king is also said to be seeking soldiers.</p>
      <p>I wonder what the true reason for this peace is and what news Mr. Froschauer has brought with him from Frankfurt. I could not write more. Farewell, most esteemed man. Our consuls, Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Charles, Victor, Bonettus, and the others send you their most respectful greetings.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from our Chur, 1573, on the day of St. Michael, that is, September 29.</p>
      <p>Your excellency's most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zürich, his most singularly esteemed sir.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zürich at the Great Minster.</p>
