      <p>I recently received the money for the books purchased for you, most distinguished man, from the very good and learned Fabricius, and I will send the rest as soon as I receive them from Strasbourg; for I have not yet received them due to the inconveniences of the Frankfurt fair. As for the fragment of St. Jerome recently added to your books, on which I had also inscribed your name, you should know that it belongs to the one from whom I received your Decades, a most generous gift. Since he could not conveniently carry it due to the bad weather at that time, he asked me to add it to the books being sent to you; for he said he would request his bundle from you at home, as he is undoubtedly better known to you than to me. We have no certain news of new events.</p>
      <p>They say that Donauwörth is surrounded by a new siege by the French, as it is more likely to be captured by famine than by the sword, due to the grain being intercepted so many times. The Margrave of Brandenburg is said to be waiting for the Emperor's forces not far from Trier, having thrown up great earthworks in a strategically and naturally fortified place, to engage in open battle. The Emperor is therefore said to be hurrying to Strasbourg so that the bridge over the Rhine is not intercepted by the French, who were rumored to be approaching with great forces. He is now lingering in Landau, and few know where he intends to lead his army. The rest will be revealed in time. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, 5th of October, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>I wrote eight days ago, namely through a certain compositor who stayed with Froschauer, about what news we have from Austria; whether you have received it, I am eager to know in your next letter.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
