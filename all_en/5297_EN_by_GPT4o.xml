      <p>Two years ago, in the name of the purer religion, I was forced to go into exile from the territory of Cologne, my homeland, with my wife and children, most honorable lord and teacher in Christ. I saw the booklet of Thomas Imbrock, who was beheaded in Cologne, defending the fanatical opinion of the Anabaptists, being eagerly read by many and praised to the skies, while the pious writings of others were contemptuously ignored. My mind foresaw that many, who lack the discernment of spirits, would be ensnared by it; this omen, as unfortunate as it was true, filled me with incredible sorrow.</p>
      <p>But it was far more bitter for me that, wanting to remain silent while the ignorant masses embraced the most terrible errors of the Anabaptists, I could not speak appropriately; for I am not unaware of how limited my knowledge of languages is. Therefore, since I could not remedy this evil, which was spreading like a gangrene day by day, I finally went to Frankfurt with a sorrowful heart and joined the German-Belgian church there, where Peter Dathenus, known to you at least by name, was serving in the ministry. I enjoyed the pious and daily fellowship of brothers exiled with me in the name of the Gospel for a year and a half. Furthermore, when Dathenus and the other elders of the church recognized my inclination and zeal for the propagation of the Gospel, they earnestly urged me not only to exercise myself in the usual and ordinary prophecies of the church but also to take on the duty of teaching in the church, given the great scarcity of faithful ministers. Overcome by their persistent and importunate requests, I allowed myself to be thrust into the Lord's harvest and appointed to the church of Wolfsheim, under the prefecture of Alsace in the Palatinate. I pray to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that my ministry may serve the sanctification of His venerable name and the restoration of the church. Finally, with matters moderately established in my small church, I began again in earnest to consider how the simple multitude ensnared by the Anabaptists could be helped. But by the singular providence of the most good and great God, I came across a booklet by a certain Bernard, a minister from East Frisia, in which the tricks of the Anabaptists are solidly, briefly, and, unless my opinion deceives me, clearly refuted. I attempted to translate it into German, for the lower German language is partly unpleasant and partly unknown to us, according to my limited ability. I do not care what critics might say about this attempt of mine; I hope that pious and moderate men will interpret it favorably. However, how useful this work will be for the church, and what I have ultimately accomplished, I most willingly submit to your judgment, most honorable lord, to whom, next to God, I attribute whatever true knowledge of Christ I possess. I beseech and implore you in Christ, the Savior of us all, to ensure that my revised and corrected translation, about which I spoke with Lord Froschauer at the recent fair, if it does not seem unworthy, is published together with the attached letter. For I know that in this way, my homeland will be rendered most indebted to you in many respects. If, however, you judge this booklet unworthy of the light, I ask you to either write another or, with an added appendix, supply what is lacking in this one, for the outstanding gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out upon you. For this is demanded by the extreme necessity of the territory of Cologne, JÃ¼lich, and the neighboring regions, where, with the true pastors ordered into exile, the sectarians are ravaging and devouring everything. I beseech you again and again, that you may not be reluctant to inform me briefly of your opinion on this whole matter when the opportunity arises. May God, the Father of all mercy, protect you, enrich you with His gifts, and preserve you unharmed for His church in these most sorrowful times. Amen.</p>
      <p>Wolfsheim, under the prefecture of Alsace. April 23, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Engelbert Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most honorable lord and teacher. In Zurich.</p>
