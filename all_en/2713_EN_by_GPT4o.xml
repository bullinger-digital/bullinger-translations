      <p>He sends his regards. This is the year, most reverend Bullinger, in which I visited my ancestral home in Valais, and in the meantime, after I returned home, I often wanted to write to you, but due to the lack of messengers, I remained completely silent.</p>
      <p>For I remember once receiving, if you can bear it, that I would frequently inform your eminence about the news from Germany that is being spread. But now I have almost nothing that I consider worth your knowing, unless you have heard about the judgment of the chamber, which moved from Speyer (not a very safe place, which could suffer an attack from the French if anything adverse happens to the eagle)</p>
      <p>to Esslingen, fortified with walls, arms, and surrounded by the very strong duchy of Württemberg. For the most vain rumor is that they were expelled by the plague sparking along the Rhine, which they themselves do not deny, and now I have such neighbors; for we Hedelfingeners use the market of the Esslingers, situated almost at their walls, although we are of Württemberg land.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the ministers of that church, of whom there are only three, are well known to me, and they fear enough for themselves from those magnates and the imperial councilors sworn to papal customs and laws. For no one is summoned or admitted to this senate who refuses to do so, namely to swear by the words of the papal master and his church to be built.</p>
      <p>But our prince still refuses to grant free passage to that town from his own duchy, even though he has received the highest dignitaries of the emperor as guests.</p>
      <p>However, I think this is done not out of hatred for them, but rather as a punishment for the town's merits, and so that the prince may keep his own for himself and his people.</p>
      <p>Our Adam, once dean of Bartholomew, is now in Munich, a prominent town among the Bavarians; and he conducts his sermons there in such a way that all of Bavaria resounds, which I know for certain, as they sing psalms everywhere publicly in the fields and for the congregation. I also heard this last year in my Valais in the house of the bailiff, as they call it (landtshauptman) Peter Stockalper in Brig, sung by the highest voices of the highest men, and I myself joined in.</p>
      <p>And I inspected many evangelical booklets taken from their bosoms myself among them. However, some complained that few were made better who had given their name to the gospel.</p>
      <p>For Luther at the beginning seemed to condemn all efforts of piety for sins and therefore also to prohibit them, just as Zwingli seemed to exclude all ceremonies and aids of piety from the people, although he always seemed more favorable to good works. But I see them greatly disturbed by the many sects dissenting under that evangelical confession and the many bitter books flying around, so that one stands still in confusion, another doubts, and another breathes and measures, although they have a great zeal for amending or even changing religion. Certainly, it is evident that our Swiss have shed much of their ancestral and related humanity; for I learned by experience on that journey towards Valais that they barely show the way to a traveler when asked, and when greeted, they give some sign of a more envious and bitter spirit, yet quite marked about themselves. But as the hedges in shortcuts are so difficult to climb and overcome, that you would swear they were made so high without ladders or a small ladder on purpose, so that they want to afflict and detain the traveler with this laborious effort. Which indeed no one in these lands would tolerate.</p>
      <p>But my inseparable travel companion, a citizen of Hedelfingen, a farmer and vintner, also took it indignantly that the measure of wine is offered to guests in Switzerland in a wooden and covered jug, and thus uncertain how much the more profit-seeking host might bring. For it is the same as if something were sold in a sack (as it is commonly said). Therefore, he said the measure should be offered in an open vessel to assure the buyer. For he imagines that poet's line: "He returned the small weights of his wine jug."</p>
      <p>Behold, most illustrious Bullinger, since I had nothing else, I wanted to write to you even this, that our Swiss, once most humane towards travelers and celebrated for this reason among all nations, but now somewhat degenerate, to fill the paper, so that you may assist this evil with whatever remedy you can.</p>
      <p>But I also ask you very much to send some copies of the Postils of Erasmus Sarcerius of the later edition, also the Psalms of Zurich printed by Froschauer in small type, and also the printed German Testaments to Valais for sale through the servant of some printer; for there are some priests there who have requested these from me to be sent to them.</p>
      <p>Then a certain servant in the Froschauer workshop in Zurich, while I was returning through you, told me that he had gone to Valais from Zurich last year with many books without harm and even sold them publicly in the sight of the bishop of Sion. Then I would like to add a considerable number, though not a small one, of those new apostille tables of Spangenberg to the aforementioned. For thus you will make a fruitful harvest among them. But I think nothing should be sent to them about the Eucharistic matter; for they are not yet able to bear hearing this.</p>
      <p>About the Hexapla Bible or at least the three translations in the Old Testament, namely the Zurich, Vatable, Castalion, and the Vulgate, descending in four columns on each page from top to bottom and opposite each other, I have long asked you, for the honor of God, the benefit of all students of theology, for the elimination of all errors and doubts of the Bible, for the clear exposition of the sacred word of God, and finally for the glory of the Swiss name, to build; for in the New Testament I thought only the Vulgate should be compared with the translation of Erasmus. Such a Bible would be more valuable than having countless writers on the Bible, as the previous age had.</p>
      <p>For me, certainly, the comparison of a single translation does a thousand times more than if I were to look at I don't know how many explained myriads of the Bible. And I testify by the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ that I granted the Bible of Castalion and the Zurich to Dr. Brentius from my library two years ago to be used, and I cannot obtain or take them back from him, even with violent charity resisting; they are of such use to him. Hence, dearest Bullinger, consider how much good that procurement of the Bible through you will bring to the Christian republic. Hence the pontifical canon orders in doubts of the Old Testament to resort to the Hebrew language, and of the New to the Greek. See also Di. 48 c locutio. But the most renowned theologian Johannes Brysgoicus, professor in the University of Freiburg, also did this in his usual manner, to compare many translations and to oppose them for the native sense of the biblical text and for elucidating the text (I testify to God that I speak the truth and from experience). For it cannot be said, as he used to say, how much light and native clarity they bring to the text. But it is difficult to compare various translations from many books, which can be easily, clearly, and manifestly compared under one view of a single page.</p>
      <p>Thus, regarding the vocabulary, of which I only wanted to indicate a specimen to you, you also respond that those who have some judgment do not at all consider this work well applied. Why then did Bartholomeus Riccius, the author of that vocabulary (called Apparatus), judge and wish that something like what I wanted should be published? But see that I do not advance anything with you. However, if you think you have not yet sufficiently understood my plan, I will say it sometime, when reminded, clearly; for I know that this work will be very beneficial to the literary youth, etc. I give you this sextuple Psalter as a perpetual gift, so that you may see from this that what I advised about the sextuple or quadruple translation of the Bible is not said without consideration.</p>
      <p>Dr. Brentius, under these fairs or the Frankfurt market, has now finally ordered the Postil, long labored over, to be printed; but also the Apology published tramples on those things that Peter de Soto (the grunting monastic pig), professor of theology in the academy (namely) of Dillingen (an ignoble little town where the bishop of Augsburg, a cardinal, has his seat) had undertaken to tear apart and gnaw at in a public writing concerning the religion of this duchy. And they say he did this not only by the advice of this cardinal but also by the command of King Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>But the whole of Ulm has returned to the Augsburg Confession, having expelled the satellites of the papal mass and all the Interimistic priests. But also the barons of Helfenstein, who have their seat in the primary town of Wiesensteig (five miles distant from Esslingen), have very recently from being the highest and most zealous papists become entirely evangelical, having cast off all papal religion. May God himself protect his church and keep us all. Live and farewell, the glory of the learned and of our Switzerland, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Given on the 2nd of September in the year etc. 55.</p>
      <p>Peter Venetscher of Valais, preacher of Hedelfingen.</p>
      <p>To the most accomplished theologian in every respect, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, teaching Christ in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
