    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Curione does not know exactly what has been communicated to Bullinger about him. In any case, his detractors have spread many falsehoods about him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The matter is as follows: Curione was convicted because he wanted to amuse himself with a girl who consented (but it did not happen). After his conviction, he moved to Basel with the permission of his authorities to take care of himself there. He cannot complain about the councilors [of Lausanne], who treated him kindly; but he can complain about his detractors (who also do not like Bullinger). They could have easily saved him from this scandalous situation, but they preferred to ruin him. But enough of that! Curione has completely entrusted himself to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding the desired letter of recommendation, Bullinger should not worry. Curione had requested it mainly to express his high regard for Bullinger, but he does not necessarily need it. It is enough if Bullinger continues to pray for him and remains well-disposed towards him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The enclosed booklet ["Pro vera et antiqua ecclesiae Christi autoritate oratio"] was published by Curione in Basel. Bullinger should write his opinion about it. Perhaps he will not like it very much, especially since Curione wrote it in a sad state of mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler], and to the children.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The letter carrier from Italy [...] is of Jewish origin and Christian faith. He speaks Hebrew, Italian, and French, but hardly any Latin. For a while, he lived with Curione. Now he is on his way to Italy, where he might stay. On his journey through Zurich, he wants to visit [Michael Adam], who, like him, converted from Judaism to Christianity, and also Theodor Bibliander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings through Jesus Christ. What a certain brother has reported to you, dearest Bullinger, I do not know. This I know, that my detractors have spread many unworthy things about me, completely alien to the truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The matter was as follows: A judgment was made against me because I wanted to play humanely with a certain girl, with her consent (but I did not complete it). After the judgment (as is customary in such matters), with the kind permission of my authorities, I moved here to Basel, so that with God's good help, I might attend to my affairs. Therefore, I do not complain about the magistrates, by whom I was treated kindly and to whom I will always confess I owe much, but about certain of my detractors (who are also not your friends), who, although they could have prevented this scandal as easily as turning a hand, preferred to ruin me rather than save me. But I do not wish to complain further about this matter. For I have now entrusted everything to God: my reputation, my fortunes, my life, who has insight into all minds and consciences.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for the letter of recommendation, which I was asking from you, there is no need for you to be anxious, for I was doing it more out of a certain respect towards you than out of any great necessity. For the Lord, who has undertaken to protect me, will never, I know, forsake me; in whom I have placed all my hope. Therefore, nothing else remains but that you pray for me to the same Lord, that He may protect and increase this hope in me, and that you continue to love me, as you have always done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am sending to you a certain booklet of ours, which we have published here for the first time (if it does not satisfy your most refined judgment, you will attribute it to my very deep sorrow, by which I was disturbed in a remarkable way), and you will write back what you think of it at some point.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus and greet your wife and children in my name. Basel, January 18, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>This brother, who brings this letter to you, is by nature a Jew, by profession and true faith a Christian. He can speak only Hebrew, Italian, and French; he can hardly speak Latin. He was with me for several months. Now he is setting out for Italy. He will gladly greet your fellow countryman there, whom you have, and Mr. Bibliander, whom I commend to you. He is returning to Italy, God willing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Again, I greet you, my dearest Bullinger. Greet those excellent brothers in my name. Yours sincerely, Coelius S. C. signed.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, most holy, most learned, and most vigilant, to be respected. Zurich.</p>
