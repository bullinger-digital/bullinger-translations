      <p>Greetings. If you are well, it is good; I am well. Most excellent and learned man, you wrote to me a few days ago; as I read that letter, the indication of your benevolence towards me required that I respond. However, since we have established a rule between us that, if we do not converse more frequently through letters, it should not be taken by either of us in a negative way, but rather attributed to our occupations, since this rule has been established by you, we both shall be judged by it. Nevertheless, (as for me) there was nothing of importance that I deemed worthy to write to you about. But what I am writing now, I do so for the reason that you may understand that I love you very much and to commend to your kindness this man, Lord Vitus N., a man in my opinion good and learned, exiled for the sake of Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>You will understand the whole matter from him, whom you will receive as is customary among the brothers of the Lord. There is nothing else about which I should write to you further. If you have anything worth knowing, write to me, if you wish and have the leisure.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend my prince, who has been absent for almost three months now, and me, who is most devoted to you, in your prayers to the Lord Christ. Give my regards to Lord Gualther on my behalf. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written on the 15th of July in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Michael Maler, doctor, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful doctor of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
