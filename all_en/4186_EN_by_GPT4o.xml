      <p>S. I hastened your instructions, most illustrious man, to Friedrich von Salis, but your son Christoph compensated for the delay in response with his presence. He came to us sick and weak on the second of January, which was not surprising, as he had set out on his journey with his health not yet fully restored. This journey through the Alps is arduous and difficult in itself and sometimes breaks those who are otherwise in good health. He is now beginning to feel better; but it is necessary that he takes care of his health above all.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when he wanted to set out on his journey again, I did not allow it.</p>
      <p>The reasons for my decision are these: he brought with him a horse (or rather a small horse), on which he rode, which began to limp due to some ulceration of the foot; we gave it to a blacksmith to be treated. He was thinking of selling the horse and completing the rest of the journey by boat; but I earnestly dissuaded him from doing so, because of the severe frost, which I have not felt since I have been here; I feared he might harm himself. Therefore, I want him to recover, I want him to complete the rest of the journey on horseback, for he cannot walk at all.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I advise you to be at ease; we will ensure that everything is in order with him. There is no need to worry about expenses, which, if they had to be made, would still be secondary to health. But when the horse begins to feel better, Mr. Pontisella will take it into his stable. Therefore, may it be fortunate and auspicious, after 8 days, which will be the 16th of January, he will set out on his journey (for he must wait for the company of merchants), with whom he will cross the lake. Your son himself writes; he owes some unknown sum to Friedrich von Salis; but if you hear his accounts in person, I have no doubt that he will satisfy you.</p>
      <p>He needed a servant in the Alps, otherwise he would have perished in the snow; but he also experienced paroxysms on the way, which sometimes confined him to bed. I would commend him to you, if it were proper for a son to be commended to a parent by an outsider; I know what paternal affection can do, but nevertheless, I have no doubt that he will prove himself to you and win your fatherly affection with his piety. What I wrote about the pontiff is true.</p>
      <p>The French are murmuring.</p>
      <p>It is said among the people that the castellan of Müß, the deceased brother of the current pope, served in Bergell, being a stable boy; how he rose through murder and robbery would take long to tell. Therefore, it would be a shame if this money were invested otherwise.</p>
      <p>This current pope was also very poor. They have given a sister to the young lord Wolf Dietrich, residing in Niederems (in our territories); she left behind three sons; to them has come the begging bread.</p>
      <p>They are said to have given the messenger fifteen hundred crowns for the begging bread; they rode with great pomp, passing through here with 25 horses on the 3rd of January. It is believed that the new pope secretly sent them the money so that they could give the honorable begging bread; for they are said not to be particularly rich noble people, or it is otherwise a contrived matter, so that everything proceeds more splendidly. The messenger himself said here, they have given so much.</p>
      <p>These things in passing.</p>
      <p>I foresee great practices, but I prefer this one to the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>May God scatter the plans of the impious.</p>
      <p>I hoped the Glarus matter was settled; the 5 Cantons perhaps await a more opportune time; the people of Uri are perhaps quiet because they fear being told about red trousers. Delete these last words; for it is capital to say these things among them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all your family, most happily. We wish you and all yours to be safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Chur, 8th of January, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant head of the church of Zurich, his much esteemed lord and patron.</p>
