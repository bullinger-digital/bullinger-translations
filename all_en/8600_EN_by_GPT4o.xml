      <p>S. I give you immortal thanks, my revered father, for sharing with me the letters of our Tobias, which greatly cheered me; I hope for better things from the Rhaetians than before.</p>
      <p>For those who did not spare Mario, their fellow citizen, will bear even less with Blandrata and his kind, unless some golden shower of Danae changes their purpose. Do not be anxious about church matters; we do indeed desire your presence, but in the meantime, all of yours diligently perform their duty. Ludwig dined at the Sword yesterday, as I hear, from which I infer that he is better. I have not yet written to our Keriz about Bernang, because no messenger presents himself and I would not want letters on this matter to be intercepted by the Harpies, who defile everything by touch and sight. I write this now as I am going to bed and I am glad that a message has been given to me, as before dinner I received the letters of Mr. Treasurer, which I send. You will see how wickedly Satan torments himself and changes into all forms. I replied to Mr. Treasurer and advised them to consider this matter prudently; for the argument is of such a nature that, if it prevails here, it can later be applied to all others. Wretched are we, who are forced to commit our cases to such judges, who, as they have everything for sale in politics, so in matters of religion they play with God himself; but this game will eventually cost them dearly. The day before yesterday I received the letters of Mr. Stettan, which I also wanted to include; the news contained in them I sent to Mr. Treasurer. What Stettan writes about the Belgian pirates is confirmed by foreign merchants who came to our fairs; they add that all the Spaniards who were on the ship were thrown into the sea, evidently to wash away Marianism. To me, this punishment seems milder than their so many and great crimes. I have nothing else to write, except that the high price of grain has become somewhat less; today a bushel of wheat sold for seven pounds. The Lucerners led their prefect to Baden with great pomp; I hear there were 160 horsemen. May God, the best and greatest, keep you with your sons, daughters, and the whole family, and I pray that you greet them all. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 29, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his relative and father, to be revered. At Gyrenbad.</p>
