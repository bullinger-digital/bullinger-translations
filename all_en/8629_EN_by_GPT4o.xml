      <p>Greetings. It has been a long time since I last wrote to you (honorable lord), and this is not due to forgetting you; please do not think it was done out of laziness or negligence on my part, but because I feared that I might intrude untimely and annoyingly upon your more serious concerns and occupations.</p>
      <p>However, the reason I am writing this letter to you is that I considered it my duty and a part of my perpetual respect towards you to write something to you. For I am already greatly indebted to you for your many merits towards me; for having read the letters of Mr. Johannes Arnaldi, which you recently sent to him, I fully recognized in them all the integrity and excellence of your mind and the image of your former love towards me. Therefore, it is unnecessary for me to write now how much I value you; indeed, I am so delighted that nothing could happen to me more desirable than to be loved by you, such a man. Regarding the nature of my studies (honorable lord), know this: I have the most faithful teachers, who diligently present to me those things which are most to my liking, and they frequently exercise me in style. Therefore, I will carefully consider what I ought to do in this matter and will always hold onto this: Always strive to excel and to be distinguished among others.</p>
      <p>You have (most esteemed lord) a letter which, though it shows little diligence, yet displays much goodwill and duty, to which, whenever it pleases you, do not disdain to reply.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet your most honorable wife, your dearest children, and your entire household in my name. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Basel.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, J. Vigierius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
