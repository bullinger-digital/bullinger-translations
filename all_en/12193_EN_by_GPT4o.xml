    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer returned [on April 24] from Isny, where Johannes Marbach completely justified himself in the presence of Gervasius [Schuler]: According to general testimony, he had never preached what was reported to Bullinger. However, the deacon [Georg Denneler] allows himself to be incited against Marbach and stirs up hatred against him, so that the latter considers it better to move away, especially since some of the leading men are not well-disposed towards him. - Blarer will soon forward Bullinger's letter to [Hans] Welser [not received] to Augsburg. - According to Bucer, [Charles V] at the Diet [of Worms] does not want to address the religious matter, but rather the Turkish defense and the Imperial Chamber Court. In [the southern Netherlands], the Emperor has women buried alive, men burned, and the reading of the Holy Scriptures forbidden. [There was] a counsel of the electors and the [Free Imperial] cities to first negotiate about religion or to ensure a good religious peace for all parties; however, the greater part of the council of princes rejected this. The bishops rely entirely on Charles V, i.e., on his advocates [Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle or Johann von Naves]. [Duke Heinrich] of Brunswick incites against the [Bishop] of M체nster, [Franz von Waldeck], who is slandered by his clergy. The Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] also has difficulties. News from Poland reports that [Suleiman I] is advancing with huge troops. - [Matth채us Molckenpur and Ludwig K체rnstaller] were appointed [for Konstanz] to the Diet. Greetings from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick, the originally intended delegates. Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, and Theodor [Bibliander]. - Repeated recommendation for Jakob Metzler.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I returned from Isny the day before yesterday, where I received the full and truly just exoneration of Mr. Johannes Marbach, who serves as pastor there, also in the presence of our Gervasius. According to the testimony of all, he never said anything in a sermon like what you recently wrote about. However, he has a deacon who is strongly incited by the intemperance of some others to slander the good man - where he also diligently works to be dragged into the hatred of all, since he himself is neither learned nor wise -, so that the doctor considers it better to move away from there than to inflame the hatred of his adversaries against him more and more with his presence, especially since some of the leading men are very unjust to him and there is no hope of a better disposition.</p>
      <p>I received your letters addressed to Welser; I will send them to Augsburg tomorrow or the day after.</p>
      <p>At the Diet, you know the Emperor proposed that now is not the time to deal with religion, that is, our conversion to the Lord. The Turks are pressing, and they must be met even without the Lord. The selection of the judge and assessors of the Imperial Chamber Court should be left to him. For regarding religion, he presents himself as neutral, namely by now more cruelly than ever burning confessors of Christ, burying women alive throughout the Netherlands, and barring his people from the sacred reading everywhere. The counsel of the electors and cities on religion first or on ensuring peace for religion itself - not just for us, and with them - is good, but the greater part of the council of princes contends; the pseudo-bishops defer everything to the Emperor, namely to his faithful advocate. The Duke of Brunswick again stirs up tumult against the Bishop of M체nster, whom the pseudo-clergy of that place betrays out of hatred for the gospel, which he makes to be preached. Great plots are being laid against the Archbishop of Cologne. Meanwhile, it is written from Poland that the tyrant of Constantinople is advancing with huge forces.</p>
      <p>I can add nothing more to this, except that our envoys set out for the Diet on April 21 by decree of the senate. Pray to the Lord that all may turn out well, and commend us to Him with pious prayers perpetually. My brother and Zwicker greet you. Greet your household with the servants in the Lord, especially Mr. Gwalther, Pellikan, and Theodor, etc. I think it was by the wonderful counsel of God that, although first my cousin, then my brother Thomas was destined for this legation, neither of them went. Would that, what I meditate, the Lord may sometime bring to pass for us, and that happily and in such a way that His name may be sanctified thereby! Amen.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Jakob Metzler, our young man, that you may continue steadfastly as you have begun. April 26, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his very venerable and dearest brother H. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
