      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received your recent letter to us and thank you for the news you have written. As you humbly request us to support the preachers with our lord cousin Duke Christoph of Württemberg, we are well inclined to do so, but we think that His Grace is so well provided with stipendiaries and others who daily attend the preaching that he might not have a place at this time, as he hopes. We send you herewith what was partly negotiated at the recent meeting in Passau, as you can see attached. We did not want to withhold this from you and are kindly inclined towards you. Dated Schaffhausen, the 5th of July, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount of] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
