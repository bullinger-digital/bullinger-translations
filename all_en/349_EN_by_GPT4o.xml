      <p>Greetings. What if you tried to persuade your people that, after the delegates have agreed among themselves, they should give their response to the Five Cantons not in writing, but orally. Letters are interpreted at will, as you know; spoken words, if interpreted differently than they were said, would have witnesses present who could explain the truth. Furthermore, our matters could become known even to the common people, who otherwise understand nothing of these things, and, who knows, they might also be advised to think very differently about us and about the Emperor's intentions than they do today, being instructed by their leaders. I spoke, indeed, about a speech that an old man from Augsburg delivered here at the fair in this manner: "When asked why the Emperor had left the Swabian cities almost defenseless, which he nevertheless knew were clearly looking to regain their freedom, he replied: there is nothing to fear; for they do not trust each other. He said almost the same about us, that victory would be easy because we are divided, and he himself would encourage this division as much as he could, until he could achieve his goal." These things must be known. He has amassed nine tons of gold from one Antwerp, which is certain; of twenty gold coins, they were forced to give seven.</p>
      <p>I believe that money is being collected against us, whatever we may persuade ourselves about him. A consultation has been initiated between the people of Strasbourg and the bishop about accepting the Interim without offending the people. I do not know, however, whether the action has begun or not. Farewell and handle our matter seriously.</p>
      <p>Hastily, November 22, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
