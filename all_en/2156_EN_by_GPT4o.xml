      <p>Greetings. There is nothing new here except that Rizzius is leaving more irritated because he did not accomplish what he wanted. I hear that the marquis has retreated to some lands to recover his strength. I am pleased to hear about the triumphs of the Emperor's men, as you all understand what they have in mind; and it is not the wisdom of the Emperor, but a remarkable chance that has given them this hope, which I see diminishing day by day. Even a small slip can break the spirits of the divine. Regarding your excuse, I add nothing, only that I have neither been angry nor will ever be disturbed if you or anyone else falsely persuades themselves of something about me or places themselves above me and thinks their own things are the only beautiful ones. It is a human flaw that can hardly be corrected even with great wisdom.</p>
      <p>As the Lord said, each day has enough trouble of its own, it is enough for me to carry my burden and not be overly concerned about what happens externally. You will see, if I can be of any help, how much I wish to benefit and serve you for the merit of your learning and piety, which presents itself as least disguised or hypocritical.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Chur, January 12.</p>
      <p>I do not want you to be unaware that Rizzius offered on the 10th of this month a very bitter response to what had been said to him in the name of the Lords of the Rhaetians, and that it was written by the hand of your Gallitius.</p>
      <p>Would you say this is the work of Vertumnus or Mercury?</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
