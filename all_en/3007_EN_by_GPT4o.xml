      <p>Greetings. In April, around May, I wrote a rather long letter to you, Heinrich, my son. But on July 1st, I received your letter around mid-August through the St. Gallen merchants, from which I could not understand whether you received mine. You indeed say that on May 10th you sent me a letter through the messenger from Neroberg; however, I neither saw the letter nor the messenger. Meanwhile, I paid Bartholomew Steck from St. Gallen 3 batzen for your previous letters, 3 for mine, and now again three for your latest. You see how expenses grow in a trivial matter. Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary for you to write, I wish you to refrain; in necessary matters, I want you to have the freedom to write.</p>
      <p>Since I doubt whether you received my previous letters, I will repeat from them what I still remember and what concerns me. The main point is: I cannot bear the expenses you incur. I gave Froschauer 20 gold coins or 40 pounds to be given to you; I also gave him 10 pounds received from you for travel expenses. Burcher's wife gave you 4 pounds. Again, at the spring fair, I paid Froschauer 38 pounds and 3 shillings, and for books, also 4 pounds. If you add these up, they make 94 pounds, four pounds less than 100 pounds. I have spent this amount for you in the middle of this year; now, if I have to spend the same amount at this fair, the expenses will reach 90 or 100 gold coins. You know that for my three daughters, I have to spend 60 pounds annually. Where is Christoph? How much do you think should be spent on him?</p>
      <p>And something must be given to Johann Rudolf. Furthermore, I incur great expenses in domestic matters. Now, if I calculate my stipend and income, they do not amount to 700 pounds annually. Calculate on your fingers now (if you continue like this), whether you will soon reduce me to poverty or force me, in my old age, to burden myself with debt and neglect my other children for your sake.</p>
      <p>However, I will not neglect. I said I would give you 45 gold coins a year, and if I see you are frugal and compelled by necessity, I will add 5, so you will have 50. I will, can, and may not give more. Therefore, manage accordingly. Oh, how many good, honest fellows must manage with less; they are also people and become honorable, distinguished people. Remember this and see to it that you contract yourself. I see you have forgotten our instruction, which I had given you, nor did you promise me this when you were in Strasbourg and asked me to send you to Wittenberg, but you reported that you had learned from trustworthy Englishmen that you could live in Wittenberg at less expense than in Strasbourg. The English could indeed live like this and honorably; why can't you? Our stipend recipients receive 40 gold coins from the most generous magistrate. They add almost 5 or 10 of their own at most, so that they come to 50 gold coins annually. And they live honorably. But enough about this. You know my means and my heavy household and indeed my poverty if my affairs are compared with others. Therefore, be frugal.</p>
      <p>In your last letter dated July 1st, you ask me to allow you to accept the honorable master's degree offered to you and not to fear the expenses. I will say what I think: I would not fear the expenses much if it could be completed or resolved for a price of about 10 gold coins. There is something else I fear more, that in the promotion you might be forced to abjure the true faith and doctrine of the sacraments or at least promise not to teach the Zwinglian doctrine. If they asked you not to follow heretical doctrine, I would not be difficult; for we must freely abjure all heresies. However, if you promised not to teach except according to the doctrines of the Wittenberg church, how could you return to your homeland and teach in these churches or live in your homeland with usefulness and honor? Especially if you encounter an enemy who accuses you of being unworthy to teach in this church, since you abjured it in Wittenberg. See what kind of degree you would have built for yourself. Otherwise, if your freedom is not taken away, if you are not bound by an unjust vow, I would not be so difficult; but still, I do not see why this degree is so much to be desired by you. I wish you could otherwise achieve something in the arts, languages, and good literature! In the meantime, I do not consider degrees in the arts to be despised, in theology I do not care, indeed I do not approve, etc. Perhaps in the promotion to the titles of the arts, they act more moderately, they bind young people, since it is not a theological profession, so there might be less danger here. Therefore, if you, relying greatly on my ease and kindness, obtained the degree without such a dangerous obligation, perhaps I would not take it badly.</p>
      <p>I would assign the time and hour of your birth now, if I did not seem to suspect for what purpose you ask. You wanted your birth to be composed and your fate to be written, of course. Do you not know that God forbids such observations? Those who indulge in this follow superstition and sin gravely against the Lord.</p>
      <p>Let them compose... the birth of Esau and Jacob or other twins, whose outcomes are very different. Spend your time on other, more useful, better things, and do not defile your sincere religion and faith.</p>
      <p>We are all well by God's grace. My brother, your uncle, has somewhat recovered. Zwingli has been blessed with a male child in July. We hope for a moderate but excellent harvest.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless us.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Italy report that the Pope has expelled the Colonna family and given their towns and lands to his nephew from his brother, whom he also made Duke of Paliano. The expelled have fled to the Emperor and the protection and assertion of the Prince of Florence, who, with an army prepared from Naples and Tuscany, wanted to recover what was lost; but the Pope, equipped with a just army and supported by the help of the French, has driven back the Imperialists. Hence, they predict a war will arise between the Emperor and the Pope.</p>
      <p>Letters are certainly delivered, which you send to Ernest VÃ¶geli in Leipzig, through St. Gallen. So if you think something is necessary, or to respond to these or announce something else, send it to Ernest in Leipzig; he will give it to Gaspar Steck, who will send it to Bartholomew Steck in St. Gallen. If you have taken the master's degree, see that you also receive testimonial letters.</p>
      <p>Of the whole family, no one is weaker and more prone to illnesses than I am; for I am greatly tormented by headaches. Therefore, see that you use well what time remains, so that when I am dead, you do not lack those things which you now find hard to do without, and which you can now obtain more easily; later you will not obtain them.</p>
      <p>If you conduct yourself well and honorably, study so that you can do something, you must see, dear son, that I do much more than I can. But do not overdo it and also consider my and the rest of the family's situation. Fear God. Be humble and tractable, pray diligently, live holy, be diligent in learning. Farewell, dear son. Your mother greets you, Christoph the baker greets you, your five sisters greet you and encourage you to study virtue.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 1, 1556.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Melanchthon, to whom, so as not to be burdensome to others, I do not write. May Collini and your roommates be safe.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Since we perhaps do not have such a convenient messenger anymore, here you have from me and your mother's side a good year for 57 years and a new Bohemian (sending you the two girls) which is minted here for many thousands of guilders. The little bride sends you the Bonovier for the good year. May God give you many good years.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger from Zurich in Switzerland, now in Wittenberg in Saxony, his dear son.</p>
      <p>[Wi]ttenberg..</p>
      <p>September 1556. In the name of the Lord.</p>
