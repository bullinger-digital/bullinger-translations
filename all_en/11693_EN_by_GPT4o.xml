    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has certainly received his letter [No. 1648] through the messenger who also delivered Bullinger's letter. He cannot add anything to the report of Erasmus [Schmid or Ritter]; unfortunately, there was no opportunity to show more kindness to him and his companions, as their stay was very short and also [Johannes] Zwick, who had been called to those afflicted by the plague, did not want to join them due to the risk of infection; God seems to want to chastise [Konstanz] like last year, Bullinger should pray with his people for the people of Konstanz. [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel] has fled with a few others to Landshut in Bavaria; we will see what the future brings. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I believe you have received our letter, my venerable Bullinger, which we sent through the same good man who delivered your letters to us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is nothing to add beyond what our Erasmus could narrate to you. Unfortunately, we were not able to be as kind and attentive to him and the excellent men he joined as companions, as they are in every way most worthy. But almost every opportunity was denied to us, both because they did not allow themselves to be detained longer and because our Zwick could not be present with them; for when he was called to some who were afflicted by the plague, he did not want to meet with them afterward, lest he inadvertently spread any harm (as this disease spreads by contagion). It seems that the Lord intends to chastise us this year as He did the previous one, so you will commend us to Him with your Christian prayers, that we may either live to His glory or exchange this fleeting and transient life for eternal life.</p>
      <p>[Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel] has taken refuge by fleeing and has retreated with a few to the small town of Landsberg in Bavaria. We await what the future will bring.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you. You will greet your entire household with all the brothers and friends. Farewell, most beloved heart.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, August 9, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
