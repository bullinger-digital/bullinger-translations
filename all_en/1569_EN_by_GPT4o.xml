      <p> Greetings. I received your most loving letter, dearest compater in the Lord, at this hour. I give thanks as much as I can for your kindness and prudence towards me, as you take care of my affairs no less than your own. What I sent to you in writing, I would not have written unless you had demanded it from me, because of the incredible malice of these times. However, I did not want to fail your wishes. I saw the danger that would follow if they were published under my name as they were written by me; now, since you judge it prudent to act, so that I, a foreigner, do not stir up a hornet's nest from which I could not easily extricate myself, I beseech you by our mutual faith and friendship to return both writings to me at the first certain opportunity, so that they are not spread imprudently without the knowledge of both you and me, and immediately after reading this letter of mine, erase my name, which is written at the front. In my judgment, this age is so deaf that it can no longer be brought back to the right path by any admonitions, and so insane that it mixes heaven with earth for a trivial reason. Therefore, it is better to remain silent and watch the course of God's judgments in silence and hope for a while, until, with serenity restored, the swans sing and the crows are silent. Great and terrible storms are threatening from all sides; we must pray for the Lord's mercy, that He does not involve His own with the wicked unto destruction. Farewell excellently and return my writings, I beseech you. </p>
      <p> Greet your entire household in my name and in the name of mine. My Margarita is worth many hundreds of pearls and yet not even saleable for a penny, she is most burdensomely pregnant. Also greet Mr. Theodor Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Butler, and the other brothers and friends along with our Traber. May the Lord preserve you in His grace forever. Bern, 16 February 1552. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, compater and dearest brother in the Lord. Zürich. </p>
