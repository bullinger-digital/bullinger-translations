      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, our Jehovah, we pray for you, diligently commending our observance of you.</p>
      <p>When Lord Christophorus Thretius, our dearest brother and fellow minister, was requested by the illustrious and magnificent Palatine of Kraków, the patron of our churches, to travel to your regions and especially to the most illustrious Prince Elector Palatine, and then to you, most distinguished Bullinger, we could not refrain from taking this opportunity to write to you, even if with empty letters, in which, if nothing else, I would at least remind you that in the name of our churches, which by your grace have been admitted into the catalog of those churches that have subscribed to your confession, I have sent letters to you, in which we thanked you for your great benevolence and favor towards us, which you have shown by sending letters and by including us in the number of those professing the pure confession.</p>
      <p>Then, in the same letters, we sent a certain form of concord proposed to us by the disciples of Stancarus, which we in no way wished to accept nor do we wish to, unless we first hear your opinion on this reconciliation, which, as it seems to us, cannot be free from just criticism. We do not doubt, therefore, that you will write something to us on this matter through our Lord Thretius.</p>
      <p>For the very close connection that exists between us demands that we also inform you of the smallest matters that pertain to the church. What you wrote to Thretius about Stancarus himself is as true as it is prudently and with great judgment derived from your piety. He is a man of the lightest spirit and will remain the lightest as long as he lives, as it appears from that little book he recently published. I would be more detailed in describing these sects and blasphemies, were it not that Lord Thretius has all the known and understood opinions of all heretics, with whom we are constantly in conflict. From him, you will learn everything about this Italian gangrene and what concerns our affairs, and we earnestly ask you to trust him in all things and love him as you are accustomed to. We will not allow you to lack our efforts, work, and duties in return. Farewell most happily, most esteemed father, together with all your fellow ministers, our uniquely esteemed brothers, whom we greet reverently and constantly pray to God for you. Do the same in your prayers. Given in Oświęcim, June 20, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and observant Paul Gilowski, superintendent of the Reformed Churches in the Duchy of Oświęcim and Zator, has signed on his own behalf and on behalf of all the brothers.</p>
      <p>[...] to the most distinguished man and... to the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord...</p>
      <p>Paul Gilowski, Superintendent of Zator, Poland, 1568.</p>
