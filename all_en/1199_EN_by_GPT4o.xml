      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letter on February 26, which I also gave to Duke Georg to read. Various things are written here and there, which deceive us in strange ways; we gladly hear good news, and we hardly admit anything against us, even the truth itself.</p>
      <p>Some deceive many with a beautiful appearance. We think things are going well for the people of Magdeburg, while everything is going badly. Articles have been prescribed to them, harsher than those for the people of Konstanz.</p>
      <p>Cities are deserting them, and aid is denied. They have goods and fear that the Emperor will cut off their route; if they do not profit from the goods, they have never tasted the gospel nor love it from the heart, even if they pretend and quibble about it.</p>
      <p>What do you think they will do something significant, who perpetually condemn our church? Do not the people of Magdeburg criticize us in their confession over the matter of the Eucharist?</p>
      <p>They want to transfer the bad cause they support onto us. But what does Philipp Melanchthon's arrival mean? I think he is spending his leisure in Strasbourg, and perhaps he will come to us shortly to visit Basel and greet the learned. I believe the Saxon church is scattered along with the Wittenberg school due to the warlike madness, which perhaps will flare up again with the onset of spring; however, we will learn more from the fairs.</p>
      <p>I also showed your letter to Mr. Myconius; after reading it, he laughed and burst out with these words:</p>
      <p>"What is the poor old man, who does not want to enter, going to celebrate, being confined to bed; if he gave me solid and agile feet, it would be more pleasing. Let him seek others from whom he will receive greater favor and also some benefit; I have nothing to repay but a letter full of words." He added: "But it will be a welcome gift from a very good friend."</p>
      <p>What should I write about the future council? Even our confederates rejoice in their hearts over the council and hope that all ceremonies and superstitions will be approved and that we will be forced to observe them. But they are deceived in strange ways; after the council, the papal and imperial excommunication will overthrow everything, terrify the enemies of the ceremonies, so that they will fall away from the gospel, unless they want to perish or hide at home and suffer from a lack of resources. Thus Satan seeks a thousand tricks to destroy us, but without a doubt, he will achieve nothing with his followers. For the Lord will protect his own and suggest plans by which they can conveniently resist the efforts of insane men who try to cast Christ out of heaven.</p>
      <p>Farewell, to be brief; for I know you are now entangled in various affairs due to the sermons you have in the press. We will discuss these matters more extensively at another time when I send the list of books printed with us. March 2, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor in the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
