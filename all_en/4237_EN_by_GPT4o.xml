      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace, I am your humble, willing servant at all times. This past winter, with God's help, I wrote these six books against the Anabaptists, as well as against the entire matter of Anabaptism. I hereby send a copy of some of these books to Your Princely Grace and humbly ask that Your Princely Grace graciously accept such a book from me, as from one who has loved Your Princely Grace dearly for a long time and years, and who would gladly and diligently serve and wish well to Your Princely Grace, wherever it might be possible for me. I also send some books for the reason that Your Princely Grace may clearly see that neither our late ancestor of blessed memory, Huldrych Zwingli, nor we have any commonality with the Anabaptists and other sectarians, so that Your Princely Grace might graciously promise us before princes and lords, when we are mentioned. For it has not without reason pained us that the aforementioned Zwingli and also we are placed among the Anabaptists or with the Anabaptists and are denounced and condemned as sectarians, also with the name of sacramentarians, even by those princes and lords, against whom we have never deserved any harm, whom we still love from the heart and are ready to serve.</p>
      <p>For this year, a church ordinance was printed in Tübingen for the lordship of Montbéliard, in which two Zwinglians are disgracefully mentioned by name. Likewise, in May of the past year, an ordinance was issued in Tübingen under the name of the illustrious high-born prince and lord, Lord Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, etc., in which chapter 2 the Zwinglians are counted among the blasphemers and placed with the Anabaptists, etc., where Your Princely Grace well knows how much better the aforementioned Zwingli deserved and how he was loved by the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, etc., of blessed and praiseworthy memory, that he would never have allowed such a thing to happen, and perhaps also without the thorough knowledge of the current prince, as he has shown such great praiseworthy seriousness towards the true religion, etc. Therefore, Your Princely Grace might continue, as before, to ensure that the princes who adhere to the gospel have better trust in us and our ancestors, who are neither Anabaptists, sectarians, nor blasphemers, and speak differently of us than those who are generally enemies of our religion. May Your Princely Grace graciously and kindly accept this from me, as from one who has always had special trust in Your Princely Grace and still has, and pray to God that He may graciously preserve Your Princely Grace along with all Your Princely Grace's associates in His grace until the end. Dated in Zürich, the 20th of March, anno 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Princely Grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the Landgrave of Hesse.</p>
