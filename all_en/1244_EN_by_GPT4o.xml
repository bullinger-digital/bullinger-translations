      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I send, dearest brother, a bundle of letters sent by Vergerio. They are addressed to Lord Rudolf Gwalther; however, I decided to send them to you, as the courier is entirely unknown to him. The courier is the son-in-law of Lord Haim, our consul. I request that the other letters be presented to Franz, whom he also does not know.</p>
      <p>Franz has so far kept the furniture or clothes of his daughter with him; now I demand they be returned through the present courier. We have almost no news worth knowing. There is a rumor that Parma has been handed over to the King of the French, supposedly as a seedbed for a future war.</p>
      <p>The dispute over our bishopric is said to have been resolved and concluded; Thomas Planta has prevailed. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you and your entire family. Greet all the brothers in my name. Haim, the consul, and Philipp, our brother, greet you. From the Court of Rhaetia, April 14, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
