      <p>S. D. Meanwhile, since I received your letter, which you sent on October 29th, dearest compater (godfather) in the Lord, Bullinger, no opportunity to reply has presented itself, and while I write this, there is no one at hand through whom I can send it. For your diligent writing to Mr. Haller, the treasurer of this republic, on my behalf, I am most grateful to you; may the Lord repay your benevolence towards us.</p>
      <p>Four days ago, I asked Mr. Haller, my compater, whether the Bernese had done anything in his case; he replied that as far as he knows, nothing at all; they remain silent, and he will also remain silent until the time comes for him to move from here. When I learned this, I intended to approach Mr. Haller (for there is no other senator who shows any familiarity) and advise him in due time; but behold, what has intervened. I hear he is suffering severely from gout; it seemed inappropriate to disturb him while he is suffering. Soon another inconvenience arises in my home, which again hinders me; for Judith, my eldest daughter, was struck by the plague on the 17th of this month and today, between nine and ten in the morning, was called from this world to the heavenly homeland.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we are in such sorrow and mourning that I could do none of the things I had planned. The hand of the Lord touches us. But I pray for His mercy, that He may preserve us in His grace and truth; I beseech you, commend us to His providence.</p>
      <p>I sent the ecclesiastical histories to you on October 21st and do not doubt that you have received them. Farewell excellently, dearest compater. May the Lord preserve you and all yours, whom you should greet in my name and that of mine. Also, greetings to the lords and brothers there and to our Gervasius, for whom I wish there could be provision in Aarau; for he could now be called there to the place of Christian, who is called to the diaconate of our church here.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, dearest compater in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
