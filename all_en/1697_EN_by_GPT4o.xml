      <p>It has been a long time since I wrote to your piety, brother in the Lord, esteemed and beloved, especially as I was observing for some serious occasion. Since it has now arisen, I wanted to resume the duty of writing. No doubt that brother from Lausanne, returning from the Baden assembly, reported what was done by the cities of Zürich, Basel, and Schaffhausen concerning the prisoners for the word of God in France: and that our esteemed Johann Habius, the consul of our city, was sent as an envoy to the king. Today, he presented in writing to the most honorable city council how he carried out the assigned mission, what response he received from the king from his own mouth. Namely, after diligent supplication was made, the king, without consulting with his advisors, expressly requested that those cities should not continue to trouble him in this matter: since not long ago, he had explained his opinion in writing to the four cities dealing with the same matter, from which he has not deviated: he allows the cities to govern their affairs according to their own pleasure: he absolutely wants the same in his kingdom, which he intends to keep pure from those seditious men. This is the king's response, which has been received by ours as it deserves. I did not want you to be unaware of this, so that we might continue to offer more fervent prayers to the Lord together. He lives who delivered his people from Egypt. He lives who brought back the captivity from Babylon. He lives who, having overthrown emperors, kings, and princes, asserted his church. We must indeed enter the kingdom of God through many afflictions. Woe to those who touch the apple of God's eye. Let us continue steadfastly to teach the word of God, to preach the gospel of Christ, and with all the saints to lift our eyes to heaven. He will not forsake us who said: I will be with you until the end of the age. In the world, you will have afflictions: take heart, I have overcome the world.</p>
      <p>May Christ preserve us and his church.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 15th of August, 1552.</p>
