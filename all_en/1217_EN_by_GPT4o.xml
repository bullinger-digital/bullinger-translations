      <p>Greetings. I am very concerned about your health, most esteemed lord and incomparable friend; for since I receive no letters from you, I gather that you have not yet been restored to your former health. Therefore, I continually wish that the Lord, who alone is the unique author of life and all health, may heal you. I hope you have long since received my fifth decade along with the Consensus of Mr. Calvin and ours; for I handed it over to your Knoblauch to be delivered to you.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from England at any moment. It is written from Italy that Cardinal Crescentius of Bologna, the legate, has been appointed president of the council, with two cardinals to be added to him; others say two bishops. They add that there is a great scarcity of grain in Rome and that the Turk is on a major expedition, and also that Cardinal Cornaro, a notably wicked man, has died; he was a Venetian. Rumor spreads that the people of Magdeburg are besieged anew, but by a rather feeble army. However, I pay little heed to such rumors, just as I do not give much credence to the great tales of the Emperor's serious illness. You are not unaware of what was done at Baden, or if you are ignorant, you can hear from this relative of yours. Johannes Wunderlich from Nuremberg said at Baden that the King of France does not want his learned men and bishops to leave Trent. Would that he had spoken the truth! Mr. Calvin has published a Commentary on the seven canonical epistles to the King of England and on the prophet Isaiah, as well as a book on scandal. As I requested in my last letter, most esteemed lord, that you advocate my cause in Poland through your brother with Mr. Florian or his brothers, I now repeat and urge you by our friendship not to fail me. Farewell. Zurich, March 22, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen.</p>
