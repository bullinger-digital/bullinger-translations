      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Diet of Worms has been dissolved. The Emperor is already in Cologne, preparing traps for the bishop. The citizens are indeed plotting to overthrow that bishop. All the canons agree to this except for a few who are acting on behalf of the bishop.</p>
      <p>I heard this from a citizen of Cologne in recent days, who is trying to avoid hostility by his departure and has decided to stay with us for a few days until the Emperor settles the matter. In my judgment, he acts prudently.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hear that the people of Nuremberg and Augsburg are in dispute over trade and have lodged a massive complaint about this matter with the Emperor.</p>
      <p>The Emperor also demands the Duchy of Brunswick by imperial right, as it is a fief that belongs to him, and he wants to maintain it as such. If it is proven at the upcoming Diet that the Duke is an incapable man, not worthy of possessing such a fief, then His Majesty will punish him in body and goods. The Protestants wanted to give the dominion to the firstborn, but he refused, for reasons I do not know.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write these few things to you. Farewell in the Lord, remain safe. Basel, August 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>If you have any reliable information from your printers about the German sermons, please let me know. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
