      <p>Greetings. I would very gladly write to you at length, but I cannot.</p>
      <p>I ask this one thing, that you, by whatever means you can, deal with the neighbors of the Council of Trent, so that they may investigate what is happening there and write to you diligently, and you to me. How can the powerless French be so lazy, careless, and unfaithful! They either refuse or say they will not share anything more with them. I have given to your relative the latest things I received, to be copied for you.</p>
      <p>Briefly: I understand from Calvin's letters that the matter is in danger, because the King of Navarre is not very firm. But the Lord will preserve us and His church.</p>
      <p>The letters, which I received a little while ago, I send here, so that you are not unaware and do not lack what I have; but return these at the next market. Farewell very well.</p>
      <p>There would be more to write; but I said: I cannot. Three bishoprics, Magdeburg, Halle, and Merseburg, have thrown off the papacy, including the bishop and cathedral chapter; this is most certain. The bishop and chapter have become evangelical, having reformed.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th February 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, as always.</p>
      <p>Greet those you know, the consuls, Philipp, Pontisella.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
