    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends [Ambrosius] Blarer, who set out for Augsburg on [June 18], to his intercession. Grynäus responded negatively to the opinion of the people of Konstanz regarding the Nuremberg meeting, which Blarer sent to him before his departure, because he expects more from the [planned religious discussion] than they do. Zwick forwards Luther's writing [“On the Councils and the Church”] as well as some theses [by Luther on resistance against the Emperor?], whose publication in Zurich would be desirable. He asks again to name a young man who could enter his service as an assistant.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ. On June 28, Ambrosius set out for Augsburg with his lord and his angels; I commend him to your prayers. Before he left, he sent our writing to Grynaeus, which we presented to our council regarding the Nuremberg meeting.</p>
      <p>Now the excellent man Grynaeus writes to us Blaurers and Zwicks a rather long letter, in which he refutes our opinion, but with much sincerity and charity; for he hopes for better things than we predict. But we also wish that our predictions are proven wrong, and even more so, we wish that the meeting itself is proven wrong.</p>
      <p>And now we hear nothing at all, and all is silent, but let it be as the Lord wills. I am sending you here an open and candid booklet by Luther, which you will share with Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the others. Therefore, I am sending some theses, but they are to be returned entirely; for they are not mine. If only they could be printed with you!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, not long ago I wrote to you to inform me if there is any young man with you who could serve as my assistant and who could sometimes act as a sub-teacher in the school. However, he is not to be sent immediately, but described. In this matter, I especially desire the assistance of Pellican; for he knows my character well enough.</p>
      <p>Farewell to all of you in the Lord, safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Given on July 5, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
