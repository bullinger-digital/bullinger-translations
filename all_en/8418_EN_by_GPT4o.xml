      <p>S. D. I am now somewhat better than before, although the swelling of the palate has not yet fully subsided; however, I hope that through the grace of the Lord, I will soon be fully restored to health; but may His will be done! If you receive anything worth mentioning about the Davos assembly, you would do me a favor by sending it to me. I would like our Campell to succeed in Ganthner's place. Do what is in your power. We must pray to the Lord that He may make it happen. Greet Campell. I sent your letters to Kamp through my son to Lucius; I hope he has taken care of them properly. I received my writings, which you returned, and since you say you have copied them, I have now re-read what I had sent in haste, and I found that in my hurry I had omitted the fourth chapter; therefore, if you please, add it. If the sayings of the Old Testament are not proven, then one would have to discard the entire New Testament, in which Christ and the apostles prove all their matters with the Old Testament, and that is a true Anabaptist article, etc. I have not received any letters from friends for 14 days except one from Biel. The minister of that church writes that a rumor has spread among them that the king's mother and some prince have died in France, which I will not believe until I hear more certain news.</p>
      <p>With us, by the grace of God, all is peaceful. However, we must be vigilant against the wolf Borromeo, and one should make the Confederates understand that he bears little goodwill towards them because they expelled his mother's brother, the lord of Müß; for the two brothers, Müß and Pope Pius (who became pope with his brother Müß's money), have two sisters; one is married to Borromeo in Milan, hence the cardinal wolf, the other to Wolf Dietrich of Hohenems, from whom comes the cardinal bishop of Constance, Count Hannibal, etc. Their cousin, the pope, has made them all cardinals and counts, who otherwise would have stood for a while at the bottom of the stairs as simple noblemen.</p>
      <p>Now they are elevated and are contemplating revenge. Therefore, one should be cautious. These are just passing thoughts.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet the consuls, Pontisella, Carolus, Bonettus, and our other friends. November 4, 1570.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
