      <p>Greetings. I would not have allowed you to be without my letters for so long, had I not been deprived of the abundance of messengers. Meanwhile, I have received all of yours and I give thanks.</p>
      <p>The Cretan, about whom you write, did not come here, but passed through Solothurn and from there sent your letters to me. As for the French affairs, we have almost nothing other than what you also have, as I have learned from yours. Today it is first reported that the colloquy has ended and that Mr. Peter will soon be present, that public congregations have been granted to the faithful, yet in such a way that the churches are kept for their priests; meanwhile, there are princes and nobles who wish to construct public auditoriums from their own goods in many places, and this has been granted by the queen. But whether it is true, I do not yet affirm for certain, although it seems not unlike the truth; however, we will soon have certain information about these and other matters. Farel left Neuchâtel last week and set out for the Dauphiné, where he is originally from, to preach Christ there. From our parts, almost all the French ministers are leaving; they claim that they cannot obtain the discipline they would like; but I think they are more led by love of their homeland and hope for better outcomes. The Lord knows what each one seeks.</p>
      <p>I think Diesbach has spoken with you about these matters.</p>
      <p>We had advised the senate to grant them some tolerable form of discipline; but this was denied to both them and us; for most are persuaded that all who make mention of this matter are seeking dominion and I know not what keys again. However, there are also many on the other side who are not unfavorably disposed to the matter and who see that the church's necessity requires some stricter correction.</p>
      <p>May the Lord ensure that such discipline is established, which is not a cause of greater destruction than edification. But more on these matters another time.</p>
      <p>I write these things scarcely from the midst of the crowds of the fair and the frequent interruptions of those approaching me, so that I cannot write more now. I return to you Fabricius's letters and give thanks.</p>
      <p>Diesbach, Steiger, Musculus, Haller the treasurer, Zehender, and many others send their greetings to you. In Bern on St. Martin's Day, 1561.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, family, and all the brothers. Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
