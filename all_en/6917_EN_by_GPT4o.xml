      <p>S. As much as I have traveled through Germany, Poland, and even Hungary in your letters without any inconvenience of travel, you demand that I do the same. Indeed, I owe it; but a day of solace must be obtained from you. Certainly, I am especially glad for this reason, that France offers almost nothing new. It is more pleasing to recount the labors of others, if only fortune has completed them for us. I remember Chantoneum, the brother of Cardinal Granvella, lamenting the unfortunate state of the French kingdom among some nobles when civil unrest was raging among us. I, on the other hand, replied that the affairs of France were not so worn and afflicted that they would arouse the pity of perpetual enemies; rather, I saw that these things were said in jest by him. Therefore, he should remember that line from Horace: "Hey, you who walk proudly in my misfortune, alas, you will weep for loves transferred elsewhere; but I will laugh in turn." Both happened; for what you write about the affairs of Flanders is very true, and what you predict about Spain is confirmed by the opinions of many. They say that this Spanish inquisition is producing very unexpected effects, more atrocious than snakes to the Moors; for from there emerged the Flemish assemblies, which otherwise lay hidden. Many Spaniards are said to be about to do the same, to shake off the slaughter of the inquisition. The Spanish king is expected at Savona, through Savoy, as they say, on his way to Belgium. They write that many are expected there, who have gone to meet him.</p>
      <p>Regarding German affairs, either I know nothing or you judge best; the Germans babble so much recklessly that I wish rather than dare to have faith in their writings. I send you a German document; judge for yourself. I will copy some other things from a friend's letter, so that the author may have credibility. From Lower Saxony, it is reported with constant rumor that a great disaster has been inflicted on the people of Lübeck and the Danes by a storm at sea; the king lost ten, and they lost three of their most well-equipped ships with artillery and other equipment, with about seven thousand men missing. The day before these things happened, they wanted to attempt a battle with the enemy; but adverse winds drove the Swedes away. The Danes, therefore, pursuing them with their allies, fell into this misfortune and danger of life. They had indeed already been severely punished both because of the scarcity of provisions and because of exactions; yet because they lived impiously and disgracefully enough, they profess to endure deserved punishments and prefer to fall into the hand of the Lord rather than the enemy. However, both kings met on land, and with several thousand lost on both sides, the Swede was put to flight and is now in danger of losing the kingdom. For the king of Denmark, having advanced with his army, has besieged the royal seat of Stockholm, to which the Swede fled. Some affirm that besides Stockholm and Kalmar, all of Sweden, even the silver mines themselves, have come into the power of the king of Denmark, and that the Danes have been introduced into the kingdom by the Germans and peasants, who defected because of the tyranny of the Swede, and thus this long war, undertaken for a very trivial matter, as it seems to most, may perhaps reach an end. If some great hero had applied his mind to it, it would have been settled long ago. Moreover, there is also great dissension between the Hamburgers and Duke Otto of Lüneburg. He has a castle on the Elbe and recently began to demand a toll there. The Hamburgers, while sailing to the sea, are forced to pass by this place, and when they said that the toll was imposed contrary to custom and refused to pay, the Lüneburgian seized the ships and ordered them to be carried into the castle with the artillery taken away. They, however, gathered together and rushed to the court, to present themselves as avengers and helpers against this violence. That one also quickly takes care to enlist cavalry and infantry. But the prince, as they say, tries to prevent this and has joined himself with Ernest of Lüneburg and the Bishop of Bremen, the brother of Henry of Brunswick, who are all hiring soldiers, and there is fear of greater disturbances. In Saxony, too, there is a gathering of cavalry and infantry, and that by three different princes, Elector Augustus, Duke Johann Friedrich, and the Elector of Brandenburg, mainly for this reason, that with the Bishop of Magdeburg having died on September 6, Augustus wishes to transfer the bishopric to himself under the pretext that he obtained it from the Emperor at the recently held diet. Brandenburg opposes him. Why the Duke of Saxony is in preparation is unknown, especially since it is rumored that almost all the proscribed have left from there. Recently, the envoys of some princes held a meeting at Erfurt because of the controversy about the Lord's Supper; but because the plague is raging there, they are said to have immediately departed, perhaps with nothing accomplished. The Rhenish circle also met a few days ago, dealing with preserving peace and leisure in the empire. Thus far my friend, who is a sincere and prudent man. Since these add somewhat to yours, in some things they differ, I thought they should be sent. I pray for much health from the Lord for you and Master Gwalter. Farewell, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, October 8.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] Bellièvre.</p>
