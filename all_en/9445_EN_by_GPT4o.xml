      <p>Greetings. I have returned safely with my wife from [Alv..] to new places, most reverend father. I give thanks, for you have supported us so fatherly even to this point.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly sent the acts of the last judgment, if I had not been hindered by one cause.</p>
      <p>I submit what Mr. Lentulus sent. I will soon send the description of the Scuol miracle. Everything else is going very well, and unless some new oligarchs attempt something again, a firm peace and quiet can finally be hoped for and desired. More soon; I just wanted you to know that we have returned safely. Farewell, most reverend father; may the Lord preserve you in good health for all of us for as long as possible. The envoy recently went to the Engadin; upon his return, he invited me to lunch through his interpreter, but I had many reasons that deterred me.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Campell, etc., send their greetings to your excellence.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, 8th of September, 1573, in Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
