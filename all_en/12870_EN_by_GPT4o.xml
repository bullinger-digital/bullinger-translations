    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Haller sent his letter [No. 2805] to Bullinger via the Zurich council messenger [Hans Zingg], he received two letters from Bullinger [not preserved], which took a very long time to arrive. A response to them might be unnecessary, as Haller has made it sufficiently clear that he was never fearful (hopefully, Bullinger now thinks differently of him). He aligned himself with the best men in Augsburg and wanted to leave the city only because of its impending unworthy situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Now what Haller had long feared is happening here, and what has already occurred in other [Upper German cities]. Today, six imperial companies under the command of Colonel Count von Schramberg [correctly: Bernhard von Schaumburg] are to march into the city. The colonel was here four days ago. He stayed at the Fugger House, near Haller's accommodation. The troops are to be quartered with the wealthy citizens and not with the poor, to avoid any unrest. The colonel thought it would be a disgrace to house the deserving soldiers with the poor or in the monasteries (where beds had already been prepared for them) as closely together as in a hospital! So they gave in to him. He and his men dined here, but did not pay, only saying that Emperor Charles V would soon come and settle the bill. This alone upset the citizens, and it is hardly expected that the citizens will get along well with the occupiers. The city is already teeming with red sashes [of the Imperial troops].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The sermons are still diligently attended.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Hans Wilpert Zoller should return to Zurich. Presumably, he will do so, as he is in danger. Haller also assumes that he is getting into debt, as despite his admonitions, he lives extravagantly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder will return to Zurich after receiving their travel money. Thoman Ruman would like to accompany them, but the Augsburg council wants him to stay. Haller has already written about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Perhaps everyone will soon have to leave if the Emperor continues as before. For then the preachers will face a problem, especially since they are already being asked to pray by name for Charles V and King Ferdinand I during the service! This has already led to tensions among the colleagues. Everyone is willing to pray generally for the enemies; however, naming them (when previously the names of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, the princes, and the imperial estates were mentioned in prayers) will cause offense in the church. When Pastor Johann Heinrich Held von Tiefenau ordered prayers for the most gracious Emperor after the city's submission, it already caused great irritation (if it were in the interest of the church, Haller would not hesitate to mention the Emperor by name). He also heard (albeit only from private individuals and not from officials) that the preachers are to be instructed not to speak vehemently against the Mass and the godless enemies of the Gospel. If they do not adhere to this instruction [and if there is an uprising], they will be held responsible. The Emperor is already annoyed that the pastors admonish the congregations not to take offense at the success of the godless.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Undoubtedly, the devil will rage. It could be like in Ulm. The Emperor has chosen a church there where he hears Mass daily. Perhaps the Imperial troops will claim the same in Augsburg. It goes against Haller's conscience to make room for the Antichrist! But things are still in flux. In due time, he will ask Bullinger for advice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Haller can only recall the terms of the Peace of Augsburg from memory, as he heard them read by someone [...]. He noted them down immediately when he got home, but they may not be complete. [This is followed by nine points of the peace agreement between Augsburg and the Emperor, occasionally commented on by Haller.]</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The people of Ulm have entered into even worse obligations, and yet their land was almost completely destroyed in the presence of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg had to accept even harsher terms. Haller received them in a copy from a good man [...]. [This is followed by 18 articles of the peace between the Duke and the Emperor, which Haller evaluates in places.]</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The acceptance of these treaties will be an eternal disgrace for Germany!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Not a word in these treaties about religion. The Emperor did not want to address the issue because he allegedly did not start the war for the sake of religion! Bullinger can imagine the consequences of this. May the Lord free his church from this tyranny!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Regarding the Elector, one only hears that he has a large army and is vigorously pursuing his cause. May the Lord strengthen him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Many claim that Landgrave Philip of Hesse is a traitor and knew [about the plans of his brother-in-law Maurice of Saxony]. Hopefully, this is not true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] The Emperor is recruiting troops in Nuremberg for three regiments intended against the Elector. King Christian III of Denmark supports the Emperor. The situation with the Hanseatic cities is different than claimed. Poland is said to have renounced obedience to King Ferdinand. The Bohemians do not want to come to his aid, except that they are willing to protect their land. On January 27, Anna Jagiello, Ferdinand's wife, died. The English King Henry VIII is also said to be dead. There are so many rumors about King Francis I of France that they cannot all be true, and Haller is reluctant to write about them. Does Bullinger know anything about this? Is it true that Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, is coming to the Baden Diet [on February 28]?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Thus, the Holy Scripture is fulfilled! Lift up your heads, for redemption is near! Greetings and recommendations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Haller has almost finished his sermon series on the Second Epistle to Timothy. He wanted to preach on the Gospel of John, even though Wolfgang Musculus (albeit at a different time and place) is also speaking about it. But given the uncertain situation in which the church finds itself, the Acts of the Apostles seems much more appropriate to him! Haller possesses Bullinger's corresponding commentary. Bullinger should have his sermon notes on this book (if he has any) copied by a poor student. Haller will cover the costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Greetings to the colleagues, to Anna [née Adlischwyler], and to the children. Greetings from Meyer, Ruman, Schwyzer, Musculus, Michael Keller, Georg Frölich, Sebastian Lepusculus, and Sixt Birck.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] [P.S.:] Bullinger should also inform Bernhard von Cham, the bailiff of Kyburg, about the peace treaties shared here. Haller does not have time to copy them for him as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Zoller is currently here and sends his regards. While Haller and Zoller were reading the bailiff's letter, the aforementioned six companies arrived. There are about 1200 men. Another similar number is expected to arrive in the coming days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] [Above the address, Haller noted the composition of the Elector's army and the names of its leaders.] No one has yet set out from the Elector's land. The Polish King [Sigismund II Augustus] and Duke Albert of Prussia have renounced obedience to Ferdinand. This was written to the Augsburg council. Haller learned of this as he was closing the letter.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ. Since I last sent you a letter via the public messenger of the Zurich council, I have received two from you, which, however, were delayed for a long time on the journey, as I understood from the date. To these (since I have long since opened my heart to you sufficiently) I have, in my judgment, cleared myself of the suspicion you have of me and the claim that I have completely lost heart. I hope you will think better of me in the future, and therefore it is unnecessary to respond to them now. I did what I saw the best men do, and indeed, not out of fear, but moved by the indignity of the situation, I wished to leave.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now what we have long feared has happened to us, and what we have observed in others until now, we now feel ourselves. Today, six imperial companies are coming into the city. The colonel is Count von Schramberg. He was here four days ago, staying at the Fugger House, near my lodging. The soldiers are only quartered in the richest houses. The poor and weavers have been spared, so they do not become rebellious. They also do not want to stay with any poor, but where it pleases them. Many have been placed in some monasteries so that the citizens are less burdened. The citizens have provided beds there, but they do not want to stay there. The colonel said it would be a disgrace to lay the honorable people, with whom they have won land and people, on top of each other as in a hospital! In short: they are the masters. One must do what they want. Some have gone away. It is said the emperor will come soon; he will pay the bills. The arrogance has already begun. God have mercy! The citizens are unwilling and heated. There is a great evil to be feared, for they will not be able to get along with each other. The city is already full of red sashes, which could break one's heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The sermons are still strongly attended. The pious are zealous. God preserve it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I would advise Zollern to return. I also believe he will do so, for he will have great attacks from within. I fear he may be burdened by foreign debt, although he has said nothing to me. He has always wanted to be too extravagant, no matter how faithfully I have advised him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The two brothers, Laurentius and Rodolphus, are expecting the stipend for the imminent journey. Then they will leave. Romanus would gladly leave with them, but since he is pleasing to the council, they do not want to let him go, as I wrote recently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Perhaps an opportunity will be given to everyone to leave if the emperor continues as he has begun. For as far as I can judge, they will soon make an attack on us. They already want us to name the emperor and royal majesty in the pulpit and urge the church to pray for them! This has caused great contention among the brothers. No one has denied that we should pray for him and all enemies, indeed we all do this, but whether he should now be named, with such a sudden change, pleases few. Until now, we have named the elector, princes, and states of the empire. If we now omit these and name others, it will be offensive to the church. For it is amazing how much slander has arisen because Heldius, one of the ministers, immediately, upon hearing that our people had submitted to the emperor, ordered the church to pray for that most gracious emperor. It is therefore permitted to us to pray for him either implicitly or explicitly. If I saw it to be in the interest of the church, I would not hesitate to name him, but as far as I understand, they will soon prescribe some way, so that we do not inveigh too harshly against the mass and the impious enemies of the gospel (although I have heard this much from private persons, not yet from public ones), and if we do not do it, all the blame will be turned on us. For already some say that we irritate the emperor with our sermons, when we admonish the church not to be offended by the success of the impious.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, I do not doubt that we will encounter much of the devil. There is also a danger that what happened in Ulm may happen. There he chose a particular church for himself, where he hears mass every day. Perhaps they will also demand a church for themselves here. I, who am a servant of Christ, cannot in good conscience give place to the Antichrist! But since all these things are still uncertain, I ask for your advice in due time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I cannot certainly describe all the conditions of our peace. I recently heard someone recite from a note. Therefore, as far as I could comprehend from memory, I immediately noted them down when I returned home, lest they slip away before I wrote to you. I perceived them to be of this kind: 1. They shall surrender at discretion. N[ota] B[ene]! 2. Whatever people he places in the city, they shall receive and provide for. No number is mentioned. 3. All claims that the royal majesty and the cardinal of Augsburg, as well as others, have against them and theirs are waived. Therefore, they shall come to terms with them; for this, he will graciously mediate. This may well make a new war for us! One cannot approach them. They want to have an innumerable amount of money. They are still in daily negotiation. The coffers must once be emptied. 4. All who are out of the city, without exception, shall be allowed to return with their old honors, without injury, regardless of their civic constitution and ordinances. This article will bring the priests back to us! For they left the city because they did not want to adhere to the ordinances like other citizens in taxes and contributions. 5. The moderation (thus they call the money he demands, with a new term) shall be paid according to the convenience of the city. N[ota]: He wants to stretch them well; he thinks they have it well. 6. The justices of the chamber court, which they appoint, they shall uphold. You are not ignorant of what has been done in this matter so far. 7. The alliance with Saxony, Hesse, and all their adversaries shall be abandoned and never again approved against them and the house of Austria. There he will want to make good with them! 8. The oath, like other cities, shall be renewed. N.: D. Naves has ridden to Ulm. He was supposed to take the oath from Augsburg. And when he came to Günzburg, he was struck by a pain (some say a stroke), so he had to be taken back to Ulm. 9. They shall obey all that his imperial majesty will henceforth order in the empire for the peace and unity of the same. In this, faith and all that is in dispute may be included. I noted these things from memory. I think I have omitted few. You see what kind of peace! What are we to expect!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The people of Ulm have accepted even more disgraceful conditions, although their land was almost completely devastated and they were oppressed by the presence of the emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Württemberg after a more disgraceful! I have these described from a good man. 1. First, his ducal grace's envoys shall fall at his feet and beg for mercy. 2. In 6 weeks, he shall personally fall at his feet and confess that he acted against his majesty. 3. He shall recognize his majesty as his rightful, natural lord. 4. He shall provide the necessary maintenance for the justices that his majesty will appoint. 5. He shall not assist Duke Hans Friedrich, formerly Duke of Saxony, and Philip of Hesse, nor the others of the alliance, but help his majesty according to the ban against current or other enemies. 6. He shall not allow any dealings contrary to his majesty. 7. All alliances against his majesty and Austria shall be renounced and never entered into again. [9.] He shall give his majesty and Austria, as often as they desire, passage through the land and access to all their fortifications. Beware, Confederation! [10.] All artillery and ammunition remaining in the land, belonging to the enemies, shall be handed over to his majesty. They say it is a great treasure. For all the states have left some cannons there. [11.] He shall pay his royal majesty 300,000 Rhenish guilders at 15 batzen (half in 15 days and the rest in 25 days thereafter) to be paid in Ulm. [12.] Schorndorf, Hohen Asperg, and Kirchheim unter Teck shall be handed over to his majesty for the assurance and execution of the treaty. [13.] His majesty retains all claims and demands previously taken from him. He shall come to terms with them or adhere to his majesty's recognition. [14.] Likewise, both dukes, Ulrich and Christoph, shall renounce all rights they may have in the county of Burgundy, whether against whom it may be. They shall otherwise take justice before the land court, like other subjects. Duke Christoph did not want to do this and therefore (as it is said) sold Montbéliard to the king in France, who holds the fief from the house of Burgundy. [15.] For this good deed, which has happened to him, his imperial and royal majesty shall retain all their rights, which they have to the principality of Württemberg. NB! [16.] The cadaverous treaty shall remain in force. [17.] If he keeps all that is contained in the treaty, his majesty shall renounce all that he has acted against them. [18.] Count George of Württemberg, his princely grace's brother, as the one who openly rebelled, shall be excluded; also all other subjects of his princely grace, who are now in service against his majesty. He shall consider all of them as enemies. Their goods shall be confiscated and remain to his majesty. [19.] He shall ratify the treaty in 4 days, and Duke Christoph shall ratify it in 6 weeks and also keep all that is contained therein. He shall have the treaty ratified by his estates in 6 weeks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>To accept such treaties will be an eternal disgrace for Germany!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Nothing about religion in the treaties, for he did not want it mentioned, since he did not start the war for the sake of religion! What will follow, you can easily judge yourself. The Lord must be prayed to, that he may free his church from this tyranny.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>We hear nothing about the elector, except that he has great forces and is conducting his affairs vigorously. May the Lord strengthen him!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Many cry out that the Landgrave is a traitor and was aware of all this business beforehand. I hope for better things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>The emperor is setting up three regiments in Nuremberg against the elector. Denmark is well disposed towards him. The Hanseatic cities are also not as they say. Poland is said to have renounced Ferdinand. Bohemia does not want to help him, except to protect their land. Ferdinand's wife died on January 27. They also say the king of England is dead. What the French king is planning is uncertain: so many rumors are spread that, since they cannot all be true, I am reluctant to write any. I wish to learn something from you. They say Granvelle is at the Helvetian diet. I would like to know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Thus, thus the scriptures are fulfilled! It is time to lift up our heads, for our redemption is near. Farewell and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I have almost finished the second epistle to Timothy. I had intended to take up the Gospel of John (which Musculus also treats, but at a different time and place). But with the church in such turmoil, the Acts of the Apostles seem more appropriate and applicable. I have your commentaries. If you have notes, I would like you to have them copied by a poor student. I will pay the price.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>I wish all the brothers, your wife, and children well. Our brothers 3, Musculus, Cellarius, and d. Laetus, also Lepusculus and, who always commends this to me, Xystus, greet you. Augsburg, February 21, 1547. Your Haller forever.</p>

      <p>I ask you to inform the gentlemen of Kyburg about these treaties. I have not had time to write it all down for him.</p>

And no one has yet set out from the Elector's land. The King of Poland and Duke Albert of Prussia have renounced the king in Bohemia. I have just received this written to our senate, as I was about to close the letter.</p>
