      <p> S. Even now, I would not have a reliable messenger through whom I could write to you, if our merchants were not traveling to Geneva; however, I entrust these letters to them, so that they may send them to you either from there or on the way. Brunner brought me your latest letters, and as far as he is concerned, he achieved nothing here; for he arrived at a very inconvenient time. Impatient with the delay (for he could not be admitted to the council for three whole days, although I had particularly recommended him to Steiger and Gravenriet), he decided to travel to Basel for some time and return when our envoys from Savoy have come back. For during those days, the matter of the Savoyard restitution was being discussed, and the envoys of the Swiss were present; moreover, other matters were being discussed, so he was not heard. Meanwhile, our people have set out with the envoys of the 4 Cantons to Savoy, to restore to the Duke those prefectures, which you know, may God grant it success! From Lucerne is envoy Schultheiß Pfyffer, from Schwyz Ammann Reding, from Glarus Ammann Schüler, from Basel Mayor Krug, from here Schultheiß Steiger, both treasurers Gravenriet and Manuel, Herr von Mülinen, Benedict von Diesbach, and Hans Jacob Delsperger. In previous days, the French alliance was also discussed. What was concluded, you have heard from my previous letters; it is not entirely rejected, but only postponed for the time being; I fear, however, there will be no let-up, and many of the best among my lords are behind it, thinking it is not entirely dismissed. We oppose it as much as we can; hence we incur great hatred. As for Angusola, about whom you write, he is not here and was here for only a few days, nor would our people have allowed him to linger here longer. But he stayed for some time in Fribourg; what he did there, I do not know, nor even if he is still there. What you write about your envoy sent to the Palatinate, and what he brought back, I have shared only with the most confidential; but the same was written here to a certain citizen of ours in Winterthur, who would have filled the whole city with this matter, had I not restrained him. So I see that this business is not secret with us/you. Our people, however, fear nothing from these plans, which are commonly devised against the Swiss, and they favor the Austrian side as you do too. </p>
      <p> Otherwise, I know nothing about other matters; it is very quiet with us. The Spaniards are down in the Netherlands and are scattered here and there in the garrisons. The Confederates are moving towards Picardy to guard the borders. We have nothing from Germany. I await what you have. Diesbach greets you, who is now in charge of affairs in the absence of the consul. </p>
      <p> I presented your letters to the consul and saw the gift you sent him; he thanks you and will also thank you through his own letters when he has returned. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Give my regards to all yours in my name. Bern, August 28, 1567. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot. </p>
