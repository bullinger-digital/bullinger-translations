    <p xml:id="regest1">Emphasizes the importance of the agreement reached in Schmalkalden in light of the threat posed by the Pope and urges unity. Yesterday, received Bullinger's and Pellican's [Bible commentaries] and heard them praised by people who have already skimmed through them; however, unnecessary reservations are said to have been made in them. The church is built up through proper preaching and good administration of the office, not through disputes; Capito knows Bullinger's mildness and points out the special responsibility he bears for numerous congregations. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt that you have already been informed about the proceedings in Schmalkalden. The hope of any kind of concord, as much as it brings significance to the churches, is evident from those very proceedings. For our ministers of the word have agreed, and there is consensus among the princes and our magistrates. The Pope is now contemplating our destruction with greater effort than you perhaps believe; but it is the duty of pious prudence to foresee widely and to observe what the Lord requires of us at each time. He requires the closest friendship in Christ as the head and foundation, and then, that others may be edified in Christ through us with great simplicity. But concord would grow if old wounds were not reopened with new writings, although I hope that the Lord will suddenly shine upon us, who misuse joyful things; we need to be brought back to the path through more sorrowful things. This is what I see happening especially in our church, which, though afflicted, receives an increase in strength.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, your and Pellican's writings were brought. Soon, our people eagerly went through everything, as they say, which I believe cannot be done with certain judgment in passing, and yet my dinner companions last evening highly commended your clear brevity and the light of your expression, then they praised the prefaces with the highest praises, except that they think some unnecessary caution has been added, which will exacerbate more sensitive matters. But I will finally examine this myself with the fairness with which it is fitting to evaluate the works of friends.</p>
      <p>We will build up the churches with successful outcomes if we teach the same doctrine of faith to the unlearned, that is, repentance and the forgiveness of sins in Christ Jesus. From this source, the other duties of a Christian man flow beautifully. In this matter, some in this vicinity have been negligent, whose churches are deteriorating daily. Repentance and faith in Christ are taught not only by the word of preaching but also by the ecclesiastical order and the authority of our ministry, as far as it is clear from the scriptures. The diligent care of pastors brings so much benefit to consciences, it can hardly be expressed. For we experience this very thing according to our mediocrity. I prefer to devote myself to this matter rather than to deadly quarrels, by which churches have been submerged from ancient times and are now hindered from being established. I know your mildness of spirit, who undoubtedly share the same opinion. May the Lord grant that both of us may proceed strongly to His glory, and you even more so, as you are bound to a larger province. For you indeed bear a great burden, taking care of so many churches, as the Lord has entrusted to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, and please convey our greetings to Pellican, Bibliander, and the most learned professors in our name. I ask you to interpret Bucer's efforts kindly, who is entirely devoted to public concerns. Commend us to the Lord Consul and the friendly senators, who are dear to us for this reason, that they honor and protect you, the ministers of Christ, with great faith. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 8th of April.</p>
      <p>Your V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church in Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
