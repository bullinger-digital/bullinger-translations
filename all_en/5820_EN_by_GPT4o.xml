      <p>Holy Bullinger, I wish you eternal salvation in Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>You may wonder why I dare to trouble you with my letters.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I will write briefly.</p>
      <p>Not long ago I was in Zürich, where I could pour out all my concerns; you have the remains of the same person among you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Zürich often comes to my mind. But why should I babble about what I am thinking? Martyr lives; may Zürich live and prosper happily. And so that the memory of Zürich's kindness to me does not perish along with Martyr, I now address you. A small dwelling was once given to me in Zürich: if God were to grant my wishes now, I would earnestly seek it again. Perhaps I am complaining about myself while wishing for such things; I do not deny it.</p>
      <p>But since the glory of Christ, our Lord, is to be sought above all, I abandon my requests, as far as they concern me.</p>
      <p>In this matter (in seeking a little lodging) I do not wish to trouble you again.</p>
      <p>Oh, if only it were granted to reach the mansions prepared for us by Christ the Lord in heaven! Meanwhile, most holy father, I commend our England and myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Things are going badly in England; I fear worse, not to say the worst.</p>
      <p>But in the meantime, we must serve Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Happy is he whom our Christ calls into service.</p>
      <p>Therefore, keep England most recommended in your prayers and also remember me.</p>
      <p>As a perpetual sign of my love for you, I send Oxford gloves through Mr. Blaurer, your countryman.</p>
      <p>They will grow old; yet may the love of England and me never grow old with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live most happily in the Lord, dearest father. Oxford, July 26, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, in my name and my wife's, Julius Terentianus. To the excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful preacher of the divine word.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
