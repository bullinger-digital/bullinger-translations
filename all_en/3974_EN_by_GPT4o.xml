      <p>Greetings. You will learn about our situation from the bearer of this letter.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I received letters from Heidelberg indicating some disturbance at the university; for the most learned Mr. Stephan Sylvius is disputing about the Lord's Supper and defending our position.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord that the matter turns out well. I could not write more; I will write again another time.</p>
      <p>I have scarcely recovered from a severe headache, which is growing stronger and stronger. Farewell with all friends. May 30, 1559.</p>
      <p>Be vigilant, lest a papist school be established in the Valtellina, about which I will write another time. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
