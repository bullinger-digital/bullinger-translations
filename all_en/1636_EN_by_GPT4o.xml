      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter, written on the third of May, and regarding the matter of Rottweil, that the princes should not oppose those of Rottweil, etc., if this is understood to refer to the high-born Lord Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, our dear friendly lord and cousin, we believe that Your Grace should not undertake anything inappropriate or unauthorized against the people of Rottweil. If it were otherwise, which we do not hope, it would not be pleasing to us at all. You may also have understood that we have offered and undertaken to seek the good in this matter and all its parts to the best of our ability and have been confident in this. But since this will not follow through, we will let it rest as it is. However, if the warlords intend to oppose Rottweil, we understand their actions and undertakings as nothing other than that they are friendly and graciously intended to support the law and not to abolish the customs and privileges of the empire, and we believe they will conduct themselves well within the empire and know that no one should have cause to complain about this.</p>
      <p>As for the princes marching towards Constance, we cannot know their intentions, nor can we see where this might lead; however, we believe that the king and they are inclined to act everywhere with friendly and gracious intent. You must consider that when the king and so many people come into a land, it cannot always proceed so precisely at the borders against the will of the lords, so that these people must sometimes be guarded, like a hive with bees, where many friends and neighbors want to do their part, to be supportive and favorable to the matter, and we ourselves have sometimes experienced the same. We write to you about how things are going, although we believe that one does not look so much towards Constance and that the king and princes will know how to conduct themselves there as well.</p>
      <p>Regarding Ulm, due to the great disparity, we cannot write anything definitive to you. However, we expect to have certain news in a few days. We did not want to withhold from you our gracious and good opinion in response to your letter and are inclined to your grace. Dated Schaffhausen, the 9th of May, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
