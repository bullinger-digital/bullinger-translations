      <p>Salvation through Christ, who is the only salvation for all, amen.</p>
      <p>Venerable, highly learned, God-loving lord and father. God in heaven knows the heartfelt joy I have received from two letters from Your Reverence addressed to unworthy me. For I have truly recognized your fatherly, Christian, and well-meaning heart from them. But especially, it has been no small comfort to me, and increasingly so, that Your Reverence, in the most recent letter, has given me good hope and comfort to be helpful in a matter of condition, whether it be in Thurgau or in the Chur area, wherever you might find a small place where I might have a decent living and, above all, manage my office without violating my conscience and serve the church. I will accept this with the greatest gratitude from Your Reverence and will not cease to pray to God for Your Reverence and the entire church (as I already do). Therefore, Your Reverence, if my affairs should lead in that direction, please extend your fatherly hand to me for Christ's sake. For my affairs are such that I can no longer assure or promise myself of staying in our lands, unless God, in another way, as He can, turns and changes things. For just as some preachers have secretly accused and defamed Mr. Lorenz Agricola as a fanatic to the prince, so it has also happened to me, as the aforementioned Lorenz and Mr. Fröhlich know well. Therefore, I await the great change of the prince, which I, for my part, if it cannot be otherwise, might well endure. For I am not willing to serve in the place as before, to the detriment of my conscience. Therefore, I, unworthy and unknown, wish to commend myself to Your Reverence as my father for Christ's sake. Your Reverence will also receive further information from the bearer of this letter, who is my dear lord and brother in a village half a mile from Neuburg, about how things are going with us concerning the servants of the church, and also how unchristian and ungrateful a certain Leonhard [Leonhard Sörin?] has behaved, to whom much good has been done by Your Reverence and others, as he himself admits.</p>
      <p>Finally, with us, all things tend towards aligning everything according to the Augsburg Confession; whatever does not retain the color and the mark on this touchstone must yield. Everyone boasts and relies on this. May God stand by His own, etc. Almighty God, for the good of the church of Christ, may He preserve and maintain Your Reverence, along with Your Reverence's entire household and many other dear lords and fathers, in fresh health of body and soul for a long time to come, amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Neuburg on August 7.</p>
      <p>Your Reverence's most humble and obedient Johan Bechlin from Augsburg, servant of the church in Neuburg.</p>
