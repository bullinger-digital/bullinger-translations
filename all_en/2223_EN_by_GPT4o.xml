      <p>That I write to you less frequently is because I do not wish to interrupt your occupations and studies. Now, since there is nothing that needs to be written, I will be brief. What is happening in Germany and the great preparations being made there, you know better from the letters of your many friends. Therefore, it remains for me to commend myself to your piety. Shortly, if the plans of many proceed, arms will clash everywhere. May God, the best and greatest, direct everything for the salvation of His people. Farewell. Chur, on the Ides of March.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
