      <p>I have no doubt that you received the letters which I arranged to be sent to you on the day before the first of August through Georg Wimpfer. However, the situation of our exiles remains the same as it was then. My brother and Conrad Zwick have not yet received any response to the petitions they recently submitted. Indeed, if they are more severely exacted for such a large sum of money, this affected injustice will be clearer than daylight, although those who are entirely focused on making a profit by any means have completely lost their sense of shame. Meanwhile, good men are being drained beyond their means and are almost miserably stripped, in which there is no fault except that they cannot resist. But the Lord, I hope, will argue their cause. There are some foreign captains in Konstanz, and it is said that some others, besides those from Lier, are supposed to come on the next Sunday; nothing good is expected.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, eight days ago, early Sunday morning, the colonel with many guards rushed to the vineyards and to the Rhine gate, then rattled with the guards in front of the council chambers (for he had summoned the council late on Saturday evening for Sunday morning), took Eckle and Sigmund von Landenberg with him into the council chambers, sat down, and began to expostulate very harshly and vehemently with the councilors, complaining bitterly about their disobedience, that the councilors went to mass little, some not at all, some left as soon as it began; he said he would not tolerate this any longer, etc. He reminded them of their oath and ordered them to go to mass, stay there until the end, and let it please them, he plowed on for a long time; for Doctor Veltin has long preached against it and scolded the authorities, including the colonel, harshly for being so sluggish in their service to the block and not keeping the subjects to it either.</p>
      <p>Thus, the poor councilors are forced into a corner, and it is thought that soon the same will be commanded to the common citizens. May God in heaven have mercy on this cruel compulsion and look upon it graciously! The king is supposed to come there in mid-August as well. It is said that the bishop is worried that they will take the Ouw from him; but no one knows how the devils are leading the skirmish. May the dear God preserve His own and us among them, amen!</p>
      <p>The other day, the scribe from Pfin, an honest, pious man, said that someone had been with him, pulling him aside, saying that the Frenchman is excellently provisioning Turin; he has also bought over 2000 oxen and is buying more, letting them go out to pasture; he must have something urgent in mind; for the oxen cannot be kept for long, they have already devoured everything. They have also had to thresh all around there and bring the grain into the city. Any honest servant coming from a Confederation, he also takes into the garrisons; otherwise, it is completely quiet, etc.</p>
      <p>In MÃ¼nsterlingen, nuns are supposed to come soon, who will resume the service of God with singing and reading; thus Satan is diligently working everywhere to prevent his kingdom from perishing. Oh, that we were as diligent and zealous on our part!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother, and commend me and mine most diligently to the Lord Christ. Greet your household and brothers with all friends in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, August 5, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I wrote this, not because it is worthy of you in any way, but so that I would not neglect any opportunity to write to you. Therefore, bear with my clumsy chatter.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
