      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, may you be well. I had intended to respond to your three letters with greater convenience and diligence and to send all that I had so far obtained about the Tridentine synagogue; but behold, a messenger has arrived who says he wants to leave for ZÃ¼rich in the morning. Therefore, I write these few things hastily and send what I know you eagerly expect. Consider it kindly if I have not sent it earlier; it is not easy (believe me) to extract such decrees from the hands of the papists. When you have read and copied what you wish, you will give them to my nephews, who will transcribe and send them to other churches, as I write to them. I hope to go to Chur for the Pauline fair; for the brothers call me there to handle many matters of religion. Who knows if I might suddenly fly to you from there? Indeed, I do not despair.</p>
      <p>Martinengo, Zanchi, and Niger greet you, indeed all the symmists (fellow believers) and the whole church greet you. All three are present while I write, and know, Heinrich Bullinger, that you are held in the highest regard by them. I have not yet fully recovered; but I hope that I will soon be freed from the remnants of ill health.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed brother and lord; may the Lord Jesus bless your labors. Pray for me with the domestic church.</p>
      <p>I will respond to your letters as soon as possible. Greet all the brothers for me.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, January 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerio.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Bullinger.</p>
