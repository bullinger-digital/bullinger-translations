    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's commentary on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians. Found nothing offensive in the eleventh chapter. The Frenchman Guillaume du Bellay spoke falsely. The true intention of Duke Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg will soon be explained through action. The rest will be reported by Johannes Zwick. Greetings. Best wishes for the spa treatment. Sister Margaretha Blarer will write herself and send something.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have never been able to repay you, dearest Bullinger. You bind me to you with such new and uncommon benefits. Those very clear commentaries on the divine Paul could not fail to please us greatly, even though I have not yet had the time to read everything. However, we have carefully gone through what you wrote on the eleventh chapter and we do not see why anyone, unless they are extremely unfair or lack any judgment, could be offended by it. Thanks be to Christ, who does not begrudge us so many learned scribes in the kingdom of heaven. May He keep you with us for as long as possible and make you better and altogether superior each time!</p>
      <p>Regarding what that Frenchman, whom you recently mentioned to me, said to you, be at ease. For they are as vain as they cannot fail to be true, as good men, aware of the prince's plans, have written to us. Soon, the matter itself will declare the most Christian intention of the Christian prince. In the meantime, let us diligently support his efforts with sacred and perpetual prayers.</p>
      <p>The rest will be reported by our Zwick, that most pious heart burning uniquely for the glory of Christ, whom, if he were not already most recommended to you, I would commend to you in many ways. Now, by his own virtue, he has long since entered your minds. Greet the best and most learned men Pellicanus, Leo, Theodor, and especially your most holy wife, on our behalf, and commend us to them diligently. May Christ grant that you may bathe happily and wash away whatever impurities have intervened, so that not only strength to the body but also vigor and cheerfulness to the mind, which cannot help but be somewhat dulled by those perpetual studies, may be added to your intellect. Farewell, esteemed and more than dearest brother, remember us before the Lord.</p>
      <p>8th of July.</p>
      <p>My sister herself will write either to you or to Pellicanus, sending some powders, which you should use and be cheered by.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother in Christ.</p>
