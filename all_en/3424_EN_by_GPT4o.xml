      <p>Greetings. Reverend man and dearest brother, I often recite the Homeric verse "A good messenger is also made, when he knows the favorable message," as I frequently experience the inexperience of messengers.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received your longer letter, which I am eagerly expecting. Know, however, that your letters are intercepted with great care by my enemies, in which matter I am angered by their wickedness. I do not mind that both my letters and yours are read; for what do they contain except pious conversations and expressions of great sorrow, with which we are afflicted because of public dissensions and because of the flattery of teachers, which establish idols and confirm the rage of the pontiffs. Lelius faithfully delivered your letters and those of Lascius to me, and indeed the letters of Lascius contained nothing noteworthy except complaints.</p>
      <p>Poland burns with the same dissension with which miserable Germany burns, and I fear that both regions will be consumed by Turkish wars somewhat later. Let us pray to the Son of God, that He may heal the wounds of the Church and preserve some honorable refuges. In the colloquy begun in the city of Worms, after the adversaries' prefaces, they did not wish to return to the debate.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all of you.</p>
      <p>On the first of December.</p>
      <p>Philipp.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
