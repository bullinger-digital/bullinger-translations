      <p>Greetings. Most illustrious man, friend, and brother to be especially honored, although I do not doubt that our Gregory will most fully explain the most miserable state of our French affairs, I did not want to send him to you without a few lines from me, so that you may at least understand that we have by no means forgotten your memory, but retain it perpetually fixed in our minds as long as we live. However, I do not write more because of the utmost sadness of mind, which I have conceived from the nefarious and more than treacherous and barbaric slaughter of so many noble and Christian men in France. Praying to the best and greatest God, that He may finally have mercy on His people. I know that this tragedy will be no less distressing for you to hear than it is for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, and greet your brothers and those serving the school and church with you very much in my name.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, September 8, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Christoph Ehem, Doctor.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety, learning, and virtue, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful servant of the Church of Zürich, and his especially honorable friend. In Zürich.</p>
