      <p>S. I was very close to not writing to you at all, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, because I could not accomplish anything according to my heart's desire, as I am now being distracted by various occupations, which, without thinking of anything like this, I am increasingly and deeply involved in, and almost overwhelmed. I am very grateful to you for your writing; no one has read it, nor have I dared to entrust it to anyone for copying, and yet, since I want to have a copy with me, I have decided to copy it myself by my own hand, which, due to my business, I have not yet had time to do. This is why I have not been able to send it back yet, but I will certainly send it back to you with the next messenger of proven trust. Beza is a remarkably learned and pious man, so it should be forgiven him, as he erred more out of imprudence than deliberate error, especially since the interpretations he gave should be taken in a favorable light. I am very eager to read your response to Count Georg, imploring you by Christ to gladly share it if it is now at hand. From Augsburg, from the letter of our Welser.</p>
      <p>The pope, after making peace with the king of England and thinking that the mockery is now enough, has sent out two cardinals, one to King Philip, the other to the French; they should leave nothing undone to make peace so that thereafter they may deal more unanimously in matters of religion and the Turkish issue. News has come from Rome that on September 17th, there was such a flood in Rome and Florence that many hundreds of houses were destroyed and a great number of people drowned, such damage occurred, the likes of which have not been seen before due to floods, as long as Rome has stood. In Vienna, Austria, half the city is eagerly following the gospel.</p>
      <p>King Maximilian has a very capable preacher who not only teaches the truth but also overturns the papacy; he has a large following. Likewise, the old King Ferdinand also has a preacher who sticks to the scripture; however, he does not touch the abuses and ceremonies, etc. Regarding your dear old brother-in-law Adelschwiler, I think you still know how things are; one would truly like to help him if it were possible; however, the good old man is hesitant, he cannot easily decide what to do or not to do; he will not be free from worries, etc. I also hope that he will be helped to the day, so that he will try.</p>
      <p>They are doing their best in Basel to ensure that he gets by, etc. The good man is also old and incapable, not every service is suitable for him.</p>
      <p>Convey my many greetings in my words to the esteemed men, friends, and brothers there, the fellow ministers and professors of the school, especially to the venerable in every way Peter Martyr, Lord Rudolf Gwalther, and all the others. I wish your entire household to be safe in Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Help me with your effective prayers and the support of sacred prayers before the Lord. Do not hide from me what you have received from Lysmanino in Poland. October 28th.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
