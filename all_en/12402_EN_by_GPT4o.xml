    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's friendliness and goodwill encourage Hochholzer to write to him more often. Hochholzer asks for a kind reception of this letter, especially since Bullinger has already received letters of lesser importance with a welcoming attitude.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The people of Aarau have learned from an uncertain source that an official messenger of the Elector Johann Friedrich I of Saxony has been sent to Zurich with a particularly important letter. They are now caught between hope and fear. The proud and difficult character of Luther does not bode well. Many righteous people hope for better things from Luther and wish for the resolution of the dispute among the Evangelicals, but many also fear that even more dreadful things will come from Luther (although this seems hardly possible), not out of fear for the truth, which remains invincible, but out of fear that the opponents of the truth will rejoice even more over this discord.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [In Aarau] they have also heard about the Ravensburg uprising.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- If Bullinger's duties allow and he knows more details, he should write. This would not only please his loyal Hochholzer but also all the good and pious people who asked Hochholzer to deliver this letter with a reliable messenger. This is only in brief, so as not to burden Bullinger unnecessarily.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Your singular kindness and goodwill, which you have shown towards me thus far, esteemed lord and father, encourage me to write to you more often, even if the letters are of little importance. However, since you have previously received my letters containing matters of no great significance with a welcoming attitude, I now judge that if I write about something, it will not be a burden to you. Therefore, I ask, in accordance with your usual kindness, which makes access to you easy for everyone, that you receive this letter of mine. For there is something that keeps many good people among us concerned; a concern which you can easily remove. What it is, I will explain briefly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We have heard (though from an uncertain or not very reliable source) that a certain messenger of the Elector of Saxony, Johann Friedrich I, was sent to Zurich with a particularly important letter, which should have been delivered to you. We are caught between hope and fear. For the proud, arrogant, and unmanageable nature of Luther does not allow us to hope for anything milder from him. Many righteous people expect better things from Luther and wish him to approach the truth; not because the truth will not endure without Luther, but so that finally the altercations, dissensions, battles, and very serious offenses may be removed from the church. For you know that many are quite offended by this contention among those who are called Evangelicals. Many also fear that something more dreadful may come from Luther, although hardly anything more dreadful can be found or imagined; not because they fear for the truth, which remains invincible, but lest the adversaries of the truth have more reason to rejoice.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, we have received some reports about the uprising in Ravensburg, which were atrocious and would have caused much damage to the good people, had the Lord not watched over and broken the power of the enemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding these matters, I ask, if your duties allow, and if you have any certain information, that you write to us, not because I wish to pry into secrets, but only so that we may hear what is certain and dare to give credence to the matter. In doing this, you will not only do a favor to me, who am entirely yours, but also to many good and pious people who have asked me to write to you about these matters through a reliable messenger, so that I may report back to them if there is anything. All good people will strive to deserve this favor on any occasion. I write briefly; for if there is anything, you know it yourself; if all is fictitious, there is no need to trouble you. I also know that there is no need for many prayers. For your goodwill towards me and the magnitude of your kindness make me promise myself anything from you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will await your letter on these matters, which I ask you to send to me when you have the leisure.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings, both in my name and in my wife's name, to all your household. Farewell in the Lord. Aarau, 17th February 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in both learning and kindness, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, to be esteemed as a father.</p>
