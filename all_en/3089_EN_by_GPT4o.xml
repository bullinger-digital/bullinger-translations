      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus! While I was in Geneva, so engaged in reading in private studies and listening to the sermons of preachers in public gatherings, that nothing seemed to me to be more desirable for that time, both for my own instruction and for the edification of the church; then some English compatriots of mine, exiled from England for the sake of religion and staying in Wesel, sent their letters to me, in which they wrote that I had been elected as their pastor by a majority of votes and by the common and unanimous consent of all, in a free election. Therefore, they earnestly requested through letters, and implored in Christ, that I should neither refuse the office which God, hearing their prayers and directing the votes, had imposed on me, nor delay the journey to them, who were eagerly expecting me. For since the one who was pastor had already voluntarily departed, and the magistrate had forbidden them the use of the sacraments; they hoped that with my coming, they could both have a pastor and regain favor with the magistrate for the free use of the sacraments, or at least hear useful and necessary advice from me. Therefore, having read such letters, invoking God, after consulting with Mr. Calvin and my pious and learned brothers, ministers of our English church, I am now on my way from Geneva towards Wesel: considering their state and condition and my own limited ability, I am persuaded that I ought neither to take up the office of pastor nor to refuse any diligence or labor of teaching. For the office of pastor does not seem to me, nor to others whom I consulted, to be able to be exercised among those to whom the ministry of the sacraments is prohibited: and indeed; what the word of God teaches ought to be in a pastor, I do not yet find in myself; but whatever I have found to be given to me by God, I will never deny to freely and diligently impart to the brothers in Christ who ask, with God's help. Therefore, according to your paternal benevolence towards me, which I have often experienced from our first meeting until now, in the bowels of Jesus Christ, I pray, venerable father, that you may always remember me in your prayers to God, and sometimes also through your letters to admonish and teach me as your son, so that I may better learn to serve Christ and His church humbly, eagerly, and faithfully. As for me, having nothing to repay you, I will diligently strive to obtain all good things for you and yours from God in daily prayers.</p>
      <p>I also pray that you would greet on my behalf Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Bernardino Ochino, Mr. Gualter, and the other ministers of your church, to all of whom I acknowledge myself a debtor for your merits towards me and other Englishmen, for all that I could ever provide to you. Please also convey, I beseech you, my greetings in the Lord to your wife and the whole family, and finally to that honorable matron who served us English, or rather nourished us in one house. May God preserve you for a long time for us for the edification of the church of Christ and for the fight against the kingdom of the antichrist.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, as I was on the journey, on the 4th day of January 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours faithfully in Christ, Thomas Lever.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and faithful pastor of the church of Christ. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
