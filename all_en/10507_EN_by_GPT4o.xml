    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes to Bullinger because he has heard from a friend that Konrad Pellikan has recently translated the Holy Scripture from Hebrew into Latin and provided it with explanations. Asks Bullinger to procure a copy for him and send it through the messenger - an uneducated person who fears being cheated by the printer. Praises Bullinger and wishes to own his works as well, especially the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews and "De origine erroris". Already owns his commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, the Acts of the Apostles, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and the two Epistles of Peter, but wants to have everything. Best wishes. May write more soon.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The reason that has compelled me, an unknown person, to dare to address you with barbaric letters, O wise and faithful minister of Christ, is briefly as follows. A certain friend recently wrote to me from the depths of the Alps that Konrad Pellikan, the faithful and learned interpreter of the sacred language of your church, has recently translated the Holy Scriptures from the Hebrew source into Latin and has added annotations and interpretations to illuminate certain passages. If this is so, as I hope, through Christ himself, I beseech and implore you, a man of the highest renown and authority in the Christian world: Condescend to the use of many brothers and the salvation of our churches and ensure that I receive a copy with this messenger, if they are available. For this messenger frequently travels to and from you. Being completely ignorant of letters, he fears being deceived by the printer's name. You, a man whom all the pious and learned rightly celebrate as given to us by Christ, born for the salvation of the wavering church, comply with the wishes of those thirsting for the doctrine of Christ and through your servant, ensure that we have a true copy. Your sacred writings, which all disciples of Christ handle both night and day, even though the Pharisee murmurs, the world rages, and Satan bursts, ensure that I have them all, especially the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, which you reference somewhere, the books "De origine erroris" and any others that are, as they certainly are, monuments of your Christian spirit and most holy doctrine. What I have are: On the Epistle to the Romans, On the Acts of the Apostles, On the First Epistle to the Corinthians, On the two Epistles of Peter. I desire the rest. You will ensure - for such is your Christian spirit - that I have everything in due time, especially the Bible as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>We seek the glory of Christ, we depict Christ, we will live with Christ as our guide. In this, farewell, live and continue, sir and lord, most highly esteemed by me, even unto death. Soon more, O minister of Christ, if I see that these barbaric, yet Christian, matters are dear to your heart.</p>
      <p>From the Graian Alps, on the fourth day before the Nones of November, in the year etc. 34.</p>
      <p>Bartholom√§us, your disciple in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord in both learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, his unique and reverently esteemed teacher in the Lord.</p>
