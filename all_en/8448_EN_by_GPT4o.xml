      <p>Greetings. I have received letters from your piety several times, most esteemed lord and godfather, to which I have certainly not yet responded; the reason was that I had no one who would return to you. Conrad the pharmacist has delayed his return until now; for he has been received by our magistrate and therefore wanted to prepare all his affairs before returning there.</p>
      <p>Clauser, aided by your recommendation, has obtained a place in our college until something else is provided for him, and it will not be unhelpful for him if he continues to practice among other students. He wanted to return to you immediately; but I advised him to rather make use of the present opportunity and soon subject himself to the common discipline and occupy the place destined for him, but to postpone his return until the next festive days. Hence, he remains here. In the meantime, I have again fallen into my usual illness, and although I have always hoped for better until now, I can no longer deny, whether I want to or not, that I suffer from joint disease; for it has not confined itself only within the limits of my feet, as it used to, but has also spread to one knee and even to my right hand, in which it still resides so that I can barely write this to you with my bound hand. Thus, it pleases the good Lord to chastise me, whose judgments are just and fair, and to prepare me for a greater longing for future life. I am glad to hear that you are in good health. I am sending back to you the letters from Chur and Gallasio. What do you hear about Beza, I ask? You mention danger, but do not explain it; everyone in Geneva is anxious because he has not returned. His wife was also seized by the plague in his absence, but she has recovered again. Otherwise, we have nothing new from there, except that few remnants of the plague remain. I am glad that another has been appointed in place of Ganthner, provided he is confirmed; for hardly will the one left in the city cease to cause them trouble. You know what would have happened here if Sulzer had been allowed to remain here even as a private citizen. Even so, we can hardly guard enough against what he suggests. I also hear that the younger Bovillus has died in Schaffhausen, which I fear may also be to the detriment of that church.</p>
      <p>All is silent from France; I do not have a word, except that our delegates supply money to Solothurn, with which our bloodsuckers are satisfied. They lend the king 50,000 crowns; all of this is sent to Solothurn to certain Solothurners and lenders frequently; it causes great resentment; people are suspicious, they would have preferred gold. They have, as I hear, gravely reproached the delegate for the peace made; but he prudently replied to them, "After all, they have also made a peace in the land," etc. I thank you for the Wittenberg propositions. Dr. Lavater, your son-in-law, sent much more money than he should have; I will respond to him shortly and do what is right. Due to my poor health, I cannot write more now. All friends and brothers greet you, especially Aretias, whom I wish you would write to frequently; for he is worthy of love and does not think badly, at least so that he also understands that he has some value with you. I ask the same from Dr. Simler, Dr. Lavater, and Dr. Wolf, whose letters I see are pleasing to him; I do not dare to ask this from Dr. Gwalther, as he is occupied with other matters.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 16, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zurich, my lord and godfather, always to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
