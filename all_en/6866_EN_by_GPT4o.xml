      <p>Greetings. I read your letter delivered to me by the messenger you sent to Hesse. I greatly approve of your diligence and effort in resolving disputes; if only the followers of Luther were equally inspired by the pursuit of peace! Perhaps we would have more fairness and modesty and fewer disturbances. Now, since the majority are proud of their unjust prejudices and arrogant primogeniture, it is inevitable, in my judgment, that actions in this matter will collapse to the sorrow of the pious. You have often cited in your writings a passage from Eusebius, book 8, chapter 1; I fear that we may eventually experience such an outcome of ambition. I see the discord among the Saxon princes has progressed to the point that, unless God restrains Satan's bloodthirsty instruments, it will cause incredible harm to the church. Therefore, we must pray to God to raise up serious, patriotic, and wise politicians who can apply remedies to the boiling issues. Regarding the Hungarian expedition, I do not know what to expect. Suleiman, a powerful and warlike enemy, has been provoked, whom the Lord has used against us as a rod. We resist with weapons, and hopefully with prayers as well! I am greatly frightened by the disaster at Varna and the fate of Louis. Farewell, my dear Bullinger, and know that I am entirely yours. Greet on my behalf the most honorable men Gwalther, Simler, Wolf, Lavater, and others. Our people are well by the grace of God and commend themselves to your prayers. Heidelberg, August 7, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Stephan Zirler.</p>
      <p>As I was about to seal the letter, a certain noble Frenchman sent by the admiral came to us. He requested that the French churches in Erfurt be considered and that their scholars be admitted to the colloquium; which the Saxons will hardly allow, as they aim to preserve their primacy and impose laws on others, etc.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Church of Zurich, to be pursued with singular love. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
