      <p>Greetings and best wishes. For both the letter and the books, namely the Compendium of Christian Doctrine and the Apologetic Exposition, sent to me, I give you, most learned man, the greatest thanks I can, and I do not see how I can repay such a great favor. For I write either nothing or things that are very childish and only smell of scholastic dust, so I cannot rise higher and send something from my workshop that I consider worthy of reading to you in return. However, if the occasion arises for me to speak with the prince, I will do as you advise, and in such a pious and publicly useful cause, it is fitting for me to act.</p>
      <p>Regarding your son, I have heard from a certain acquaintance of his, whom I once used as a servant, that he is conducting himself honorably in Wittenberg, as are the Collini brothers (whom I had diligently recommended to the most illustrious man, Mr. Philipp, through letters, and he kindly replied and promised that his help and protection would not be lacking to them), and Mr. Philipp frequently and kindly speaks with them. Your son also intends to visit some other schools.</p>
      <p>If in the meantime he happens to come to Marburg, I will make sure that he does not lack any service from me.</p>
      <p>These disputes, which are being stirred up again most odiously, greatly grieve all the pious people I know, as is fitting, and I truly believe that some ambitious minds, like that of Herostratus who burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus, want to gain a name and fame for themselves from these disturbances. Nor do I see clearly by what means these controversies can be resolved and the concord of the churches, which is now so sorely wounded, can be restored. On the 20th of February, I received letters from Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, in which he indicated that some princes are urging that a synod be called for our churches, and that it is extremely necessary, since so many disputes are arising everywhere, for some chosen men to meet and peacefully discuss the doctrine of religion and the order of the churches.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing this, I was moderately pleased and immediately conceived a good hope in my mind that in a synod, if one were called, some way could finally be found to resolve the controversies by which the churches are today being shaken everywhere. And on the 27th, if I am not mistaken, of February, our most illustrious prince sent me a letter, in which he ordered me to arrange my affairs so that I could go to Regensburg in April with the reverend Mr. Johannes Pistorius for the assembly, where a colloquy is to be held with the papal adversaries. Soon after, Mr. Pistorius himself wrote to me about the same matter and asked that we meet before the time of departure, where it would be possible to discuss necessary matters. I replied that I was very pleased with this and greatly desired it, and if he thought it advisable, I would not hesitate to come to Frankfurt, where I knew he was accustomed to go during the time of the fairs, since he lives nearby.</p>
      <p>We both therefore met at these fairs in Frankfurt; but behold, since we became much more uncertain than before about both the synod and the colloquy to be held at the assembly, we could not conveniently confer about anything. For there were more things heard everywhere about those matters that pertain to new dissensions and even open war than those that pertain to the hope of concord or peace. The assembly is said to have been postponed again to another time, and there is even a rumor that not small forces of cavalry and infantry have been gathered in the territories of Trier and Luxembourg, and many think that since the dispute over the territory of Nassau has not yet been settled by an agreement, the prince of Nassau is to be sent into possession by the auspices and arms of the Emperor or King Philipp of England, against the will of our prince. If this is attempted, I fear that the seeds of a new and disastrous war will be sown, and soon all of Germany will rush to arms; for some dare to threaten very harshly against all who profess the evangelical truth.</p>
      <p>From these things, therefore, and the others that are also written to you from elsewhere, it is easy to gather that our churches will not be allowed to breathe a little and take counsel for concord. It remains, therefore, that we all pray with ardent prayers to the Lord Jesus, that he may protect his churches and his little flock, beloved to him, from the machinations of the impious, as he has indeed done in wonderful ways and beyond all expectation, as we have experienced more than once. I also pray to the same that he may restore you especially to your former health and preserve you unharmed for a long time for his church.</p>
      <p>The young men who are now being called back home have always conducted themselves properly with us, and I have not heard anyone complain about them. They have tested their progress in sacred letters in the school by disputing and declaiming, and their efforts have not been unsuccessful, and we would have often challenged them to the scholastic arena if they had been able to stay with us longer. Farewell, most learned man, and worthy of my respect in many ways. Mr. Pistorius wishes to greet you most dutifully in his name, whom I hold in the highest regard, if anyone, in all of Hesse.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt on the day after the calends of April 1556. Your Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my lord to be respected. In Zürich.</p>
