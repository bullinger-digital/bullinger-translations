      <p>Greetings. Maynard seemed to us a good, sincere man and of good example, for which reason we have given testimony, as you have indeed seen. Otherwise, there were things in the confession that somewhat moved us, which we also explained; however, because a sound mind was recognized in him, and the things that moved us were not of such great importance as to detract from the truth, we thought that this old age should no longer be disturbed, after it had been sufficiently disturbed by the most foolish adversaries before.</p>
      <p>But I believe that he has abundantly explained to you everything that we have dealt with him.</p>
      <p>The news is: The Emperor (Kaiser) has ordered the Elector of Brandenburg and Maurice to besiege Magdeburg, and Maurice is already preparing the necessities for this expedition. Having learned of the Emperor's will, he did not wait for the day, but left in the dead of night.</p>
      <p>Count Buren is said to be setting out with an army towards Upper Friesland, to subject that region and Bremen to the Emperor. I have understood from someone from Constance that it is very anxious because the Emperor is trying to impose the Interim, wanting it to receive the priests, wanting the city to be completely open to the House of Austria, and demanding a large sum of money. Furthermore, a rumor has come to the people of Strasbourg (as Theobaldus Nigri and a certain noble Gallus wrote to me yesterday) that all the Swiss have, by common consent, offered them aid and defense against the Emperor; but whether this is true or not, you can know. It is also rumored: that the Emperor has summoned new assemblies for the states in Strasbourg on the first of August; if true, Strasbourg is doomed. In recent days, Caelius has reported that the Angels have routed the Scots in a new battle along with Germans sent by the French and that New Boulogne has been captured and the gospel is continually gaining ground. You know about the tyranny of the Emperor in religion and Ferdinand in the politics of Germany; I have never heard of graver matters; there is a need for many and devout prayers.</p>
      <p>I seek your judgment on the 15 sermons of Michael the suffragan for the restoration of the mass, indeed on the good of the mass. I beg you, do not deprive me of it. It seems to me that the man is a chameleon, speaking against his conscience more than once. It also seems that he has compiled a good part of the Emperor's Interim. The one who delivers this to you, so that I may finally end, is M. Heinrich Pantaleon; last year he was the dean of our academy's faculty of arts, the deacon of D. Wolfius. He seems to love me; therefore, I love him in return. He has never been to Zürich; he wished to visit and speak with you. If you confer anything upon him, you have conferred it upon me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with yours, with Gwalther, Pellican, and Otto. I recently sent letters to be delivered to Blaurer through a student from Zürich, who had abandoned the ways of the revelers here; I beg you, let me know if you have received them. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 21, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zürich, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
