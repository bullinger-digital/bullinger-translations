      <p>Greetings. Hercules has returned to us; he speaks wonderfully of your kindness towards him, especially that of the council and yours. He recounted everything in detail as it happened.</p>
      <p>I noticed that during his recitation, he was particularly enthusiastic, so much so that it was clear he was acting seriously; however he may appear in person, he is especially praised among the Rhaetians for his military prowess; but he is said to be more attentive to the matter than is fitting for the greatness of such a name. But this is a common fault among the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>He earnestly asked me, if I ever wrote to you, to urge you to diligently discuss with Calvin the matter he recommended in person. There are those who affirm that in your senate, the issue of sending aid to France, if requested, has been discussed. Whatever it is, we are eager to know.</p>
      <p>I am anxiously awaiting further news from France. Coignetius wrote and says he expects the secretary at any moment and promises new developments every moment. But he is too brief; therefore, I ask you, who have started this thread, to continue weaving it and to keep informing us about every detail as you have done so far.</p>
      <p>I am hopeful and will no longer give in to anxieties. The matter is in the Lord's hands, who knows various ways to assert His own.</p>
      <p>Thus, when human virtue, pressed by evils, falters, God is usually present with help.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the defeat of Guise will raise our spirits and conversely cast down our adversaries. But these matters will not cease to be of such great importance.</p>
      <p>If Guise had fallen into our hands, the war would have been concluded and this fire, which now seems rekindled and inflamed, would have been extinguished. I am surprised, however, that Condé has sent nothing certain to yours for so long, and nothing at all to ours. I am sending back your matters and indeed wish to inform you clearly about Italian affairs and the acts of the council, nor do I neglect my duty. But as if Italy were closed, nothing reaches us.</p>
      <p>This concern has been taken up by Mr. Hercules, but also by the old Traversius.</p>
      <p>I was expecting Traversius; for the bishop, who is repeatedly summoned to the council, holds the wolf by the ears and needs Traversius's help; he fears that if he stays, he will incur the pope's indignation, and if he goes, he will stir up the hatred of ours against him. Thus he is torn; but it is certain that he is being urged and expected by the council.</p>
      <p>If Condé were to request soldiers, I would wish for it to be expedited. Certainly, the bravest among us would be ready.</p>
      <p>I am indifferent about the speech being printed; I have other speeches with which it might perhaps be joined at some point; but it matters little if it does not come out at all.</p>
      <p>A year ago, I wrote something under a changed name to the primary cardinal of France; Mr. Lavater and other learned men, to whom the argument was pleasing, had read it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gesner had prefixed Greek verses.</p>
      <p>That writing was extorted from me by the mathaeologist P[etrus] Perna with a singular promise, saying that he would publish it at the first opportunity, approved by the Basel councilors. But what? I can no longer obtain a copy nor do I have another, and he has not published it; thus the opportunity has passed. I earnestly ask you to intercede with Mr. Peter Martyr, if he ever writes to Basel, to remind the man, so that he may finally be ashamed of the vanity and lies with which he has so far deceived me. If he does not want to publish it, why does he not return my writing, which I have requested several times, and give it to Mr. Gratarolo, with whom I have corresponded about these matters. I can hardly digest this notable injury from a man of such great vanity.</p>
      <p>But what are these matters to you, who have other things to do than to call my printers to their duty. I think, however, it is important for Mr. Martyr to remind him, an Italian to an Italian.</p>
      <p>These thoughts came to mind after I considered that this speech, if published under a changed name, could have been very well joined with that letter, since both deal with papal power. If Mr. Martyr were to send my speech to Peter Perna with the condition that he add it to the previous ones, it would be a great favor to me; but if not, and Perna cannot, he should give it to Mr. Gratarolo, with whom I correspond by letters.</p>
      <p>However, if Mr. Martyr is too busy to do this, I do not want to trouble you with it. Farewell again. I have changed my plan and will arrange for the speech to be sent through a relative to Gratarolo himself; for Perna has not learned to keep faith. It might happen to me with this speech as with the previous writing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, just ask Mr. Martyr to write to Perna to hand over my matters to Mr. Gratarolo, and I will be satisfied. Farewell, reverend father, and forgive me.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 6, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>What will the English and Scots do, about whom various rumors are spread here? Mr. Augustyn Talp has been sick with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those from Grüsch have made an agreement with another; but he has hired a few servants, and now has a bathing trip to Fideris. He would gladly do his best, but it has not yet once regretted (according to his old custom) that he handed over Zurich. To the most distinguished man with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and reverend father in Christ. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
