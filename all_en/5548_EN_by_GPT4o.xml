      <p>Greetings. If what Mr. Coignetius writes is true, I still do not see what peace could be established. I often recall the saying of a certain foolish German, who, when asked what would be achieved by prolonged wars, devastated fields, burned villages, plundered towns, and walls stained with the blood of citizens, replied: "Peace will finally be made," laughed and said with a chuckle: "But peace was needed while things were still safe and intact, not now that they are lost and ruined." Thus, I am very surprised at what terms of peace could be initiated after so many thousands of our people have been slaughtered, where neither age nor gender was spared. Every time this dreadful slaughter comes to my mind, I shudder.</p>
      <p>Either we had to conquer with Christ or be honorably defeated. But Christ does not know how to be defeated; yet the adversaries have not learned to keep faith, and if peace is made, it will be ruinous for us. But why do I say this to you, who knows all this more correctly and better than I do? Yet, in such a small number of those who understand this, I complain with you. I have often said and repeat again that we knowingly, willingly, and with open eyes are perishing.</p>
      <p>But this is the hand of the Lord, which is stretched out over us. I have not received anything from the council for a long time.</p>
      <p>What is commonly reported, you will understand from Balingket. A certain merchant from St. Gallen passed through here, who came directly from Rome and had many discussions with Consul Tscharner, among other things, saying: there is great mourning in Romania because of the sunken ships or galleys, and nothing is more certain than that they have perished and that it is said the son of the Duke of Florence was on them; there is great fear in those parts that he may have perished as well. The other younger son, who was recently made a cardinal, was stabbed by a relative with a dagger while going to Pisa and has died.</p>
      <p>He says this as truth; how true it is, I do not know. He said further that one of the Pope's nephews, whom he had made a count and had married to a duke's daughter (the consul could not recall the duke's name at the time; in the meantime, I have not met him), was one day fresh and healthy and then dead. The Pope was greatly grieved by this.</p>
      <p>It is thought, however, that it was forgiven him; for the daughter was hostile to him and the weak one not very willing, because the Pope had promised him some land for the wife, and when it came to a decision, it could not be carried out, because the cardinals and Romans, who were attached to the Colonna family, did not want to let it happen. Although I do not have great things, I also pursue these small matters to fulfill the duty of writing and to extort from you in return the French news. When I was next a guest at our lord's during the annual reckoning, the bishop's secretary informed my lord in my presence how Ferdinand's treasurer, whom he has in the county of Tyrol, wrote to his gracious lord, i.e., our bishop, and requested in the name and on behalf of the Roman imperial majesty a large sum of money from him, namely thirty thousand 304 florins, 3 kreuzers (I laughed at the kreuzers). So much he owed to be paid against the Turks, and if he delayed, he would be forced to seize his rents in Etschland, belonging to the lordship of FÃ¼rstenburg. I think he will also request something similar from the prelates of the Confederation, etc. I have nothing else new.</p>
      <p>We wish you and all yours to be well and healthy. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 21, 1562.</p>
      <p>No book by Brentius has been brought to us.</p>
      <p>I will instruct Balingket, if they are available in Basel, to obtain them for us. There is nothing I should prescribe to you; but I would very much like you to be brief in responding and in such a way that he understands he is not worthy of being neglected, for whom much more effort is made by responding. May the trickster with his heteroclite heaven and Democritean atoms be well.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
