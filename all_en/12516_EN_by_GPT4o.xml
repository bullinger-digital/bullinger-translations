    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received two letters from Blarer, the first dated June 8 [No. 2458], which included a letter written by [Georg] Frölich [No. 2453]. However, he is troubled that Blarer has not received anything from [Barbara Winzürn], who was in Zurich because of the inheritance she received from [Agathe] Studler. Bullinger had sent a bundle of letters to the [inn] of Michael Meinrad for delivery [to Constance]. Among them was a letter from Gwalther to Augsburg. Blarer should inquire about them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger regrets that the church in Ravensburg is being reformed in such an unfortunate manner. Blarer should continue to be of service to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Emperor [Charles V] has deceived the Rhenish nobles. His sweet words are poison. He also made many promises to the Swiss Confederates in a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Regarding Blarer's second letter from June 21 [No. 2468]: It is not true that [Bishop Johann von Weeze] was hosted for free in Zurich for 14 days. He arrived in Zurich on the evening of [June 10]. The council only learned of his arrival the next morning. Mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] and some council members paid him a visit as a prince of the empire. They entertained him with two bushels of oats, fish, and wine, without much expense. The bishop said he had been warned by the [Inner Swiss] that the Zurich pastors wanted to take legal action against him because he had declared them heretics; however, he had not done so and never intended to. The mayor then explained to him that the pastors had not complained, but the council would take legal action against him if he were to declare them heretics. In the afternoon, the bishop rode off with his entourage because he wanted to be in [Constance] for the [Pentecost] festival. No one thought much of him; many said the devil had driven him to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer should continue to keep Bullinger informed, as he is concerned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The current letter carrier [...] was not friendly to Bullinger's daughter [...] when she wanted to give him a letter from Bullinger to take to the [inn] "Zum Roten Hus." He was obliging to Bullinger. However, it would not hurt if Blarer generally admonished the carriers, without referring to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger has communicated [Konrad] Hofherr's opinion to Blarer. He cannot do more.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [The Zurich council] will advocate for the Swiss Confederates [for the Schmalkaldic League]. Blarer should strengthen the brothers in Swabia.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have received two letters from you, dearest brother of all, the first dated June 8, in which you included the letter of our most friendly brother Laetus. I am more surprised and very concerned that you say you have received nothing through that woman who went to and obtained Studler's inheritance, to whom, unless I am completely mistaken, I sent a bundle of letters to be delivered to you at the inn of Michael Meinrad. Among them were writings from Gwalther to Augsburg, etc. Therefore, you will carefully examine whether she lost them on the way or what excuse she offers. For unless I am completely insane, I know the bundle was entrusted to her.</p>

      <p>I deeply regret that the church in Ravensburg is being reformed so miserably after so many disturbances. You will not cease to do your duty here. The Emperor has deceived the nobles of the Rhine. He offers sweet words to everyone, indeed he serves them, so that he may kill with poison. He recently promised many things to the Swiss in written letters. I believe it is deceitful (evil conduct).</p>

      <p>I have just received the second letter dated June 21. And it is not true that he was here in Zurich for 14 days or that he was hosted for free. This is what happened: On the night before Pentecost Thursday, he rode in and no one came to him that evening. In the morning, his arrival was announced to the council. It was a wonder that he came. It was advised that the mayor should take some of the council members with him, present him with two bushels of oats, fish, and wine as a prince of the empire, and not make much fuss with him. This was done. The bishop announced that he had been warned in the lands not to ride to Zurich because the preachers would take legal action against him as those he should have declared heretics. He had not done so, and he would never be found doing so, etc. The mayor replied that he had no complaint from the preachers. But the bishop should know that if he declared them heretics, they would be taken up by my lords and not released from legal action, etc., with many words. I do not know how the matter pleased him. In the afternoon, he mounted - he said he had to go home for the festival - and rode off with his entourage, and no one thought much of him, many said the devil had driven him here, etc.</p>

      <p>I desire that you will inform me accurately at all times, for I am very anxious. I fear evil, unfaithfulness, and treachery. Yet we will faithfully pray to God.</p>

      <p>This messenger was not willing when he first came against my daughter, whom I sent down to the "Zum Roten Hus" inn. But he was very willing towards me and behaved friendly. I had already written the letter. It may not harm if you speak with them, that he and others are willing when given a letter. But I would not want anything to be said to him especially and for my sake, and I ask for that.</p>

      <p>I have communicated your opinion to Curioni. I can do no more. God be with you. My lords will deal earnestly with the Confederates.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Strengthen the brothers throughout Swabia. Let us pray to the Lord. God be with you. Given in Zurich, June 22 at night around 10 o'clock.</p>
