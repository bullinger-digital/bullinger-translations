      <p>Greetings. Once again, I have received your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>As for the current situation in Lausanne, I can only write what I know: that the French are migrating there in great numbers from Geneva due to the increasingly severe plague there.</p>
      <p>I fear, therefore, that they may bring some contagion with them. However, I will write to my son-in-law, and once I have confirmed that all is well, I will send your Felix to him. He could hardly be better off anywhere else than with him, especially now that he is freed from the domestic burden of having to support twelve regular students; now he only accepts those he wishes, and I know he will gladly do this for you and Mr. Lavater. While he is with me, I will make every effort to ensure that he continues to perform his duties in every respect as he has begun. I am very fond of him for his honesty and sincerity, and for this reason, he is loved by the whole family, who would like him to stay with us longer if his circumstances allowed. As soon as I receive a response from Lausanne, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, along with all your family, to whom I ask you to convey my warmest regards.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 8, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and godfather.</p>
