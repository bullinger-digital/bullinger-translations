      <p> Greetings. I am deeply and exceedingly grieved by the fall of the English church, my brother in the Lord, venerable one; I would prefer to die a hundred times than to experience such a thing in our churches. The Lord has extended His angry hand upon us many times, as we have deserved, so that unless the Lord takes His own to Himself, I fear we will experience even more lamentable things; our heart has so hardened in wickedness and immense ingratitude towards the unspeakable benefit of God offered to us. O Lord, deliver Your own from such a perverse age, do not allow Your name to be blasphemed any longer. I hope we will soon depart, my brother, to the eternal homeland; may God grant that, for the rest of our lives, we may devote much boldness of spirit for His truth and glory. Otherwise, I am moderately well with my wife and children. My daughter Anna is not yet reconciled with me; perhaps she is not concerned at all. I am told reliably that my counterpart, the pastor in Gauchlingen, behaves very badly and dishonorably; he fornicates so that, as has happened before, an illegitimate child is born. Young Konstantin is excessively proud and wanton; I am very concerned that my daughter is being led astray. </p>
      <p> May the Lord improve it with His grace. The Lord be with you. Farewell with all your own, wife and children. The governor of the castle and city greets you, especially our Hamman. Given in Lenzburg, 10th of September, 1553. </p>
      <p> Yours, Gervasius. </p>
      <p> To the faithful servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, my lord, brother, and dearest old friend, to his hands. </p>
