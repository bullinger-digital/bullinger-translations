      <p>The method to be observed by the lords theologians in pronouncing sentences in the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>Sentences should be derived by theologians from sacred scripture, apostolic traditions, sacred and approved councils, and the constitutions and authorities of the holy fathers. They should use brevity and abstain from superfluous and useless questions and past contentions.</p>
      <p>The order in which sentences are to be spoken will be as follows: First, those sent by our most holy [Pope] will speak, then those sent by the Emperor, and afterwards secular clerics according to their promotions, then regulars according to their order. They will begin on the first day of Tuesday, which will be in the month of September, at the eighteenth hour, with the preceding Monday and the morning of that Tuesday, it is not suitable due to the solemnity of the vespers and the mass of the feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
      <p>License to the most reverend legates.</p>
      <p>The most reverend and illustrious lord legate and the presiding lords, by the apostolic authority granted to them, bestow the faculty and authority to the lords theologians, who are to speak the sentences for the purpose of speaking the truth and refuting and attacking false opinions, so that they may have and read all prohibited books.</p>
      <p>Articles on the sacrament of the Eucharist to be examined by the lords theologians, whether they are heretical and to be condemned by the holy synod: 1. That in the Eucharist there is not truly the body and blood nor the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, but only as in a sign. 2. That Christ is exhibited in the Eucharist, but spiritually, to be eaten by faith, not sacramentally. 3. That in the Eucharist there is indeed the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, but together with the substance of bread and wine, so that there is no transubstantiation, but a hypostatic union of the humanity with the substance of bread and wine, so that it is true to say: This bread is the body of Christ and this wine is the blood of Christ. 4. That the Eucharist was instituted for the sole remission of sins. 5. That Christ in the Eucharist is not to be adored nor venerated on feast days nor carried in processions nor brought to the sick, and that its adorers are true idolaters. 6. That the Eucharist is not to be reserved, but immediately consumed and given to those present, and those doing otherwise abuse this sacrament, and it is not allowed for anyone to communicate themselves. 7. That in the consecrated hosts or particles remaining after communion, the body of Christ does not remain, but is only there while it is being consumed, not before nor after consumption. 8. That by divine right, the people and infants are to be communicated under both kinds, and therefore those who compel the people to use one kind are sinning. 9. That under one kind, not as much is contained as under both, nor does the communicant receive as much under one kind as under both. 10. That faith alone is a sufficient preparation for receiving the Eucharist, and that confession is not necessary for this, but free, especially for the learned, nor are people bound to communion at Easter.</p>
      <p>Canons on the sacrament of the Eucharist. 1. If anyone denies that in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ are truly, really, and substantially contained, and says that it is only there as in a sign or figure or power, let him be anathema. 2. If anyone says that in the sacrament of the Eucharist, the substance of bread and wine remains together with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ or says in execrable and profane novelties of words that Christ is impanated, but denies that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of bread into the body and of the whole substance of wine into the blood, with only the species of bread and wine remaining, which conversion our fathers and the whole Catholic Church most aptly called transubstantiation, let him be anathema. 3. If anyone denies that under each species and in every part of it, the whole Christ is contained, let him be anathema. 4. If anyone says that after the consecration in the admirable sacrament of the Eucharist, the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ are not there, but only while it is being consumed, not before or after consumption, and in the consecrated hosts or particles which are reserved after communion, the body of the Lord does not remain, let him be anathema. 6. If anyone says that the only-begotten Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is not to be adored in the Eucharist with the worship called latria, or to be venerated with external adoration or with festive and special celebration, or that it is not lawful, according to the pious and laudable rite and custom of the holy Church, to be solemnly carried in processions and publicly proposed to the people for adoration, and that its adorers are idolaters, let him be anathema. 7. If anyone says that the sacred Eucharist is not to be reserved in the tabernacle, but immediately after consecration to be consumed and necessarily distributed to those present, or that it is not lawful for it to be honorably carried to the sick or for the priest to celebrate so that he may communicate himself, let him be anathema. 8. If anyone says that it is necessary for salvation and by divine right commanded that all the faithful of Christ communicate under both kinds, or that the Church has erred in communicating the laity and non-celebrating priests under one kind only, let him be anathema. 9. If anyone says that it is necessary by divine right for infants, before they reach the age of discretion, to communicate, let him be anathema. 10. If anyone says that less is received under one kind than under both, or that injury is done to the laity or they are defrauded of the fruit of the sacrament who communicate under one kind only, let him be anathema. 11. If anyone says that Christ is exhibited in the Eucharist to be eaten spiritually only by faith and not sacramentally, let him be anathema. 12. If anyone denies that all and each of the faithful of Christ of both sexes, when they have reached the age of discretion, are bound by the precept of the holy mother Church to communicate at least once a year at Easter, let him be anathema. 13. If anyone says that faith alone is a sufficient preparation for receiving the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, let him be anathema. 14. So that this sacrament of sacraments is not received unworthily and therefore to death and condemnation, the holy synod itself has decreed and declared that for those who are burdened by the conscience of mortal sin, sacramental confession must necessarily precede. 15. If anyone, however, presumes to teach, preach, or obstinately assert or publicly dispute the contrary, let him be excommunicated by that very fact.</p>
