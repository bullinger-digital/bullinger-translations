      <p>Greetings. Recently, Mr. von Stetten relieved me of a very troublesome worry by indicating that you had received the letters from Mr. Haller, which I sent last month. Since I knew you were very eager to receive them, I assumed you would respond as soon as they were delivered to you. When that did not happen, I could only suspect that they had not been delivered to you, which I am very glad to find out was not the case, even though I had given them to a known person. I really have nothing else to write now except that I am eagerly awaiting your letters, with which I can assure Mr. Haller that his were delivered to you; for he has written to me once and again, and has hinted that he is somewhat doubtful. I am all the more expectant because I hope your letters will not be empty in this sad state of affairs, but full of news, especially about the French matters, of which nothing easily escapes you, and the Belgian matters, about which Mr. Haller himself also awaits your letters.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, please convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther, Wolf, and Simler, along with your family, to whom I wish and hope the coming year will be most prosperous. Farewell, my dearest Mr. Bullinger, and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, on the eve of Christ's birth, who grew in age, not in stature, when the whole world itself was his cradle: oh, what a manger! But farewell. 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and especially learned Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
