      <p>Most Serene, High-born Prince, Gracious Lord. Your Electoral Grace, my humble and ready service is always at your disposal. Your Electoral Grace's gracious letter has been well received by me through my lord mayor. First of all, I thank Almighty God, to whom all honor alone belongs, that my work and service are pleasing to Your Electoral Grace. I sincerely pray to the faithful God that He may grant me His grace for His honor and the salvation of many people. Thereafter, I thank Your Electoral Grace most sincerely for all the gracious will and offer, which Your Electoral Grace has expressed to me in the aforementioned letter, with humble offer, that I am always ready to serve Your Electoral Grace in all that is pleasing to Your Electoral Grace and possible for me with God's help.</p>
      <p>However, since I have also well understood from the aforementioned my lord mayor, how great the opposition to Your Electoral Grace is because of the confession of Christian pure truth, and also how steadfast Your Electoral Grace is in the truth with God's help, I have never ceased to pray to God for Your Electoral Grace, that He may strengthen and preserve you, and also protect you from all evil, especially strengthen you in true steadfastness against all opposition. I also exhort Your Electoral Grace to continue, as hitherto, to be comforted and to stand by the confessed truth, since our Lord Christ demands nothing more than steadfastness and, speaking of the last times, says: "He who endures to the end will be saved." He has also foretold us that we must suffer much for the sake of the truth; yet He also promises us comfort, help, and support, and His word and promise are the truth. The world, on the other hand, and what is in the world, is deceitful, perishable, so that man is never in a worse state than when he looks to the world and relies on the temporal. The time of the world and also of our life is short; eternity is set before us, upon which we should focus all our days and strive not to lose it through the temporal. We have many glorious examples of the holy friends of God, who have all overcome through true faith, here attained eternal praise and there eternal bliss. In all these things, above all and without ceasing, our Lord and God should be invoked and prayed through Jesus Christ, the only mediator, that He may grant Your Electoral Grace and all rulers grace and strength for this. I commend Your Electoral Grace to the protection and care of the faithful God and Father, along with the entire principality. I ask Your Electoral Grace to consider this writing favorably and to always hold me in grace. My gracious lord mayor has instructed me to convey his greetings and willing service to Your Electoral Grace and to thank you for all the grace and goodness shown to him by Your Electoral Grace in Augsburg. Dated Zurich, July 10, 1566. Your Electoral Grace's humble, willing servant Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the Most Serene, High-born Prince and Lord, Lord Friedrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Bavaria, Arch-Seneschal and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, my most gracious lord.</p>
