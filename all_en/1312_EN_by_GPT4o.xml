      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letter on the 9th of this month, for which I thank you immensely. Although there are some uncertainties, such as regarding the people of Magdeburg, who are still besieged, and I received this information from a certain soldier who was in the Mauritian camp 14 days ago. Some say that the camp is set up three miles away by rebellious soldiers, but the cavalry is still performing its duty to prevent anything from being brought into the city. Some people are spreading many rumors about this matter; but I hope to receive letters from Leipzig at the Strasbourg fair about all these things. Mr. Schertlin is surprised as to why you have not replied to his letters and does not believe that we have been deceived by the treasurer, nor that Mr. von Heideck has defected, but rather that he is seeking the most opportune and convenient occasion for the gospel's cause. May God grant that all things turn to His glory. Man is deceitful and an excellent craftsman of many words; but we know that man is not to be trusted, for he is a liar, especially those who have sought their own under the pretext of the gospel.</p>
      <p>They say that the King of Poland wrote to the Emperor in these words: "Most invincible Emperor, if you do not cease from the attack on the people of Magdeburg, then know that the Turk will soon make an incursion into Silesia through my kingdom, and he demands this of me, nor do I dare to deny him a safe passage without my own benefit. Therefore, do what you consider beneficial and useful for the Christian republic; nor will I be able to resist him, nor deny it because of the treaty once made with him!"</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt on the Main, the priests wanted to hold a solemn procession on Corpus Christi day and were even dressed in precious garments on that very day, holding relics in their hands, and when the bell rang, the senate sent to them, ordering them to strip off and desist from that idolatry and go to their own homes, lest any insult be inflicted upon them.</p>
      <p>So they stripped off and the wretched ones hid themselves for the entire day, not without grief. Furthermore, the senate ordered all craftsmen to work on that day as usual.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, two priests were found at night in the streets, one almost killed and lost his tunic and almost had his right arm amputated. Some of the priests left the city, saying they preferred to live in the countryside than among that cruel, heretical, and seditious people. Farewell. More soon.</p>
      <p>Basel, 11th June 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear and gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>The latest from Dr. Johannes Gast.</p>
