      <p>Greetings. For several days now, I have not left the house due to the continuous pain in my kidneys that I suffer; therefore, I have not written anything in the meantime. I am beginning to feel a little better now. Yesterday, I received your letters along with these, which I am returning and for which I thank you. What we have, I believe, is written to your senate or is being written now.</p>
      <p>The main point is that the people of Strasbourg write that the German cavalry has advanced as far as Verdun and do not wish to proceed further unless their wages are ready; indeed, Condé lacks funds; furthermore, 4000 cavalry from Saxony (I believe from Lower Germany) are coming to the king's aid; Condé is hurrying to meet the Germans to join them; the king's forces are almost following. These are not favorable news; therefore, we must pray to the Lord all the more intensely, that He may find a remedy for these evils.</p>
      <p>What Beza writes, you will learn from his letters, which he wrote to me these days; once you have read them, you will return them as well as the previous ones he sent.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you; convey my greetings to all the brothers in my name, and especially to those who are of your household.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 7, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
