      <p>Greetings. Three days before your later letters reached me, I finally received the earlier ones which I thought had been lost to us. For when the one who has the other sister in marriage sought Hopper's letters at the Count's, upon seeing the other packet, he immediately laid hands on it. The Count, either out of shame or for some other reason, did not dare to snatch it from him.</p>
      <p>I read your annotations, from which I noticed what you find lacking in our method of teaching. I tried to satisfy you briefly, because the matter itself did not demand a long discourse. I will know how well I have succeeded when you respond. Certainly, I would like to obtain this from you not undeservedly, that you do not entangle yourself in vain suspicions. For I see you laboring in many things in vain, which otherwise have no difficulty, because you interpret most of my things differently than you should. This is due to the opinion you have formed of me, so that you attribute to me things that never came to my mind. Furthermore, while you are entirely focused on defending your own views, whatever they may be, to the very end, you sometimes consider more what agrees with them than what is true. If simplicity pleases you, I certainly do not delight in pretenses or circumlocutions. If you love the free profession of truth, it was never my intention to bend what I wrote to the favor of men. If some have flattered Luther or others, I am not among their number.</p>
      <p>The excellent Musculus knows, even when the wise were afraid, that I have always been free. If it had not been for vain distrust until now, there would have been either no controversy or very little between us long ago. Although I thus disagree with you, I am by no means disjoined in spirit: just as I cultivate friendship with Bucer, so I sometimes freely disagree with him. Therefore, that statement in your letters is too harsh, that things will go well, provided you do not consider yourselves to be regarded as enemies. I do not know from where you infer this. I do know this, that I think and speak of you in a friendly manner. This latter is also known to many who have heard me speak. It may indeed happen that in private letters to friends I have criticized certain things, or have not concealed that things criticized by them were worthy of criticism. However, praise was always mixed in, which both tempered all bitterness and bore witness to a sincere mind.</p>
      <p>Others will judge as they wish. But I will never regret my integrity. If Mr. Blaurer takes up the office offered to him, and Musculus joins the theological profession, I not only congratulate the Bernese church, but I hope this will be a bond of closer union between us. When it is convenient for you, I ask you to inform me about your affairs. You would have had my commentaries on the five epistles of Paul long ago, if I had not thought they were available there. However, because messengers rarely travel from here to you, I feared the transport would be more costly for you than the purchase itself. I now send the second to the Corinthians and the four that follow.</p>
      <p>I have not yet published anything on the epistle to Titus and the two to the Thessalonians. I also send my Response, which is greatly approved by Brentius, which I do not mention to boast before you, but so that you may infer from it how much more moderate he is in the doctrine of the sacraments than he once was. Farewell, most distinguished man and dearest brother in the Lord. May the Lord Jesus always guide you and your colleagues, whom you will greet diligently in my name. My people in turn greet you very much, among whom Gallasius offers you a booklet he recently composed. Many greetings to Mr. Musculus and other pious brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, January 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and colleague, and singular friend.</p>
