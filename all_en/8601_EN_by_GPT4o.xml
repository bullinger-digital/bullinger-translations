      <p>Greetings. If you are well, it is good; we are all well except for Lavater, who still has a fever; on the other day he is well, but he suffers severe paroxysms, not so much from chills as from a certain distress, that dry cold pain; the doctor hopes it will not be long-lasting. I am sending you here the acts of the Chur synod, which Tobias sent to me. Furthermore, yesterday Roset the Younger was with me, who sends you many greetings. He reports that things are peaceful in France and the king is upholding the edict of peace. Finale has been captured by the Spanish, but the French soldiers have partly gone to the Venetians, partly returning home scattered by the same route they came. Moreover, he has learned from prudent men that a great scheme is being secretly negotiated. The Pope, the Spanish, and the princes of Italy think the king is granting too much to our people; for until now he has strongly resisted some who tried to violate the peace either by force or deceit; thus, it is said that the princes of this holy alliance have deliberated to deprive him of the kingdom and substitute him with the Duke of Anjou, and there were secretly with the Duke of Anjou Italians and Spaniards who did not approach the king; however, it is thought that the envoys of the alliance's princes have had secret consultations with him about these matters.</p>
      <p>Moreover, all these things are known to the king, who remains silent and pretends not to notice, meanwhile treating our people with the utmost humanity and has already summoned the admiral to the court several times, who perhaps will go there at an opportune time. Wiss's son, who has only one hand, came from France the day before yesterday; he confirms the same about the peace and the edict being upheld, but adds that when he left La Rochelle, the admiral was outfitting a fleet, but for what purpose he does not know. Besides this, there is nothing new with us.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, hail caused severe damage in Thurgau, starting around Frauenfeld, where it perhaps took away half the vintage; but it was more severe around Bürglen, so that the crops are so damaged that what remains must be cut like hay. Our senate sold grain yesterday for six pounds, I hear it is sold in the market for seven pounds. Tomorrow, as I believe, an edict against drunkenness will be published, authored by the new consul, who, I hear, gave a serious speech about it in the senate and confessed about himself that he was perhaps more fond of wine than he should be, but he is seriously dealing with this matter and acknowledges that unless a remedy is applied, our affairs cannot be safe. May the Lord grant that some salutary repentance follows. My wife and I wish you and yours well and hope you return to us soon.</p>
      <p>We are sending you this French coin and an eel; we were going to send some animal; but the boy here, when he was with you, asked your maid at my command, who replied that you have plenty of both fish and meat. Therefore, we ask that you accept this small token of our goodwill with an even mind and wash happily.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Last day of June. Always entirely yours, Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Girenbad.</p>
