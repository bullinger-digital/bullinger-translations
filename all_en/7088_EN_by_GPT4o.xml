      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although I was occupied with very great and almost troublesome affairs, most illustrious man, I nevertheless thought that some time should be granted to the bond of mutual friendship and goodwill, so that in some part I might be able to fulfill my due duty, especially with a more convenient opportunity assisting my effort. For when the excellent and learned man, Mr. Christophorus Threcius, with whom I am most intimately acquainted, was preparing a journey to you and had recounted many things about your sincere disposition towards me, which I had also previously learned from your most kindly written letters, I took the opportunity and immediately decided to send my letters through him, in which I might visit your health and offer my most ready services. For this has always been and is my sole endeavor, to earn the favor of those who excel in the brilliance of intellect, the fervor of piety, and the sanctity of life. Since this is rightly proclaimed about you by reputation, and your excellent writings declare it more clearly, and finally, your letters kindly written to me exude the same, I considered it a great part of happiness that I might enjoy your most pleasant conversation, if not in person, at least through letters in absence. Therefore, having learned from certain reports that you have enjoyed good health up to this point, I greatly rejoice and give immense thanks to God for such a benefit, and furthermore, I ask that He may deign to grant you the same strength and vigor in the future for the glory of His name and the benefit of the afflicted church, which I do not doubt He will do because of His love and kindness towards the human race. And since I am now occupied with the affairs of the republic and do not have the time to write more (as I said), I have entrusted the rest to Mr. Threcius to report to you in person on my behalf, with this one addition, that if ever my services can be of use to you in this distance of places, I will devote my effort to it, so that you may recognize that you have bound a most grateful man to yourself.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned man, and love me as you are accustomed, and be assured that you are greatly loved by me in return.</p>
      <p>Given from the salt mines of Wieliczka on the 28th of April in the year of Christ our true God 1567.</p>
      <p>Most devoted Andreas Szadkowski, notary of the Wieliczka salt mines.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, an outstanding servant of Jesus Christ, most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, etc., a lord and brother in Christ to be respected.</p>
      <p>Andreas Szadkowski, notary of the Wieliczka salt mines in Poland.</p>
