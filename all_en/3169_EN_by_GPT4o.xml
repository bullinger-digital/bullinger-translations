      <p>Most illustrious man and most esteemed brother. Since I will soon be with you, burdened not only with Prussian, Lithuanian, and Polish affairs, but also with German ones, there is no need to burden you with reading my letters now; I will do so in person. In the meantime, farewell.</p>
      <p>I bid greetings to your household, school, and church. I pray, call to you two Polish brothers, sons of a most pious mother; tell them that I will be present shortly, and that they should conduct themselves in such a way that I can give a good testimony to their mother. If you have any news of Italian matters, I pray, write with this my servant. Farewell and be well, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, on the first of May, 1557.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed brother and lord. Zürich.</p>
