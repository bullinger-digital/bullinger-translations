    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger urged the return of the book [Zwingli's "Complanatio Jeremiae"?], although Comander had already once asked Leo [Jud] to excuse him, as he was somewhat hindered due to his weak eyesight; he will take good care of the book - only Johannes Blasius has seen it besides him - and will have it returned through Margaretha [...], Zwingli's former maid, at the Martinimarkt. He would gladly, when he has time, present his opinion on the matter of Bucer and the Lord's Supper, which Bullinger has described to him; Bucer mixes things up, introduces ambiguities, and follows Luther, who has written unbearably rudely against Zwingli. He hopes that [Johannes] Pontisella can at least stay in Zurich over the winter as a student, because he cannot further his education in Chur; Comander is unable to help him, as his salary has been reduced due to his anti-French stance.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ. I received your letter, dearest brother, in which you first reproach me, though not undeservedly, for keeping the entrusted book for so long. Indeed, I had already asked Master Leo [Jud] through a letter, if I am not mistaken, to excuse me to you, and I had also explained the reason for this delay, namely that due to the dullness of my eyesight, I am almost removed from writing and all study. Your book is safe and clean, and no one knows of it with me except for one Johannes Blasius. I ask again and beseech you, if possible, to allow me to keep it until the Martinimarkt; then I will certainly return it to you through Margaretha, Zwingli's former maid, who will include it in her chest, so that it is safe from any damage. But if this is inconvenient for you, let me know, and I will do whatever you command. You write about Bucer and the Eucharist; you outline the matter briefly, which is indeed the case. I would gladly present my mind and opinion on the Eucharist to you, if I were not currently hindered by business; but I will do so in a few days. The Papists proposed Christ himself to be both adored and devoured; Bucer, however, with his followers, imposes on us a certain mixture unknown to himself and to all. I am greatly amazed at how it happened that such a great man willingly withdrew from clear light into Cimmerian darkness. Luther wrote many things against our Zwingli, but so uncultivated and unclean that he rightly caused nausea to all the pious. Yet Bucer, above all, concedes to his side. You write about Pontisella. I earnestly ask, if it could be possible, for him to have sustenance somewhere with you; I would provide for clothing and books with some friends. For he should not be recalled to us; there is no study or literary game in which he could make progress. I can do almost nothing; for the Lords of Chur, moved by envy, have reduced my priesthood by 34 Rhenish guilders each year, because I continuously oppose the French faction. Help, I beseech you, the poor little one; he plainly has no one except a paralyzed mother. If at least he could stay with you in Zurich over the winter. Farewell, distinguished man. From the ancient court of the Rhaetians, October 2, 1537. Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and esteemed brother.</p>
