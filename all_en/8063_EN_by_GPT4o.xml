      <p>Most revered father, today I received a letter from your reverence and dignity, in which you have greatly uplifted the spirits of many with the hope of better success. We thank you for this message. However, the same people you mention have been steadfast, claiming that triumphal bonfires were prepared in Lyon, but even on the 8th day after the battle, they had not yet been lit. They also affirm that Duke of Guise was slain, and Mr. de Martigues was captured and mortally wounded. From our treasurer today, I hear that there was a very papist merchant, a citizen of Rapperswil, who openly reported in a certain place that the royal forces were inferior and that the Swiss fought poorly. From Italy, there is nothing, not even a hint, about the battle, no sign of victory, and even the crests of our courtiers are becoming more subdued, the clamor and ovation are fading; we therefore expect everything to be contrary. It is certain that the Emperor of the Turks fought most unsuccessfully against the King of Persia and the Muscovite; so affirms our envoy from the fraternal letters of the Turkish ambassador, but now war is being prepared against the Venetians, whom I understand from Mr. Bonetto wish to buy grain here. Our envoy daily expects the secretary and interpreter of his brother, from whom we will draw cartloads of news.</p>
      <p>All who have been greeted send their greetings to you. Last day of October 1569. Your most submissive Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most illustrious and primary Antistes of the city and church of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
