      <p>The day before yesterday I wrote to you, venerable brother, through an Italian who is familiar and a neighbor to me.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received yours along with Sarnicius's packet, where I found letters written by Thretio, which I am sending back.</p>
      <p>Although Sarnicius thought I would learn much from them, I did not want to unseal them, and it will be better for him to receive them untouched.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I recovered that response which I had lost, in which Thretio's diligence pleased me not a little.</p>
      <p>I do not know whether it is expedient to undertake a new work against the disciples of Blandrata, until we hear how the admonition already published with its explanation has been received; for the brevity to which I confined myself does not seem obscure, nor do those rascals object to anything that I have not previously refuted.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one thing may be lacking, to examine the defense they claim from ancient writers.</p>
      <p>Although there is certain victory in this part as well, the work will be full of tedium and annoyance, and the devil has taught them to toss themselves about in these rough places and wallow in these hiding places, so that he might drag us through long circuits of disputes without much profit.</p>
      <p>You know how harsh and rough Tertullian's speech is; certainly, it grates more than it speaks.</p>
      <p>And yet it would be necessary to weave a long volume from there.</p>
      <p>In Hilary, the reasoning is not so difficult, although his speech is very thorny and perplexed.</p>
      <p>If you think anything still needs to be written, I await your advice in this part.</p>
      <p>Nothing is reported about the affairs of France, from which we gather that everything is so disturbed that both our people and the enemies hang between hope and fear.</p>
      <p>Outside the court, the brothers gather their spirits and do not succumb to the pride of the enemies nor are they broken by insults.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and my honorable brother, together with all the fellow ministers, whom I greet most warmly; my colleagues and friends do the same.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us and always bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, June 6, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
