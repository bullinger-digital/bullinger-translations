      <p>Noble, steadfast, especially gracious young lord, my willing service and all good things beforehand. I thank God that He has given me the grace that my Isaiah pleases you and other honorable people so well; may God grant that it also bears much fruit.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as you desire my opinion on whether to allow the papists, because of the alliance, to hold in your city rites or commands and other abominations forbidden by God and therefore abolished by you, never to be taken up again, I say simply that such a thing is in no way to be permitted; for it is contrary to the Reformation. Thus, God may be angered by the fact that we hold so much to human alliances that we, for the sake of men, indeed for the sake of their help, abandon the faith. As soon as Constantine and other emperors became Christians, they removed all idols from the banners, and they also did not want to allow their soldiers, who were still idolatrous, to have their symbols hanging from paganism, nor that they should sacrifice according to their religion in the camps of the Christian emperors. It would soon have caused great unrest and uprisings among the people.</p>
