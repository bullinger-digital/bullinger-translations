      <p>Greetings. I eagerly received everything you sent, most esteemed father, and we give you eternal thanks for this immense labor of yours and your incredible kindness towards us. Even our papists have quieted down a little. But as for what the pope himself may relent from his cruelty, which he exercises through his inquisitors on Christian communities, observe and gather from his printed mandate, which, as there is nothing more savage, so he will not obtain faith and execution everywhere. For it is certainly reported that the Duke of Milan responded to the papal legate, who wanted to impose the mandate of that dreadful slaughter on them, that he neither wanted nor could accept it, as it is of such a nature that similar discord would arise, as the French now feel; that he, as far as he can, will prevent civil wars, not plant them, etc.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Ruinelli, Pontisella, Gantner, and Mr. Karl send their regards to you. 1569. August 22.</p>
      <p>Forgive me; for I wrote hastily by the light of the moon. Oh, how our legate wishes that a soldier need not be sought.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your lordship, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord most worthy of perpetual reverence.</p>
