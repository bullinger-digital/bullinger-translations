      <p>Greetings. Yesterday during dinner I received your letters, my father, for which I am very grateful to you. For, believe me, every time I receive something from you, I feel myself ignited with a new kind of ardor. The boy about whom you wrote to me will be treated by me and my colleagues as if he were truly one of our own.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about that promised colloquy we had already heard before. All good men seem to think the same as you do, namely that this effort will be in vain: if not, I do not see what you expect from those two madmen. For I could never persuade myself that it is possible for Philipp to be dragged here to have such colleagues, if indeed it is true what the rumor about him was spreading, that he has become a little fortress. Therefore, what remains, except that the Lord applies the ultimate remedies to extreme diseases? But the truthful Lord, without a doubt, will preserve His church, even in Babylon itself. This I can indeed affirm to you as certain, that the kingdom of God is now making such progress in at least ten cities of France, and especially in Paris, that it seems openly that the Lord is planning something great there. Therefore, I am not at all surprised that Satan is trying nothing here as much as to block that source near us, from which not just streams but indeed rivers have begun to overflow. Hence, all good men must be more diligent and attentive, to restrain the ambition of some and the incredible rages of Satan with prayers and all means.</p>
      <p>Our annotations on the New Testament have finally been published, the bulk of the book prevents me from sending a copy to you. I hope they will be published separately at some point and indeed much more corrected, for which purpose I especially require your opinion and judgment, indeed even your refinement, if ever you wish to inspect them and in your leisure note something that you think should be corrected or polished.</p>
      <p>We are eagerly awaiting your Homilies on the Apocalypse. It would be a wonder if you finally bring D. Martyr here so that he may finally bring forth those treasures of his for the public use of the church. Calvin, as you know, is most indignantly vexed, consoles himself by writing commentaries on the Psalms, in which work he will indeed surpass himself. May the Lord strengthen faithful workers and bless your holy labors more and more. Our Viret is indeed somewhat better, but his weakened little body terrifies us so much that we are completely at a loss here. Therefore, we earnestly ask you and all your colleagues to also help us here with your constant prayers. Farewell, my father, may the Lord Jesus be with you and all yours with His holy spirit, and may He confirm you daily in His work.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, March 27.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
