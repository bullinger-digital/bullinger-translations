      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand, noble, honorable, especially gracious lord. My dear lord and fellow brother Mr. Rudolf Funk has informed me these days through your honorable letter, how you desire my advice, whether some canonries in Passau, Salzburg, etc. should be assigned to your honorable sons Alexander and Vespasian, and whether your honor might accept them. Since I am inclined to serve Your Honor in this and everything else that is possible for me, I extend to Your Honor my friendly request to accept my advice as it is, in a very simple, faithful, Christian manner. If I were to advise Your Honor according to the world, it is beneficial that the canonries be accepted. Then Your Honor's sons could come to the greatest glory and wealth without work and special costs, also behind the most delightful pleasures of the flesh, although at the same time all reasonable and serious people, who are nevertheless not attached to the gospel at the moment, do not hold much of such canons, as they are commonly called God's young lords, and although they outwardly show them much honor with bows, high titles, and many courtesies, they nevertheless despise, yes, hate such persons in their hearts so much that, when given the opportunity, they express the evil resentment of their hearts. Therefore, what they do in reverence to the so-called spiritual ones, they do either out of fear or hope of a better benefit.</p>
      <p>But if I were to advise Your Honor according to God and eternal truth, honor, and blessedness, I simply say that Your Honor should in no way let yourself be persuaded by anyone to place your beloved children in the dangerous position; for the old foundations were originally established for the good and support of the Christian church, namely that from the donated goods always Christian and learned, also God-fearing men of good conduct would be appointed as servants and teachers of the church, and that the poor needy of the church would be supported, etc. Such misuse of the foundation goods is at this time considered heretical by those who pursue their matters more according to their own will than according to the truth. And if Your Honor's sons were all learned, so that they could preach the word of God or interpret and read the holy biblical scriptures in the church of Passau or Salzburg or Eichst√§tt, etc., and thus be rightful beneficiaries of the church goods, they would in no way be accepted by the chapters of those places and much less be regarded as the poor of the church. Your Honor would also not desire or allow such a thing to happen under such a pretense. Therefore, if they were accepted by the mentioned cathedral chapters at the present time, they would be accepted in a completely papal manner, either that they should read their canonical hours according to the order of the Roman church and pray for the living and the dead, or be maintained there as poor needy noblemen. But this last point is a pretense of those who want to bring the church goods into their power under a temporal pretense. I also do not know whether the arrangement can stand with the common, right understanding of the church goods, unless it is a matter that special foundations have been made freely for the nobility. But if they were to earn their canonry by singing their hours and praying for the living and the dead, Your Honor now thoroughly knows that such is in many ways contrary to the holy gospel of Christ Jesus. We read much more in the gospel of Matthew that the Lord has spoken: "You hypocrites, Isaiah has prophesied well of you and said: This people draws near to me with their mouth and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men," Matthew 15. And again in Matthew 23, the Lord says: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation." Therefore, Your Honor can well understand that you cannot place your beloved children in such foundations without offending God and themselves, also their own blessedness.</p>
      <p>I remain silent here that they would be bound with oaths and vows over time to many ungodly things, that they also later, when they come of age, because of the accepted canonries, can no longer come to holy matrimony, but are thereby driven to shameful whoredom, of which St. Paul writes, saying that no whoremonger will come into the kingdom of heaven. I remain silent here about the misery with the illegitimate children, of whom Your Honor would be called grandfather, etc. When then Your Honor's beloved sons would be cast from one into the other through the just judgment of God (may God protect them), it is well to fear that they would say little thanks to Your Honor, their lord father, and all those who helped them into this unfortunate state. Moreover, there is the great and dangerous concern that after Your Honor has committed your own flesh and blood to idolatry (for it can be made known with the divine word that idolatry is practiced in many ways in the foundations), that the spirit of opposition against the holy gospel might come into Your Honor and compel you to defend the vile, idolatrous priesthood. And since the high cathedral priests of this world are quick and cunning, it is believable that they offer Your Honor such canonries so that Your Honor can speak less against the priests and their abuses, as you have committed your own children to them and placed them in this wretched order. All of which and much more Your Honor can assess better than I can describe.</p>
      <p>When one then also considers the worldly and spiritual laws, it is found, in some places, that they also do not advise Your Honor to place your sons in the foundations. For in Novellis Constitut. 3, Emperor Justinian orders that the patriarch and priest of God in Constantinople should diligently ensure that the income of the churches is not wasted through intercession and human favor, nor given to those who otherwise have a living, and that they should ordain everything for godly uses, etc. In the spiritual laws, however, there is a canon taken from St. Jerome to Damasus, 1 quest. 2. clerics: The clerics should be kept from the church goods; but those who have enough to live on and yet accept and enjoy what belongs to the poor, truly commit a robbery against God, and through the misuse of such goods, they eat and drink judgment upon themselves, etc.</p>
      <p>But that so many and high persons possess and so miserably misuse the church goods against these divine, worldly, and spiritual laws does not make their case any better, nor themselves any more fortunate in soul and body, nor the Turks any weaker. May God have mercy on us and grant the high persons such minds that they rightly believe in the holy gospel of Jesus Christ and lay down and root out their abuses, so that God's wrath over our sins and especially over the great robbery against God may be appeased and His grace obtained. So now also, through God's grace and enlightenment, many pious, holy, and learned people are pressing for an evangelical reformation, even among you in Bavaria, and if Your Honor were to cast your beloved sons into the abuses and idolatry against which people cry out, Your Honor can assess how grievously you would sin before God and diminish yourself in the eyes of all honorable, God-fearing people. Those who have advised wrongly in the time of ignorance before the recognition of the truth and acknowledge their lack have some excuse before the world and are worthy of being considered well and friendly in the reformation. But those who hide in this darkness in such clear light have little excuse before God or before men. God Almighty, rich and merciful, still lives and gives us abundantly what we need, He will grant Your Honor that you may raise your beloved sons and children well and happily without and outside of such means with honor. May He graciously provide for your concerns in this and everything else, amen.</p>
      <p>In whatever I can serve Your Honor, I am willing, I commend myself at all times to Your Honor's friendly favor and love. May God keep Your Honor at all times in His grace.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich on the 28th day of May in the year 1556. Your Honor's always willing Heinrich Bullinger, servant, etc.</p>
      <p>To the noble, honorable lord Pankraz von Freyberg, etc., Bavarian court marshal, his gracious lord.</p>
