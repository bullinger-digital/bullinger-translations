      <p> Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, yesterday the plague first seized me, and that same night, the boy Johannes Rudolf. I feel the pestilential fever, which torments me. We are deprived of the help of doctors; therefore, I flee to God alone. Meanwhile, what torments me is this: my wife, in a most afflicted state of health, has not spoken for three days. Consider whether the Lord has visited me, who is blessed forever and ever; to Him, I commend myself and all mine from the heart. Farewell. This in Chur, August 31, 1566. </p>
      <p> The most delicate little boy, the youngest, also seems destined for death; for he has slept the whole day unusually. - I leave behind a ruined republic; for the dregs remain, and the wisest among us die. You will see wonders if you live. When they accept the next citizen upon death, the newcomers will spread the gospel from Chur. If you live, encourage the survivors to have regard for religion in this. Pontisella still lives, and my colleague Johannes Gantner also lives, etc. May you be well forever, etc. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile, my son Johannes Rudolf is dead. He lay for exactly one day and one night. The youngest little boy is also weak. Agatha, my wife, has been without speech for many days now; yet there is hope for her recovery. It attacked the two little boys and me in one night, and it pains me greatly; showing blisters and sores; there is no rest. Pray to God that we may be patient. I have not written to my father-in-law Collin; tell him, etc. </p>
      <p> To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his and in Christ reverend father. Zurich. </p>
