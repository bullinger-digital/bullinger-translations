      <p>Peace and... through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Greetings. From your son-in-law, indeed your son, and my old disciple and as if dearest son, I received your letters along with those of Mr. a Laski, which were most delightful to me and the other brothers, and rightly so; for how great an addition is made to the kingdom of God if in the vast kingdom of Poland, Christ the Lord is received. And indeed, the heavenly Father must be prayed to, as Mr. a Laski himself requests, to grant grace to His own and the power to assert and expand His kingdom.</p>
      <p>This good news, which you have written, I will send and share most willingly.</p>
      <p>As for what you ask, that I retain towards you the same spirit I have had until now, there is no need for you to doubt, my most friendly and esteemed lord and brother; for I am who I have always been, who can and should forget myself more than your merits towards me. But much more must I insist on this from you, that you continue to love me and do not lend your most religious ears to the slanders of my ill-wishers; for there are some who sell themselves under the name of brothers, but in truth are enemies not only to us but also to the cross of Christ the Lord, liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies no less than those Cretans against whom Paul inveighs. Therefore, I beg you again and again to protect your Caelius against such people, who loves you, reveres you, and observes you as a parent with all yours according to his own modesty. My wife and daughters send their greetings to all yours and wish them all good things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most loving lord and brother, and greet yours also in my name. Basel, January 20, 1559.</p>
      <p>Caelius Secundus, always yours from the heart, wrote. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
