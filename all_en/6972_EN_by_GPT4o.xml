      <p>Greetings. For a long time now, I have received no letters from you, most esteemed lord and brother in Christ, and I confess that for an even longer time, I have sent none to you. I know the just cause of your silence: many and holy occupations; nevertheless, I fear that something may have happened to you otherwise than I would wish. Certainly, on my part, there is no other reason than that nothing worthy of writing has presented itself. To this, the scarcity of couriers has also contributed. What news is circulating among us, you will perceive from the attached note. Now, at the beginning and progress of the coming year, I pray and wish for you and yours the greatest health from the Lord God and our Father, and at the same time, I send this little gift in the name of New Year's presents, according to the custom long established among friends and hitherto usual for me; I ask that you consider it kindly. I also ask, since I have often received letters which you sent to Mr. David Hug and others, whether the same write back to you, please let me know. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg, December 27, in the year 66.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg von Stetten... to the learned lord... of the Church of Zürich..., lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
