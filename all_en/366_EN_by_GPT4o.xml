      <p> Greetings. You may have wondered, most learned man, why it happened that I did not visit you upon my return from Bern and did not inform you about the matters conducted there. So, I will first respond to the first point. Dr. Haller urged me to leave the route to Zurich on the right and head to the Swiss Baths, and from there directly to BÃ¼lach, where I was to visit his mother and present the instructions given to me. I obeyed my friend, especially since there was nothing to report to you about my affairs, and if there had been anything, Haller himself promised to inform you diligently. Now to the second point. After I heard from Haller about the salary of the school and the disposition of the Bernese council, which wanted me to come to them immediately, not to wait until the first of February, nor to negotiate with me for several years, nor to bear the cost of transporting my belongings there, seeing that the condition was not in my interest, I did nothing in front of the council, although my Haller greatly desired it. You have the whole business, for the sake of which I undertook such a journey. When I came to Kempten on my return, by chance and beyond all hope and expectation, the council of that town hired me for an annual preaching position. Meanwhile, while I was on my return, the people of Augsburg had also called me, which letters I found upon returning home. The people of Kempten had preempted them, so I excused myself to the people of Augsburg; however, I promised to serve them after this year is over. Thus, I am now spending the fourth week in Kempten quite peacefully and sincerely, except that God has mixed a most bitter cup for me; for He has taken from me my dearest wife, leaving behind three young children. I have experienced nothing more bitter in my entire life; all my ways of living have been disrupted by this event. </p>
      <p> I would have also written these things to Haller, if the courier, in his haste, had not barely allowed me to write this. Please inform him of these matters and ask him to either have our Epitome printed or return it with this messenger. Laetus left Augsburg and now lives in Kaufbeuren; therefore, if he intends to send anything to him, it would be in vain to send it to Augsburg; however, if he wants anything to reach me certainly in Augsburg, he should send it to Dr. Gereon. Among us, papist rites and masses are held in the temple. I have nothing to do with those rites or the mass. </p>
      <p> Impart your advice to me, whether in this time of difficulty or rather perversity, you think marriage should be pursued again. Farewell with everyone. Greet Dr. Musculus and Gervasius and others, if there are any who wish me well. Given on December 11, 1548, in Kempten. </p>
      <p> Thomas Naogeorgus or Kirchmayer. </p>
      <p> To the well-learned and honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the congregation of God in Zurich, my kind, dear lord and friend. Zurich. </p>
