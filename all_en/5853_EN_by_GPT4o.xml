      <p>S. P. D. Since, dearest sir, I knew that I would do something pleasing to you if I sent some letters to your excellency, I therefore did not want to omit writing something to your excellency through the merchants who are going to the Frankfurt fair, and to frequently recall that kindness bestowed upon us, even though I had nothing particular to write. But lest I seem completely ungrateful and forgetful of the benefits bestowed upon us, let your excellency know that by the grace of God we are enjoying good health. However, for our teacher Lorenz, the air is not very healthy; for he was ill. We have heard no news from Poland that we would judge worthy of writing to your excellency. Therefore, I ask your excellency not to accuse me of negligence in writing, as I was hindered by studies. I have nothing more to write to your excellency. I wish your excellency to be in good health.</p>
      <p>Given in Leipzig on the 25th of August in the year of our Lord 1563. Your excellency's most obedient son, Andreas Czikowski.</p>
