    <p xml:id="regest1">The church of Lausanne is still plagued by this [Calvinistic] spirit. It proves to be so cunning and sly that unfortunately, many will fall into its net. A piety and a very sensational self-mortification are feigned, so that the people of Lausanne could be taken in by this blasphemous doctrine. This hellish demon brings (as if he had never left!) the angel of light [Satan] into the hearts of the people of Lausanne and sows the weeds of his false belief among the seeds [of true faith] that God once sowed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Among those [possessed by the demon], Pierre Viret, the Antistes of the Lausanne church, takes the first place. He had claimed that the passage about Christ's ascension in Luke [Lk 22, 69] was compatible with the real and bodily presence in the Lord's Supper! When André Zébédée, the head of the Lausanne scholarship college, contradicted him [in a colloquium], he accused Zébédée, so that Zébédée had to answer to the Bernese [council]. Viret's further godless and outrageous statements will not be elaborated here, because Comte hopes to report on them personally in Zurich soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">John Calvin, the head of the Geneva church, promotes this new adversary Viret to the detriment of the faith. Not too long ago, he dared to write the following about the highly learned and blessed Huldrych Zwingli: "Some make every effort to leave Zwingli's [doctrine] untouched. But his view of the Eucharist was wrong because it opposed the true benefit of the Lord's Supper." So far Calvin. How heretical and blasphemous this is, the leaders of the Zurich church should judge for themselves. Moreover, they should consider something to curb these unfortunate demons [with the help] of the Holy Spirit of Christ!</p>

      <p>To the doctors and bishops of the Church of Zurich, Béat Comte sends greetings. That impious spirit does not cease to sift us and attack our churches in wondrous ways. It is so cunning and deceitful, so astutely and cleverly evil, that I greatly fear it may lure many of our people into its net. It feigns piety and a certain remarkable mortification of the flesh to persuade our people of its impious doctrine. That hellish demon, as if he were an angel of light, insinuates himself into the minds of our people to sow the weeds of his impiety among the seeds that the Lord once sowed.</p>

      <p>Among them, Pierre Viret, the bishop of Lausanne, holds the first place, for when André Zébédée, the head of the Lausanne college, dared to resist him to his face, he was summoned to Bern by Viret himself and forced to give an account, because he had dared to oppose Viret's assertion that the passage in Luke about Christ's ascension into heaven did not contradict the real and bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. I will omit writing about many other wicked and unheard-of things he asserted, as I hope to discuss them with you in person soon.</p>

      <p>Calvin, the archbishop of Geneva, supports this new adversary beyond belief, who not long ago dared to write these words about the most learned and blessed Huldrych Zwingli: "Some are entirely devoted to ensuring Zwingli's salvation. However, his opinion on the Eucharist was false and pernicious, as he disrupted and scattered its true use." These are his words. How impious and blasphemous they are, you, venerable bishops, must judge. And consider how to resist these impious demons with the Holy Spirit of Christ.</p>
