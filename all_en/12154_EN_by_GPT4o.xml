    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has indeed not written to Myconius for a long time, but he sends the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] in the well-translated Latin version by [Rudolf Gwalther]. Bullinger sent the German version [“Warhaffte Bekanntnuß”] to [Johannes] Gast. He hopes that Myconius stands on the side of [the Zurichers] or the truth. - Myconius can learn more from the letter written by Bibliander in the name of all [Zurichers] to him and Markus [Bertschi]; [the Zurichers] want to join their forces with those [of the Baselers]. - Why does Myconius not share anything about his works? Bullinger heard that he published a catechism [“Institutio christiana” by Johannes Oekolampad]. If Bullinger behaved in such a way, Myconius would feel sidelined.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have not written to you, my dear Myconius, but now I will converse with you more extensively through the book I am sending. I know you take more delight in Latin than in German. Therefore, I am sending the Latin version. I sent the German version to Gast, in case you also wish to see it. The translator has beautifully expressed the meaning everywhere. We hope that you will be on our side, or rather on the side of truth, and that you will not disapprove of our work. We hope we have responded modestly and sincerely; but we would gladly hear your judgment.</p>
      <p>Bibliander has sent more to you and Markus on behalf of all of us; for we love you and wish to join our forces with yours.</p>
      <p>But how is it, my esteemed brother Myconius, that you send me nothing of what you produce? I hear you have published a catechism. If I were to act in such a way, you would soon suggest that you are less loved and cared for. May the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 14, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, his ever-loving and esteemed brother.</p>
