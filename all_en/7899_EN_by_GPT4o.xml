      <p>I am sending the letters of the most illustrious Dr. Erastus, which were presented by three students who will soon be sent to you in ZÃ¼rich by the school authorities. However, something happened to me with your letters that should not be kept silent. A letter of the same form written to me by the same Erastus was lying on the table with other letters. A most honorable lady was present, who interrupted me as I was almost finished reading the letters of Dr. Jetzler. While speaking, I opened the letters, which I believed Dr. Erastus had sent to me. But behold, when I inadvertently opened them and briefly glanced at the first lines, I realized they were not meant for me, and upon inspecting the heading, I was indeed horrified and saw that they were yours. Therefore, I ask for forgiveness for the mistake; for I immediately, not without great distress of mind, closed them again, and believe me, I fully understood nothing of what they contained. I also did not want to conceal this, lest you suspect that the letter might have been opened by someone else. Dr. Erastus writes to me about the remarkable and glorious, yet bloody, victory of the Count Palatine. The same is confirmed from Chur and Nuremberg. I fear that the victorious Count Palatine in France may cause similar disturbances in the church as Illyricus did with his associates in the Netherlands; but these matters must be commended to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
