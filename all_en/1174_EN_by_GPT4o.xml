      <p>Most illustrious man, when I had already handed over the bundle of letters to the messenger to be delivered to Chur, behold, your letters arrived with the manuscript about the Council of Trent, etc. Thus, you have filled me and the other brothers with the greatest joy. I will immediately translate what you have written into Italian and will undoubtedly publish it. We gladly heard the rest of what you wrote; but I will respond more fully a little later. I earnestly beg you to inform the most illustrious Count that I have received his highness's letters with the greatest joy and will soon respond and send some other things to him. Farewell, most excellent man, and commend me to the entire school and church. May Christ our Savior keep you from evil.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the Ides of February 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
