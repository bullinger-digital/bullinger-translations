    <p xml:id="regest1">Zwingli's widow [Anna, née Reinhart] has died. He learns from France that the Emperor [Charles V] intends to move to the Netherlands in the spring, that Duke [Charles] of Orléans is to marry his daughter [Maria] and receive the Duchy of Milan, that the Archbishop of Rouen [correctly: the Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne, Robert de Lenoncourt] has become a cardinal, and that [Pope Paul III] is also obliging everyone in Spain [through appointments]; the latter has married his son [correctly: his grandson, Ottavio Farnese] to [Margaret of Parma]. Bedrot writes that in Strasbourg, Bucer is expected back from his journey to Luther and to [Landgrave Philip]. In this restless winter, plans are being made everywhere against the Protestants, which will be executed in the spring; he has heard that captains, who were previously in Bavarian service, are recruiting soldiers in Ingweiler [Alsace]. The threats of the Imperial forces regarding the Duchy of Guelders do not frighten Duke [William] of Jülich; he may reach an agreement with [Anthony] of Lorraine, who is asserting claims. Myconius writes [No. 1208] that the clerics of Minden have proposed the bishops of Cologne [Hermann of Wied], Trier [Johann III of Metzenhausen], Münster, and Minden [Franz of Waldeck], the Duke of Brunswick [Henry IX the Younger], and Georg Schenck [of Tautenburg] as executors of the imperial ban, and that there are rumors that [King] Ferdinand, [King Sigismund I] of Poland, and the Hungarian Voivode [John I Zápolya] would meet in Vienna, and in another place also the Emperor, [King Francis I] of France, and the Pope, to negotiate the suppression of Protestantism. The Anabaptists in Lower Germany are restless again. In view of these omens, he is pessimistic about the future of Protestantism. He asks for news. [Heinrich] Brennwald had his son Hans Jakob demand the ten guilders for [Sebastian] Uriel [Appenzeller] from his niece [...] Rubli, but she refused the payment, arguing that she had promised her support not for the education of the boys, but only for the apprenticeship; Bullinger considers this an excuse but has agreed with Brennwald to give her a deferment until October 16. Greetings and a request to do something against the excessive gambling and card playing; in Zurich, serious measures are now being taken against it.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. We are all well here, thanks to God, except that Zwingli's wife has been gravely ill for several weeks, but finally, in these days, she has miraculously passed away to the Lord. Good men write from France that the Emperor intends to move to the Netherlands in the coming spring, that the Duke of Orléans will marry the Emperor's daughter and become the lord of Milan, and that the Archbishop of Rouen has recently been made a cardinal, so that there are now 12 cardinals in France. In Spain, he similarly acts to bind everyone to him. He has given his son a Florentine widow as a wife. - Bedrot writes to me on December 14: "We are expecting Mr. Bucer any day now, who left for Luther and the Prince of Hesse a month ago." - They think that in the last ten years there has been no winter more restless than this one; for plans and practices are being agitated everywhere, which will erupt against the Lutherans in the spring. Today, indeed, I hear that in the village of Ingweiler, under the rule of the Counts of Bitsch, soldiers are being recruited by those captains who have so far received annual pensions from Bavaria. The Cares are indeed beginning to move. What will happen, the Lord knows. The prologue of the story is displeasing. The Imperial forces are threatening the Duke of Jülich greatly over Guelders. He, however, relying on the loyalty and power of his own, fears nothing. He may come to terms with the Duke of Lorraine; for he claims some right to Guelders. Myconius writes from Basel: "The clerics of Minden have recently asked the Imperial Chamber in Speyer to give them executors of the ban: the bishops of Cologne, Trier, Münster, Minden, the Duke of Brunswick, Georg Schenck, the Emperor's vicar in Friesland. There is then a rumor that Ferdinand, the Pole, and the Voivode of Hungary will meet in Vienna, elsewhere the Emperor, the French, and the Pope, to seriously discuss the suppression of the Lutherans. The Anabaptists in Lower Germany have again stirred up a king; but he is said to have been captured and beheaded." See, my dear Vadian, under what auspices this year begins. You can guess what will happen. I fear nothing at all for myself, indeed for us; I only fear our ingratitude. To die is not miserable; but to oppress the truth, and that because of our merits, and to recall the yoke of the Antichrist upon the necks of our grandchildren, indeed our children, that is far more miserable. May the Lord have mercy on us and spare us for the glory of His name. Farewell, and if you have anything, share it, as you have done so far.</p>
      <p>With Mr. Provost Brennwald, I have half agreed on the 10 guilders to defend Uriel. He has sent his son Hans Jakob to the Rubli, who is his sister's daughter, to the little house. She has answered that she has promised nothing to give, to raise the children, but only when one of the boys grows up, to give a door to learn a craft. Besides, she is not in a position to give anything now. The provost, who also gave me the first answers, which I write to you, has given me this answer. I am very dissatisfied with it and have thought it is a pretext so that nothing will come of the matter afterwards. On this, the provost has agreed with me: until October 16, she will be in her youth. He is of good hope that he will be able to arrange for her to pay the 10 guilders by then. I will not spare my diligent service for this; although I would have preferred if she had given it now, so that she would not make any excuses then. I hate such benefits. But I cannot do anything about it. As they give me, so I write. God willing, it would be better. Greet the brothers preachers for me and help them, so that the game of dice and cards does not prevail and break out. Our people have just seriously stopped it and are punishing all those who have played, etc. January 1, 1539. Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
