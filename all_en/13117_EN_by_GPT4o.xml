      <p>I did not have time to write more due to the departing messenger. I wrote this almost standing on one foot.</p>

      <p>Farewell, therefore, by the grace of Christ, and when you have time, do not hesitate to write to me. St. Gallen, the third day before the Nones of November, in the year 1547.</p>
