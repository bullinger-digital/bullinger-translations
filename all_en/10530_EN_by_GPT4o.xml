Laments their absence at the [Constance] discussion, their attacks on unexamined Lutheran writings, and their avoidance of a comparison that cannot be done solely in writing, for which he has already sought out the Swiss three times, twice of which were Bullinger.

      <p>Grace and peace, dearest and esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have read your confession, but how necessary it would have been for us to converse, for which reason I have brought so many brothers here in this stormy time! The confession is satisfactory in all respects, even the interpretation. However, you must teach others how it aligns with the views of others. You admit that you have not seen the Lutheran writings - but where are they in the church? - and they are being attacked in the meantime. Unfortunate me, who cannot obtain from you a friendly discussion on this matter! The Lord knows what I seek. May He be with you, of whom I will always take account, and I will not peddle the word of the Lord. You know how gladly the fathers once met. Who am I or any men that you should fear for your faith from us? I beseech one thing: Until you have fully resolved to hear us, do not judge us, and do not condemn the work of concord we strive for until you have understood the cause from both sides. Matters of this kind cannot be settled by writings. I have already followed you three times, twice to you, and I could not obtain a proper discussion. This pains me more than I can express, because it is against the laws of true charity and the examples of all ages. Nevertheless, I honor and love you in Christ, and I still hope that you will not deny me the opportunity to meet with you.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers, and act with fear and trembling. Certainly, God does not allow us to disdain Him in any men. I earnestly impress this upon the opposing party as well.</p>
      <p>Constance, 18th of December.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother.</p>
