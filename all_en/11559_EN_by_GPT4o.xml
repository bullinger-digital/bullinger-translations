    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses concerns about the intention of the Zurichers to recall Christoph [Rotacher] from Basel already; a stay abroad brings more than domestic education, as can be seen with Otto [Werdmüller], [Johann Jakob] Ammann, and [Konrad] Gessner, and it is not good for young people if they - as is customary in Zurich - marry too early. [Christian Wirth and Konrad Suter] have departed without a greeting, allegedly to Marburg. Grynäus has become rector. Musterings are taking place against [Sultan Suleiman I], who was provoked by [King] Ferdinand, and the nobility is meeting in Ensisheim; the Turk is said to have threatened Pope [Paul III] to come to Rome, and King Ferdinand has issued a mandate against foreign military services. News from the Imperial Diet [in Regensburg] has already been sent by Grynäus. Greetings. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is said to be at a spa in Wildbad, which seems to contradict the report [by Rudolf Gwalther].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I hear that you are considering recalling Christoph [Rotacher] after a six-month period. This does not seem timely to me; for he is now of such age and stature that he cannot return without shame and remain. It is fitting for someone of this age to know the ways of men, to see and hear many and various learned individuals. You know how greatly this benefits, once someone has acquired judgment, to see and hear everything for his own and the country's benefit, which I certainly do not doubt is the case with him. If Otto [Werdmüller] had stayed at home and had a teacher, he would never have turned out as he is now. The same can be said truly of Ammann, Gessner, and all others. A monk may be found very learned, but only among his own, because he has never left the threshold of his monastery. Staying at home has its time, and so does being abroad. These things should be considered, in my judgment, by those who are responsible for the care of youth. I now remain silent about your custom of marrying them off as soon as they reach a certain age. How harmful this is to their minds and growing bodies, I need not say, especially to you. Moreover, a moderate mind will not spend more money abroad than at home. Even if he spends more, he easily compensates with virtue and the increase of learning. Therefore, I wish that you, with your wisdom, would inform others so that they refrain from recalling him and others of good hope until necessity compels, since so far it has not been regretted that you or yours have stayed abroad for some time. You have certain talents among you that are quite promising, but because they have never left Zurich, it is surprising how inept they are when they are among strangers. We do not boast lightly: A man who has never left his homeland is a goose, and likewise, he is like bread not baked. But you can consider all these things more rightly than I can write. Therefore, do what you know and farewell.</p>
      <p>Two others have recently left, but we do not know where to. Neither Grynäus nor I were greeted by them. Christophorus says that Christian said they would go to Marburg.</p>
      <p>Furthermore: Lord Grynäus has become the magnificent rector of our university.</p>
      <p>Everywhere, musterings are being held against the Turk, whom no one provoked except Ferdinand with his ambition. Within eight days, a meeting of the nobility will be held again in Ensisheim. There is a rumor that the Turk has sent such a message to the Pope, that he wishes to visit his palace this summer. Ferdinand has issued a most threatening mandate that none of his people should venture to foreign lords.</p>
      <p>I would send what was recently written from the Imperial Diet, if Grynäus had not already anticipated me. Farewell in Christ with yours. May Theodor and Pellicanus fare well. There are those who say that the Duke of Württemberg is bathing in the Wildbad, which I am surprised at, since we understood otherwise from yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 9, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
