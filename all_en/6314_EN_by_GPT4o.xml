      <p>On the Duty of a Christian Man in Times of Plague</p>
      <p>If you were Italian, I would indeed doubt whether they should be offered. For Italians flee from such letters, which come from infected places, just as they do from the plague itself, and I do not think Zanchi himself would have wanted to open such letters [...] [...] he is a Frank, not an Italian, and nothing could have happened to him more desirable than your letters. As for Zanchi and our conversation, I cannot deny that I desire greater fortitude in the man; however, he anxiously fears for himself and the minister of Plurien, his relative, who left the church for many weeks, and he excused him in many ways.</p>
      <p>We had agreed among ourselves that each would express his opinion in writing; which I did, addressing both German and Italian speakers.</p>
      <p>Some Italians read it and were greatly pleased; but when I sent it to Zanchi, he took my writing most indignantly, and he is ashamed of the opinion he defends tooth and nail, because it is most absurd, and yet he has initiated some kind of defense. He calls mine, which are drawn from more sincere theology, mere fallacies; he will make an effort to make all my fallacies known to everyone.</p>
      <p>What do you want? He wrote most bitterly.</p>
      <p>Italy has had only one martyr.</p>
      <p>Since I see the man's nature and do not wish to be the author of disturbances and have long known the Italians, I replied most kindly and amicably and allowed him to change in the writing what offends, and even to suppress the writing entirely... I will make an effort to ensure everything is peaceful.</p>
      <p>I have enough enemies among the papists; I do not need domestic and internal ones... As for our matters: the envoy of Philipp returned to us the day before with a fairly large cavalry. It is not Angusola; for Angusola was sent to the Swiss in Freiburg, where there are those who think he will come after the festival. The one sent to us is said to be a Knight of Rhodes; so the consuls think, because he bears the cross of the Knights of St. John on his chest; he is Spanish. With him came that Ascanio, whom you know, I think he is called Marsus, and at the same time Adrian, who was first brought here from Salices.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I wrote extensively to Hercules; I proposed many difficulties. I urged him to consider more rightly for himself and his own; for these things cannot be attempted by him without great danger; he should consider what Philipp's attitude towards religion is and what the eternal peace can achieve.</p>
      <p>But he obstinately persists; he goes on about the Rhaetians negotiating with both lords. Thus he would like to have both as friends, so that he could exploit both.</p>
      <p>But in vain, as I hope, he attempts this.</p>
      <p>Philipp has promised his son an annual pension of 1000 crowns; they do not like to let it slip from their hands. You have a brief summary; what will happen in the future, you will hear in due time.</p>
      <p>Chur, in the year 1564, November 27.</p>
