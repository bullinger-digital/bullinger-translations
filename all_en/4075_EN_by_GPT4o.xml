      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written to you for a long time, my father, is not due to a lack of topics or messengers, especially since so many new and astonishing things have been reported to us in the meantime. Rather, it is because after the death of Heinrich, about which it was unnecessary to inform you, there has been such a remarkable variety of events that nothing but uncertainty and ambiguity reached us. Now, however, I will briefly inform you of the state of French affairs.</p>
      <p>You will learn more about these matters from the person delivering this letter to you.</p>
      <p>The Guise brothers have divided the kingdom among themselves in such a way that nothing but an empty title is left to the king. The cardinal is in charge of the treasury and all jurisdiction, while the other brother is in charge of military affairs, effectively making him the constable. Navarre, to whom the administration of the kingdom rightfully and traditionally belonged, although greeted and urged by many churches not to neglect such a splendid and divinely offered opportunity, and although openly mocked by the Guises, has nevertheless agreed to everything and confirmed by his example Christ's saying: It is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Thus, the cardinal effectively reigns, hated by all, but also feared by all, proving the old proverb true: The French are foolish. They have borrowed four hundred thousand crowns from the Duke of Ferrara, as they themselves are not abundant in gold. They are also expecting troops from Germany, using the Scottish war as a pretext, but many suspect that they are openly seeking the royal diadem. From this, you can easily infer what storm threatens the churches, at a time when some semblance of freedom had appeared. For the cardinal is no longer content with threats, but openly pursues what he began under Heinrich, as our patience has sharpened his fury. Therefore, he no longer dares to threaten only certain individuals, but everywhere proclaims that he will destroy the entire faction, cities, and peoples. Philip, on the other hand, rages so much that you would say Heinrich only played.</p>
      <p>It is said that among the Flemish, the Macedonian law has been renewed and is now actually being enforced, if it can be called a law, which provided that if anyone were accused of treason, not only he but also all his relatives would be guilty and condemned along with him if he were convicted. However, we hear that an exception has been made, so that if the relatives are papists, they will be strangled before being burned. These things have been written to us about Philip by a person not entirely unreliable, and if they are true, you see that there will be hardly any safe place for the faithful. For impunity has been promised to those who denounce their relatives.</p>
      <p>What the same Pharaoh is preparing against the Spaniards, I think is already well known to you. Among the Piedmontese, the Waldensian churches expect nothing milder from Charles's pupil, the new prince, who is hungry and intent on seizing every opportunity to gather money, and also a vassal of Philip. The widowed queen, admonished by the Parisian church with very serious letters, had given some hope, but now she flatters the cardinal so much that it is clear nothing joyful is to be expected from her. Thus, the Parisian church is almost entirely scattered, as it is not even safe to hide at home, with many lists already intercepted, and the audacity of the impious raging so much that anything is now permitted to them. In the remaining churches, except for a few in the jurisdictions of Toulouse and Bordeaux, everything is still quite calm. Meanwhile, all the ministers continue bravely and hope beyond hope.</p>
      <p>We are often consulted on whether it is permissible to rise against these enemies, not only of religion but also of the kingdom, especially since according to the laws, the king himself has no authority on which they can rely. For there is no shortage of many Scaevolas who are prepared to redeem true freedom even at the cost of certain death, if a just call appears. So far, we have responded that the storm must be overcome with prayers and patience, and that He will not fail who recently showed by such a miraculous example not only what He can do for the sake of His church but also what He wills.</p>
      <p>They have so far obeyed this counsel.</p>
      <p>They earnestly ask that all churches, and especially yours, which is almost the only one celebrated in Switzerland, remember them in public and private prayers, which we do not doubt you will diligently do. In Calabria, a distinguished man, Ludovicus Paschalis, who had gone there from Lausanne at the request of the churches, has been captured, and these churches themselves are now in danger with many already captured. May the Lord comfort them and us as well, so that when I finally come to you, He may strengthen us in due time. For what else do you think they are plotting, but to destroy that city, believing that with its fall, everything will be beautifully accomplished for them? The new duke is already reported to have crossed to Lyon towards Nice. It is well that we are so despised by them that they do not even consider us worthy of being addressed.</p>
      <p>For in this way, they certainly free us from great trouble. Meanwhile, by the grace of God, I seem to observe not only no disturbance here but also much firmer spirits than ever before. We will therefore await whatever the Lord will give, and, as I hope, we will endure it relying on His goodness rather than on any human beings. Our Calvin continues in his usual manner, and Viret is also well, except for his eyes.</p>
      <p>Recently, Mr. Haller passed through here, but without greeting any of the brothers, which we had not expected.</p>
      <p>Many fevers here have taken away many children, and some of all ages, among whom we count with great sorrow Robert Estienne, a man of incomparable diligence and singular integrity, whom we accompanied to the grave three days ago. Henri Estienne, whom he named as the sole heir among his sons, has succeeded him, and we promise ourselves much from him if the Lord preserves him. As for the rest, our little academy is growing daily with moderate success, and I am sending you its statutes. There are also some other matters concerning the Parisian church that you will learn from the person delivering this letter to you. For he has come to us from that very church, and therefore will explain everything to you as an eyewitness. He is traveling to you on our advice, and therefore I ask you, my father, to assist him there with your authority and counsel, that is, to continue to be like yourself in helping a pious and foreign man. I would urge you more on this if I had not already experienced your piety and humanity, not only towards friends but also towards myself, more than once.</p>
      <p>I wish the same to be testified to the rest of your brothers and colleagues, whom I hold in great esteem in the Lord, and to whom I would have written individually if it had been possible. As for the rest, I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may keep you safe and sound for His church, and bless your labors more and more. I ask you to convey my greetings to Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gwalther, and the other esteemed brothers in my name. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 12.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zurich and my most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
