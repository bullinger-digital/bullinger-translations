      <p>Georg Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, dear friend. We have received your letter, dated April 22, and we are pleased to hear that Margrave Albrecht has expressed himself amicably regarding the properties that were demanded from those of St. Gallen, according to the common Confederates' directive. We also hope that His Grace will not seek anything rashly or unlawfully; as you well know, in such proceedings and cases, it is often not possible to foresee everything. Ulm has not yet surrendered. As they have previously been a cause of ruin and all burdens to the empire and religion, and have thus shown themselves everywhere as enemies of God, this unruly people now want to hinder, as much as they can, the hopeful salvation and restoration of all freedom and true religion, to their own ruin; for they do not want to believe without a sign and first give a gross reason to make themselves poor people. After suffering damage, they have sought the princes, and it is expected that they will now surrender. Regarding Duke Moritz, we will not withhold our trust that he has been with King Ferdinand; however, he (considered to be well advised) did not let himself be dazzled by the peacock's tail, but held his ground on this side, and has thus departed from there and is traveling back up, and it is expected that upon his arrival, we will hear something good with God's help. We thank the two mayors Lavater and Haben for their greetings and send them our greetings and good will in return. If we knew more news to write now, we would share it with you. Likewise, we expect to hear from you and them at any time. Although we are currently overwhelmed with business, which often prevents and hinders us from writing against our will, and thus we cannot always write. As for the situation with Überlingen and their surrender, you now also know well. Regarding the princes' proclamations and other booklets concerning this war, we have had few copies and have had to send what we received unavoidably. We are working to seek more; those that are due to us will be shared with you for your benefit. We did not want to withhold our gracious response to your letter and are inclined to your grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Schaffhausen, April 27, in the year etc. 52. G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
