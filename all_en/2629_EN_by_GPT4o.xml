      <p>Greetings, Doctor and most pious pastor of the church, I am very mistaken in my intention, as I look more at the public cause than the private one. I received your letters dated March 22nd on April 2nd in Strasbourg (Straßburg), which I entered the day before and returned the day after, and nothing troubles me except that I see the hope of rescuing my family from France almost cut off. However, when I wrote to you at the beginning of March, I had recently received letters from my wife advising me to seek the king's permission for her to come to me, and also from a notable printer who also wished to come to me from France if a tolerable condition could be provided for him. And at that time, I had already spent a whole month in vain trying to establish a school here. Therefore, seeing a more suitable and safer place for the printer in Strasbourg than here, and confident that the Senate of Strasbourg, after experiencing my diligence, would write to the king for my family's departure, I wrote to friends in Strasbourg, as I also informed you. But now the matter (which was hidden from me) ceased to be intact at that very moment; for Lord François Baudouin had made himself accepted into the position I had in Strasbourg, and my friends almost resentfully wrote back accusing me of inconsistency, because I had recently sent Baudouin to them, whom they had accepted according to my recommendation. I certainly had called him from France, asking him to be my substitute in Tübingen with the consent of the prince, whom I had named him to. He was one of my principal scribes twelve years ago, who recorded my more important writings and edited them with learned speed, whom I later nominated in Bourges (Bituriges) as a professor of law and was accepted according to my nomination and taught there with praise for seven years. I received his letters in Tübingen asking for any honorable condition (to escape idolatry) in Germany. I was going to give him better opportunities (after I dealt with the Duke of Württemberg in September), so that he would be my substitute, and I wrote to him at the end of September from Tübingen that I had acted in his favor, and soon after the victory of the papacy in the school, Vergerius and other friends urged me to stay, and a very convenient residence was offered, and I would have stayed, if I had not already sent letters from Bourges to Baudouin, whom I did not want to deceive. He accepted the position I had from the University of Tübingen and came here on February 10th, whom (as I had written back to him) I wanted to keep at my expense at home until (which was soon to happen) he received the duke's letters. He said he would meanwhile seek Basel (Basel), then Strasbourg, from which he wrote to me that he was waiting for the duke's letters, so I was thinking of nothing less than that he had changed his plan or was pretending something else without informing me first. If he had asked me or indicated that he preferred the position in Strasbourg, I would have clearly written to Strasbourg in his favor and not only recommended him so that he would be received with an honorable pension in the meantime at the inn. I did not want to write back to those complaining letters from friends, but on April 1st, I personally showed that I was pleased with Baudouin's reception, but would have been more pleased if I had been forewarned. For I had always openly said that I would return to Strasbourg if the hope of establishing a school here promised by the princes failed, and I was not inconsistent in my purpose, but because I did not want to change, I was caught. I could have stayed in Strasbourg without that professorship and been more fully supported by my consultations than here, which I would have done if the people of Strasbourg had been willing to write to the king for my family's departure: when I understood that this could not be obtained, I returned here again to negotiate with the convening princes at the count's wedding; but these are now postponed from May to August. Farewell. May the Lord keep and prosper you for the growth and protection of His church. Montbéliard (Mömpelgard), May 5th, 1555.</p>
