      <p> I recently wrote, most honorable man, that I would be so far from renouncing the son of Cholini and myself, that I would admit no one else to my table, for which reason I also looked after your stipendiaries and Colino himself with another professor of rhetoric here, a good man, whose absent wife I imposed them upon with the hope that I could persuade her husband upon his return to keep them; but indeed it turned out otherwise. For he assured me of the lack of resources necessary for their support and asked me to provide elsewhere. However, since I could not advise them better, I finally said that if it pleased them, they could try with me, which I would also do; perhaps, if they remembered their duty, I would retain them and they would desire nothing else, if I treated them according to the modesty of the money they paid, comfortably enough. When this condition pleased them, I received them at my table, rented three heated rooms with their chambers and four beds, provided chests and tables and bookcases and other things in abundance, as these are added by me to each dwelling, so that those who live there, students, do not have to buy them, each paying thirty florins for everything, valued at 15 bazen, and one thaler for washing and daily preparation of the beds. And so they still act with me, knowing that I cannot tolerate any petulance, insolence, drunkenness, or laziness, wherefore they are also more modest, sober, and diligent, so much so that if they continue to establish the order of their lives and studies in this way, I dare to promise about each of them that they will become good, learned, and extremely useful and honorable men for the churches. Therefore, if your decision still stands to send us your son and indeed to have him live with me and live by my frugality and discipline, I promise your kindness all faith and effort and more than to many others. With these few words, farewell with your whole household and all good men. Given in Marburg, November 26, 1553. </p>
      <p> Wigand Happel, yours sincerely. </p>
      <p> As for public lectures and the promotion of their studies, they have nothing at all to require except this, that, as their study of theology and languages is as well provided for as possible, so nothing is lacking here for them to learn the arts except time; for they fear that they may be recalled sooner than they have completed their course. In this matter, I would advise you to be more generous and indulgent than usual and, if possible, to do without their service to your church. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy of all, Antistes of the Church of Zürich. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
