      <p>Greetings. You can imagine, most reverend father, in what anxiety I have been these days, after reading the German letters, which I am sending along; you will indeed find them very difficult to read (they were written by Georg Carlin, who writes very poorly), yet I wanted to send them to you to give credibility to my account. In summary: Prince Condé was surrounded in a meeting and struck by the dagger of Guise, with 300 falling on both sides. This was affirmed by the one who spoke to Carlin (we believe it to be Dietägium) and was sent from Trento to Germany by post.</p>
      <p>I beg you, father, to free us from this worry and anguish. It is indeed unlikely that these things were announced sooner in Trento and Germany than in Solothurn; but what do we not fear as lovers? Or what do adversaries not dare? Then he adds in the letters that it is certain that Ferdinand's army sent against the Turk has been destroyed, including 400 horsemen. What you have commanded cannot be of greater concern to me; I have written to several places at once.</p>
      <p>Balingketus has also promised his efforts individually; meanwhile, I will have spies here among my papists. Vergerius returned from Chiavenna yesterday.</p>
      <p>I have not yet met the man; you see with what praises old Maynard adorns him; what I foresaw from the watchtower and predicted for those churches, the matter testifies, etc. There is no need for you to return either Augustine's or Carlin's letters; however, tear them apart.</p>
      <p>A colleague says that Vergerius reports the pope is recruiting an army in Italy. Another came from Venice, who reports the same.</p>
      <p>Besides, nothing new is known.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, with all your people.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 18, 1562.</p>
      <p>Hastily after the burden of sermons.</p>
      <p>Your observant.</p>
      <p>I return the copies of the letters.</p>
      <p>I am grateful; I read them with pleasure; they are very Latin, but I also copied them. To the most esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and patron, to be greatly respected.</p>
