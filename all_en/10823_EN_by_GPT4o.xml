    <p xml:id="regest1">In the case of the priest Umendum, who spread the rumor that the Mass would soon be reintroduced in Zurich, two honorable persons were interrogated; further statements are less credible, as the witnesses are Catholic. The Bernese have captured Chillon Castle. Asks for news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Revered, gracious, dear sir, I have well understood your letter concerning the priest Umendum and its contents. Regarding this matter, I inform you that I have interrogated two honorable persons under oath, and one of them stated that the priest Umendum said to him: "How do you like it that the people of Zurich are going to reintroduce the Mass? It is not more than two men who are inclined towards the council and citizens, otherwise, they would have reintroduced it." To this, the person replied: "I do not wish that to God." The other person I interrogated said: "How do you like it that the people of Zurich are going to have the Mass again? Therefore, I have had prayers said in the church for it to happen." And many other useless words were spoken, as he is a wicked bird. I have more testimonies, which I do not dare to trust, as they are all of his faith. But I will continue to investigate further.</p>
      <p>At the moment, I do not know of any new events to report to you, except that my lords have captured Chillon Castle with great honor. Praise and thanks be to God Almighty! However, I hope your lords are well informed about this.</p>
      <p>I ask you, if there is any new news, to inform me.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Löwe and all who are dear to you for me. Nothing more, may the Lord God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated on the 4th day of April in the year 36.</p>
      <p>From me, Benedikt Schütz, bailiff of Baden, your willing servant at all times.</p>
      <p>To the pious, revered, wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
