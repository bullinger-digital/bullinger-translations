      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I do not wish to trouble you with many words, most esteemed Bullinger. I sent three letters to the last fair; whether they have been delivered, I do not know. Now I am sending clothes for the girl, and I wish to know how she is doing. I also wish and pray that, if she does anything worthy of correction, she may be chastised. Furthermore, she should not become accustomed to idle leisure and laziness, but to girlish tasks and frugality, and when the time comes for me to send money, may your kindness write to me. The illness (thank God) has subsided; its fierce voracity no longer finds sustenance; almost all the youth and the pride of the city have been taken away. We will also send clothes to Titus; his paternal home has not been clean until now, and therefore we have delayed. If you have anything from Augsburg, I pray that you write to us. No one has yet been appointed in place of the late Johann Blasius of blessed memory; I will endeavor to have Philippus Gallitz reinstated in his place. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the sixth day before the Kalends of September, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
