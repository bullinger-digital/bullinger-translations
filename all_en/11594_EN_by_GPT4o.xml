    <p xml:id="regest1">Grynäus is critically ill; pray for him! Jakob Lemonius suggested in a letter to [Nikolaus] Episcopius that Myconius or Bullinger should dedicate a writing on the Christian state to Johannes Rubeus, his German study colleague, who has access to Duke Cosimo of Florence; this could fully win the Duke over to the Gospel. Myconius cannot comment on this in detail now, but he feels that caution is advisable. Furthermore, Lemonius reports that after Pope [Paul III] destroyed Perugia and subdued Ascanio [Colonna], he now threatens Duke [Guidobaldo della Rovere] of Urbino; this shows what he would use Swiss mercenaries for, should he obtain them. A papal legate, a bishop, is said to have been hanged at the behest of this Duke. Myconius cannot write more due to lack of time and his grief over Grynäus. Regards.</p>

      <p>S. Grynaeus is critically ill. You and all your people should pray for him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Jakob Lemonius, a Swiss doctor of philosophy and medicine (whom I do not know), writes from Bologna to Episcopius with these words: "Johannes Rubeus, a German, a learned and Christian man of no small authority with Cosimo, Duke of the Florentines, often communicates with the prince about our religion. The Duke, being pious above others and humane, delights in hearing about new matters. If you could persuade Mr. Oswald Myconius or Bullinger, or even both, to publish a book encompassing the essence of the Christian republic and dedicate it to Johannes Rubeus - in this matter, as Rubeus has often discussed with me very familiarly (for we have pursued common studies until now), we hope the prince will come to the knowledge of the Gospel, who is already not so far from the goal, and we trust to gain great favor with him, because afterwards we will dare to ask him more freely for those things which we feel will be to our advantage - if you do this, you will bind Lemonius to you forever." This was written to Episcopius, who transcribed it for me to read and keep.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I sought someone through whom I might also send this to you, but no one appeared except these little women. Hence, there was no leisure to add anything else during the very short time they were here. However, I will not conceal my advice: I think nothing should be written unless we first converse with Lemonius through letters, except for some booklet by another author, in which the requested matters are contained, until he makes us more clearly aware of what he wants; for certain dangers seem to me to be lurking, about which I cannot write now due to the disturbances concerning Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>He adds in his letters, which is for the Swiss to know: "We have no news of new matters here, except that the Pope has destroyed Perugia and subdued Ascanio, and now threatens the Duke of Urbino." From this, you understand how he would use Swiss soldiers if they were given.</p>
      <p>They say that the Duke hanged the papal legate, a bishop. When the leading men of the court asked with what honor, if any, they should treat the legate, they say the Duke replied: "Let him be hanged," and he was immediately hanged.</p>
      <p>This is all I could write, not more, both due to time and because of the grief over Grynaeus. Farewell with your people and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, July 27, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, in his Lord.</p>
