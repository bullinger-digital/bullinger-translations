      <p> Greetings. From Musculus, you will receive much, especially about Laetus, whom those new orders of usurers, now in power in Augsburg with the favor of the Emperor, could not tolerate under the single name of piety. However, our Musculus is leaving for Zürich with the chief scribe of Lindau, a prudent and pious man, who was also expelled by some people more fond of the Emperor than of piety. But soon he will be received honorably; for no one has anything that could be charged against him in the name of any crime. He could have been great in the Emperor's court but did not wish to. I commend him to you in many ways. As for our common cause, Bullinger, I would very much like you, since you are in a position that holds the first place among us in both authority and power, to be vigilant day and night with your people, lest certain ones sow [Greek] among your people and indeed in your city, who do not cease to look back to the pots of Egypt and, as rumor has it, favor Sylva so much that they would desire nothing more than for the sylvan, that is, papist religion to be indulged in your city, if not entirely, at least in some part. The people of Constance have feigned for several years and have greatly deceived the magistrate. Therefore, see to it that there are not those among you who, for the sake of their own advantage, think far differently than they profess with face and mouth. I would indeed wish that every opportunity for friendship with the Cantons be sought, but with the law of religion intact and corruptions rejected, which they admit with excessive greed and almost no shame, not only now but also pursue, to which I would indeed wish to apply a bit, unless perhaps we think that certain things must be endured and concealed for the present, rather than disturb the otherwise more than sufficiently fluctuating harmony with new pursuits. Money wants to have the hellish plague. </p>
      <p> May God graciously grant that the dearly and arduously obtained freedom of our fatherland be dearer and more honorable in our hearts than vile money. Farewell and support Musculus. I wish all yours and mine to be safe in the Lord. </p>
      <p> St. Gallen, the 10th day of September, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most renowned church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and friend. </p>
