      <p>If you are well, most distinguished and esteemed Lord Bullinger, it is well; indeed, I and my whole family are quite well by the grace of God. However, it has been a long time since I have written to your kindness, and the reason is that I had nothing worthy of writing, just as I do not have now. Therefore, I ask you to excuse me.</p>
      <p>Now I thought I would come there and had indicated the same to you by letter. However, the reason why this does not happen is the daily business by which I am pressed.</p>
      <p>If therefore I do not fulfill what I promised, you will forgive me, and after the upcoming fair of Saint Paul, if the Lord keeps me safe until then, I will certainly visit you with the rest of the assembly of pious and most learned men, having postponed any business that could delay me. In the meantime, if my son needs clothing or any other things necessary for the preservation of health or the advancement of his studies, I ask again and again that you take care to assist him. However, when I come after the Pauline fair, I will pay off any debt incurred in my son's name and will again make an effort, even if no one reminds me, to satisfy our Lord Lavater for Dussio. Furthermore, today, as soon as I arrived, I met our Lord Johann Fabricius, and he, having shown your letters, informed me of what Lord Gessner desires from me; but I was informed too late, since I have the little work at home and, if I had known, I would certainly have brought it here with me and sent it to him. But what cannot be done now will be done when I visit you; for I will bring it with me.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write now, and therefore I am brief. Farewell, most excellent lord, and keep me and mine always recommended to you.</p>
      <p>I also pray that you greet your most honorable wife and the rest of your household in my name. Given at Chur on November 21, 1557. Do not allow, I beg you, my son to lack clothing or other necessities; for I would rather suffer a financial loss than a loss of health. Again, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Friedrich von Salis. To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and patron, always to be highly esteemed and respected. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
