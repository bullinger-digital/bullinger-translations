    <p xml:id="regest1">[The four students from Zurich] continue to live in poor conditions; although he is grateful for the helpfulness of [Stiftsverwalter Heinrich] Nüscheler, the funds delivered or promised by Froschauer and Egenolff are not sufficient. He has completed the first of three books of his "Monomachia Davidis" and wants to include his "Epistolae heroinae" in this work; he is considering possible dedicatees. Eobanus [Hessus] has died; Lonicerus wants to have the epicedium, which Gwalther composed for him, printed. [Philipp] of Hesse has fled from Kassel to Marburg because of the plague; Emperor [Charles V] is said to intend to come to Worms; rumors report unrest in the Five Places - God's judgment could also strike the [evangelical Confederates] allied with them.

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I believe I wrote to you quite extensively about my affairs recently, most esteemed father; however, I cannot refrain from informing you about my affairs again, especially since I do not doubt that my matters are dear to your heart.</p>
      <p>We are thus living here in the usual manner, namely poor and meager, with all hope placed in the generosity of the school authorities; for as far as I am concerned, I have nothing else to hope for. I wish they would consider this as well as you or I do and not compare me with others, knowing that I am deprived of all assistance from both parents and relatives. But there is no need to repeat this often.</p>
      <p>Your letters have given me hope regarding Nüscheler's benevolence, who, if he continues in this way, will surely find that he has not bestowed this benefit on an ungrateful person. I will indeed strive, as much as I can, to meet both his and all of your expectations of me. Please encourage and ask him to be more accommodating in assisting me. You wrote about Froschauer intending to lend money. Since I saw him either hindered by other inconveniences or otherwise not inclined, I did not want to press him too insistently. I received eleven florins from him, which he said were the only ones entrusted to him to give to me, and he even claimed that you had forbidden him to add anything, although I know this to be false and can easily deduce it from your letters. It has finally come to the point where he instructed Egenolff to provide for us.</p>
      <p>Content with this, we left Frankfurt. Now, however, Egenolff promises to give each of us 5 florins in Froschauer's name and affirms that he was not instructed to give more, which he also confirmed by sending us his signature. This matter certainly troubles us greatly, as no better hope appears anywhere, especially in this most turbulent state of affairs, being so far from home. How shall we live or from what, when I am forced to buy winter clothes with my own money, and my companions have even less money than I do? Egenolff's kindness gives me greater hope; if this too deceives us, we are uncertain of what to do. Therefore, dearest father, I earnestly ask you to kindly speak with Nüscheler on my behalf, so that he may be willing to lend some money for the coming year. I will strive with all my might to ensure that neither gratitude nor the duty of a good young man is lacking in me.</p>
      <p>Regarding the "Monomachia Davidis" you wrote to me about, I am diligently working on it and am entirely focused on completing it by the next fair. I have finished the first book. I have decided to divide the entire work into three books. The first of which contains the expedition of both peoples, the layout of the camps, the description of the weapons, and Goliath himself. The second will complete the monomachy. Allegorical expositions will be described in the third. I have also written several "Epistolae heroinae," which I intend to include at the end. However, I am uncertain to whom I should dedicate them. Please advise whether they should be dedicated to Nüscheler or M. Wernher Lithonius; these are the ones that come to mind among others. I will commend the monomachy to you and the other school authorities.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would like to ask you to send me the names of others by the next fair. Then I will commend everything to Froschauer for printing.</p>
      <p>We here mourn the deceased glory of Germany, Eobanus, a most holy man, who died on the fourth of October, not without my utmost sorrow. He was the only one who treated me with singular benevolence. I wrote an epicedium on his death, which will perhaps be printed shortly. For this is the wish of our common teacher, Dr. Lonicerus.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Hesse has fled here from Kassel due to the plague raging there. I do not know much else. For the uncertain changes of affairs and the disturbances of kingdoms, which are common in our age, I consider nothing new. I hear that the Emperor is coming to Worms, intending to do the same as in other assemblies. We hear of unrest among the Five Places here. May the Lord's just judgment finally destroy them! However, I fear that we too, because of the excessive familiarity and indeed the alliance we have with them, may feel the deserved penalties with them. My mind predicts that this will certainly happen.</p>
      <p>May I be a false prophet here!</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother with all the family in my name, as well as Dr. Ammianus and Collinus. Farewell, my father, and keep me commended to you, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Marburg, the day before the Ides of October 1540.</p>
      <p>Your most observant R. G.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
