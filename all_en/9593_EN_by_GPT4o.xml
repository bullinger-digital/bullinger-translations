      <p>Greetings. For that letter of yours, written last year in London on August 15, filled with all humanity, love, and your singular zeal towards me, I give you, my honorable lord and dearest brother, the greatest thanks I can possibly offer. Nor is there any reason for you to doubt my equal love and zeal towards you. Let us continue to love each other in the Lord, for it is known that God is especially delighted by brotherly love and the unique union of brothers, and nothing is more useful or necessary for the church of God. For we see today that nothing disturbs the churches of God more than the dissociation and discord of teachers. Today, indeed, the dissociation of certain obstinate, insolent, and stubborn Lutherans, who, separated from us, defend certain of their own rather unsound doctrines and try to impose them on everyone, causes many churches throughout Germany to be uncertain about what to follow, meanwhile hindering the course of the gospel among many, and fostering and increasing dissensions, while our common adversaries laugh sweetly in their bosoms. Would that we might not be forced to see these hateful conflicts someday dragging many with them into ruin! Hence, it pains my mind not a little, as I understand from your letters, that such conflicts are also arising in England. These things undoubtedly happen by the cunning of Satan, who, when he sees that he cannot overthrow the churches by the threats, force, and persecutions of outsiders, turns to other arts and seeks the destruction of the churches through domestic hatreds and mutual wounds of brothers. May the Lord cast down Satan under the feet of the saints and settle those pernicious conflicts with holy peace and concord.</p>
      <p>However, the young men you describe to me, new orators, who strive to change the entire face of your church and introduce a new form to it, even casting aside all good ecclesiastical things, seem to me indeed to imitate those Roman tribunes who distributed public lands by agrarian laws to acquire wealth and honors for themselves privately; that is, to succeed us by casting us out, etc. But they also attempt to erect a church which they will never exalt to the height they desire, nor will they be able to preserve it if they do erect it. I have seen the heads of their extraction delineated by you: about which what should be thought has long been indicated. The first proposition, that the civil magistrate has no right in ecclesiastical matters; likewise the second, that the church admits no governance other than that of the presbyters or presbytery; these two, I say, they have in common with the papists, who also remove the magistrate from the governance of the church and substitute themselves alone. I have refuted their opinion in the refutation of the bull of the Roman pontiff and in my defense of the Queen of England and the renowned kingdom, etc., which I sent to you two years ago. Would that there were no desire for domination in the authors of this presbytery! Indeed, I think it should be most carefully avoided that supreme power should be with this presbytery, much less that it should be a peculiar magistrate. Perhaps this presbytery has a place in one or another church, but not in all: much could be said about this, etc. But time will also reveal many things that are now hidden.</p>
      <p>About the names and authority of bishops, and also about the election of ministers, our Gwalther has written extensively to the reverend lord of Ely, Dr. Cox. You may inquire from him, if you please.</p>
      <p>We feel that the abuse of ecclesiastical goods must be removed, lest they serve idols and superstition. However, their use can be good if they are applied to schools, ministry, church buildings, and the support of the poor: about which I have discussed in our decades, near the end of the work. The church cannot entirely lack resources. If they are not readily available, they must certainly be collected from the faithful.</p>
      <p>What madness, therefore, to cast away what is prepared, or to yield it to others to whom it is not due, and to collect new ones anew with great inconvenience to the faithful! I do not see what those men are aiming at. I fear they seek something other than what they wish to appear, etc.</p>
      <p>But if no one should preach in his own flock except the pastor alone, what will happen if he is sick or cannot preach due to other business? Will the church meanwhile lack ecclesiastical assemblies? I know that Chrysostom harshly rebuked Epiphanius for usurping authority in another's church; but that is a far different matter. Among us, the gospel would not have been so widely propagated if pastors had only preached in their own churches.</p>
      <p>I certainly did not want infants of papists to be baptized against the will of their parents. But those who reject those offered to the church seem to be like the apostles, who forbade infants to be brought to Christ the Lord, whom he rebuked more harshly.</p>
      <p>I have discussed the judicial laws of Moses in my Decades, Dec. 3, sermons 7 and 8. Indeed, those men seem to be excessively desirous of new things. I wish those men would look further than their own affections.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant them the spirit of peace and quiet! No cloth has been brought here. Indeed, our Froschauer said he had heard something about the cloth, but none had been given to him, nor has any been sent here by anyone. Nevertheless, I give you the greatest thanks for your liberal generosity. Perhaps it got stuck somewhere on the journey. I truly ask you not to incur any such expenses for me in the future. I have seen letters written by those innovators, in which it is said that bishops send gifts to learned men to attract them to their side; soon they would also say we are Balaams. I know indeed that good men can receive honorary and friendly gifts from their friends; but you know what moved Paul not to want to accept the stipend due to him. "All things," he says, "are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient." I prefer that men ready to slander and calumniate have not even the slightest occasion to detract from us and our ministry, etc.</p>
      <p>Whatever my thoughts may be, I ask you to consider them kindly, and I pray that you continue to love me, who loves you most dearly, in return. May the Lord bless you and keep you from all evil!</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 10, 1574.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to deign to greet the reverend lord Dr. Horn, Bishop of Winchester, in my name, and to wish him and his wife all happiness and to excuse me for not writing to him particularly now. I will write another time when I have more leisure, etc.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverence, Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>To the reverend lord Dr. Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London in England, a lord to be honored by me with perpetual observance.</p>
