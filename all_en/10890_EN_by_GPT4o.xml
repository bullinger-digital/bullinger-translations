    <p xml:id="regest1">Lieb and some of his colleagues send Johannes Kym, pastor in Homburg, who is being troubled by the magistrate [Niklaus Friedrich von Heidenheim], to Bullinger with a request for help; Kym has found the evangelical truth after once being an ardent Catholic. Pastor Johannes [Muntprat?] in Lommis, who wished for a letter of recommendation from the Zurich council to his patrons, has been called to Rheineck. Greetings, especially from Andreas Klinger, who sealed the letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace be with you, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Relying on your kindness until now, all of us who preach the gospel in the Thurgau region, whenever any controversy arises, we run to you as to a certain refuge, imploring you to provide both advice and assistance with your unique wisdom. Therefore, the bearer of this letter, Johannes Kym, a native of our Switzerland, pastor in Homburg, a man fulfilling all the qualities of a pious and sincere pastor, has been sent to you by me and other surrounding brothers of our chapter, whom we all pray you kindly listen to, treat, and hold in your commendation, as he will orally and with instruction explain all his troubles and efforts, which he has had with his magistrate since the time of the rebirth of the gospel, especially since the disturbance of our peace's constitution. Certainly, while he was devoted to the world and the papal priesthood, he was greatly embraced by all the neighboring nobles and prelates, engaged in their hunts, tumults, and feasts; but as soon as the light of evangelical truth arose, he abandoned the mass and gave his name to Christ, they hated him all the more intensely, and not least, since there is no agreement between Christ and Belial.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Johannes, the brother from Lommis, who after the synod requested you for letters of recommendation from your senate to his patrons, who are called "die Montbraten", no longer needs them; for he has been called to Rheineck, an excellent ministry of Christ, through my and Martin Mötili's induction.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>June 21.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you and pray for your long safety for us and your church, especially Andreas Klinger in Mühlheim, who in the name of all of us sealed this letter with the chapter's seal for his function.</p>
      <p>Huldrych Amantius, your most observant in Wigoltingen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious pastor of the Church of Zurich, M. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
