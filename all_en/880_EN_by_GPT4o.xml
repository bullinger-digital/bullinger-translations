      <p>Praise be to God always, added on April 9th in Strasbourg 1550.</p>
      <p>May God's grace and mercy be with us all at all times. Amen. Honorable, kind, dear sir, I cannot refrain from writing to you every now and then; for I have a special love for you because of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my request to you is that you do not take it amiss that I write to you so boldly, even though I have not seen you. Yet I also know well that you are well-disposed towards everyone, whether they are wise or unwise, as long as they mean well, and therefore I cannot hide my joy and sorrow from you. And you should first know that it has not been four weeks since, in Holland, where my wife is, three women were drowned in chains because of the Emperor, for the sake of faith. In Toul in Lorraine, two priests were also recently executed by order of the Emperor for the sake of faith, as I have been informed from that city. My lord Ã  Lasco is still in Bremen with Doctor Albert Hardenberg; if you wish to write something to the two of them, you may do so; for I have a secure messenger who will go there in 14 days. Some of the lords of Bremen were here in Strasbourg, in secret, not three weeks ago, and others more; I was with them and also gave them letters. They will be here again in 14 days, and as I have well understood, there are secret dealings. The nobility in Brunswick is against their duke; the reason is this: Duke Henry of Brunswick wanted to force the nobility to help him wage war against the cities; they did not want to do that. When he saw this (it is now three weeks ago), he ordered his subjects, anyone over 18 years old, to be armed, and his intention was to force the nobility. The nobility became aware of this, gathered about 800 strong, and from the city about 1500 strong riders, came together, took some places from the duke, and he went to the Emperor, etc. Furthermore, you should also know that our bishop has insisted through his cathedral priests that our preachers should be removed from the city and that our lords should stand before them in the mass when they perform mass, and protect and shield them, or else they will no longer want to hold mass and will write and complain to the bishop. To this, our lords have given this answer: they can well imagine that the bishop and the cathedral priests would like to cause a bloodbath over this city; they shall lie, that they have not saddled the donkey, and think that it will not go over their heads. If they have not had enough when they have complained to the bishop, they may also complain to the Emperor; for their proposal and desire will be nothing in that place; they should not think about it. And so they have parted with discord, and as the matter seems to me, it will soon become something else; for it is not very long ago, at a wedding, some wanted to kill the bishop, and not small people, but great lords like counts and dukes, who have drawn their swords to stab him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my request to you is that you exhort all the pious to pray sincerely that their recklessness may not prevail. With that, may God Almighty be entrusted, and tell the good lord Pellican that I have greeted him kindly in the Lord, and I expect that his money will be here in 14 days.</p>
      <p>Oh dear, if the Jew were with you, my request is, if you could, that I might come to my 16 Strasbourg guilders; it would be a great service to me.</p>
      <p>I, Gabriel, your willing servant. To the prudent, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, to my kind dear lord's hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
