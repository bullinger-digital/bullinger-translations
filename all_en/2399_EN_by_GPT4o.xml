      <p>Greetings. The opinion of Mr. Calvin on restraining heretics and the punishment inflicted on Servetus is approved, most illustrious man, by Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, as I heard from his own mouth in a conversation held in Neuburg in Thuringia this year 1554 in the month of May. For he had brought Mr. Calvin's book there and offered it to me one day, when we were leaving the place of assembly, to read, and I indeed read it gladly, although I had seen and read it once before. However, when I later returned it and we discussed certain matters privately, as often happens, among other things, he mentioned that Mr. Calvin's judgment on the punishment of heretics was strongly approved by him. On this occasion, and especially because of Mr. Urbanus Rhegius's book, both previously and recently, about ten days ago I think, because now everywhere, especially in the territories of the Palatine princes and the Landgrave along the Rhine, certain Anabaptists aspiring to sedition and new things are raising their heads, an edict has been promulgated everywhere for the stricter restraint of Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in that Neuburg colloquy, the pious men sent there discussed these topics, which were proposed by the order of the princes: first, if a diet were to be held, as His Imperial Majesty had enjoined, and our people were ordered to render an account of their faith and all doctrine and the institution of their churches, it should be provided with all care how agreement in doctrines and all things that are adjuncts would be declared.</p>
      <p>It was indeed decided that the confessions already published would suffice for this purpose, the first of which was presented at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, another published in the name of the Saxon or northern churches, to be presented at the Council of Trent in 1551, and finally another in the name of the Duke and the churches of Württemberg presented to the Council of Trent in 1552. For these confessions abundantly testify to the agreement of all our churches in doctrine.</p>
      <p>Secondly, it was pronounced specifically about the doctrines of Schwenckfeld and Osiander, and a black Ξ was prefixed to them. The rumor is that the theologians of the Württemberg territory now openly defend Osiander's doctrine. Thirdly, it was proposed about the universal adoption of the same ceremonies. However, the learned men responded that it was neither very necessary nor easy to do, and that we should be more concerned about agreement in doctrine than in ceremonies, which should be especially free. Meanwhile, however, both the princes and the superintendents can work towards having the purest ceremonies and those most suitable for the edification of the unlearned people. I have heard, however, that within a few days our most illustrious prince wishes to ensure that all churches in his territory use the common ceremonies of the Wittenberg church; for it is believed that this would especially appease the mind of the Emperor, whose commissioners, as they are called, recently acting in Augsburg, declared such a thing in writing and indeed by the Emperor's command. Fourthly, some things were briefly established about the examination and ordination of church ministers, the visitation of churches, ecclesiastical consistories, and the more severe punishment of ministers who commit serious offenses. Fifthly, it was asked whether jurisdiction and ordination should be granted to the bishops called ordinaries in our churches. The pious men responded that, since they persecute sound doctrine and its professors out of hatred and, conversely, establish false doctrines, superstitious rites, and the like, it cannot be granted. Behold, you have the summary of what was done in the Neuburg colloquy. I have reported these things so that you might understand in some part what the state of our churches is; for we cannot conceal that, at the time our prince acted abroad and at home, matters were disturbed and preachers were harassed everywhere by the Interimists and others, then because of roads beset by soldiers or robbers, visitations were interrupted, moreover, ministers were nowhere defended by magistrates, and indeed despised by the people intent on wars or new things, many things that had been well established have gradually collapsed, and in some places even new vices have crept in, all of which now need purification and correction. I believe, therefore, that with some peace and quiet now granted to the princes, some will soon attempt to better arrange most ecclesiastical matters.</p>
      <p>Regarding our school, since you ask so, I will add something, although more can be learned from our students who return to you. Our prince is accustomed to entrust the highest matters in the school to jurists, a kind of people here generally proud and arrogant, even if they have emerged from the lowest dregs of the populace, and moreover, beyond what can be said, hostile to theologians. Which I, if anyone else, have often and to my great private, but greater public detriment of piety and sacred literature, experienced in this school for almost fourteen years now. But now, since Mr. Oldendorp has been in charge for a year and a half, the worst of the worst evils seem to be at hand; for he daily undertakes and accomplishes many things to oppress me and sacred studies, which someone might think he learned from the laws and counsels of Emperor Julian the Apostate. For now to diminish, now to utterly prohibit our stipends, to block the way to academic honors, to remove theologians and theology students from consultations and public functions, to close lecture halls, to designate inconvenient places and times for students, to bring into counsel and honor those who declare themselves willing to oppose sacred studies, to approve what is publicly spewed against theologians in the school by some, to dissuade youth from piety studies both openly and secretly and through himself and his own, to prohibit the inculcation of catechism doctrine in tender minds, these and similar things are plainly a game to him. But I, as I ought and have been taught by the apostle, strive to illuminate my ministry, and I contend with all my might to protect and preserve sacred studies. And by God's grace, I have experienced marvelous successes from time to time, to the dismay and grief of all adversaries. You would see a certain image of Elijah's contest against the Baalites. However, now, when it has reached the utmost on both sides, so that one side must soon fall, I have decided within eight days to approach the most illustrious prince himself and to expose the whole matter (for I have found out that everything is done without his knowledge) to see once and for all whether he wishes to protect and defend us and our studies against the force and plots of the jurists or not. Indeed, if he does not intend to provide for us otherwise, I will soon see what needs to be done; for it will be necessary to think about migration. But if he responds that he wishes to retain these sacred studies, which I believe he will certainly do, then I will propose and request to establish in the school those things through which our studies, with God's help, will take great growth. You will have done rightly in my judgment if you write a letter to our most illustrious prince as soon as possible, in which you will encourage him to more diligently protect and promote sacred studies and their professors in his school; for you have understood from the young men who return from here to there that those who preside over the school hinder sacred studies in various ways and lightly impede the professors, about which your young men will be able to report not a few things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the city of Cologne, it has been reported here that recent contentions about religion have arisen there and that in one or two churches the gospel is openly and freely taught with the senate and people supporting the preachers. Meanwhile, however, the plague is also said to be smoldering there. In Antwerp, seven or eight weeks ago, there was a sedition, but because of the Emperor's too severe exactions.</p>
      <p>The princes newly joined in a league in Germany, especially the Elector Palatine and the Duke of Württemberg, have sent their forces. Similarly, the bishops joined with the Nurembergers have dismissed all their soldiers or rather ordered some select ones to winter in the towns; for Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg, is believed to have gone to the King of France and now to be gathering new forces in the city of Metz or not far from there. Henry, Duke of Brunswick, still retains some cavalry and infantry in the territory of the Counts of Mansfeld. The Duke himself recently came on the 24th day of August to our prince acting in the castle of Zappenburg; but what matters they discussed is uncertain.</p>
      <p>Regarding your four books on the grace of God justifying, which you sent to our most illustrious prince at the spring fair, how they came into his hands and were delivered through Christoph Helvetius, the prince's wardrobe keeper, your young men will be able to explain more certainly than I can write.</p>
      <p>These young men, however, have lived modestly and blamelessly among us, and indeed have applied themselves diligently to their studies and have been actively engaged in all kinds of exercises; for they have argued, responded in disputations, and each has declaimed except Bodmer, who only made a trial in arguing, but was about to respond and declaim, had he not been suddenly recalled home. Johannes Hugo, having been seized by a fever in recent days, has not yet been restored to his former health, for which reason he cannot come with the others, but will follow as soon as he regains his strength.</p>
      <p>It was very pleasant for me that in your letter to me you included greetings in the name of the most illustrious man, Mr. Cheke of Britain. Ah, how often both his and the memory of other most excellent men, whom I knew in Britain either in London or Cambridge (which is Mr. Cheke's homeland) or Oxford, comes to mind, sometimes joyful, sometimes sad...</p>
      <p>[...] joyful indeed, because I saw those men adorned with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, through whom there was the greatest hope that the church of God could be helped and illuminated, but sad because I now hear that they are most undeservedly exiled for the confession of the truth. Some Englishmen were with me who reported that Mr. Cheke could not remain in Germany but was compelled to go to Italy. If this is true, I indeed marvel at the cruelty of those who preside over Britain and procure this; meanwhile, however, I interpret it as happening by God's providence, so that through exiles coming to Italy, the word of God may be propagated with a more fortunate course in Italy itself and especially in the dominion of the Venetians and the Duke of Ferrara, in which places I have heard many pious people are scattered. But I fear that my verbosity may be troublesome to you.</p>
      <p>I pray the Lord Jesus to always keep you and the other excellent men there safe. Farewell. Given at Marburg on the 18th day of September 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
