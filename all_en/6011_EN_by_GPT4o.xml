      <p>In Paris, by the king's order, they say the gospel is being publicly taught among us.</p>
      <p>Some scoundrels wanted to betray Geneva to the Duke of Savoy on the appointed day of December 26th of the past year, but they failed in their attempt and were captured and executed.</p>
      <p>The Bavarian is so harassing the knight of Ortenburg, under some specious pretexts, that he has fled to the assembly of princes in Meissen; for some princes of Germany are holding an assembly in the town of Dresden with the King of the Romans and Augustus of Saxony, who are already present there.</p>
      <p>I did not want to omit these things, but rather, before I returned to our land, I added them to the previous letters, which I had already sealed and handed over to Mr. Schenk.</p>
      <p>I fear that this alone... the conflict that has arisen between the Bavarian and the Ortenburg knight, to omit other matters, will cause us great disturbances.</p>
      <p>Grumbach has been publicly outlawed by the imperial court; nevertheless, he, accompanied by strong allied French forces, is causing terror. I hear that on both sides, both from the bishops and the citizens of Nuremberg as well as from Grumbach and his associates, larger forces are being gathered daily. Thus, in the end, God leaves us to our own judgment and perverse will, as we disdain to depend on His will and be governed by His hand.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, January 7th, in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Georg von Stetten, your most observant.</p>
