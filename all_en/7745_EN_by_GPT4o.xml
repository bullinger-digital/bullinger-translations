      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most distinguished and revered father, along with the enclosed writing, but I could not return it now, as it has not yet been returned by a certain benevolent and singular friend. He is also one of our number, which I write so that the delay of your letter does not trouble you. I will send it back soon and as soon as I have received it. But there is nothing dissimilar in this, which was recently written to me. We have nothing new, except that the adversaries themselves now affirm that a battle has been fought in France, but it was mournful and bloody for both sides. - Our people went to the assembly yesterday. We will soon hear what is decided in the case of Cellarius. Two leagues have agreed to avenge this injury, and not a few communities from the third as well. But I can hardly express in words how much the supporters of the monks have rushed together with full force to attack, if they sensed any who were less benevolent, and there is certainly a danger that they might soften even the hardest with such small gifts. Our envoy affirms that the Venetian senate has rejected their inquisitors and their practices and has removed them. This is all for now.</p>
      <p>We anxiously await the history of the French battle, and it would greatly benefit our cause if it became widely known before the end of the assembly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man; may you serve the church of God eternally. Chur, January 10, 1569, from which none of yours have yet arrived.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their regards to you with the happiest wishes for the year. Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished and primary minister of the church of Zurich, his eternally revered master.</p>
      <p>To the pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich</p>
