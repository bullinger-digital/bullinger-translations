      <p>As I was returning home in the evening, I happened to meet an envoy who was carrying letters in his hands, which had just been delivered to him from France. These letters stated that there was still great hope for peace. However, those who are negotiating peace did not meet in Arras, as had been decided, but in a city named Lille. The letters were written on the 14th day of this month.</p>
      <p>As for the French King, it was very close, indeed extremely close, that he did not take Saint-Omer through treachery in the meantime. There is no truce; both armies are engaging in skirmishes in each other's sight, etc.</p>
      <p>The neighboring fields are also being devastated everywhere by raids and incursions.</p>
