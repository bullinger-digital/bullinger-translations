      <p>S. D. I have instructed this servant of mine, who is returning from France and heading to the court, to visit your lordship and inform you of those matters which he learned both at the court of our king (for he was there) and on the way. Here in the countryside, where I have retreated for a few days for the sake of my mind, there is nothing new worthy of your piety. However, I expect letters from you, which will inform me about your health, your affairs, and your continued friendship towards me. Meanwhile, I wish you all happiness and offer and commend myself entirely to you.</p>
      <p>From my countryside estate in Solangy, the twelfth of March, 1561. I will soon return to the court of our king and from there will write more frequently to your piety and make amends for my past negligence and tardiness. Your lordship's most devoted J. Ja. Cambray. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zürich and dearest friend. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>From Jean Jacques de Cambray, French envoy.</p>
