    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letters sent by Bullinger and from Worms; regrets the persecution of the faithful. Has also received the letter of recommendation for Johannes [Pontisella]; however, cannot do much for him, as the situation in Graubünden looks bleak; therefore asks that the people of Zurich continue to take care of him and employ him in church service if suitable. Finds it particularly offensive regarding Leo Martini that he absconded with foreign money [from Memmingen]; sees the cause of the problem in an alcohol issue and also in Martini's wife. Can report nothing specific about Johannes Travers; the booklets [which Bullinger inquired about] are probably not in Travers' possession; Johannes Blasius has not sent them to him in any case. There is nothing new to report from Graubünden and Italy. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have received your letters of kindness, most learned Bullinger, first two, namely yours and those sent from Worms. It is indeed most pleasing that the word of God, with its clarity and power, renders the enemies of Christ so terrified that they do not even dare to begin a discussion of the scriptures; but meanwhile, the cruelty of the Emperor is displeasing and brings torment. Yet these things proceed from God and His providence, a test of faith and the proof of faith through the sufferings of the innocent. Then, through our Johannes, you sent other letters; in those, you commend Johannes to me. I am indeed most ready to do this to the best of my ability, which is very little; for they have so curtailed my priesthood that I must live meagerly and sordidly, and if I were not already of advanced age, I would resign this and seek another condition wherever I could. Therefore, I earnestly ask you and wish to implore my other lords that he may henceforth and hitherto be commended to you, and if any good fruit is to be hoped for from him by the grace of God, we think it will be to the benefit of your church. For we hope for nothing from our own; the ministers of the word are starved and killed among us, etc. Regarding Leo Martini, I would not accuse him of leaving his homeland for the aforementioned reason, unless he did not care to make payment for the foreign debt he contracted. This vice is in him, that it is not bothersome for him to be in debt; the cause of this is his drinking, and also his wife, etc. I cannot write anything certain about Johannes Travers; for he did not come to this fair. Johannes Blasius is at his hands, to buy books and send them; he is not aware of ever having sent these booklets, from which we certainly think he lacks them. Otherwise, nothing is happening among us that is worth knowing, nor in Italy, or I would have written. Farewell, most distinguished and dearest man. From the court of Rhaetia, on the calends of February, (year) etc. 41.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, a lord and friend to be esteemed among the first.</p>
