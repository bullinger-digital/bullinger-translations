      <p>Johannes Blasius to his esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, greetings. We have received your letter, full of all courtesy, most honorable man. In it, you have indeed commendably recommended to us the Bernese boy, whom we have received safely along with the letter, and he will be most commendable to us and to all good people. As for the specific task you have assigned to me (to ensure he is not corrupted by bad company), you have easily persuaded me; for I promise in good faith that I will diligently do this, although I hope to accomplish it without much effort, since he not only has a respectable family but also a decent neighborhood. For we have here, by the grace of God, a people not responding too poorly to the evangelical doctrine. Therefore, so that we may continually trouble you, we request the commentaries on the Apocalypse, which D. Theodor Bibliander recently published; for besides those written by D. Sebastian, once a minister of the Bernese church, we have none. Therefore, if you have any other works by any learned and pious person, please send them to us; you will do us a great favor. We will send the money to the bookseller, which they cost, without delay.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have no news from Italy worth your knowing. Everything here is still quite peaceful, although the French faction is trying to overturn and disturb everything with their impious and bloodthirsty treaty conditions.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver us from this temptation.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, April 30, 1549.</p>
      <p>Lord Comander, Consul Heymius, and all the others send you their warmest regards. Farewell again. On the Sunday of Cantate, a great day of assembly will be held in Ilanz because of the union with the French; on that day, Traversius will also come, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours to the altar, Blasius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and steadfast man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of our Switzerland and Rhaetia, his most esteemed lord.</p>
