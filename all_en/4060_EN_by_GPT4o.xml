      <p>Greetings. Our assembly, glory to God, has reached its conclusion, and nothing else is being done than what has been done so far. Our people declare that they will not deviate a nail's breadth from the Augsburg Confession, while the Catholics do the same, saying they do not care a straw for our protestation; for they consider the church to be of more value than our pseudo-gospel. The Emperor supports both sides, and because he needs the help of both, he allows each side to have its own opinion. For the fortification of places bordering the Turks, 500,000 gold coins are counted for three years, and some states that owe the Emperor have not yet paid, which amounts to 300,000 gold coins. Peace between Christ and Belial, so that neither harms the other's members, has been established and confirmed with great severity, with heavy penalties to be inflicted on transgressors. Here you have the prologue, the play, and the catastrophe of the assembly.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the very bitter booklet of Staphylus. Philipp's strength is failing, and he is not sufficient to refute the trifles of the Staphyluses; the Bavarian superintendent triumphs, even sent to Silesia. What happened to him while traveling to Silesia, as it were, is explained in the attached note. I am very, very afraid that we will be destroyed by our security and laziness and the cunning and diligence of our adversaries. Our preachers here are lulled to sleep within the walls, occupied with daily feasts and the foolish praises and acclamations of women, sleeping deeply within private walls, thinking they have beautifully fulfilled their duties if they preach once a week. Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet Gesner and the other friends in Augsburg briefly on August 25, in the year etc. 59.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the divine word, incomparable lord and friend. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
