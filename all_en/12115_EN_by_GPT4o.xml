    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius recommends the not entirely untalented Kaspar Schneeberger at his request; he is best supported if allowed to proceed in his own way. - After sealing the last letter [No. 2064], Bullinger's nephew [Josua] returned to Myconius with a [not received] letter [to Bullinger?]. - The 8000 soldiers [of Charles V] ravaged Lorraine; Duke [Francis I of Lorraine] wanted to take action against their [plundering], but an [unknown] mediator prevented violent outbreaks by threatening the [Schmalkaldic troops?], the Sundgauers, and the Breisgauers; and if the nobility, who are therefore gathering in Sélestat, do not intercede with the Emperor, something will happen.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Please receive Kaspar Schneeberger in such a way, as he is the simplest of all and somewhat foolish from simplicity and a little proud; he understands what is right, but does not know how to use it. He is not entirely without letters (which I am very surprised by), but likewise without good use. If his friends and relatives allow him to live according to his own ways, he will be able to be pleasant; but if they try to change him, they will completely ruin him. He asked me to recommend him to you. Therefore, make sure that he is most recommended, if only for the reason that he is not at all bad, unless he is made so by too much vexation.</p>
      <p>I omitted in the other letter, that after I sealed it, your nephew returned to me with letters - as you can know, because I am sending them.</p>
      <p>Also, the Emperor wanted to burden Lorraine with eight thousand Spaniards, which he had previously exhausted. But the Duke, having gathered an army, while he was trying to drive them out by force, an intercessor, a great man, came and prevented the violence and relieved Lorraine, threatening the Concordians, Sundgauers, and Breisgauers. And unless the nobility, who are therefore gathering in Sélestat, intercede with the Emperor, something will happen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. January 16, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, president of the church of Zurich, his venerable in the Lord.</p>
