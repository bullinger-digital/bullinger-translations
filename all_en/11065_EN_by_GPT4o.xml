    <p xml:id="regest1">He thinks it would be better if [Jakob Fehr] stayed in Bischofszell out of consideration for his family; however, perhaps Fehr will decide differently after receiving the letter from Theodor [Bibliander]. He hopes that [Konrad Zwick] will accept the invitation [to Urdorf], and sends greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>What you write about the transfer to Bischofszell, dearest Bullinger, does not please me. For I hear that the situation of that good man has already begun to improve. Therefore, it would be very difficult for such a good man to travel such a distance and bear the burden of his family. Moreover, he has a wife and children, as I understand from good friends, such that it would be more prudent for him to stay with his own. But I wish this to be written only to you. Perhaps he will respond differently upon receiving Theodor's letter. May the Lord's will be done, not ours.</p>
      <p>Farewell; for I have nothing else to write. I am glad to hear that the brother has been called to you; I hope he will not be lacking in such a sincere fellowship. Again, farewell with your mother, wife, children, and your entire household.</p>
      <p>July 18, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely,</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
