      <p> Greetings. By what sacrament and with what written agreements the senate and city of Constance have bound themselves to King Ferdinand and the future lords of the House of Austria, you will clearly understand from the example of the formulated words, which I wanted to send to you, who recently generously shared with my brother and me the cause of the Swiss delegations concerning the question of ratifying the council and such matters. However, I ask you, once you have read or even copied the example I am sending, to return it to me, and if you have shared it with anyone, which I would prefer only with the most trustworthy, do not disclose my name. The matter is not indeed obscure; but the annotation of the form is desired by many citizens as well. I also beseech you, when your delegates return from the Thermopolitan assembly, if you have learned or inquired anything that pertains to the exiles from Constance scattered through Thurgau and Switzerland, to inform me of it. Commend me to your fellow ministers and other pious and learned men. Lament our plight in such a way that it serves as an example for preserving the things that remain for the pious; for you are not unaware of the state of our city. Now it is rightly preached about it as in Ezekiel 19:13f:... May the gracious Father of Heaven, the Lord of Hosts, prevent such lamentation from Switzerland and finally preserve some remnants for the magnification of His name! Farewell in this and love me. </p>
      <p> Griesenberg, 8th of March, 1549. </p>
      <p> Your Thomas Blaurer. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Evangelist of the Zurichers, his esteemed friend. ZÃ¼rich. </p>
