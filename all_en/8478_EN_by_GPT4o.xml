      <p>Greetings. I hope you are well in the Lord along with all your family, most esteemed lord and brother. I have decided to write to you about the state of our affairs, so that I do not seem to delay the duty of writing longer than is appropriate. The strength of the Moors in Spain is growing more and more. Letters written from Lyon on January 5th report that the French peace is still holding well and there is hope that it will endure. The Queen of England hoped to return the spoils, which she has often seized, although the immense amount of money exceeds; but the hope for peace between her and Alva has now collapsed. The fortress of Alva, which he had begun to build very strongly in the town of Groningen, collapsed in the recent flood so that no traces remain, and about three hundred Spaniards perished in it.</p>
      <p>Alva is preparing for war; for the evangelical princes have decided to restore by arms those whom he, with his confederates, had ejected from the fiefs of the empire; they are only waiting for the time of year when soldiers can be led out. They also declare that they will avenge the bloody plans and alliances of many against them; I fear there will be a very fierce war spreading far and wide. The kings of Denmark and Sweden have secured peace for 16 years.</p>
      <p>Antonio de Colonna is appointed commander of the papal fleet; a lightning bolt struck his galley, shattered the mast, and in its fall, 30 rowers were crushed. The commander himself barely reached the shore safely near Sicily; then, when he boarded another galley, it was also battered by a storm, so that he barely escaped with a few men.</p>
      <p>The earthquake in Ferrara still continues. The Elector Margrave of Brandenburg has left. The Bavarian daughter-in-law gave birth to a stillborn child. The Margrave of Ansbach, guardian of W端rttemberg, began to contest the town and provostship, claiming that the right of patronage of that place belongs to W端rttemberg; the Bishop of Augsburg had possessed it until now, but with an unjust title. It is said that the preparations of the Turks are great. Some are moving towards Istria and Dalmatia, others towards Hungary, and others to other places. May the Lord be with His own and hasten His coming; and may He grant us to be watchful.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, January 31, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Z端rich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Z端rich.</p>
