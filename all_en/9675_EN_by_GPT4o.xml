      <p>The scribe Roll from Uri has hanged himself at Imm Hoff and other Catilinian; they have received great support from the Spaniard and money and are driving together 15 penny soldiers to lead to the Netherlands to help the Spaniards, where no human tongue can express the wantonness and cruel tyranny that the aforementioned Spaniards are driving in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>They want to help them for the sake of money. There is hardly anything to bite or break; they lead sheep to the slaughter, regardless of whether they are already ruined and never return home, just so that the big houses come from there and bring full purses, overloading the fatherland with blood money, so that it later also breaks in and disintegrates. All authorities have forbidden the move; but they have all broken through with force and have gone from there, having in their pockets, as they say, crucifixes, images of Our Lady. 'We travel in God's name there; Mary, God's mother, wants to be with us.' They have shielded themselves with this: it is right to take money from the French, so it is also right for them to take from the Spaniard. With this, Brother Clausen's prophecy is fulfilled: the money of foreign lords will separate and betray us. It is not enough that those traveling to the Netherlands are disobedient and rebellious, to murder and plunder poor people who have never harmed them; but now the bloody king from France also comes and demands 6000 soldiers. A day has been set in Solothurn on Urbani, where I do not doubt, he will make his case bloom, as is his custom, showing us water where one finds fire. But in the ground of truth, it is thus: Some estates have asked the king to bring peace to the crown and reform according to the order of Louis XII, and therefore hold a diet, etc. He does not want that, advised by his pretty mother Jezebel, by the Cardinal of Lorraine, Italians, Chancellor Birago, and the Guises. His brother, the Duke of Alençon, the King of Navarre, Marshal Cossé, and other lords have been advised to distance themselves from the court for a while, to see if they might thereby move the king to the diet. But they have been betrayed, and the king has captured and detained them, dismissed 18 parliament lords in Paris, captured many of the nobility. He claims they wanted to fall from him to the Huguenots, which is not true. What will become of it, one cannot yet know.</p>
      <p>The Huguenots, however, are lying with their troops in Dauphiné under Lord Monbrun, in Normandy under Count Montgomery, in Poitou under Lord de la Noue, and in other places under others; yet they all await obediently, only that the diet be held and religion be given freedom. The king does not want to do that, strengthens himself, demands of the Confederates that he may kill his own people, etc.</p>
      <p>If we now help with such, we know well from the word of God what awaits us. And it seems to me, whatever one may do, it will go again. I fear it will go as written: 'They did not listen to the ministers, because the Lord wanted to destroy them!' In France and in the Netherlands, there is an unheard-of famine; in Holland, many have died of hunger and been found dead on the streets. There our people go, adorning themselves with the fact that they come from hunger and misery, and yet come into much greater suffering. That is the reward of our insatiable greed and luxury, through which the war people come there, that they must sell and pledge themselves to the unfaithful leaders; God have mercy! It is said that Count Hannibal von Ems with several horses and wagons, loaded with all kinds of war equipment, came near Alsace-Zabern, where unexpectedly attacked by French troops, 27 of them killed, Count Hannibal shot through, escaped into the town of Zabern and died there. Others say he still lives and has not yet died of the wound. The French have laid down and plundered the wagons, well 8 or 9. These French, about 1500 strong, were on the move, wanting to go to Count Ludwig von Nassau in the Netherlands, and when they came to the princes and the area in Lower Alsace and learned that the Nassau camp before Nijmegen was beaten by Spaniards and Count Palatine Christoph slain (some say he still lives), they stayed there in Lower Alsace waiting for further instructions, and Count Hannibal was unexpectedly part of them and other big houses more, although the story, in Hegau, at Engen with the Count of Lupfen, he was warned. But against the Lord, no counsel. What if the members conformed to the head? From the French court, the young Prince of Condé has been warned. He was governor in Picardy, and when he learned that the lords were captured by the king, he hurried to the German land, narrowly escaped, came to Strasbourg, and then to the prince in Heidelberg, then back to Strasbourg; there, as the story goes (the rest mentioned above is otherwise certain), he is supposed to gather a cavalry train. A diet is also supposed to be held in Heidelberg, in Milan Don John of Austria (Hans of Austria) is said to have arrived, to meet with the princes of Italy, to take soldiers, to lead to the Netherlands or I know not where. Everywhere war, war, horrible war. The Lord have mercy on His own and come soon to separate with His coming. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, the day after the Ascension of the Lord 1574. The Lord be with you and with all yours and friends, lords, and brothers of ours, whom you will greet individually and in order by name.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger]. To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my gracious lord and dear brother.</p>
