      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, dear brother, from which I first understood that you greatly desire to know what Mr. Erastus wrote.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am sending his letters here, but please return them.</p>
      <p>I understood nothing of this, although I carefully ensured that your letters addressed to him were delivered and know they were delivered, nor have I heard anything from Froschauer, which is not surprising, since Erastus was not in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>It might be better to send two bound copies, one for the prince, the other for Erastus. If those other and earlier copies of yours have already been returned to him, he will donate these two later copies of yours to other good men, etc. Then you describe to me the death of the reverend bishop, whose loss I mourn, and that sincerely, not so much because I fear a worse successor for him, but because we are deprived of the benefit that was hoped for from him; but perhaps we are not worthy of better.</p>
      <p>However, do not think that the matter should be brought to the point where there is no longer a bishop. I would indeed wish for none; but there are many reasons why I think that is impossible.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I think we must work for what is good and leave the outcome to the Lord. - The people of Bregaglia, inspired by the example of the Engadiners, do what they do; for it is from the Lord that the pensioners feel the judgment of God and consider what they are doing, lest they experience worse things at some point. - What you wrote about the papal alliance, I shared with both consuls.</p>
      <p>They were extremely displeased; for they see that it pertains to the destruction of Switzerland, and I do not doubt that they will carefully consider and deliberate on this matter. May the Lord break the cruel plans and turn them upon the heads of the authors.</p>
      <p>Today, there is a convenient opportunity, as someone is going to Bern and returning. It would be better for Mr. Legate to suggest to his friends everywhere what he thinks should be opposed to this pernicious plan, etc.</p>
      <p>It is to be greatly feared that the recklessness will bring us to the point where we hear, while such long warnings and the manifold preaching are struck in vain.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Count Anguissola was here for several days.</p>
      <p>When he came here, he said he would stay in such a pleasant place for a long time.</p>
      <p>However, what he thought or what kind of responses he received, I do not know. This I know: he immediately changed his plan and left, nor did he come to the council nor propose anything in writing; for when the consuls did not want to convene a public assembly at his request, he saw that he could achieve little, etc. Greet the most honorable Mr. Legate, the consuls, and our friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 11, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
