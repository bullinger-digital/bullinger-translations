      <p>Most learned man, greetings from God our Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Amen. Mr. Pietro Paolo Vergerio, that man who is indeed an excellent champion for the Christian religion, recently wrote to me in this manner: "If you wish to send any letters to me, direct them to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, who will make every effort to ensure they are delivered to me as soon as possible." Therefore, as he advised, I have acted, trusting in the diligence with which you are endowed, to ensure that what he has persuaded me about you, he may see he has spoken the truth. Farewell in the Lord always.</p>
      <p>From the place of Vicosoprano, on the 20th day of August, 1551. Your brother in the Lord, Paris from Bergamo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, much to be respected by me. In Zürich.</p>
