      <p>To the propositions of Justus Velsius, June 28, 1561.</p>
      <p>You presented to me yesterday, most excellent and learned Velsius, this writing of yours, which I now return, and you presented it with the intention that I should diligently read and consider it with the brothers and fellow ministers, as it pertains to gathering the scattered churches, and that you uniquely aim for the healing of the church's wounds, for which reason you are not reluctant to undertake private discussions and public debates. I have proposed and exposed all these things to my brothers and fellow ministers here present, who have instructed me to respond to you.</p>
      <p>First, we also grieve over the wounds of the churches and therefore diligently pray to the Lord to deign to heal them. Meanwhile, being well aware of our infirmity and recognizing how much is required of one who wishes to heal them, we focus primarily on how the church entrusted to our faith may remain in Christ and true tranquility.</p>
      <p>Then, when you discuss much about vocation and the types of vocation and disapprove of those who glory in Luther, whose vocation you call incomplete, we consider these things to pertain to those who are inflated against others in the name of Luther. We glory in the name of Christ alone and accept neither the words nor deeds of Luther unless they agree with Christ, with the rule of faith, and with the Holy Scripture.</p>
      <p>In the same way, we do not consider that the things you extensively discuss about the vocation, character, and morals of pseudo-evangelical preachers, from the second epistle to Timothy by Paul, and what you add about corrupt churches, which you call cities of the nations alienated from the republic of Israel, pertain to us. For all the pious have thought well of us and our ministry so far, and although we are sinners, we have been found faithful by the grace of God. We do not care what enemies think of us. Furthermore, we hope that in the churches entrusted to our faith, the marks of the Christian and apostolic church will be found. For this, we give thanks to God and diligently pray that He may never forsake us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what you expound in many words in your writing about the Roman church and papal tyranny, that it has departed from Christ and become a harlot, has been handed down by our predecessors and us for 40 years and more, and it is evident to all that we have no commerce with that Babylonian harlot [Rev 17].</p>
      <p>Finally, since you have comprehended the sum of true religion and doctrine in 20 propositions and 7 chapters and proposed that the churches have a formula of true doctrine, our churches have had the true doctrine for 40 years, which, drawn from the scriptures, announces repentance and forgiveness of sins in Christ, accuses the security of the same and all kinds of vices and sins, we do not think any private discussion or public debate with you is necessary. Our church is peaceful by the grace of God. There are no dissensions in it; it walks in harmony in Christ. If any prefer to have the integrity of His word, we assist with pious admonitions and exhortations. If you wish to offer your assistance to churches that are dissenting somewhere or where the name of Christ has not yet been heard, you may do so through us. We pray to the Lord to direct all things to the glory of His name and the salvation of souls. We have responded to you, most learned Velsius, so that you may understand that we have received you amicably and dismiss you amicably.</p>
      <p>When Bullinger had recited this on behalf of all, he replied that this response was unexpected to him, yet revealed to him that night, and he prayed that we might deign to hear what he had written to Borrheus. He recited it. It contained notions of the true Christian. He inferred that since such are found nowhere, there are no churches. From there, he was carried into dire threats against ministers. Finally, he said he had fulfilled his function, now he lays everything before the tribunal of God.</p>
      <p>We responded that we also lay down everything, knowing that we must give an account of our ministry. We trust in the mercy of God. Meanwhile, let him consider what spirit it is that despises so many good and faithful men in the church and does not think them to be saints. He said the Lord would visit shortly [Lk 9:5; 10:11; Acts 13:51], etc. We responded that we have good confidence towards God, etc.</p>
      <p>The writing he recited was composed against Borrheus and contained the marks of the true church. We accepted that Borrheus, a man endowed with various gifts, could respond for himself. According to his marks, there has never been such a church nor will there ever be. Therefore, let Velsius see with what spirit he is endowed, who considers all true churches of Christ to be false and thinks no one just except himself and those who listen to him. We do not care for his imaginations, who believe in the word of the Lord and rely on it, etc. He replied that he lays everything before the tribunal of God, having fulfilled his duty, and therefore now shakes the dust from his feet. We also willingly lay everything before the tribunal of the just judge and, since his mind is not from God, we do not care for his shaking off and wish him a better mind. Thus, we parted on both sides.</p>
