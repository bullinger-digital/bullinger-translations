    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Serin would have written long ago if a messenger had been available to him or if new publications [from the Ulm printing house of Hans Varnier] had emerged since the arrival of Bullinger's letter [HBBW XVII, No. 2565] and [Gwalther's] "Endtchrist." Now that a pious old soldier [...] from Stammheim offers himself as a messenger, he does not want to let him leave without a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Serin will not report on the war events, as the commendable mercenaries [returning to the Confederation] can tell everything much better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger is especially thanked for Gwalther's ["Endtchrist"]. This writing was all the more welcome to him as he had to preach on 2 Thessalonians at that time. [Martin] Frecht also finds it sensational. Due to a mistake by the letter carrier unknown to Serin [Heinrich Thomann], the treatise first ended up in the hands of Frecht, who eagerly began to read it and only gradually handed over the sections he had already read to Serin. Frecht is even of the opinion that [Hans] Varnier should reprint the writing. What happened to Bullinger's letter of September 4, Serin knows just as little! It is certain that he only received the letter on September 17 with a broken seal.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He has neither heard anything from [Johannes] Haller nor received a letter. Frecht sends his regards. Serin thought that [Johannes] Piscatorius would write, but he also only sends his regards because he finds neither the desire nor the strength to write in these war turmoils.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Serin congratulates the Augsburg church on the mayor of their city [Hans Welser], who was honored by such a famous writer as Bullinger [through a dedication], much to the displeasure of the superstitious "Sakramentarier" [Lutherans]. In reference to the words "assistant" and "court administrator," Serin designates with "Sakramentierer" those who attribute properties to the sacraments and their effectiveness that have never existed and will never exist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Praise be to the Lord, who does not allow the blasphemers to suppress the truth! For recently, the Lord is said to have called a servant of the word [Georg Hieber?] in Nördlingen (where the "sacramental superstition" had prevailed). The information is not yet confirmed. But one should pray that similar things happen in many other places!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Through the Bohemians and Inner Swiss in arms, one learns that more is to be expected from prayer than from weapons.</p>

      <p>May grace be multiplied to you through our Lord Jesus Christ. I would have written to you long ago, most esteemed Bullinger, if either a convenient messenger had been available or if any new writings had emerged since the time I received your last letters with the "Antichrist." Finally, although I have nothing to send, I could not delay any longer without writing to you, especially since that good and, as it seems to me, very pious old soldier from Stammheim voluntarily offered himself as a messenger to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the war matters and the calamities of our people, I will write nothing, since your dismissed soldiers (who served here with great praise and commendation for their modesty) will narrate everything much more fully than I could achieve with my not burdensome writings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, I will only briefly respond to your matters. First of all, I give great thanks for the gift of the Christian and excellent work of Gwalther, which is even more acceptable to me because it arrived just in time for my sermons on the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians. You should also know that Frecht found this work to be remarkably commendable. For, as it first reached his hands rather than mine due to an error by the carrier (whom I do not know), he read it so eagerly that he only handed over the read pages to me and wished that Varnier would also print it. However, I do not know what happened with the letter, as I could not learn who the carrier was. I received it with a broken seal on September 17, which you had written on the 4th of the same month.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have received no message, let alone any letters, from Haller so far. Frecht has instructed me to send his regards to you. I would have thought that Piscatorius would send his regards through a letter, but he said that in these turmoils he neither wants nor is able to write. However, he instructed me to send his regards to you as diligently as you have greeted him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I heartily congratulate the Augsburg church on having such a mayor, who receives a writer of your caliber, undoubtedly against the will of many superstitious "Sakramentarier" (those who attribute and confine to the sacraments their opinions, which they never had nor will have). For I use the term "Sakramentarier" in the same way we use the terms "operariorum" (workers), "iustitiariorum" (judges), etc. And I think this is more correct than those others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Blessed be the Lord, who does not allow the blasphemers to suppress the truth according to their desire, whom I recently heard has stirred up a certain minister of the word in Nördlingen (where sacramental superstition had prevailed with ceremonial masses under the gospel)! If this is so (for I am not yet certain), I pray the Lord may favor these beginnings and continue to do the same in many more places!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>More hope and support (as you piously write) should be placed in prayers than in arms, as the Bohemians and the five Swiss cantons, as rumor has it, will finally teach us! May the Lord keep us in His ways, whether it be through life or through death, as He sees fit. Farewell. In Ulm, November 5, 1546. Leonhard Soerinus.</p>
