      <p>S. D. Often letters are not delivered faithfully, my esteemed Myconius; hence you and other good and singular friends complain that you do not receive what I have entrusted to the couriers to deliver. Mr. Gastius writes that Caelius Curio has the session records; but I had wrapped the entire bundle in paper and inscribed Gastius's name on it. Since there were several letters, I had chosen him as the procurator of all, so as not to trouble you with these. However, since Caelius also had letters in that bundle and I wanted the sessions to be communicated to him as well, perhaps everything first reached his hands; but it should have first reached Gastius and you, and then others.</p>
      <p>But all is well: I hope you have now received and read everything; for I am waiting for them to be conveniently returned by you and Gastius. I have just prepared a booklet, which is being printed in Latin and German, in which I clear our churches of the alleged crime of heresy and schism. The same matter has often been treated by others as well; however, I have condensed the otherwise copious cause for those who do not willingly read voluminous books. I doubt, however, whether the fathers of Trent can proceed in such expeditions; if they continue, they will have continued with a diabolical and more than diabolical obstinacy. Perhaps God intends to present some tragedy to the world, and great and eminent men cannot be represented otherwise than in a tragedy. But what do I say represented? Let them be treated corporally, substantially, and bloodily, etc.</p>
      <p>It is amazing to hear and write back and forth, so that one can sense the great work of God at hand. May the Lord have mercy on His church. It is said that the King of Denmark, others, and many German princes have made an alliance with France for 12 years; this is supposed to affect the Emperor in Germany. For the French gladly transfer war from themselves to other nations, wisely. On the other hand, the Emperor is said to have released or wanted to release the Elector and the Landgrave, to whom he would add Spaniards and Italians, Neapolitans and Germans, and reinstate them, so that through these gracious persons he might sow discord in this alliance. Done in a very Spanish manner, if what is said is true; I do not report these things as certain and verified, but narrate them as I received them from others. Therefore, I do not want you to say that you have these things from me. The Turk is certainly in unspeakable preparation, supposed to be himself in Adrianople. He has requested passage from the Venetians for 60,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry.</p>
      <p>See how Nebuchadnezzar prepares himself against the King of Egypt, against Zedekiah and his conspirators. Monk JÃ¶rg was stabbed in the castle at Wintz on January 16th by the cunning of Joan Baptiste Gastaldi. Everything is full of evils. Let us pray and exhort everyone to repentance. Since the crow with the peacock's tail boasts and flaunts in Germany, there is neither luck nor salvation.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver us. I have detained you long enough; live and farewell with all yours, most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you; greet Gastius and the remaining friends. Last day of February 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the Basel church, his honorable and beloved lord and brother. Basel.</p>
