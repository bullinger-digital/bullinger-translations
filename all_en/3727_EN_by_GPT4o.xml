      <p>Greetings to you again, most learned and in so many ways esteemed Bullinger, my dearest brother. I received your letter through the public courier of your city and without delay sent someone to bring me the books you requested from Mr. Heinrich Petri; however, he only sent me one, as all the other copies of the Theodosian Code had been distributed. I am sending this one, reinforced with a cover, through the courier, unless he refuses to accept it. When asked about the price, the printer demands half a florin, which I will pay as soon as I have recovered my health and can go out in public.</p>
      <p>I had written the enclosed letter the day before, intending to send it through a certain Englishman who was to travel to you, but he proved untrustworthy. I am feeling a little better now and hope for even better health.</p>
      <p>The Lord knows what He has planned for me; may His will be done. If He raises me up, I will write more extensively; now it seems to me that I have written an entire book.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 6, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the esteemed Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most revered lord. Zürich.</p>
