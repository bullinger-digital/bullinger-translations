    <p xml:id="regest1">The letters from Bullinger and [...] arrived at an extremely opportune time! For some of Basel's city leaders had sleepless nights due to terrible rumors. At first, it was said that a battle had taken place, which ended in favor of the Emperor [Charles V]; then, that on August 29, 40,000 men from both armies had fallen, with Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] having won. The second version was already better, but still caused dismay due to the large number of dead, as the Imperial forces can easily replace their losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- According to an Italian [...], 160,000 soldiers are said to have been conscripted for the Emperor in Italy. The version transmitted by Bullinger probably corresponds to a second stage of this news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- There is nothing more cruel and deceitful than the imperial ban letter against the pious princes [John Frederick of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse] and their followers, so that one wonders who should read these six sheets of paper. The pride of the devil is nothing against it! And the cruel raging of the "wolves" [bishops] among the sheep is child's play compared to the bloodthirsty ban by the tyrannical Emperor, which has no justified reason! But God will avenge that. May Christ grant courage to resist!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Unfortunately, Myconius can only repay Bullinger's book gifts [Commentary on Luke] with thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>S. How timely your letters arrived! For rumors had spread such horrors that some of our leaders spent sleepless nights. At first, it was reported that a battle had taken place and victory remained with the Emperor. Later, on the nearest Sunday, it was said that 40,000 from both armies had fallen and the victor was the Lord of Hesse. Although this was more acceptable, the number of the slain was still troubling, and the adversaries have the means to replenish their numbers.</p>

      <p>It is reported by an Italian that a few days ago, 160,000 soldiers were gathered throughout Italy as reinforcements for the Emperor. Indeed, what you write, I believe, is what the later rumor brought.</p>

      <p>Here finally comes the imperial destruction of the goods and pious princes and all who adhere to them in any way, by which they are forbidden water and fire. No one has ever seen anything more cruel. Six sheets of paper are filled (not in the form of a booklet) with lies, devotions, cruelty, and degradations so horrendous that it is a wonder there are those who read them. The pride of Lucifer is nothing compared to the pride of the Ghent man. The cruelty of wolves among sheep is child's play compared to what this tyrant does through this bloodthirsty interdiction without just cause; which the Lord knows! Therefore, I hope the same will soon avenge such foul and impious cruelty. I can speak no more on this matter. May Christ instill courage in good men to bravely despise lies and vindicate in the Lord.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you enrich me with books, venerable in the Lord! Therefore, I give you immortal thanks; for I can do nothing else. If I could, I would undoubtedly do so. Due to time, I cannot add more.</p>

      <p>Farewell with yours and Rudolf Gwalther. Basel, hastily, September 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Os. Myconius yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother and lord.</p>
