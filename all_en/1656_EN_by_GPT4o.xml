      <p>Grace and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Several times, as I attempted to write, esteemed patron, shame held me back, and indeed I am not unaware of how little modesty it shows for a man in a bad cause to seek the advocacy of a good, honest, and well-deserving man. But since I hope and am thoroughly convinced that my offense, which I committed against you all, the school authorities, and my teachers, can merit amnesty and forgiveness, I have finally overcome my shame and have not hesitated to seek pardon and forgiveness from your singular humanity and almost divine benevolence towards all who are devoted to true religion and honest arts. For I hope and fully trust that you will be persuadable and placable in this matter. I am not unaware and deeply regret that I have greatly offended your excellence by my silent and sudden departure, having been so liberally educated by your generosity and discipline for such a long time as your pupil. However, I hope the reasons for my journey are still known to you from the letters I left behind at home. Therefore, I ask and beseech your excellence to recall them to memory, to carefully consider them, and to deem my disobedience worthy of forgiveness, and thus to kindly receive me back into your protection and former grace when I return to my homeland by the grace and mercy of Almighty God. For since men are born for the common society of life, nothing is more fitting than to deserve well of others; just as we see in beasts a separation and perpetual love of solitude, because they do not need mutual assistance, so in men there is a love of society. Therefore, it is most according to nature to do good to others. Since you, venerable patron, have always done this for me, I fully trust that you will also act now in a way that will render me most devoted and ready in all things to you and all yours. For to help someone in these matters far surpasses the magnitude of other benefits; for this benefit pertains to the best part of man, than which nothing is more excellent, nor is anything more delightful than studies devoted to confirming it. If, therefore, gratitude can never be adequately returned for other services, how much more will it always be desired in this benefit of yours, and since benefits are considered greater the more utility they bring, what greater thing can be esteemed than your work bestowed upon me? For it is not only good for me, but it will also benefit many others who will enjoy it someday. Let other things be held in great esteem by others, but indeed, compared to those things by which intellect and prudence are stimulated, they are very small. Therefore, I know well and willingly confess, venerable patron, that I owe you very much and deeply regret that I cannot be sufficiently grateful.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I give you the greatest and never-dying thanks and pray to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, together with His co-eternal Son our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, that He may always be with you with His merciful blessing and increase both spiritual and bodily goods, so that you may have the ability to bestow as many benefits as possible and that this liberality may happily return to you before God; for He said with the most certain promise: Whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of these little ones, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, esteemed patron, that I cannot escape the suspicion of having contracted the Lutheran religion among many, since I have been for some time in a place where there are the fiercest defenders and champions of that religion. Therefore, I am greatly afflicted, especially since I am not conscious of having approved even the smallest point of that religion, let alone having contracted it. For I firmly believe and confess according to the Catholic faith: that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, suffered, was crucified, died for the whole human race, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven with a true body, and sits at the right hand of God the Father, reigning with equal power and glory with the eternal Father, from there to come to judge the living and the dead. I firmly confess and will confess this faith even to the last breath of life, nor will I allow it to be torn or shaken from my heart by any allurements or threats.</p>
      <p>To be able to do this more strongly and confidently, I pray to the most excellent and greatest God, that He may guide me with His Holy Spirit and protect and defend me against all false and Epicurean sects and religions, together with the whole assembly of our truly believing people, amen.</p>
      <p>Not with the mind and will, venerable patron, did I leave my dearest homeland, to desire to devote myself to the various customs, rites, and ceremonies of various nations and, having been imbued with them, finally to revisit my native lands, but rather to focus on those things, the knowledge of which may someday be useful to our church and republic. Therefore, with the greatest reverence I can, I ask and beseech you, esteemed patron, to remove that false and unjust suspicion, if there has been any, from the minds of my dearest and most respectfully esteemed teachers, and to signify my faith and confession to all according to your humanity. Furthermore, I also earnestly ask you, dearest patron, to always hold me, my affairs, and my studies as highly recommended to you, and, if it is not troublesome for you, to prescribe to me a rule and method of life and studies, according to which I may direct my course and efforts. For you know that we can easily slip and rather do everything wrongly than rightly from the just order. Nothing do I desire more than to have someone whose advice and judgment I may use in my studies; for it matters greatly in all things, but especially in the studies of letters, to have someone as a guide, who may disentangle what is entangled. For many things continually occur that considerably retard the progress of the learner. I would now add the course and method of my studies; but because I fear it may be shameful to trouble your most pleasant ears with a first and unlearned letter lacking all elegance of speech, I will defer it to a more convenient time. For when I perceive that my letters are pleasing and acceptable to you, I will give my utmost diligence and observance to ensure that, whenever I encounter a courier going to you, you may at least have some, if not many, letters from me.</p>
      <p>These are the things, esteemed patron, that I wished to write to you at this time, partly so that you may understand that I constantly persevere in the sincere and Catholic religion of our people, and partly so that, with this my mind and sincerity known, you may kindly receive me back into your former protection and grace.</p>
      <p>I have nothing of new matters, which are now being reported among us and which I judge worthy of your ears. You will be able to understand the state of this Saxon region better from the bearer of the letters himself, who will easily inform you of all the things that have been done here among us over the past two years. Furthermore, how Duke Maurice has placed garrisons in all the fortifications and cities of his entire dominion, lest any enemies invade the borders of his dominion in his absence, etc.</p>
      <p>The state of the academy is now not very commendable, because we are greatly hindered by the soldiers, of whom, if I am not mistaken, we have 400.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a plague threatens us, which certainly threatens the dispersion of the whole school; but to prevent this, we invoke the most excellent and greatest God, the creator and preserver of the human race, to protect it with His Holy Spirit against the devil and his instruments, who strive with all their might to utterly overthrow the schools and the whole church.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Please convey my most dutiful greetings to all the school authorities and my teachers in my name, especially to the venerable Mr. Pellican and the reverend Mr. Theodor Bibliander, to whom I would have gladly written now, had I not spared the courier. But I hope to write to them shortly; therefore, I ask you to have me excused with them. Also, greet your sons for me, namely Heinrich and Rudolf, who are most dear to me. Written hastily from the college in Wittenberg in the year of human salvation 1552 on Trinity Day.</p>
      <p>I ask that you consider this my uncomposed letter, lacking all elegance of speech, with fairness and kindness, and if possible, write back to me soon.</p>
      <p>Marcus Hoffmann of Zürich, your most obedient client and student.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in virtue, learning, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his patron and benefactor, always to be uniquely honored and respected.</p>
