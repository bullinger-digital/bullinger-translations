      <p>[...]re Challon, or Cabilonum, Schalun.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Queen of England, having sent a herald, has declared war on the Guise for Condé and that a large cavalry and infantry are setting out from the Palatinate, Saxony, Hesse, Lüneburg, etc., to aid Condé.</p>
      <p>It is confirmed that what I wrote about the victory of Lord von Aderes is true and that several from St. Gallen have been slain. We expect more news at any moment, and we know and hear that unimaginable massacres are taking place in France. Rumor now spreads that the Abbot of Hermetschwil is returning from the council, that the council is dissolved, at least due to hunger and scarcity; that the market is again denied to us from Milan, that riots are being stirred up in Bologna, and I don't know what else. I will believe that when I receive more detailed information from you.</p>
      <p>I received the 5th session printed and the material for the 6th session to be held on September 17th. If you can, please acquire for me the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sessions; nothing could be more pleasing to me. I hurried, painted poorly; please consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you and all ours. August 21, 1562. I did not reread.</p>
      <p>Yours, always.</p>
      <p>It is affirmed to be true at the same time that Lord de Susa, who entered Provence with 8,000 men, was routed and put to flight by Lord von Adreß, whose forces did not much exceed 4,000 men.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
