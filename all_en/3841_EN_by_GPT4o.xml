      <p>S. When our Fabricius was recently there, he was asked by our son Alexander to instruct the bookseller to bind your Decades and the sermons on the feast days of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ all into one volume most skillfully; however, he did not give any money because he had not received any from him. Therefore, he sends here this money, completing full and just bacios, which you call Constantienses, 35; for we think that this is enough; if not, we will send more with the next messenger, and whatever more is requested; just let the bookseller send the book and whatever he has received.</p>
      <p>The son, who bought the book, is most respectful of you and considers and keeps whatever comes from you as sacred relics not to be touched, whatever is written by your fingers. I therefore beseech you, to cheer him up with your kindness and to write in the book even this: "Heinrich Bullinger sends this book to Alexander Saluz, preacher of the Gospel of Christ in Thusis." For he will read the book more eagerly, being cheered by this, than if I, his father, were to urge him a hundred times to read this golden work, and it will be more pleasing to him than if he were given many gold coins by you. With such a small favor, I ask, most humane man, let us gratify a young man who is not at all bad.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is absolutely no news here that is worthy to be written to your excellence. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most humane of men, do not cease to love Philippus, your old friend. From Chur, January 16, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours in integrity, as always, Philipp Gallicius. To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most honorable to all good people. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
