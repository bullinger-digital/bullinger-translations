      <p>Greetings. Jacob Brenwald, to whom I had recently given letters to you as he was departing for Bern, did not pass through Bern, but now finally continues his intended journey to you.</p>
      <p>He will be a living letter; you will hear from him everything about his affairs and ours. His work is most pleasing and at the same time most useful and fruitful for our school.</p>
      <p>May the Lord support us and him in promoting the glory of His name. Therefore, you will bear it with a not unjust mind, venerable father, if it is not permitted to deal with you at greater length now.</p>
      <p>My father-in-law brought me your little book, that is, the one you sent me as a gift, for which I give you the greatest thanks; for nothing more pleasing could have happened to me.</p>
      <p>But as I had begun to read it, behold, our ministers, who snatch it from my hands and eagerly read it before me. They affirmed that the matter is explained much more clearly than ever before, and even that various questions are elegantly and clearly solved in it. Therefore, they also give you great thanks with me in this regard and pray to God with common prayers that He may preserve you safe for a long time for His church. Meanwhile, Mr. Beza continues diligently with the response to Brent, which he has promised us by letters that he will complete shortly. Life here is lived quite happily by God's grace, still free from any contagion of the plague, not so in Geneva; for there it gradually spreads.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>The rest, as I said, from Mr. Brenwald.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed father, with your entire family.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, September 22, 1564. Yours if his own, Blaise Marcuard.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, my lord to be embraced with the highest respect. In Zurich.</p>
