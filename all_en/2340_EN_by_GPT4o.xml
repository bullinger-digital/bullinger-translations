      <p>Greetings and best wishes. What you have instructed your son to do, most honorable Bullinger, to send my treatise on restraining heretics, transcribed to you, at least for the sake of exercising his own talent, I praise your paternal diligence and care; but as for the fact that he himself, (which, however, is easily forgivable for him as a young man and not yet sufficiently practiced) sends such a defective, distorted, and corrupted, and in many places false copy, so that it hardly has any form of my treatise, I am very sorry. He showed it to me as instructed; I began to correct it, but when I proceeded to read, I found the entire copy so corrupted and defective everywhere that it seemed not to be corrected, but rather a new one to be transcribed. I explained that if it had been allowed for me to order him or for him to obey my order, I would have instructed him not to send it in any way. Scarcely a third part of my treatise is there, and even that I hardly recognized as mine. This consoles me, that both your prudence and the obedience of your son, who, as much as he could, complied with your parental command, will consider it favorably, and that your judgment, as to what my treatise could be like, will easily judge even from such a false and distorted example. It is indeed not a distinguished work, but it is of a different form than the copy sent to you by your son. I will take care, when I respond to that book, which was recently published against our opinion, to have my entire treatise transcribed and sent to you as soon as possible, so that after hearing your judgment before the Frankfurt fair, if possible, it may be printed. Moreover, since I have nothing else new to write and it is not necessary to engage in superfluous words between us, I will bid you farewell. Farewell then, and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, July 12, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Hieronymus Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the learned and most excellent pastor of the church in Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most respected and esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
