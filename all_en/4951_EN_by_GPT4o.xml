      <p>S. What my lord Mayor Tscharner has discussed with our gracious lords, the mayors Müller, along with your reverence regarding the handling of these lands, is well known to you, my gracious lords, and therefore requires no further explanation. My lord Tscharner would have followed his agreement completely if the assembly had not been extended until the next Sunday before Galli, as I have already informed your reverence of all this. Furthermore, it is the decision and opinion of my lord Mayor Tscharner, as well as mine, subject to the improvement of my gracious lords of Zurich, whose manifold wisdom we gladly incorporate into our counsel (although we have sat over it for more than two hours): since this is a serious, important matter, which particularly concerns the honor of God, and consequently also the welfare not only of these lands but also of the entire Confederation, one might, with too much modesty, perhaps complicate the matter, since the people ask so many questions that they expect us to be confused, nothing would be more fruitful than for the four evangelical cities of Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen to address the matter with special seriousness and send a strong delegation to the assembly with instructions. For in our opinion, the five places do not need to be particularly shy, as they now know well what religion the evangelical cities are, to whom it is entirely appropriate to promote their religion. For why should it be denied to the evangelical cities to act against their oath and confederates, but allowed and permitted to the others in their dealings with foreign lords? For we see that they promote their religion to the best of their ability, without regard to anyone here. Why should we not also come together with loyalty and seriousness? If we do not think it is time yet, God have mercy, that one does not want to open one's eyes. However, our confederates from the five places cannot be so greatly angered by this, as it is to be assumed from all preceding causes that they will also send their delegation on this day. On the other hand, one must consider what fruitfulness and usefulness might follow if the four cities had their delegation here: firstly, it would break the evil-minded their counsel, who might otherwise say at home to their communities: our dear confederates from the five places must do this and that to us; so we do not know what we have to fear from the others, who never appeared and also never informed us what they intend regarding the council and other matters; if we were then to venture out on our own and give the envoys a negative answer, we might have sunk ourselves; the five places would grant us that, from and by the others we would have no comfort, as they never showed themselves in such important demands, etc. Haec non modo dicerent papistę ex professo, sed etiam qui se pro evangelicis gerunt et corrupti essent.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is unbelievable to you how the arrival of the evangelical envoys would delight the well-meaning in opposition and strengthen and encourage them in their good intentions. Item, the legates of the Pope and Philip, if they felt such seriousness, would also trust less in war and think better, seeing whom they had before them. There, the evangelical delegation need not be timid; it would only be necessary to admonish our people to proceed cautiously and not to let anything slip in these dangerous swift courses. The evangelicals might also especially remind Angelus Ricius of the dangerous courses with requests to hold back against his lord, King Philip, that he would be a good neighbor and establish peace and tranquility, etc. This seems to us to be quite achievable.</p>
      <p>If your reverence and our gracious lords of Zurich think otherwise, we must also let that happen. My lord Tscharner has instructed me to write to your reverence, hoping that you will also inform our gracious lord Müller about this matter and write confidentially to Lord Hansen Haller and other trusted ones about all this. However, it would be very good to handle things quietly so that our opponents do not have to suspect anything. Otherwise, both lords' delegations are here in Chur, intending, as I hear, to await the appointed day. A few days ago, someone from Constance passed through here; he secretly announced here as well as in Feldkirch that the bishop of Constance was dead; therefore, he was riding to Rome to win the bread of supplication for the one from Ems. Later, it was written to Mr. Georgius Carly from the butchers, whose blood relative he is, that the bishop was still alive but very weak. Interim non audimus, an mortuus sit an v[ivus]; should he recover and the one from Ems ride out on the post, it would be quite certain for him and he would have to bear the mockery to his detriment.</p>
      <p>For now, nothing further, may God keep your reverence in all good. Chur, September 8, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>S. Haec, reverend father, I had already written before, while eagerly awaiting yours; for today is the 8th of this month and all the other merchants returned yesterday, and now evening is approaching. Therefore, as I was about to seal this letter, behold, yours arrived along with the booklets, one of which you sent to Mr. Planta, the other to me.</p>
      <p>Indeed, by giving me your writings, you abundantly declare your goodwill towards me, and now you add to your benefits. I will read them most eagerly; for I have already read Brentius, to whom Mr. Martyr responds, who certainly seems to distrust the cause he is dealing with, as he proceeds with such hesitation. Mr. Philippus, my colleague, has promised to respond to your writing and the whole Waldensian matter, and I will inform you about everything else if it seems right to you; but at another time, for now, I cannot. You see, however, with what difficulties we are struggling; we cannot now undertake these matters with any fruit, which we would very much like to do. Among the brothers, at least, a contribution should now be made to the ministers.</p>
      <p>But the Italian brothers are supported by the contribution of the churches, which are small and not very numerous.</p>
      <p>In the rest of the Confederation, there is such poverty and such a narrow family situation that they are struggling with dire hunger and often have to be supported by me. Mr. Philippus, my colleague, himself needs a contribution, which seems strange to you, I know. Now you see what is left for us, where we must now indeed seek refuge.</p>
      <p>Since the Italian brothers intend to present themselves at the assemblies, they will incur great expenses, as they themselves are very poor. If God, however, blesses our efforts at these assemblies, we will seek a sacrifice of praise from everywhere, although I already foresee that it will be very small. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, for as long and as happily as possible. Chur, the day as above.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man distinguished in learning, piety, and humanity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron always to be honored. To Mr. H. Bullinger, Zurich.</p>
