      <p>Greetings. The young men who are about to leave asked me to provide a testimony of their life spent with us, which I thought was a duty I should perform all the more readily, as I was more convinced that they are most worthy of an honorable testimony. I therefore testify with my own hand that these three young men, now returning to you, your stipendiaries, have conducted themselves most honorably in all respects and have earned considerable praise for their modesty among us, as indeed have all the others who remained; as for the others who have recently come to us, I dare not yet pronounce anything, but I have conceived the greatest hope for them as well, that they too will conduct themselves no less honorably, and I will do my utmost to ensure that they are not led astray, and I am confident that they will readily obey me. Your son is living excellently with Doctor Hyperius, and there is no need for you to be concerned about him; for he surpasses all others in modesty and piety, and he is so prudent that he undertakes nothing rashly, and he takes care not to burden you with expenses beyond what is proper. I wish, however, that your little book had already been published on that question of our most illustrious prince and delivered through your son. For there would have been no doubt that it would have contributed some support to his studies and relieved you, his parent, of a heavier burden, nor do I think that the prohibition on accepting money can or should be extended to this, so that it is not permissible for sons living under a most remote prince to accept the generosity towards themselves or rather towards their studies from the most friendly prince, I say. As for the colloquy at Worms, I do not know what to hope for; I fear, however, that the victory for the French may be ruinous and that the discord among us... the Wittenbergers, inflamed by the zeal of some of the more obtuse Saxons, may have added much or even contumacy to the adversaries, who are already more than sufficiently impudent and obstinate and indeed proud. I am also suspicious of that too harsh and unworthy obligation for future sacred colloquies, by which none of those who attended the colloquy is allowed to signify the least thing to others, whether it proceeded or what anyone said or thought. Indeed, what kind of monstrosity breeds such a religious silence about such great matters, unless my mind deceives me, this colloquy was permitted and undertaken by the adversaries in pretence, namely so that by this show of obedience they might fleece us of money to be collected (if it pleases the gods) for expelling... and so that no benefit may result from it, they evidently wish the light found to be hidden under a table and darkness to be cast over the light and truth to be obscured by lies. Certainly, unless I am mistaken, they will boast that they have prevailed over us, with us scarcely daring to mutter due to a certain religious promise and sworn silence. But, since the cause is the Lord's, it does not happen as we dream, unless our ingratitude and prevarication, as is indeed to be feared, stand in the way. Farewell, reverend man.</p>
      <p>Given at Marburg on the 25th of September in the year 1557. Greet in my name Martyr, Bibliander, Gwalter, Wolf, and the other good and learned men.</p>
      <p>Yours, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and by far the most worthy minister of the church of Zürich, his most reverend lord. Zürich.</p>
