      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received the sermon on the Lord's Supper, most illustrious and dearest Bullinger, the day after Easter; for I hear that before it was returned to me, it was held for a long time by someone. I have read it and approve it, what do I say, I approve it, indeed I accept it with all my heart and I thank you, because I see that you persevere in loving me and are not deterred by any voices and rumors from preserving our old friendship. If I do the same towards you more rarely, you should not attribute it to negligence or lack of love, but rather to my reverence towards you and modesty, and also to your very serious and innumerable occupations, with which I know you are almost overwhelmed in your very extensive and holy office. For I love you and respect you and preserve your memory immortal with me due to your greatest merits. Therefore, I am eager to know about you, your most holy wife, your children, and relatives, how and how well they are doing, wherever they may be in the world. You will do me a very great favor if you inform me about these things, especially about those who are still abroad in Germany or Poland, whether they are studying, progressing, and what kind of studies they are pursuing, if it is permissible. Here there is nothing else new, except that the opinion, about which I have spoken before, is gradually spreading, with the same people as before promoting it. "Resist the beginnings," he said; "medicine is prepared too late"; we sometimes feel this. Farewell and in my name and my wife's name, lovingly greet you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, 14th day before the calends of May 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours always, C[aelius] S[ecundus] signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and best man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed master. In Zürich.</p>
