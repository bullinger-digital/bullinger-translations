      <p>Oh Heinrich, by the grace of God, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Arch-Steward and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke in Lower and Upper Bavaria, etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand. Honorable, dear, faithful one. We have received credible information from more than one source that during the recent Holy Week, when you preached about the venerable supper of our Lord Jesus Christ, you condemned the Zwinglian error and sect, as well as introduced teachings about baptism that are unfounded in scripture, thus teaching against our church order, which is in agreement with and founded upon the Holy Scripture. This has resulted in various misunderstandings and offenses arising among our preachers and subjects. Considering this, since you have been appointed according to our church order and have not raised any objections, and given our gracious written warnings and commands sent to you, we cannot understand how you could have done this with any justification or reason. Since it is not appropriate for us, for the sake of our conscience and to prevent offensive and harmful misunderstandings, to look on any longer if this is the case, and since you are to be heard according to your necessity, we hereby command you to arrange to come to our chancery in Heidelberg to give an account of your teachings, as you are obliged to do, and to await our further decision. This is our will and intention.</p>
      <p>Given in Speyer on the 10th of May in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Upon the advice of Mr. Georg Fr√∂lich, I have thus answered and written to the prince:</p>
      <p>Illustrious, high-born Elector and Lord, to your Electoral Grace, I offer my humble willing service along with earnest prayers to God beforehand. Most gracious Lord, your Electoral Grace wrote on the 10th day of this month from Speyer, in which I am required to give an account of my teachings in your Electoral Grace's chancery in Heidelberg, etc. I have read this with all humility, yet with a troubled mind and heart; for I was of the humble hope that since your Electoral Grace had previously intended that I should compose my sermons on the holy venerable sacrament of the body and blood of Christ our Lord in writing, your Electoral Grace would have allowed me to remain at this time. However, I can understand that there are so many adversaries to the truth and pious people that your Electoral Grace has been moved to this seriousness. Well, my faithful God and Lord will govern it, help me and all faithful servants of pure doctrine to withstand and maintain the fight. The matter is His and not mine. He has protected me thus far from false and damnable doctrine and will continue to do so, even to the point that my enemies must be ashamed of it.</p>
      <p>Most gracious Elector and Lord, I have just returned from Switzerland today and, as an old man of good years, have become so weak that I cannot undertake the journey. I have also previously sent my provisions to Zurich and exhausted all my resources, so I do not know how to complete this journey. Not only love and desire for the arts but also my weak means and the concern for my wife and dear children have driven me to bring together the three powerful books of military pieces with unspeakable effort and labor, and I have recently translated Idacius Clarus, Marius Victorinus, and Athanasius on the holy Trinity of God, and have dedicated all this solely to your Electoral Grace for some praise and remembrance, hoping to find in your Electoral Grace, as the most renowned patron and lover of all honorable arts, a gracious lord. I humbly ask through God that your Electoral Grace will graciously consider the glorious church that sent me and my person, so that honorable people are not belittled or condemned by ignorant, hateful slanderers. To see and hear my delivered sermons (which I will write down and present to your Electoral Grace as soon as possible) above all things. If your Electoral Grace does not change your mind regarding my presentation, I am willing and ready to appear wherever your Electoral Grace decides, provided that no force is used against me and I can provide for the journey with reasonable provisions. I could not and would not know how to do it at my own expense, as God well knows. I humbly hope that your Electoral Grace will be and remain my most gracious lord, and I ask for the most gracious response.</p>
      <p>Given in Lauingen on the 15th of May in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Electoral Grace's humble church servant in Lauingen, Lorenz Agricola, etc.</p>
      <p>This is the copy of the prince's letter and my response to it. I do not know what will come of it. The copy has its prejudices, indicating the prince's embittered and confused mind against me.</p>
      <p>I have dared, if it pleases God, to bear the case...? with my great detrimental damage and will end grace and favor, pay and service together. So soon is the favor and service of lords gone; so much power has the tongue of deceit and fraud everywhere, especially in the court of princes. So highly is the true and lively doctrine of our religion valued, etc. I ask that you will act in this matter, also show advice and help to my gracious lord and me, so that it does not happen to me as to many others who have been set between two stools on the hearth, first in my old age with untrained children undeservedly cast into misery, etc., but that my zeal for the truth and willing mind, also considering my dangerous and harmful journey now to many places, may be regarded for the welfare of my gracious lord, etc., written to the Elector, and undertaken to quiet him in some way, etc., to save our innocence and not be declared as damned sectarians, etc.</p>
