      <p>Grace and peace from God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Although I have so far restrained my indignation, most venerable and esteemed father and patron, so as not to trouble you, for I am aware of my importunity, which almost exceeds into madness unless I first thoroughly digest the matter by which I am offended. But now I cannot restrain myself, so that I may at least unburden myself in part, if I entrust it to your faithful heart. It has tormented me most bitterly and ulcerated my heart that the arrival of Mr. Musculus to us has been hindered by the treachery and clandestine denunciations of certain malicious individuals; I had hoped that our endeavor would meet with success and that the outcome would correspond to our efforts. But having been cast down and utterly overthrown from my conceived hope, I grieve deeply. I experience that, although some pretend to be humble, they nevertheless conceal great arrogance, fearing that the illustrious brilliance of the learned might pierce their dull eyes like those of a night owl, as if the matter were an empire that cannot endure a partner. It is true that the magistrate reproves a man, so we are intoxicated by our own folly, that nothing pleases us but our own club, and jackdaws persuade themselves they surpass nightingales. From the heart, I hate and abhor arrogance and pride, especially that which strives to commend itself to others under the guise of humility, etc. I know myself, that in myself I am nothing, unless one considers me a worm, who ought to be bound to the service of all the pious.</p>
      <p>But I am excessively criticized as dialectical and rhetorical by those who are mute in the arena and have become stiff to every movement, etc. The duty of the school is most burdensome to me, and therefore I have resigned this function to Mr. Questor, the schoolmaster, and what I am doing now is to comply with Mr. Questor until they conveniently find another.</p>
      <p>I would rather the entrails of the malevolent burst than be harassed by their games, since they have not labored with all their desires to compare to such a great man. Mr. Haller conducts himself excellently; he is serious and accepted by all, and he is faithful without any deceit and has a thoroughly candid heart, which I consider it irreligious and a furious madness to deceive.</p>
      <p>Our teeth still ache from this bitter grape, that we did not succeed. May God deign to be present and moderate all things, lest His name and majesty be offended. As for the Emperor, we await our exploration; certainly, the rod of the Lord is at hand; I confess we have all deserved it and summoned it by our sins, who through our crime do not allow Jove to lay down his angry thunderbolts. The younger Duke of Savoy has sought his region or that we may deal with him by law before the Swiss; we are inquiring into old actions and writings; the matter must be tried and resolved by law; for all the subjects detest this region, so that they do not take up arms in his name; for he nourishes and promotes young lords with prefectures. The people of Constance are indignant at being deserted in open robbery, who would have gladly brought them assistance and now grieve for those abandoned.

I feel that everything with us is more disturbed than anyone would easily believe; I know the minds and characters of men; but whatever it is, we are tested by fire.</p>
      <p>No virtue exists without blood and grief. However much they rage, riot, and roar against Christ, we will triumph by dying, etc. Take it in good part; I wrote hastily with Valentinus already prepared for departure and standing by. Greet all the learned and pious, both consuls Mr. Gwalther, Pellicanus, Theodor, Werdmüller, and the rest. Farewell in Christ, best regards to your entire family.</p>
      <p>Given on Friday after Bartholomew's day in the year 48. Your little client Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and vigilant and at the same time most renowned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zürich, his venerable patron in the Lord most esteemed.</p>
