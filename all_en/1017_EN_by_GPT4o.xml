      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I thank you for these new things.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick cannot acquire captains suitable for military affairs; he refuses the inexperienced. He sent a certain soldier to Strasbourg, who hired a captain for a large sum of money, but found few soldiers willing to serve under such an unfortunate leader.</p>
      <p>They say they do not want to serve a timid and unfortunate prince in military matters and do not want to harm the pious confessors of Christ in any way. They are not unaware that the prince shamefully abandoned the soldiers fighting in the battle line and led them to slaughter; moreover, they prefer to hide at home in winter rather than bear arms in the cold and serve such a prince who lacks money. Perhaps he fears that a great loss will be inflicted by the cities of Saxony after the defeat; therefore, I believe that this duke has already been defeated a second time.</p>
      <p>Some say that the hand of God touched the Emperor, so that he was mute for three days and did not leave his bed. Perhaps he intended something against the gospel of God, and in the midst of consultation, the Lord warned him not to proceed further unless he wishes to die.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they say the Emperor is very ill-disposed towards Prince Maurice; for he has private consultations with King Ferdinand against the Emperor's power.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is seeking the imperial dignity after the death of his brother; therefore, he recalled his son Maximilian from Spain; we will see amazing things in the summer.</p>
      <p>They say the Landgrave is dead, but the manner of his death is still unknown; some say he perished by poison, others say he was consumed by excessive grief.</p>
      <p>In addition, rumors spread that Granvelle has passed away, who was the soul of the Emperor, and I do not think the Emperor will live long after losing his soul. In Halle, Saxony, they say blood flowed from a very clear spring for three days, astonishing all who saw this prodigy.</p>
      <p>You should know that Nausea was in Freiburg; for he has a rich provostship in Waldkirch, and he was instructed from the court to return home, as the Turk is increasing his army. As soon as he read the letters, he bid farewell to his friends there and left in great haste, lest the Spanish army, which was sent to Vienna, occupy his house. I have no business with Nausea, nor have I ever greeted him; but if he had come to Basel, I would have approached him and spoken with him due to the old friendship we once had in Mainz. More from Myconius.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, September 2, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>I write this to you: Someone from Zurich spread the word in Basel that Bibliander holds the doctrine of Pelagius on free will and wants to defend it against anyone as if it were founded on divine scriptures. However, I never wanted to believe this, nor will I believe it; they have enemies who dare to criticize his doctrine, which they cannot imitate. Mr. Schertlin sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>Read, if you want to waste time, the chronography of our Pantaleon, who dares whatever he thinks, and consider with what calculation you count the years.</p>
      <p>I will write extensively about the books published at this fair shortly. To the honorable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, kind lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
