    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though the Zurich council diligently transmits the news coming from Constance to the St. Gallen council, Bullinger wants to report what Hartmann von Hallwyl let him know in a letter [with No. 2538], after he returned to Bern from his visit to the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Hallwyl left Donauwörth on August 10. On that day, however, he dined with the Landgrave, who spoke honorably of Zwingli during the conversation. He also sent his regards to Bullinger, asked him to call upon the [Zurich] churches to pray, and to inform his authorities that the war has religious reasons and is not due to political disobedience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Hallwyl also reported on the extraordinary strength of the [alliance's] forces: 120 small and large cannons, 116 companies, and about 8000 cavalrymen. The [Schmalkaldic League] has publicly declared war on the Emperor [Charles V.] through a herald. Their troops, among whom good conduct is said to prevail, set out on August 10. The Emperor is said to be staying in Landshut and to have an army of 30,000 men. During the conversation, the Landgrave emphasized that he is ready to free the people from the Antichrist for Christ and to risk everything, including his life, in the process.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Vadian will learn more from the Zurich councilors. Meanwhile, Bullinger is surprised by the prolonged silence of his correspondent. He should finally get in touch with his friend again!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Today, Bullinger is writing the preface to his commentary on Luke. The work will be available in a few days.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Although the magistrates diligently communicate to you what they receive from Constance, I still wanted to share with your kindness what Hartmann von Hallwyl, a truly noble man, had written to me upon his return from the Landgrave on August 17.</p>
      <p>On August 10, he departed from Donauwörth and returned home to Bern. On that day, he dined with the Landgrave under his tent. The Landgrave spoke much about Zwingli with Hallwyl, asked many questions, praised Zwingli, and sent his regards to me. He asked that I urge the church to call upon God for grace and to inform my lords (the council) that the Emperor's actions are about religion and monarchy, not about disobedience, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Hallwyl reports and has written about an extraordinary armament, the likes of which have rarely been seen: 120 small and large cannons on wheels, 116 companies, about 8000 cavalrymen; a beautiful, well-equipped force. They have bravely declared war on the Emperor and sent the declaration with a trumpeter. On August 10, they set out against him. He is said to be encamped at Landshut, with a force of 30,000 strong. The Landgrave says he has everything to gain in this war, nothing to lose; for if he wins, it is for Christ and his church; if he loses, he dies for Christ and his church, and the cause is no less Christ's, along with the war; for he stakes his life on freeing the people from the power of the Antichrist or dying. May God grant him grace.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Hallwyl says that there is neither drinking nor swearing among them, but rather vigilance, seriousness, and prayer. This is what I have.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will learn everything more fully from the letters of our magistrates. I cannot sufficiently marvel at your persistent silence. Therefore, break the delay and silence and write to your most observant friend.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>

      <p>Today I am writing the preface to the 9 books of commentaries on the Gospel according to Luke, which will be published in these days.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 20, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of St. Gallen, his ever-honored lord. St. Gallen.</p>
