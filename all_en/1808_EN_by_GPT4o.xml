      <p>Greetings. Beza sends these seventeen crowns to you, for what reason, you undoubtedly know, I do not know; he only asks me to safely transmit them to you. Regarding other matters, our people will report, and since they will be living letters to you, I do not wish to trouble you with more at this time. Farewell. All of ours greet you, especially those whom our Gwalther will mention to you by name. May all of yours be well; especially your household, to which, in the name of my wife and family, you will convey many greetings. Bern, February 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] J[oannes] Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dear and esteemed lord and compatriot. In Zürich.</p>
