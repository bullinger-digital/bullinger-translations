      <p>Greetings. I do not think it is unknown to you what Justus Velsius has done among us and how he departed, as it was publicly noted by Borrhaus. I do not doubt that he is known to you, especially through the most illustrious man Peter Martyr as an interpreter, for many years now. What he has done among you, how he was received and dismissed by you, although I can easily surmise from the impudent and arrogant actions he displayed among us, it would still be appreciated if you could inform me about it, if only it is possible during your leisure, which I know you have very little of. For I would not want to be a bother to you, occupied with honorable studies, especially concerning Velsius, the disturber of pious men and consciences, whom through his so-called perfect faith, which he feigns through hypocrisy, drives to despair rather than alleviates in any way, while he demands the renewal and regeneration of all parts of the body, soul, and mind in man, removing the war of the flesh against the spirit through concupiscence, in our justification and teaches that it already happens in this age.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on him, and may Christ the physician heal this madness of his with Hellebore, which he needs, not born in Anticyra, but in that heavenly garden, and may He retain us and His beloved bride, the church, in the saving doctrine, through which we may glorify the name of God the Father in the Son and procure the salvation of the elect, according to His mercy.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, that Jew asked me to commend him to you and the ministers of the Zürich church [...].</p>
      <p>Basel, July 16.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zürich church, to be respected as a brother.</p>
