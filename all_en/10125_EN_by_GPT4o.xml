    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Bucer's accusation that the people of Zurich behaved disloyally during and after the Second Peace of Kappel, Bullinger emphasizes that the peace is in accordance with the old Swiss confederation treaties and also provides for the restitution of the Abbot of St. Gallen. However, there is a difference in legal opinion between Zurich and Bern on one side and Lucerne on the other regarding the permissibility of the claim that human ordinances are inventions of the devil. There will be a legal decision on this question.</p>

      <p>I have read, most learned Bucer, that very pious letter of yours written to our Leo, in which there is nothing that I am not compelled to admire greatly and embrace. You accuse our disloyalty, which we abhor not so much because it is disloyalty, but because it is composed of the evil arts, the inconstancy of our allies, and the violence of our enemies. You advise that we encourage our people to uphold truth and faith, which we do quite diligently, as much as the Almighty has granted us grace, but it is too late. For then, as Hannibal said to the Carthaginians, we should have wept or died when we accepted those very harsh conditions of peace. In that peace, the Abbot of St. Gallen was freed from exile and restored to his position. The same peace offered the impious an opportunity to revive the foolish ceremonies of the Pope, if there are any among those whom we have subjected to common rule with the Five Cantons. In that peace, the old Swiss confederation treaties were renewed, which are so established that in those common provinces, if most people tell the truth, the votes of the majority prevail, and therefore the religion of faith is now free among all. However, a question worthy of a judge arises among the provincials, namely, he has violated the conditions of peace who said that human ordinances are inventions of the devil. Here, the judgment of the Swiss senators, who convene to judge the causes of the provincials, will be awaited. Therefore, the eight cantons convene, the case is presented. The Zurich judge considers that this is the opinion of Paul, not to be condemned by man, and therefore the accused should also be acquitted, as he has not violated the conditions of peace, having confessed his faith, which the peace makes free. The same judgment is made by Bern. But Lucerne adds that the words are quite harsh and impiously hurled against the Catholic faith, of which they are worshippers and defenders, and therefore the peace has been sinned against and the accused should be fined.</p>
