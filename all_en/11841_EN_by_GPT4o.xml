    <p xml:id="regest1">Is thankful to God that he has found such an excellent woman [Küngold von Schönau], whose piety and good conduct Bullinger recommended to him, [for marriage to his son Samuel]; if he were only concerned with temporal goods, he would not have needed to inquire so far and wide; asks Bullinger to convey his thanks to the parents and assure them of his goodwill; if they do not object to his opinion on the agreed marriage contract, they should set a suitable day after October 28 [as the wedding date], on which he intends to appear together with his relatives [in Zurich]. Regarding the church attendance and the return, Peter [Fuchs] will write to Bullinger; apologizes for his delayed response.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord, with the offering of all goodwill of my ability beforehand, reverend, highly learned, especially beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>I am once again informed of your unwavering love and loyalty, which you show to me and mine. May the Almighty God be your reward, for I can in no way repay you (compensate) for such. And since you assure me of so much piety and godliness and good conduct on the part of the daughter (for which I then completely place my trust), I give praise and thanks to Almighty God for sending me such a person, whom I have sincerely desired from God. For if piety and godliness were not dearer to me than much temporal goods, I would not have inquired so far and wide. Therefore, I earnestly ask you to convey my highest thanks to the pious parents of the daughter, along with her honorable relatives, for the honor, love, and friendship they have shown me in this matter, along with the great confidence and trust they have in me; I will (with God's help) never forget to repay this to the good daughter, also for her relatives, in the future according to my ability. On this matter, I have briefly set forth my opinion and desire on the eloquence and articles you have agreed upon; I hope the honorable relatives will not find this inappropriate; yet I am always willing to be guided by better advice, and if it pleases them (as I hope), they may set a friendly day after Simon and Jude, on which it will be convenient for them, I will (God willing) appear together with some of my relatives and complete the matter in the name of God. Regarding the church attendance and the return, I have instructed my good friend Peter to write to you, seeking your faithful advice in this matter.</p>
      <p>I ask you lastly to excuse my delayed response, as I have recently returned home, and autumn has quickly set in, so I have been overwhelmed. With this, I commend you faithfully to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>From Biel, Thursday, October 4, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely</p>
      <p>Niklaus Wyttenbach.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, my honorable lord, to his hands.</p>
