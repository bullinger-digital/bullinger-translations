      <p>Greetings in the Lord. In what state the affairs of the Württemberg princes are, dearest brother, you can easily infer from the death of the senior duke and indeed from the letters sent to you by our prince in recent days.</p>
      <p>The matter concerning Lord Christoph as heir with King Ferdinand, and us with the Emperor, is not unknown to us. If these were settled and concluded, I would not doubt that it would be well with us by the grace of the best and greatest. That this may happen according to the will of our heavenly Father, for His glory and the salvation of our souls, it must be prayed for with utmost effort, diligence, and zeal. In this matter, I think it is extremely necessary that all brothers in sermons and solitary prayers do not cease to knock at the Lord's door, so that He may direct and arrange everything for His glory and the salvation of the princes. Farewell excellently. Basel, 13th of November, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Stier.</p>
      <p>Duke Ulrich died on the morning of November 6th between 5 and 6 o'clock, 1550. Let me know the price for our son's clothes, which you owe. Again, farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger.</p>
      <p>While I was closing yours in the presence of Nikolaus König, letters from Peter Tossanus, our dearest brother, were delivered to me, indicating that the state of the Montbéliard church is in great danger because of the Bishop of Besançon and the Burgundians. The brothers there debated whether they should greet and return the greetings of the impious priests, and they agreed not to, and they wish to know my opinion. I pray that you too, if you have time, write your opinion to me, etc.</p>
      <p>No discord appears.</p>
