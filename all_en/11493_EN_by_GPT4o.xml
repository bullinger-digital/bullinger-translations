If Bullinger is not currently preparing a writing on the divinity of Christ, he should heed the advice of Capito in the enclosed letter; Zwick has also previously advised him to address the topic on occasion under a different title, as Bucer did in his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans or Bullinger himself in the commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. He recommends the messenger. He requests the return of Capito's letter. The sermons of Ambrosius [Blarer] in Tübingen arouse the envy of the local theologians.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I could not inform you sooner of my thoughts. Now, however, I am sending some foolish, tasteless, and quite unorganized ones, which, having been read, I would wish for you to return. For they will serve you for nothing else than to more conveniently counter some differing opinion.</p>
      <p>But if you do not have under the press what you have compiled on the divinity of Christ, I would certainly believe it necessary to heed Capito's advice, as I am sending his letter to you for reading. It was also my advice in previous letters that you address this matter under a different or altered title, as Bucer did in his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, and as you did in the commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. I commend this messenger to you. He has some business with an unknown matron; do not hesitate to assist him wherever you can.</p>
      <p>I am sending Capito's letters only for you to read, but they must be returned. Ambrosius in Tübingen preaches with great envy from the local theologians.</p>
      <p>But now read other letters.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving pastor of the church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
