      <p>From Milan, it is reported with the utmost certainty that peace has been made in France. It is written from Chiavenna that soldiers are being enlisted in Como and Milan for the Spaniard; under penalty of death, it is forbidden for anyone to transport grain into Rhaetia. A proclamation was made in Milan that no Lutheran, whoever he may be or for whatever reason he may have come, is to be received in hospitality under penalty of 50 crowns.</p>
      <p>In the Upper Engadine, the entire valley was shaken and terrified by a dreadful prodigy. On the morning of June 27th, around 5 to 6 o'clock, they saw the sun sprinkled with various colors, and also green, red, blood-colored, and tawny globes engaging in a spherical battle in the air with remarkable force, as if cannons were being fired. The pastor of this place saw this, documented it in writing, and described to us the dreadful nature of this prodigy. We may send it elsewhere for printing.</p>
      <p>On July 8th, around 5 in the evening, while I was standing in my study to take down books that I have arranged in order, I felt a significant earthquake, from which I was greatly shaken and thought another would perform my duty for me, since both the books and the place where I was standing seemed to be moving. On July 11th, we bade farewell to the synod, as we were left without any support from the magistrate and the brothers cannot bear the expenses.</p>
      <p>Regarding our public affairs, I scarcely have anything to write. The assembly indeed decreed according to the wishes of the Swiss; but whether everything will be ratified by the communities will be heard today or tomorrow, when the votes have been collected. 1573, July 14th.</p>
