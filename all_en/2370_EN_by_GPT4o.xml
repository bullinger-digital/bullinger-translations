      <p>S. D. Our Lord Jesus Christ not only requires the faithful to support his exiles, but also to commend them to all the pious and to help them in any way they can by advocating their cause everywhere. For this reason, it will not be displeasing to commend your English exiles, whom our most honorable magistrate has received here and to whom we sincerely show favor, to your piety as well. They have lived among us thus far in sincere fear of God, in true piety, in diligent prayers, in holy discipline, and in purity and innocence of life. To no one, as far as we know, have they given any occasion for offense, nor have they been troublesome to anyone; all the pious love them; they are so devoted to the studies of good and divine literature and make such progress that a most abundant fruit cannot but be expected from them. If they continue as they have begun, there is no doubt that they will be of benefit and ornament to the renowned kingdom of England. However, even if England does not now care for them or their progress in piety and letters, we still hope that there will be other and indeed better times: especially since we see that there is a very frequent change of affairs in kingdoms; and then Christ's grace is denied to no one, so that he who was once a most ardent persecutor of Christ and the gospel soon becomes a most ardent preacher of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will have acted most prudently and piously, dear brothers and friends, if you do not withhold your support from those who have deserved well, who are of the highest hope, and who are in need of assistance as members of Christ. You know how much praise and glory Abdias, the steward of the impious King Ahab, prepared for himself before God and men, because, at the greatest risk to his possessions and life, living in difficult times when Queen Jezebel thought to destroy all the prophets of God either by the sword or by famine, he even maintained entire colleges of prophets in caves and hidden places. And indeed, those of your people are so devoid of luxury that they seem to prudent people to even deprive themselves of what is necessary for sustaining life, and to live too frugally. Would that many among us had the ability, which otherwise there was the will, to exercise beneficence: for then they would abound more. But since the Lord has blessed you and granted you greater means, and has also given you this opportune occasion to do good to your people, your charity understands what an acceptable sacrifice to God you offer, and how much you increase your resources, if you continue to be generous to those of your people, the true members of Christ.</p>
      <p>For you recognize, according to your piety, that the holy apostle of Christ, Paul, in more than one place calls the contribution made by the wealthier to the exiles, and those suffering want for the sake of Christ's gospel, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and pleasing sacrifice to God. The same apostle says, "My God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus." For the same one elsewhere says, "God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: as it is written, 'He has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.'" Certainly, in the gospel, the Lord Jesus himself says in clear words, "He who receives you receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me. He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward." For elsewhere the same Lord says, "I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in; I was naked, and you clothed me, etc. Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." Christ the Lord promises all kinds of blessings and a blessed life to such people. For it is also read that David sang, "Blessed is the man who considers the poor and needy: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he will be blessed on the earth, and you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.</p>
      <p>The Lord will strengthen him on his bed of illness; you will sustain him on his sickbed, etc." All the words of God are true, firm, and indubitable. For heaven and earth will pass away; the eternal word of God will not pass away, nor will a jot or tittle fall from it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, believing these most certain pronouncements of God; strive, dear brothers and friends in the Lord, to prepare for yourselves a rich and abundant harvest on that day with copious seed and generous contribution, through Christ our Lord. Live and farewell, and kindly accept this exhortation of ours from us, your friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 24, 1554.</p>
