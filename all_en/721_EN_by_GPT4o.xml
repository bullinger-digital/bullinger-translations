      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, greetings and best wishes. Richard Cox, the royal majesty's tutor and the archchancellor of the city of Oxford, wishes to testify with my signature that he has hastily written this letter to you, being pressed by the greatest and most urgent matters, which I attest before God and men. Furthermore, most revered father in Christ, I want to inform you through me that the religion given to us by Christ is proceeding happily and prosperously, and that the Antichrist, in this harsh and dangerous time, has been once again overthrown by the common judgment of all the nobles of all England. Not only has the religion adopted last year been judged true by them, but also a punishment twice as severe has been established for those who are negligent, which I can write to you as a most certain fact. Therefore, there is nothing for the good to fear, nothing for the papists to hope for from their sacrilegious mass. The Lord is present with His church and does not allow it to be disturbed or afflicted beyond what it can bear. If this had not been done in this turbulent time, good God, what evils, what disturbances would the papists have caused us! But enough of this.</p>
      <p>Petrus Martyr and Bernardino Ochino, as well as Schinner and Wullock, wanted to send you their many greetings from here.</p>
      <p>Farewell and forgive the brevity of the letter.</p>
      <p>Given hastily in Cox's chamber on October 22, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes von Ulm, Several books written by you have recently been translated into English, etc. Bucer is silent.</p>
      <p>I would also like, if it is not too much trouble for you, for you to respond briefly to what I mentioned in my last letter. May I perish miserably if on this very day the Duke of Dorset did not show himself most gracious towards me, having understood that I was recommended to him by you through Cox. Good God, what will he not do for your favor? But Thomas Caius, a man most learned in Latin and Greek, will write to you more fully about this shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright theologian, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
