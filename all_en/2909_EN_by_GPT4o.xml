      <p>Greetings. Assist the bearer of this letter with your advice, if it can be done anywhere, in the name of God and myself, my dearest brother. I am otherwise moderately well with my whole family. Daily and eagerly I expect the remainder that is left on the Apocalypse. Send it, my Bullinger, and refresh your old Gervasius. I am so overwhelmed with almost infinite tasks that I cannot write more due to the messenger's hasty departure. At least embrace this one, whom I commend to your charity, as my own flesh. Farewell, incomparable friend. Greet your family for me.</p>
      <p>Given on the 1st of May in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of ZÃ¼rich, lord brother, and dearest old friend.</p>
