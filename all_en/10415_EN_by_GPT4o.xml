    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his long silence due to being overwhelmed with work. Not the people of Zurich with their successful progress in studies, but many Swabian churches, over which he watches, need his letters. Schwenckfeld is troubling the churches and fully supports a booklet, which Blarer sends in a copy sent to him by Gervasius Schuler. Does not want to pass on war rumors, but what the young Eberhard von "Liecht", on behalf of Landgrave Philipp of Hesse, reported in Konstanz is communicated in Blarer's letter to Heinrich von Ulm, who is to forward it to Bullinger through the same messenger. Hopes for the success of Princes Philipp of Hesse and Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg, because it concerns Germany's freedom. Thanks for the comments of Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander and the information about the deceiver Bernhard Sapidus. Urges caution towards the French envoy Guillaume du Bellay. Sends greetings and blessings for the birth of Heinrich Bullinger the Younger's son.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, most excellent Bullinger, I am not driven by such a desire for revenge as you more humorously and cleverly than truthfully attribute to me. But what you excuse with your silence, I too, believe me, will excuse by my own right. Although you are engaged with greater fruit and clarity, I am also distracted and almost broken by no less occupation and labor and annoyance. I almost envy you and those like you for that fruitful and most successful course of studies, of which I occasionally taste the most delightful and uniquely captivating samples. Nevertheless, I must bear my lot and continue where He calls, to whose will no one successfully resists. I daily swallow mere anxieties, mere sorrows, so you would be most unjust if you were even slightly angry when I write to you more slowly. Certainly, you will attribute it to your happiness that you do not need my writing, which so many other Swabian churches, to which I diligently attend as much as the Lord grants, do need.</p>
      <p>Would that our churches finally expel Schwenckfeld! Since he inconveniences us so much, indeed more perniciously the more subtly. I am sending a copy of a booklet, which he sent to our Gervasius a few days ago, of which, although Schwenckfeld is not the author, he praises it excessively and wishes it were his own - so he writes to Gervasius -, for he should never be ashamed of it. I am sending it as I received it. You will easily divine the genuine reading despite many apparent errors, thanks to your sagacity.</p>
      <p>I was not going to write to you about the rumors spreading among us in such human vanity and the license of lies. But since Hesse sent a noble young man from Liecht here to the senate and me yesterday, it seemed right to communicate to you the main points, which might be useful for you to know, but not using the common artifice, namely to whitewash, as it is said, two walls with the same brush, to please both you and my dearest brother-in-law Heinrich from Ulm. For he will transmit to you the letter I gave him through this messenger. Love me constantly, as you do, and pray to the Lord that He may turn the efforts of the Christian princes to the best. It is certainly about our very head and the freedom of all Germany. You will read about bloody attempts and all the most truculent things.</p>
      <p>I am as grateful as I can be for the part of your commentaries given to me, and also those of our Theodor, in which I am most willingly persuaded that you not only equal your previous works but even surpass them.</p>
      <p>Regarding Sapidus, it is well that I have been informed by you. I gather from not obscure arguments that he was never an outstanding impostor. See that the French envoy is sincere and acts from the heart in what he professes. Nowhere is faith safe, some are giving birth to monstrous things. You watch with your best and truly venerable colleagues Leo, Pellican, Theodor, to whom you will most diligently commend me. My wife, sister, brother, cousin, and the Zwicks and other holy brothers commend themselves to you. For the little son you have received from your wife, we pray with all our wishes for the Lord's spirit, that he may grow and be strengthened and finally reflect the best father as the best son in talent, learning, piety, and other most beautiful gifts.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, May 23, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious bishop of the people of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
