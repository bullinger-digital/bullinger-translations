      <p> S. P. I give you the greatest thanks, most illustrious lord and revered father, for deeming me worthy of your letters amidst your many occupations, which were more pleasing to me than can be expressed. You show such paternal kindness to your students, about which I have learned much from both Laurentius and your letters. Consider that you are doing something pleasing to God, the church, and their most grateful father, who will undoubtedly ensure that you and your wife's kindness will never cause you regret. </p>
      <p> And although I never doubted that you would treat them as your own sons, since I have not only seen but also experienced your piety, natural goodness, and the benevolence of both of you, still, somehow, a great addition of gratitude and joy has been added to me, your servant and friend of the boys, from your and their letters. Therefore, do not hesitate, most kind father, to continue to pursue them with the same love and benevolence together with your most pious wife in the future. For it will happen that from this holy work of yours, the best and greatest God will be glorified and praised; they, in turn, will remember and be grateful, along with their parents and friends and our churches, always celebrating this education of yours. And I know indeed that your expenses and daily efforts exceed the pension for their sustenance, indeed perhaps the established money is not sufficient; for I guessed this immediately at the beginning, or you yourself could have noticed, as I wanted to increase beyond your request. Therefore, the expenses and difficulty of sustenance will need to be increased according to your will and desire, about which make me and Laurentius certain, so that we can deal with this matter without delay with the magnificent lord and establish a greater sum. Furthermore, I again beseech your piety to write to me about that minister who lived in the Palatinate [Füßli... Joh. Brunnerus] and who did not refuse to go to Poland, or if you think someone else would be suitable to manage the school. For I am expecting letters from Poland every day, in which they might perhaps remind me, as they have already committed once, to send someone like that to them. </p>
      <p> Additionally, in your letters (if you can write without inconvenience at some time), please let me know whether twenty crowns have been delivered to you, which I sent from Geneva when I was going to France; for so far I have been unable to find out anything, and how much was lacking to complete thirty thalers. Your letters to Mr. Calvin have been of great benefit to me, and those you sent from Poland have brought joy. If it ever happens that others come into your hands, I ask that you ensure they are forwarded, and I offer you all my dedication and perpetual respect for your kindness to me, to whom I humbly commend myself and pray that God may preserve you for his church for a very long time. I greet your household church. </p>
      <p> Given in Geneva, 10th day before the calends of December, 1561. </p>
      <p> Your most observant Christophorus Thretius, Pole. </p>
