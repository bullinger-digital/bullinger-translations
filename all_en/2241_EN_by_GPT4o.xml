      <p>Grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you/us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Since at this time, as elsewhere, the haters of evangelical truth (most humane and pious men) leave nothing unattempted to extinguish the splendor of the gospel (if it were possible), it seemed good to our church in Locarno to inform the most illustrious and excellent lords of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen of these matters, which have happened in Locarno both in the years now past and in this present, indeed in this present month, so that from this they may understand how much we value the word of the Lord and how much we value the lords themselves, to whom we are also subject.</p>
      <p>For we are equally subject to the aforementioned lords as to the others; therefore, we wish it to be known to them, what our other most illustrious lords do, lest they ever complain about us, that we have not communicated what is happening here in the cause of religion. Therefore, among other things, we send the edict very recently proclaimed in the name of our most illustrious lords of the Seven Cantons, to which our church refuses to obey for many reasons: first, because it is against the gospel of Christ, then because it is not proclaimed in the name of the Twelve Cantons; for we acknowledge twelve, not just seven lords; finally, because all of us, who are many, did not in any way consent to those letters or the instrument, which some of our citizens have drawn up. Therefore, act, most pious men, as much as is in you, to vigorously defend the evangelical doctrine. Indeed, we, obeying God rather than men, with ministers summoned from elsewhere, celebrate the Lord's Supper in our homes and baptize our infants in the Christian manner and proclaim the gospel, although our adversaries very often disturb and persecute both the ministers and the church. We trust in God, who is with us in the consummation of the age. We beseech you in the Lord, that you may deign to make mention of our church in your prayers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Locarno, 5 days before the calends of April.</p>
      <p>Taddeo Duno, physician.</p>
      <p>We send this letter of ours, believing that the most illustrious lords of the four republics are gathered there, as we have heard. But if the matter is otherwise, we pray you to inform them of whatever we have written.</p>
      <p>Pray for us, just as we also pray for our lords. [E II 365, 56b.] To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and the other ministers of the church of Zürich, most pious men.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
