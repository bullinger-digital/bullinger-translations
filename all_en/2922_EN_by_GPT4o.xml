      <p>Greetings, H. Bullinger, brother. My prince received your book and did not give any judgment of disapproval; whether he has read it yet, I do not know. I will find out, as I will soon be with him again, whether it pleased him. Hey, listen to the news about me. The Duke of Prussia sent a secretary to me; he kindly asks me to go to him, and he also asks my prince to compel me to go; he adds reasons, namely to resolve the disputes that have arisen in the Prussian churches and to assist Poland, which, fleeing from the papacy, is falling into sects; for so he writes.</p>
      <p>Although I know I am unequal to such arduous tasks, I do not refuse the labor. Pray for me with the whole church, which I earnestly ask of you. I was recently with the Elector Palatine, who pleases me greatly; he burns with the desire to restore churches and schools. I will write to you again before I leave the duchy, which will happen within 15 days, and I will go to Regensburg first. Now I send a new catalog; I will soon send annotations, which are now being printed.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, May 16, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
