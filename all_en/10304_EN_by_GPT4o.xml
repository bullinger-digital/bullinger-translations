      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Our gracious greetings to you, honorable dear special one, etc.</p>
      <p>We have heard that you, faithfully and diligently adhering to the Word of God, remain steadfast, and also promote and advance it faithfully there, and we have been very pleased to hear this. However, as you have also come into temptation and opposition because of this, we consider that the Lord has visited you as His own and has done this for your best, as it is said, "For whom the Lord loves, He chastens" [Hebrews 12:6]. And therefore, it is our gracious request, as we are also confident in you, that you will remain and persist unwaveringly and steadfastly in the Word of God and the Gospel, trusting in the Lord, who will turn all this to the best in His time and reward you richly with His grace. And whatever we can advise and command you according to our ability, that, and to your grace, we are inclined. Which we wanted to make known to you in this way.</p>
      <p>Given in our city of Kassel, Wednesday after Dionysius, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Philipp L. of Hesse, etc. sst.</p>
      <p>To the honorable wise dear special M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, and Hans Rudolf Lavater, now bailiff at Kyburg.</p>
