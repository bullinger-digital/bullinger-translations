    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the extensive letter delivered by [Heinrich] Falkner and for the support of John Burcher. As Hilles indicated in a letter to John Butler, the Scottish King [James V.] indeed died [on December 14, 1542], after some Scottish nobles had been captured by the English [at the Battle of Solway Moss]; King [Henry VIII.] sent them back to Scotland to negotiate its incorporation into the English kingdom, which, however, was unsuccessful. In Antwerp, it was reported that the Scottish Cardinal [David Beaton] had been sent to England, while from another source he heard that the Scots had rather elected a new king and asked [Francis I.] for help and that they wanted to push back [Henry VIII.]. He has not heard that [Henry VIII.] allied with Emperor [Charles V.] and terminated the friendship with [Francis I.], although he would probably do so in the event of an alliance between France and Scotland. After the Scots captured some English ships, their estates do not allow them to sell the cargo, perhaps to avoid provoking [Henry VIII.]. Greetings; he will now travel to Nuremberg for about a month to sell his cloth there, which could not be sent to the [Frankfurt] fair due to [the war between] Duke [William of] Jülich[-Berg-Kleve-Geldern and Charles V.].</p>

      <p>Praise be to God! As humbly as I can, I commend myself to your piety, my esteemed lord. I recently received your letter through Falkner, in which you excuse yourself for not being able to respond at that time with the length I might have expected, as you say. But I, in turn, reply that I did not wish for such a lengthy response, but rather one that was truly useful and most pleasing to me, so as not to be too burdensome to you, as I undoubtedly was. I am sincerely grateful to you for John Burcher, especially since you helped him so quickly, as you say, on my behalf. I wrote to John Butler shortly after Christmas about the King of Scots, stating that he was indeed dead, and that there was a rumor in Antwerp that he had died from a wound: this was not noted in my letters, but it was certainly confirmed and confessed by the Scots themselves, that their king died immediately after some of their nobles were captured by the English. Since that time, I have received nothing certain from England, except that our king immediately sent those nobles back to Scotland to plead on his behalf, and to try with all their might to have the kingdom returned or offered to him by the Scots. But, as I have now heard from an English nobleman here, they achieved almost nothing from the Scots, and returned to the king completely deceived in their attempt. However, others of our countrymen in Antwerp have boasted that the Scottish nobles, at the request or effort of those nobles, sent the Scottish cardinal to England. But this Englishman here told me almost the opposite: namely, that the Scots have appointed a new king from among themselves, implored the help of the King of France, and that our king still intends to drive them out with all his might. I have not heard that the King of England has allied with the Emperor, nor that he has renounced friendship with the King of France; although it is likely that he will do so shortly if the French assist the Scots. Nevertheless, I have been written from England during this fair that the Scots, who seized some ships from our countrymen, have been forbidden by the Scottish nobles to sell the goods with which they were loaded, until they know what our king's decision is in this matter. However, there may be some deceit in this, so that the King of England does not strengthen himself more and prepare for war sooner. Farewell, and please convey my most diligent regards to your dearest wife and to all the most pious and learned men known to me there through your efforts. May God preserve you and those like you for a long time, and pray for me. Amen. I am now about to depart for Nuremberg (intending to return in a month, God willing) to sell my cloth, which my friends in Antwerp, who manage my affairs, did not dare to send here to this fair because of the Duke of Jülich, and therefore sent them to the approaching fair in Nuremberg. Again, farewell and live happily. Amen. Frankfurt, March 24, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, RICHARD HILLES</p>
      <p>To the most pious theologian and my especially dear and esteemed friend, Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
