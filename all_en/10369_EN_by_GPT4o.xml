    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius recently urged him to consider two things: he should not judge the French King Francis I too negatively, and he should contemplate the restoration of the Secret Council in Zurich. Bullinger does not know what to say about this. The king feigns goodwill towards the supporters of the Reformation only to achieve his selfish power goals in Italy; nothing good is to be expected from him. The former Secret Council of Zurich had to be abolished at the request of the Zurich countryside after the lost Second Kappel War; many detest the idea of its restoration. Nevertheless, Bullinger hopes that this article of the Meilen Agreement, like others before it, can be nullified over time, perhaps if the one desired by the pious, Hans Rudolf Lavater, is indeed elected mayor; at the moment, however, nothing can be done in this matter. Sends Myconius his commentary on the Epistles of Peter. Visit and cordial reception of four Bernese bailiffs in Zurich. Greetings. At the request of the poor and the clergy, the Zurich Council has allowed that when redeeming core annuities, the "Mütt" can be redeemed with 20 guilders.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You mentioned two things in your last letter, first, that I should not completely despair of the French King, and second, that I should consider the restoration of the Secret Council. I do not know what to respond to either.</p>
      <p>As for the French King, a man impure, profane, and ambitious, I do not know what good I can expect. If he pretends anything, it is not in the name of Christ and truth, but for the sake of ambition. For you rightly say that he desires to be the master of Italy. Indeed, he aspires to this, meanwhile, he values neither Christ nor Germany highly. That notable schemer, who recently discussed many things with me about the king's plan, and I do not doubt that it was by the command of the leading men of France, finally added: "The king might tolerate whatever faith one had, only that he be lord in Italy." Consider this statement. You will feel how impious he is, who is prepared to endure and do anything for that insatiable desire to rule. But what we should think here, the matter itself will teach us. Meanwhile, let us not approve or disapprove anything rashly. Your writings to me on these matters are welcome. For they make even the imprudent more circumspect.</p>
      <p>As for the restoration of the Secret Council, I dare not promise anything, since it is opposed not by one, but by many, and because after that unfortunate defeat of ours, our territory obtained from the city documents in which it was stipulated that it would not establish any Secret Council in the future. But we know where this plan originated. We have so far broken some things that were mutually accepted by the same agreement. Perhaps with God as our guide, we will break this impious agreement too, especially when the Lord soon gives us a mayor whom almost all the pious desire with great prayers. Certainly, I would wish for nothing more, nor would I believe anything more useful or necessary for us than the Secret Council, but today we have not advanced anything in this matter.</p>
      <p>I am sending you our commentaries on both Epistles of Peter, in which if you find anything lacking, let me know.</p>
      <p>The Bernese prefects, Lenzburg, Küngsfeld, Arburg, and Schenkenberg, were in Zurich these days to form a friendship with some good men. Our council and a selection of the best men treated them most familiarly for three days. May God grant that we soon unite completely.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1534.</p>
      <p>Utinger, Steiner, Theodor, etc., wish you well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Regarding what our people have left in the purchase of core annuities, you should know. At the request and earnest plea of the poor in the city and countryside, they have allowed a "Mütt" of core annuities to be purchased with 20 good guilders.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, chief pastor of the church of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
