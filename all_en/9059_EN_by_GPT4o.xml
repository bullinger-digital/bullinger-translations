      <p>Venerable father, I wrote to you a few days ago and at the same time to the most illustrious man, Master Gwalther. Since that time, we have heard that your neighbors and allies are going to send new executioners to the king to complete the slaughter begun by the Swiss royal cohort.</p>
      <p>I am surprised if your magistrates do not clearly perceive that with France overthrown, the outcome of this tragedy concerns you; at least you would judge it better to fight in a foreign land than within your own borders. It is agreed among all that these are the beginnings of the Tridentine web and the accursed league, which they call the Holy League.</p>
      <p>This, our king wanted to be a pledge of his will. I am sending you a copy of the articles describing the state of France, which I could not translate into Latin due to my occupations; but I hope there are some Frenchmen or those skilled in the French language there. Farewell, venerable father, and be well; please convey my most respectful greetings to Master Gwalther, the most illustrious man; I wrote to him about Albert's ingratitude, or should I say astonishment; unless the magnificent father himself takes account of all my labors, I hope to be more cautious in cultivating foreign fields in the future. I would like you to extract the elements of law that I dictated to him, so that my son can use them and others whom I may perhaps instruct in Lausanne this winter; for I am thinking of going there soon. Farewell again, esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 8, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Hotman.</p>
      <p>I forgot about your most loving letter dated August 15, which our syndic Rosetus recently delivered to me. I am grateful for the booklet, which has benefited our churches in a remarkable way; I had heard it highly praised 14 months ago by the chancellor of France, Master Hospitalius, a most wise man and (I believe and it is rumored) recently killed. Therefore, I immediately acquired it in Paris, and I was wonderfully delighted by its reading.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and most esteemed man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent theologian and most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
