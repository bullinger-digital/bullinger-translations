    <p xml:id="regest1">Received a Lasco's letter [No. 1871], but already knew a Lasco earlier, both from letters by Erasmus, which a Lasco also refers to in his letter, and from reports by others who heard him in Basel. That a Lasco wishes to be friends with him is an expression of his great modesty and kindness, for the best do not wish so much to be loved as to love. He is pleased that a Lasco finds pleasure in the simplicity of his writings; simplicity was also the reason why the apostles succeeded in converting the entire world to Christ. Bullinger wrote to the abbot of the monastery Aduard, Johannes Reekamp, urging him to reform the churches, and enclosed "De scripturae sanctae authoritate... [deque episcoporum... institutione et] functione" and the newly published writing against Cochläus ["Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio"] - he also sends a copy to a Lasco -, but could not also send his commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and John as well as on the Pauline letters. He requests a Lasco's writing on the fall and restoration of man. Greetings to Hermann Aquilomontanus, to whom he could not write due to illness. He requests a Lasco's reply letter for the Frankfurt Autumn Fair. Greetings from the fellow brothers.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, a Pole, preaching Christ in Emden, Friesland, the most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letters, most distinguished man and my most esteemed lord, and read them with great admiration and pleasure. I congratulate you above all, brother in the Lord, venerable and dearest, that the truly most generous Lord has poured out His grace upon you with such liberality. I have known you for a long time from the writings of the blessed memory of Mr. Erasmus, to which you refer, and from the accounts of those who have seen and heard you in Basel.</p>
      <p>But now I know you much better, as I understand that you have received Christ the Lord and left behind the Antichrist with Pharisaism, and that you trample earthly wealth and eagerly pursue heavenly goods. I give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ for that incredible benefit He has most liberally bestowed upon you, and I fervently pray to Him that He may happily complete what He has begun in you for your salvation and that of many in the church.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>You ask that I receive you into my friendship and henceforth consider you as a brother.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is true in you, as is praised in almost all the most learned, that exceptional learning is joined with exceptional modesty and humanity. For what, I ask, is more modest and humane than that you, a most learned man and distinguished by many virtues, voluntarily seek the friendship of Bullinger, who truly recognizes nothing exceptional in himself, when your friendship should have been sought by me and all good people long ago? Certainly, this is the true nature of pious minds, that, as they possess the better, they seek not so much to be loved as to love. And they have this truly divine spirit from Him who is so much love itself that He not only loved first but also embraced the most vile mortals, dust and earth, with indescribable love, and testified this love towards us not with some slight mark, but with the most excellent, by sending and delivering His only begotten for us. Therefore, I embrace this divine modesty and humanity of your spirit, and I will strive with all my might, that if I cannot be equal in returning favors, I will at least follow closely behind.</p>
      <p>You are pleased with my simplicity in explaining the sacred scriptures and in elucidating the controversies of our religion. It is well, my most learned and beloved brother; I rejoice that my simplicity pleases you, which I regret does not please all the learned in our age. For as their too slippery and subtle discourse breeds much contention and ambiguity in the church, so I see that the apostles of Christ, who received the firstfruits of the Spirit, especially pursued simplicity and with that very simplicity converted the whole world to Christ; I see the churches of God, instructed with simple, consistent, firm, and solid doctrine, stand firm and act quite peacefully. Therefore, I strive for simplicity in writing and speaking, and I am greatly delighted with those who pursue simplicity.</p>
      <p>I wrote to the venerable father and lord, Mr. Johannes Reekamp, abbot of the monastery of Aduard, urging him to reform the churches entrusted to his faith and to use your and other good and learned men's help in this matter. I enclosed with the otherwise copious letter a book I once wrote, "On the Authority of the Word of God and on the Office and Function of Church Prelates," which I also now published against Cochläus, in which I also discussed some matters of church reformation. I also send you a copy. I would have gladly sent commentaries either on Matthew or on John or on the letters of Paul; but the inconvenience of the journey prevented it.</p>
      <p>Thus I wish to testify that the way to me is prepared and open for you, to deal with me, as you request, about all matters that may arise.</p>
      <p>Nor would it be unwelcome if I could see your writings, which you composed on the fall and restoration of man. Not that I wish to take a censor's rod to your work, but because I desire to be educated by your writings.</p>
      <p>You will most dutifully greet my Hermann Aquilomontanus, to whom I would have written, had not illness and bodily weakness prevented it. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you with all who call upon His name. I pray that you send your reply to the Frankfurt Autumn Fair, unless it is troublesome, to inform me of your affairs. Keep me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 24, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as much as I am, H. Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Your fellow brothers and all greet you, Megander, Gwalther, Fabricius, Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gessner, Ammianus, Collinus, Werdmüller, and the rest of the servants of Christ.</p>
