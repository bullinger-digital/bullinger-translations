      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have received your letters, dear friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Similar reports about the island of Malta are coming from elsewhere; however, there are those who spread the news that the Turk has departed after suffering a defeat; but the procurator does not believe it.</p>
      <p>The heat that troubles you also torments us in a remarkable way. The plague is beginning to spread all around; no one among us has been affected by it yet.</p>
      <p>It rages in the city and countryside of Bern, and it is also creeping into Chur; may the Lord deliver us from evil. I equally fear the episcopal plague; for unless the Lord intervenes, the matter will hardly be settled without a fight.</p>
      <p>There are no new developments; you will hear much from the honorable legate.</p>
      <p>This seems worth mentioning, that the consul, returning from the assembly, told me he had never attended an assembly with fewer disputes; the Cantons were gracious in all respects. Farewell excellently with your family.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends and especially the honorable legate.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 27, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your very own Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and very dear godfather and brother. Chur.</p>
