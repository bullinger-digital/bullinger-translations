      <p>Noble, steadfast, especially gracious young lord, my willing service and all good things are always ready for your honorable self. Above all, I kindly ask your honor not to take offense, but to consider it good that I dared to write to your honor, whom I do not know personally, not out of any presumption, but out of high trust.</p>
      <p>My son Christoph Bullinger, who serves at the court of my gracious prince and lord in Hesse, praises you so much, not only for the good deeds you have undeservedly shown him, but also for your many virtues: through which I am moved not only to thank your honor highly, which I hereby do most sincerely, offering my gratitude and willing services, but also to desire your honor's love and friendship, indicating that I love your honor's dignity and virtue, and that I am committed to loving and serving your honor as a true friend, so that I would willingly serve your honor in all that would be pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>I send your honor herewith the Confession of the Church of the Confederation in Latin, hoping your honor will also understand some of the Latin language. If not, it shall also be sent to your honor in German by me. This confession has been signed by the churches in France, England, Scotland, and Poland, as well as others. I also hope that your honor will have no displeasure or disapproval of it.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask your honor to accept this confession out of love and friendship, not to take offense at this writing of mine, and to let my dear son Christoph, mentioned above, be recommended to your honor in all good advice and help, favor and promotion. All of which I desire to be obliged with willing services. May you be entrusted to God Almighty in His grace and protection, shield and blessing.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the first of September 1567.</p>
      <p>Your honor's willing Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the noble, steadfast Adolf Wilhelm von DÃ¶rnberg, in Hesse, my gracious, beloved young lord.</p>
      <p>Adolf Wilhelm passed away in God on the 3rd of October, 1567. And thereafter the letter with the Confession was given to me, the young Bullinger, on the 2nd of December.</p>
