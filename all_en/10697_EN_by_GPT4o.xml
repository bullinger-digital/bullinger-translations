    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's generous gift and hopes to still witness the continuation of his commentary work despite his threatening hernia. The Duke of Savoy is ready for direct peace negotiations with Bern; Haller intends to advocate for the interests of Geneva in this regard, to whose defense several people from Bern have gone out despite a prohibition. Has not heard anything more from the exiled people of Solothurn. The French King will send [Guillaume du Bellay] to Strasbourg, after Melanchthon declined the call to France. Haller no longer expects Bullinger's repeatedly announced visit. Requests the dispatch of his next work immediately after its publication.</p>

      <p>I always receive your letters with the greatest joy, dearest brother, and I can hardly express how much they refresh my sometimes faint spirit. But what can I say in the meantime, when you overwhelm me with your gifts and presents to such an extent that I lack the eloquence to give thanks, let alone repay you? I did not want to be a burden to you, but since you adorn and burden me with your benefits, I will more easily bear it, seeing that your love for me grows more and more. Certainly, I am not alone, nor are there few of us, whom you serve with your talents and labors in such a way that they now begin to wonder how they could have done without you until now. What you write about illustrating Matthew, I can hardly wait for you to accomplish, since by the goodness and miracle of God, I live. You once saw my head nicely plump and thick, but now the hernia has begun to exceed its size so much that I can no longer leave the city on foot, much less ride, and I am gradually forced to crawl to the nearby temple, nor is there any hope of a remedy, except to drive away the winds and avoid what produces them. If your doctors here can advise anything, I will gladly listen. I have entrusted myself to the Lord. Would that I might live and die for Him alone! In the meantime, strive to benefit the Church of Christ, as you have begun. I certainly honor Him and His spirit in you and will honor as long as I live, for I know from experience how much you have helped me in the ministry of the word. I will not compile what you have published in four epistles until you complete the rest, which I hope will happen soon.</p>
      <p>Today, the Duke of Savoy voluntarily offered himself to the legate to enter into peace terms with the Bernese without mediators, provided they allow the assembly to take place in our city, perhaps frightened by imperial misfortune. I will work to make this happen, provided I consult with the Genevans. A few soldiers had left, some returned. They say there are only 18 of ours in Geneva. The magistrate anticipated with an edict.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have not received a word about the exiles from Solothurn, since the Bernese feel no less opposed to them than you do.</p>
      <p>I have long understood that the French King will soon send [Guillaume du Bellay] to Strasbourg, since Melanchthon also refused to go to France with public assurance.</p>
      <p>However, the more often you give me hope of your visit to us, the more desperate you make me, seeing that this plan of yours is so often hindered.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and if your works are published, advise Froschauer to send them out of his love for me.</p>
      <p>On that unfortunate day of October 11, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, sincerely teaching Christ in Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
