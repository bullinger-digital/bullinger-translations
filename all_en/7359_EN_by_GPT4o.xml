      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I recently sent you lengthy letters, most venerable Father, but in my anxiety, I omitted what was most necessary. We took great care of your letters to Stuckius along with Bonetti's letters on the very day we received them. I presented them to the consul(s), but since they knew of no special or personal messenger going to Padua, the consul Willii's brother, a cloth merchant or trader (who almost daily sends and receives letters to and from Italy), sent them to Mr. Bonetto through reliable people. Additionally, I encouraged Bonetto himself, who is very close to me, in my letters to diligently work on this matter for your and all our sakes, and I have no doubt that he will do so diligently. Therefore, do not be anxious about this matter and forgive me for not writing to you about it earlier; for our merchants had barely left when I immediately remembered the neglected duty, and it troubled me not a little until I informed you of it. Since I knew they were taken care of very carefully and many days had passed since then before the merchants began their usual journey, this matter certainly led to some forgetfulness, especially during these very frequent holidays. We have nothing else of note. It is said that a bishop and another monk were burned in Rome in the name of Lutheranism. In Bologna, there is incredible persecution. A merchant from Como, who recently returned from Zurich and St. Gallen, reported that a battle had taken place between the Condé's forces and the royalists, with 14,000 fallen on both sides, and the victory remained with the Condé's forces, who lost no more than 5,000; Cardinal Lorraine was wounded, Mr. de Omala was captured, etc., and neither the king with the Swiss nor the German cavalry were involved. The interpreter recently in the castle, where the entire senate and all of us were invited by the bishop, steadfastly denied this and repeated and defended that the king was not attacking religion, but rebels, and that the Condé had no other cause for war than the desire to dominate; indeed, he openly called those exiles, who were expelled from Lyon, traitors in front of everyone and said they were not driven out in the name of the gospel. It is said that our last ones are preparing to return to us, some out of fear, others out of conscience, etc.; but time will tell.</p>
      <p>Now, as far as we know, there is nothing, and we anxiously await certain news of the battle from you. Quickly.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 3, 1568. Please greet Mr. Ernius. Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>If you do not have the printed account of the Italian flood around Verona, we will send it.</p>
      <p>Our bishop, when he recently invited us to the beginning of a new and very happy year, wanted to have us both at his table and by his side. He showed himself to be very friendly to everyone and especially to us ministers, whom he invited to visit him daily; moreover, he promised to give us the key to his most excellent vineyards if they flourish again, and he voluntarily offered all the wealth of his cellar. We were amazed at his friendliness, especially when he said we should know this: that he would not inconvenience us in matters of faith; we would experience this in reality. [Indeed, visit me very often,] he said, [and, putting aside religion, ask me for anything.] But we attribute all this to his business, which is still precariously hanging. During our meal, letters from your most honorable Zurich senate arrived, which (as I later heard) admonished both parties to finally resolve the matter. But since this business, whatever it is, has been referred to the communities, the Rhaetians will not entrust it to anyone else but themselves and will act whenever it suits them. The Swiss are thought to be too curious in this foreign business. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his eternally and faithfully esteemed master. Zurich.</p>
