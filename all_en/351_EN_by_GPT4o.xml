      <p>The well-learned and pious Master Ambrosius Blarer rightly holds in high regard the calling that has come to him from the widely renowned church in Bern. However, he wishes, out of necessity, to reveal his shortcomings and grievances, so that no one expects more from him than he should, and that he is not burdened beyond his capabilities. He requests most amicably that both lords' messengers report everything in detail, etc.</p>
      <p>Firstly, he complains that he does not possess the skills and abilities that one might expect and hope for from him. He says this not out of humility, but truthfully out of necessity. He would take it upon himself to the utmost that the church be better provided with learned and skilled individuals like Mr. Musculus.</p>
      <p>Secondly, he complains about the language, which is not only not eloquent, as the Swiss Confederates like, but also small and weak, so much so that he could not preach in Augsburg and Ulm, and even sometimes in Constance, where he could neither be well heard nor understood.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, he complains about his age, which now no longer increases in memory, strength, and capability, which are very necessary in such a large church. He has experienced in the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg, when he was younger, that it was not possible for him to 1. provide the church with sermons, 2. visit the churches here and there, 3. hold the marriage court, 4. manage the schools and public lectures, 5. support all the pastors in the countryside, etc. He would prefer to be employed in lesser services and gladly do what is possible for him.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, he is particularly deterred by the considerable tension and conflict that has long existed in the city of Bern, as he still cannot thoroughly understand how it is constituted, and therefore he would like to speak with Mr. Haller, and requests that he come to him in Winterthur; for it is neither convenient nor possible for him to come to Zurich at this time.</p>
      <p>He earnestly requests that he be considered as a seasoned and worn-out man; for it is difficult for him to accept or decline the matter at this time.</p>
