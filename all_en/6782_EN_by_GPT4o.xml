      <p>Greetings. Most excellent man and truly venerable to me, if I knew that I could declare my most friendly will and brotherly benevolence through the frequency or length of letters and thereby assure you of my mind, I would write not only often but as copiously as our miserable occupations allow. However, since I am not unaware of your humanity, piety, and prudence, you will kindly accept that for your three letters you receive this brief one from me, written in great haste. The main point of it is that I am yours and that we are united in Christ, which I most certainly hope and do not doubt that you will consider everything to be contained in these few words. I saw my poem placed before the most learned verses of Beza not without embarrassment. If only I could see either Beza himself or at least a letter written by him; he certainly has me as a most eager reader of his writings, whatever reaches us. I prefer you to be known publicly by others; for even the thought of them does not delight me.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and happily, most excellent and dearest man to me. Augsburg, May 13, 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Crato.</p>
      <p>When you write to Mr. Beza, I ask that you greet him in my name. I cannot express in words how miserable everything is here. That impious and thrice accursed πανταψοθσια dominates, the calamity of our faith.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the divine word among the Zurichers, his lord and esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
