      <p>S. You would have received, my Bullinger, a response from me long ago if a courier had been available, whom I certainly sought diligently and finally found with difficulty. Concerning Postel, take this brief account: it seems to me, as well as to my other brothers, that he is a man excellently learned in various literature, as you also know, and that he has absorbed some principles of sincere religion, so that he somewhat understands justification by faith and abhors the Roman Antichrist. But because he has spent much time on Talmudic and Kabbalistic writings and has deeply imbibed Platonic and Pythagorean philosophy, he indulges excessively in constructing doctrines. Hence, he holds some very absurd views about Christ, such as attributing the role of mediator only to the soul of Christ, which he asserts seems to have been created before the incarnation, based on a passage from Proverbs 8, although I believe he took the occasion for this doctrine from Plato's writings on the world soul. Similarly, he pronounces something obscure about the resurrection, as if, I say, in this resurrection bodies will be raised to partake of the Lord's body in the use of the Eucharist. Then he considers the Mass to be numbered among things indifferent, which may be celebrated without sin, and he does not deny that he himself also celebrates it. He has been dealt with amicably so far, especially when he refrained from professing a certain little book, which even his listeners began to reject; he will be dealt with in the same manner henceforth, so that he may be dismissed as a guest here with good grace. He recently narrated during a lecture that he had brought three nails, with which Christ had been crucified, from Syria, and that by throwing one into the sea, which was raging with a dangerous storm, the waves were calmed, and because the listeners, who are French, could not contain their laughter, he became very indignant. These are the things that I have been able to ascertain. (Certainly, the Lord must be prayed to, that He may deign to shape this instrument for the glory of His name and to advance in the true knowledge of Christ).</p>
      <p>You have these new things besides those I received from you: Hedi sol ouch ein schnapp genommen han, and now the emperor's army is said to be marching towards Péronne. The Noricans are in good hope that they can recover all their possessions, especially with the help of the confederate forces of Maurice, from whom they recently received 2000 cavalry and 20 banners of infantry. Therefore, with 1500 cavalry and 16 banners of infantry, they occupied the fortress of Margrave Strytberg and carried off an innumerable amount of booty stored there to their city.</p>
      <p>With six larger artillery machines, they are attempting to storm another fortress, Blassemberg, fortified beyond measure by nature and art, and they continue to make up for their losses from the depredations of the Margraves. Albert came to Isleben on June 11, after unexpectedly crossing the Thuringian forest with great marches, and on the 13th he returned to Halberstadt, where he awaits 54 banners of infantry and 3000 cavalry under the leadership of Count Oldenburg and other princely men. Furthermore, on the 18th of the same month, he entered the city of Brunswick with 10 horses, and many think that, aided by the alliance of the maritime cities, he will invade the Duchy of Brunswick and, if he can, extinguish it, so that they may no longer be harassed within the cities. Maurice agreed with Ferdinand, who himself entered Isleben with a great force of his own on the 16th, with the plan to cut off Albert's return. He also diligently fortified his cities Dresden, Zwickau, Wittenberg, Leipzig with garrisons and recalled the army of Philip of Brunswick and Baron von Heideck to himself, so that a bloody conflict is expected, unless perhaps the authority of Ferdinand and the Elector of Brandenburg will have some weight for peace, which they are said to be striving for with the greatest effort in person. The Landgrave also sent 800 cavalry as aid to Maurice. These are the things I had, which I did not want to hide from you. Farewell in the Lord with your family, Gwalther, Zender, Theodor, Pellican, and all the rest, and especially also Zwingli and Josias, your sons-in-law.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 15, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my esteemed colleague and brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>POSTELLUS.</p>
