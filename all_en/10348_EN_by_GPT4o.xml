    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letters from December 20 and 28, 1533, in which a quote from Myconius' letter No. 299 about the agreement between the Pope and the French King is included, and from December 28 about Leo Jud's turning away from Schwenckfeld and the efforts of the people of Basel for harmony between Zurich and Bern. Shares news from a letter by Georg Besserer from January 19 about the day of the Swabian League in Augsburg, that its dissolution is imminent and Christoph of Württemberg and King Ferdinand could not agree, as well as from a letter by Bucer from January 8, that Nikolaus Cop had to flee because of remarks about justifying faith in his Paris rectorate speech about morals and that the Lutherans are now being persecuted in France, but that previously, during the king's absence, the Gospel had been freely preached and that the Pope is not pursuing the threatened excommunication of the English king. In such raging in France, it is important to be vigilant and to implore Christ for assistance. Gervasius Schuler, who had stayed in Konstanz for a few days due to the cold, was well received in Memmingen on January 7. Sister Margaretha Blarer sends thanks and greetings, as do brother Thomas Blarer and Johannes Zwick. Greetings to the people of Zurich. Reports from a letter by the Memmingen city clerk about a letter from the Voivode Zápolya to the Swabian League and the attempt to fob off Christoph of Württemberg with remote and endangered dominions. The dissolution of the Swabian League will be followed by war.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I received your two letters, dearest brother, one dated the twentieth and the other the twenty-eighth of December. The reason I have not replied is not due to my negligence, much less to contempt - for you are venerable to me in many ways - but due to my countless affairs, which constantly occupy me. I hope you will be less offended by this, as the nature of those letters did not particularly require a response. The first contained a fragment from the illustrious Myconius' letters, indicating the Pope and the French King's efforts and their foul collusion. The latter brought joyful news for me on two accounts: firstly, that Leo had completely defected from Schwenckfeld, and secondly, that you wrote that the people of Basel were concerned about a stronger concord between you and the Bernese.</p>
      <p>At the end, you asked that if I had any news from the Diet of Augsburg, I should share it with you. This last point alone required my reply, which I intended to send as soon as I learned something certain. Since this was denied until now and was only given yesterday, I did not want to disturb you with my untimely trifles, no matter how much you claim to delight in them. Therefore, receive now what the Ulm consul Besserer wrote to me yesterday among other things. For it seemed appropriate to include his words: «In Augsburg, they are continuously negotiating to extend the alliance for several years. This will not be agreeable to the majority; it is not at all to be hoped that there will be another alliance. Regarding faith, they agreed in the union, quite favorably to us, and that the so-called spiritual ones would also concede; but there are so many side notes that it is entirely obstructed, and it seems that we will have a cardinal in our lands, as the negotiations between the royal majesty and Duke Christoph of Württemberg cannot be settled either». He wrote this to me on January 19.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Pope and the French King, to confirm what you received from Myconius, here is a part of his letter, which our Bucer sent to us three days ago. It reads: «The King of France has begun a very severe persecution in his kingdom. One of Cop's sons, elected as rector, gave a speech as usual. In it, he included a few remarks about justifying faith, which brought him into such danger through the theologians that he sought refuge by fleeing, perhaps imprudently taking the university's seal with him. A great council was announced there by a herald, offering 300 crowns to anyone who brings back the fugitive rector, dead or alive. When the person who brought this news to us left, more than fifty had been arrested, and an edict was read that anyone convicted of being a Lutheran by two witnesses should be immediately burned. The situation will be similar to the Spanish Inquisition. It is believed that over three hundred have been arrested in Paris. For the bishop there, who sincerely favors piety, and the King and Queen of Navarre, who is the sister of the King of France, and several other great nobles, it happened that in the absence of King Francis, some began to openly preach Christ, and all spoke more freely. All these are now called into great danger. For now, the persecution is only against the moderate. Thus, with these Herodian weddings, we will sacrifice with the blood of the saints. I fear the King of England will be led to the same. For the Pope does not pursue the excommunication threatened against him, although he still retains his own over the introduced one» etc. So far Bucer. Thus, thus, my Bullinger, even though Christ has scarcely been brought to light among the French, Herod plots to destroy him. But the counsel of the Lord will be firm, no matter how much the tyrants of the world continue to fill their rotten measure. The spirit of the church will prevail, and through this, it will also overcome the gates of hell. But we must be vigilant in the meantime and always stand watch, not to underestimate such ingenious enemies, equipped with such a conspiracy, such arms, and such a force of gold, but to earnestly implore Christ, that he alone may stand with us, and be for us in place of many thousands of armored men. He will surely be present and will exercise his power in our weakness, whether the world wills it or not.</p>
      <p>Gervasius had not yet arrived when your letters were delivered. Later, however, after spending a few days with me due to the harshness of the cold, which allowed no departure, he reached Memmingen on January 7 with great expectation and applause from all. We have reminded the dearest brother of many things. He has begun to love us greatly. We found the little wife of the man to be exactly as you had previously described to my sister. We hope everything will turn out happily.</p>
      <p>My sister gladly acknowledges that she owes you much and will write as soon as a more convenient opportunity arises; in the meantime, she diligently and Christianly commends herself to you and sends you many greetings, as does our entire household and that of my brother and Johannes Zwick. You will most dutifully greet your wife, whom my wife and sister also wish to know by face. You will commend us to the truly holy man of God, Pellican, and also to Leo, Theodor, and the others; especially greet the excellent men Utinger and Steiner most accurately with our words. Farewell, venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, and never fail to commend me to our common Savior Christ in your sacred prayers.</p>
      <p>January 20, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The first scribe of Memmingen writes to me: «The Voivode has written very earnestly to the members of the alliance on behalf of the young Duke of Württemberg». Also, among other things: «They would like to assign Duke Christoph of Württemberg a seat against the Turk and an annual income of up to 5000 florins; but he does not want to accept it; so they will give him nothing in the land of Württemberg, which will then cause the alliance to dissolve and unrest and war to arise in Germany» etc. May Christ turn it to good!</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and truly holy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
