      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son. Things are fairly well with us; may God continue to grant grace and preserve us. There is much toil, work, unrest, sorrow, and misery in this world; if we did not hope for something better, the state of man, as Paul says, would be most miserable. But thanks be to God through Jesus, who has accepted us as His own and will make us eternally blessed, etc. I am much troubled with Bischofszell, I wish it would end happily; it is very close to being resolved.</p>
      <p>I did not want to bring Stimer to the honorable mayor; for as he has been with the papists and their servant until now, I do not know what the matter is. If he is now in the chancellery in Constance and still, they might not like it as with the priest of Messkirch, that he steps away from them, thereby causing unrest among the people of Bischofszell. I have said he might well try if he could get a recommendation from Schaffhausen. Otherwise, I do not like to burden myself much with the matter, I might suffer, you did not send it to me, etc. I am to greet you from all the people. Here they say little good about the vines; how are things with yours? May God protect us. I will not speak with the young lord unless he approaches me. One must let the water bubble over; I also do not know what it would bring now, even if I spoke much with him on your behalf. Yet I will observe the opportunity.</p>
      <p>God be with you. Greet Susanna and Elisabeth for me. In haste on Sunday in the sermon, February 18, 1571.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
