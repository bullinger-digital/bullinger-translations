    <p xml:id="regest1">Anton Sprüngli admitted to having spoken with Peter Graf and Othmar Widenhuber about some banners captured [in the Appenzell Wars], and referred to a chronicle that supposedly mentions the loss of a St. Gallen banner in the Battle of Stoß; however, he did not intend to offend St. Gallen and requested that his apology be conveyed.</p>

      <p>My prepared, willing service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious, dear sir, it is known that Antoni Sprüngli has let it be known to Peter Graf and Othmar Widenhuber that St. Gallen had won some banners and Appenzell some banners. He read in a chronicle (if it is correct) that the city of St. Gallen lost a banner at the Stoß in Appenzell. He cannot deny that he said it, but he spoke it in confidence and did not mean for it to bring any disadvantage. He has no dearer people than the people of St. Gallen, he swears by God; therefore, he did not speak such things to disgrace the city, but only as a remark and as one word leads to another. He has kindly asked me to write back to those from whom the writing came to me, and kindly ask them to help ensure that nothing more is made of the matter, as he spoke it without malice; he always wants to be a good St. Gallen citizen. Therefore, I earnestly ask you to do the best in this matter; for he is otherwise a very honest, pious, good-hearted man.</p>
      <p>Let me enjoy all acquaintance and friendship. With this, entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 12th of December 1535.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your entirely own.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Mr. Joachim von Watt, mayor of St. Gallen, his dear lord.</p>
