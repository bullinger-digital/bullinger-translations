    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] For humans, the situation is desperate, but not for God, who can certainly still save.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Oporinus will show a confidential report about the oath that the five cities [Biberach, Isny, Kempten, Memmingen, and Ravensburg to Emperor Charles V] had to swear. It is over for the southern German cities, even for Augsburg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bernardino Ochino has fled to Constance. Thus, he was able to preempt the emperor's extradition demand. Sebastian Schertlin also managed to escape, but his whereabouts are still unknown. Bullinger does not know the situation of Johannes Haller and the other Zurichers [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] active in Augsburg. The Zurich council sent a messenger [Hans Zingg] there on Sunday [January 30].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Anton Fugger negotiated the peace [between Augsburg and the emperor]. This makes it clear that Augsburg's misfortune comes from the "tax collectors." The imperial promise that the people of Augsburg may continue to practice their religion freely is a ruse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Lindau is also said to have capitulated. How long will Constance hold out? Bishop Johann von Weeze has offered to mediate between this city and the emperor. May God bring about the end! The emperor shows himself personally to demonstrate that he lacks nothing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse are said to be holding out bravely. Whether this is true, Bullinger does not know. Myconius, who likely receives news from the north, should share it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Human loyalty is gone! One must turn to the Lord. He will not abandon his own, even if he rightfully punishes them at present. Meanwhile, Bullinger and Myconius should continue to proclaim the word of life!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Blessing wish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] P.S.: Greetings to Johannes Gast. Why has he been silent for so long?</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. The situation is very desperate for humans, but for humans, I say, not for the Lord, who will certainly save His honor and further our salvation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>How the five cities have sworn an oath, Oporinus will show you; but do not spread it widely, for under such conditions I have given it to him. It is over for all the southern German cities, also for Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Bernardino Ochino has fled to Constance, as he was summoned by the emperor along with Mr. Sebastian Schertlin. Where he has gone, I do not know. I do not know the situation of Haller and our people. My lords sent a messenger there on Sunday.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Anton Fugger has made peace, so we see this calamity arising mainly from the tax collectors. The emperor has promised them to let them remain by their religion and liberty. But it is a deception; it is artifice and lies!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Lindau is also said to have capitulated. How long Constance will remain steadfast, God knows! The bishop of Lund offers much fatherly loyalty and love, and how he wants to obtain a good honorable peace for them with the imperial majesty. May God bring an end to this miserable life! The emperor is said to show himself freely and be heard, as it is not lacking, but that he lives.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Saxony and Hesse are said to be holding out bravely. I do not know if it is true or how much there is to it. I would like to hear from you what you have from the north, for you should have something to report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>God be with you. February 2, 1547.</p>

      <p>I see little or no faith, solidity, and constancy remaining among humans. Therefore, let us turn to the Lord, who, even if He afflicts us for our merits, will not abandon His own; and let us be, I pray, strong in the Lord, announcing the word of life and consolation entrusted to us by God. The Lord will be with His own!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell again. Your Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Many greetings to Gastius, whose excessive silence I cannot sufficiently marvel at.</p>
      <p>To his Myconius. Basel.</p>
