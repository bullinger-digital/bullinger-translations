      <p>S. D. I write this, dear brother, so that I may not write nothing to you.</p>
      <p>Your letters are now presented to me, exhausted by the task of writing, at 2 in the afternoon, which I mention so that you may consider this writing, however it may be, kindly. But difficult and numerous tasks almost overwhelm and oppress me. I read with sorrow what you write about your poverty; more disturbing were those things you write about the efforts of Ganthner, a seditious man, whose malicious arts are aided by the not sufficiently prepared eloquence of our Campelli in speaking. But trust in the Lord; pray to Him diligently, that He may be with you, and bend hearts to His holy will. If they expel you, which I do not think will easily happen, the Lord's providence will not desert you. Abraham said to his only son: "The Lord will provide." Continue in the way of the Lord and do not yield to evils. You know the saying of the heathen: "Do not yield to evils, but go forth more boldly against them." For several days now, I have diligently inquired if I might find the judgment of the distinguished man Dr. Urbanus Rhegius and the entire Duchy of Lüneburg on punishing heretics, of which you speak. The day before yesterday, I found it printed in Saxony, Celle of the Saxons; I immediately had it copied; it is a German booklet, certainly elegant and brief. Ganthner draws from the chronicles of Sebastian Franck; for in the chapter on heretics, he places the judgment of Brentius and Oedembachius on not punishing heretics among the Anabaptists. One booklet of Rhegius is quite sufficient to refute the nonsense of these people. I hope you will come to us soon, when indeed the convenience of the church will allow leisure; we will then discuss all matters more fully, even about Hegelin. We cannot all gather together. Let him serve his church, in which there are certainly also good people; let him overlook the injuries of the wicked.</p>
      <p>Nowhere will he find such a church where there are no thorns. But I think his wife, because she is from Zürich, will want to return to Zürich entirely; for since the time he married her, he has proposed nothing else than to remain in Zürich. But there are many who deserve to be promoted before him. And he has not come to you with any public testimonials; one or two have recommended him, but according to the rule: Asked, he asks.</p>
      <p>When I have more leisure and spirit, I will write more fully. Tell, I pray, Dr. Campelli that I have received his letters, to which I will respond at another time. May the Lord bless him! Greet him. If you have anything about Italian affairs and those of the Venetians, then the city of Ferrara, let me know on occasion.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Zwingli, my son-in-law, touched by apoplexy on February 11, happily passed to the Lord. Several other good men here and elsewhere have been taken by the same disease. May the Lord preserve us!</p>
      <p>In Zürich, February 23, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May the lords, the consuls, Bonettus, Pontisella, Gregorius, and our other friends, also Dr. Ruinella, etc., be safe.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Dr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
