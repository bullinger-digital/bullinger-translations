    <p xml:id="regest1">Provides information about the number of inhabitants and the endowment of the parish of Wülflingen. [Michael] Schlauer, who is to take up the parish office in Wädenswil, is still held up in Winterthur and therefore cannot preach there on April 8th, but only on April 15th; asks Bullinger to inform the undersigned Burkhard [Wirz] of this. Greetings. [Johannes] Blum recommends himself for the parish office [Oberwinterthur] through his good human qualities.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What you wish to be communicated to you by letter, receive thus in a few words. First, I believe the church of Wülflingen to be notable for about three hundred people, or perhaps more, as I gather from certain conjectures. Then, the right to confer this benefice belongs to our council in Winterthur. Lastly, from the storehouse of our hospital (des Spitals), the goods owed to the bishop are annually dispensed: 40 bushels of wheat, 10 bushels of oats, 8 barrels of wine; to these are added smaller tithes, and the winter fodder for one or two cows, then a few other minor things, which are too insignificant to be worth mentioning in writing.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the steward of Wädenswil, as he is commonly called, my relative, expects Schlauer, his new bishop, to be with him next Sunday and to preach there for the public assembly; for so I understand they have recently agreed among themselves. However, Schlauer is delayed by me, so that he cannot adhere to the agreement. He is not allowed to leave the city by a nail's breadth this week due to the occupations that almost overwhelm me, yet he has entirely resolved to take me as a companion for the journey. I also understand that the prefect wishes the same; we shall see if they can agree on the competence with me as the arbiter. Nevertheless, the following Sunday, which will be Mercy Sunday, the new bishop will preach to his church with me listening; for so the decision stands entirely, unless the Lord wills otherwise. Therefore, I beseech you by Christ, to ensure that the same is communicated to Burkhard, the undersigned, through someone else, if it is burdensome for you or not possible due to occupations, so that he may inform his brother of the change of plan.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well. You will bid your wife, mother, and children dearest to me, much health in my words.</p>
      <p>And remember our Blum, who indeed is judged to be more worthy of this most renowned and too populous bishopric, as he seems to be far removed from the crime of ambition, for he does not covet anything greater or more useful than what he possesses, which is his modesty; meanwhile, he strives to deserve beautifully by the elegance of his manners and the addition of other virtues, so that someday a more prosperous fortune may shine upon him with the favor of the good.</p>
      <p>In the year 1537, on the Nones of April.</p>
      <p>Your H. Lüthi.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, among the people of Zurich from sacred sermons, his brother above others to be revered.</p>
