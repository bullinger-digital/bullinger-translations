    <p xml:id="regest1">Accepts his admonition [No. 1977] with thanks and a clear conscience and is surprised that Luther was angered by the not yet published works of Zwingli; since [the people of Zurich] remained silent about the attacks on Zwingli in the writings of Luther and his followers, as well as Luther's letter to Froschauer [from August 31, 1543], they cannot be considered the instigators of the new conflict, but now they must confront Luther, even if they do so reluctantly and will exercise restraint; with God's help, they want to defend the true faith against the Pope, Luther, Schwenckfeld, the Anabaptists, and others, leaving the judgment to the Church. Requests a favorable reception of this letter and intercession. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your fraternal admonition does not offend me at all; rather, I thank you for it, dear Bucer. Meanwhile, our conscience comforts us, as it is aware of no wrongdoing in this matter and remains at peace. It is surprising how Luther could have been inflamed against us by Zwingli's works, which have not yet been published. If the publication of those books, which they poured out in the dispute over the Lord's Supper, provides a just cause for fighting, we would have had just reasons to renew the fight several years ago, since the books written against Zwingli by Luther or his followers have been reprinted many times. What is more, in almost every book published since that dispute, Luther has criticized Zwingli. This can be demonstrated from the books themselves. Furthermore, you know what he wrote about us to Froschauer. You know how stubbornly we have restrained both our tongues and pens in response to all that. Therefore, we are not the authors of the renewed conflict. I will not now speak of how we have conducted ourselves in the matter of restoring concord. We do not fear Luther, nor do we despise him. We do not willingly enter the arena with him, yet we will not flee in fear, but will respond to the man with the utmost modesty, trusting in the goodness of our cause and armed with divine assistance, if indeed a response is necessary. We are certain that we hold the catholic and orthodox faith, doctrine, and religion; with God's help, we will confess this to our last breath against the Pope, Luther, Schwenckfeld, the Anabaptists, and other obstinate teachers of that kind. Do not be upset that I count Luther among them. For if he continues to attack our doctrine, which is one of piety, we cannot help but count him among those who oppose the truth. "But you have not yet proven," you say, "that you hold and defend the truth." Let the church judge, which will also understand by whose fault this conflict has been renewed.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my brother, to kindly consider these matters of ours and to pray to the Lord for us, in whom alone all our hope is placed.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your loved ones. The brothers greet you. Zurich, September 29, 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Martin Bucer, respected and beloved lord and brother. Strasbourg.</p>
