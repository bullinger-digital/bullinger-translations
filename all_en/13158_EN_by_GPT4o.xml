      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ. Although, most vigilant bishop, I have no doubt that my personal affairs and their necessity are most commendable to your paternal care, since human nature is so arranged that it must always be rescued from forgetfulness, and you are overwhelmed almost daily with infinite tasks, it is to be feared that my children, especially the older one, who now greatly desires exercise due to his age and condition, may not be sufficiently present in your mind. A rumor is spreading among us that the so-called Episcopal Cell will soon be seeking a schoolmaster, and if there is anything to it, it will first reach your ears. Then remember ours, I pray, for we have hoped that he would be quite sufficient for a somewhat renowned school, if he is diligent, unless you think he should be advised in another way; for you will acknowledge that I am unequal to such numbers and such expenses.</p>
      <p>Given hastily from Rüti. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Your Georg Stäheli (Chalybäus).</p>
      <p>To the learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
