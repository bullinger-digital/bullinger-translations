    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received two letters from Bullinger [not preserved] delivered by [Johannes] Haller. If only he could respond accordingly! But he has been suffering from headaches for almost a whole month.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The entire [Augsburg] church was very pleased with Haller's arrival. Frölich will assist Haller in domestic matters to the best of his ability. He has temporarily taken in Haller with his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and child [Agnes] until their apartment is ready.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He also managed to arrange for Hans Wilpert Zoller to stay with Sebastian Schertlin for a year at no cost. However, if needed, Zoller must assist the Augsburg council. Otherwise, he can support Schertlin. The Augsburg council wants to express its gratitude to the Zurich council [for sending Haller] in this way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Frölich mourns deeply for Erasmus Schmid, especially since he noticed his zeal for faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Frölich will request Bullinger's lecture [against any understanding with the Papists] back from Haller and read it eagerly. How can Frölich ever repay Bullinger for all the kindnesses? As soon as he receives Bullinger's book "De sacramentis" from Haller, he will share his opinion on it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Regarding the dedication of Bullinger's commentary on Luke, he wrote at length last time [No. 2351] considering the rank and name of [the two former mayors Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot]. Neither of them studied. However, Welser is proficient in French, Italian, and Spanish and has visited the respective countries. He is therefore more cultured than [Herbrot]. He comes from an old noble family. Frölich saw documents proving that [Welser's] ancestors were already mayors in [Augsburg] 400 years ago. Welser also possesses a pure faith and is anti-Lutheran. [Herbrot] is the first of his family to hold the mayor's office. He is magnanimous, eloquent, and slightly prone to rashness. If only he would lay aside his pride! [Welser and Herbrot] are both rich in children and money. A little envy is already noticeable between them. Whether Bullinger dedicates his commentary to both or just one of them, he certainly does nothing wrong. Perhaps Frölich expressed himself more clearly in his earlier letter; he now finds himself incomprehensible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- There is no news of the [planned] writings of Luther against [the Sacramentarians]. These will probably not appear anymore if it is true that Luther has died, as was reported from Nuremberg the day before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich will look out for Hans Vogler [the Younger] and do his utmost.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Frölich will keep the information about the scholar [Theodor Bibliander]'s plan to himself. As soon as he has sought advice from knowledgeable people (without mentioning [Bibliander]'s name), he will answer the questions posed to him. As far as Frölich knows, such an undertaking is not only dangerous but also pointless, especially since the Mohammedans do not let anyone approach them. Therefore, he would advise against it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The difficult question that Bullinger also posed will be answered by Frölich another time, and he will inquire about it until then.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Frölich likes the antiphon [...] against the verse [“Aspice nudatas...”] by [Giovanni Antonio] Campano. If he didn't have such headaches, he would also add something to it. Bullinger forgot to reveal to him the author of the pentameter [verse]; perhaps it is Bibliander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Due to his headaches, Frölich could not respond to the letters from [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Johannes] Wolf, and [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger]; Bullinger should apologize to them on his behalf. [Konrad] Gessner is planning to honor Frölich [with a dedicatory epistle]; this makes Frölich anxious and happy at the same time. However, Gessner should rather refrain from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings to both mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to Bibliander, to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Konrad Gessner], [Konrad] Pellikan, Wolf, Gwalther, and to all others who are well-disposed towards Frölich.</p>

      <p>S. I received from you, most esteemed brother, letters through Haller, our mutual friend, filled with all friendship and piety. If only I could respond to them with the dignity and decorum they deserve! Indeed, I have been almost continuously unwell for nearly a whole month now. I suffer especially from headaches, from which my little efforts should flow. Therefore, accept what my weakness dictates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>First, you should know that the entire church was very pleased with Haller's arrival. He is also received with a cheerful face, and I do not doubt that both our church and he himself have greatly benefited from this journey to us. May the most merciful parent of all things preserve him for us! Amen. I will diligently strive to do what I can for his affairs, especially domestic ones. I have taken him in with his wife and little child into my house until their own home is sufficiently comfortable and beautiful, which will be completed in a few days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for Hilpert Zoller, I easily persuaded Lord Sebastian Schertler, a truly strong and vigorous man whose heart is in my hand, to take him into his fellowship and company and to support him for a year without expense, on the condition that, if necessary, Zoller serves our magistrate. In the meantime, he will stand by Schertler's side and enjoy his company both at home and abroad. For it is fitting for our council to gratify the renowned Zurich magistrate in this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I deeply mourn the departure of Erasmus Fabritius, for I indeed discovered his singular fervor towards religion. May he therefore be a favorable precursor for us to that heavenly homeland. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I will request your oration back from Haller and read it eagerly as a book flowing from one who can write nothing unworthy. I owe you and have eternal thanks, for you never fail to remember me, indeed you overwhelm me with accumulated duties. But how, I beg, can I repay you? I will also request your book on the nature of the sacraments from Haller and will not hide my judgment from you, however much a cobbler I may be in judging Apellean art.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I wrote to you at length recently about my advice on the dedication of your Luke, and in that writing, I did not neglect the status and condition of the men. Neither of them is skilled in letters. However, Welser, well-versed in French, Italian, and Spanish, was once an explorer of those regions and is therefore more civil than the other. He is of a very ancient and noble lineage. I have seen letters testifying that his ancestors were consuls here 400 years ago. He defends the purity of religion most earnestly, being a great opponent of Luther.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7">
      <p>The other is the first of his family to hold the consulship. He is magnanimous, eloquent, and almost precocious. If only he would moderate his excessive ostentation! I hope this will happen after a few years when the bull has somewhat worn down his horns. Both are rich in children and wealth. I sense a little rivalry between them. But whether you dedicate your work to both or to one alone, there is no error. Perhaps you will understand me more clearly in my previous letter; now I seem obscure even to myself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have heard nothing yet about Luther's writings against you and us, nor do I think anything will come to light now, especially if it is true that Luther has passed away, as was written to us from Nuremberg yesterday. I firmly believe that most giants will become milder as a result. Nevertheless, may the Lord's will be done. Once I am certain about this, I will inform you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I will diligently inquire about Johann Vogler of St. Gallen and will not cease to be benevolent and dutiful for your sake. What is commendable to you should be most observant to me by right.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The communication of the plan or institution of a certain respectable and learned man will remain with me. However, neither my strength nor my affairs have allowed me to explore the solution to the proposed questions in this short time. As soon as it can be done, I will approach and consult those knowledgeable in these matters, suppressing the name, etc. Nevertheless, as far as I have understood from some past accounts, I consider such an undertaking not only dangerous but not even possible, as the Mohammedans have closed off all access to these things, etc. Therefore, I think such a great man should rather be dissuaded from that praiseworthy journey, lest he pursue uncertainties and lose what is certain, both for himself and for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest10">
      <p>You have posed to me the Gordian knot, a most delightful question indeed, but since I am now Davus, not Oedipus, I will answer you another time. In the meantime, I will also solicit others in the same way about this Sphinx's business. However, I give you my greatest thanks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I similarly like the antiphon against Campani, a wicked man's jest, and if I were not now excessively burdened with a headache, I would also add something. You wanted to reveal to me the author of the pentameters, but you overlooked it, perhaps by forgetfulness, although I persuade myself that it is Bibliander.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The excellent men Gwalther, Wolf, and the distinguished young man Ulrich Zwingli wrote to me, to each of whom I would most willingly reply; but indeed my brain did not allow it in this way. Therefore, I beg you by our faith to excuse me to them as best you can. Gesner has deigned to honor me, as I hear, with great and immortal honor; this makes me as anxious as it does joyful. Many know me who also confess with me and know how short my supply is, how little talent I have. Therefore, I beg you by our charity to prevent praises from being made to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Greet both consuls, Bibliander, the city clerk, Gessner, Pellican, Wolf, Gwalther, and each one who is well-disposed towards Laetus. Farewell, my honor. Most swiftly. March 2, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, G. Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, also a friend and brother to be revered in every way. Zurich.</p>
