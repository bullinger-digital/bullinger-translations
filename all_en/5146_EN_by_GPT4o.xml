      <p>Greetings. I do not have the time to write more extensively now; therefore, I am sending you the letters you see here, dearest brother. Please hand these over to the next convenient messenger, who will return them to me well-wrapped and sealed. I have also included letters from Mr. Schenck, as I understood from yours that you desired them; your letters were delivered to me in good faith by Mr. Nüscheler's widow.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from Bern at any moment; for the esteemed magistrate has sent a messenger there. In recent days, Mr. Haller wrote to me from Bern: "Duke Alba is being sent to Brabant to establish the Spanish Inquisition there.</p>
      <p>He has sent ahead Count Horn to prepare the way for him; he has learned that there are over a hundred thousand men who would rather perish than accept such tyranny; Philip should remember under what conditions the Netherlands came under his power." It is said that the Spaniard is entirely preparing for war against France and promises his support to the Pope and the Duke of Savoy, with whom they have been dealing for a long time; they are very busy and restless.</p>
      <p>May God make them and others who are restless, peaceful! If you hear anything substantial from the Diet, let me know. I hear they intend to sow new discord, and the Duke of Württemberg is coming there with many horses. It is also said that Ferdinand is restless and is recruiting soldiers.</p>
      <p>Whatever you find out about these matters, let me know in due time. There is also supposed to be a captain in Constance, Hercules Gall; he is supposed to have orders from Savoy to recruit mercenaries, and otherwise, three regiments are supposed to be accepted soon, if it is true what some are boasting, etc. Farewell excellently with Mr. Matthias.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Huser, the mayor, and Gisler along with other good men. Our people send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>January 23, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
