      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, venerable and most beloved lord, along with the handwritten booklet, which I am returning to you. You have done me a most pleasing favor; for although the parts of this controversy have been quite clear to me before, and I have always abhorred not so much the crude opinion of the Lutherans as their rash judgments and that unbridled and scandalous biting nature, with which their books abound, it has nevertheless grieved me that the course of the gospel is so greatly hindered by this dissension. And as I have never doubted that it is not your fault that a holy and solid concord does not coalesce among the churches, it is equally surprising that no one has ever appeared who seems to strive for peace and concord, except for this Doctor from Göppingen. Therefore, hearing various judgments about his book, I dared to ask for your judgment with a sincere mind, which indeed pleases me and Mr. Borro, to whom I have communicated this alone, and we have some hope that, even if they obstinately persist because they depend on the authority of Luther and the princes, a clearer knowledge of simple truth will arise among all nations.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, let us pray to the Lord for the successful progress of His kingdom. These days, a certain prince from the Kingdom of Naples (if I am not mistaken) has arrived, drawn by the knowledge of evangelical truth (as I hear), so much so that he has left his homeland and decided to live near me. It seems to me that Babylon is about to fall and that the Lord is hastening to bring out His chosen ones quickly. Regarding my relative, I want you to know that I have managed, with the recommendation of Habsburg, that the margrave will soon call him to himself, so that he may be appointed steward and use his service in the monastery in Sulzberg and all ecclesiastical revenues throughout the dominion of Hochberg and Rötteln or elsewhere. Tomorrow I expect Habsburg, who will inform me about this matter.</p>
      <p>This is to be praised in that prince, otherwise not praiseworthy in all respects, that he decides to seize no church goods for himself, but to devote everything to pious uses. Regarding our magistrate, I hear these days that it has been decreed that the soldier is to be denied to the French and that it is to be diligently pursued that they extricate themselves from that alliance, after the French were the first to break faith with them. Oh, may the Lord bring this about.</p>
      <p>But more on these matters another time.</p>
      <p>Regarding our Englishmen, a good part remains here; the rest will move to Aarau, unless more tolerable conditions are offered in Wivisbach. Last week, I went up to Aarau with them and easily obtained a place for them among the citizens themselves; but we could not find houses and dwellings except for seven families. The Church of St. Ursula was granted to them, and the exercise of wool weaving, even though some wealthier individuals protested. Praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your family and brothers. Basel, August 5, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
