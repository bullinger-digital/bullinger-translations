      <p> Greetings. We are all well through the Lord, dear Bullinger, and I wish to hear the same about you and your family, as I am concerned by your long silence. Anna, your daughter, came to me in Lenzburg with her husband on the first of November, anxiously wishing to reconcile with me with many tears, asking for forgiveness for her fault. After a moderate reproach of the deed, aided by your advice in all things, I forgave her fault, and all the more readily, as the love of God and paternal affection moved me vividly. Afterwards, we went together to my son-in-law Leonard in Reinach; there, too, with the old enmity erased, we came together in the Lord, which, with the inspiration of the Lord's spirit, ended most happily. Finally, after a few days, they left for Gochlingen with much joy of heart and were very reluctantly dismissed by me in the meantime (as a parent's heart dictates). I am very glad, my brother, that everything is calm and peaceful with my family, although I sincerely wish that my son-in-law Constantin would be transferred elsewhere, so that he would not be forced to stay longer with his parent, where the freedom to speak the truth of the Lord is not as secure as it is with us. But perhaps God will also bring an end to this. On this occasion, the Lord has granted us enough benefits, undoubtedly to give greater ones in the future. </p>
      <p> I have not yet heard anything about the warlike tumults, except that Margrave Albrecht, another Attila, continues to rage in Upper Germany, especially against the Nurembergers; I fear that the coming spring will bring even harsher things. But our sins, for which there is no repentance, have not deserved anything else. A bad knot requires a bad wedge. Enough playing around, the horrible abuse of God's long-suffering cannot bear this any longer. I am deeply grieved, more than can be expressed, about the miserable fall of the Kingdom of England. Oh, how profound are the judgments of the Lord, who sends Manasseh after Hezekiah. Enough. Farewell, dearest brother and incomparable friend. I sincerely wish your wife and your entire family well. Given in Lenzburg, November 21, 1553. </p>
      <p> Your Gervasius. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, my lord, teacher, and dearest brother in Christ. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
