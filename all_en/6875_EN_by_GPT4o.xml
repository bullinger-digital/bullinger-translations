      <p>When (dearest father) I thought that I had not sent you any letters for a long time, by which you could be informed both about my studies and my condition, now having found a good opportunity to write, I did not hesitate to write something to you. The reason I have not written to you for a long time is that certain readings have been an obstacle and impediment, so that I have not sent letters to you as often as I could have. However, I am sure that you will accept them with as much equanimity as if I had written to you long ago, as long as you know the reason. If you wish to know anything about our studies, know that we are reading the second book of Horace's "Odes" and "Epistles," along with Lucian's Greek dialogues, which indeed are dear and very important to me, and I would not willingly lose them, for if they were lost, as the teacher would have said, I could no longer recover them. As for health, know that we are all well by the will of the best and greatest God, and I would be glad if you could enjoy such health. I could write nothing else to you, except that Eustachius Sanchetus's mother has died. Master Stucki sends you many greetings. You will also greet, in my name, if it pleases you, Dorothea and Veritas and other friends of mine. I will therefore make an end of writing and pray to the best and greatest God, that he may always keep you safe in his protection. Farewell. Given on the thirteenth day before the calends of September 1566.</p>
      <p>Your always most beloved son, Mathieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and full of erudition man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich. [In Zürich].</p>
