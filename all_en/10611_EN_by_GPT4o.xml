    <p xml:id="regest1">Forwards Ambrosius [Blarer's] request to send Konrad Lüthard, thanks Pellikan for his letter to the Pfullingen nuns - since the people of Zurich do not want to let Pellikan go as a Hebrew teacher [to Tübingen], he should not be further pressured - and apologizes for not writing himself. Zwick recommends the letter bearer.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, write to Bullinger to send Konrad Lüthard, whom he has recommended once and again, indicating what kind of man he is and what kind of church should be entrusted to him by merit. Give my thanks to Pellikan for the letter to the Pfullingen nuns; for I strongly hope it will be very beneficial to the minds of those women.</p>
      <p>However, since here in the Hebrew lectures he either cannot or does not want to promise his continuous service, and Bullinger writes that we cannot obtain this from the people of Zurich, we will not further trouble such a holy man in every way, to whom you will excuse me as diligently as you can, and likewise to Bullinger, for not writing. The affairs of so many churches vex me beyond strength and measure, leaving no time remaining that I can dedicate to greeting such distinguished friends." This is what Ambrosius wants to be done, having written these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, April 12, 1535.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter has some business with your people, which you will understand from him. He is truly a good and pious man, who, serving God more than men, has lived as an exile among us for some time. If you extend your hand, you will have done so to someone neither unworthy nor ungrateful.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most holy men, Lords Heinrich Bullinger and Konrad Pellikan, to be observed with the utmost zeal, in Zurich.</p>
