    <p xml:id="regest1">After he recently sent Frecht a letter and his book ["De scripturae sanctae authoritate"] through the Zurich delegation to King Ferdinand, a dispatch with documents on the concord negotiations now follows. Frecht may only confidentially disclose the letter to be delivered by the messenger to Luther to his fellow pastors for the time being; the people of Zurich hope for Luther's approval. Bullinger will send Frecht the [First Helvetic] Confession and its explanation upon request. Best wishes.</p>

      <p>Bullinger to Frecht.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>When not many days ago a delegate was sent to the king from our council, it seemed good to you, brother in the Lord, to write a few things and to add our books dedicated to the King of England as a gift. I understood from our Zwicker that our gift was received by you with a grateful heart. Therefore, I wanted to send you this second letter, dearest Frecht, and also to add some documents of concord, so that you may explain to other brothers around you what has been done among us.</p>
      <p>The messenger here carries a letter to Doctor Luther. Therefore, see what needs to be done, do not publicly share the example of the letter destined for Doctor Luther with these brothers, which you think has been returned to Doctor Luther by the messenger as the original. In the meantime, you can share it with trusted ones. After the letter has been delivered, you may share it with anyone. We hope Doctor Luther will respond amicably and accept the condition.</p>
      <p>If you have not yet seen the Basel Confession and its exposition, let me know; you shall have it.</p>
      <p>We who teach Christ in Zurich are all well. The affairs of our church are in excellent condition, praise and thanks to the Lord. We also wish you to be well in the Lord. Pray for us to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 12th of June, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
