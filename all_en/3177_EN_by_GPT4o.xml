      <p>To his most esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis wishes health.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, through a certain Neapolitan named Apollonius Merenda, I wrote to you, my excellent and most respected Lord Bullinger. In truth, I did not write but rather poured out my thoughts, as he found me completely unprepared and occupied with various matters, and he also hastened his journey rather importunately. Therefore, if I have written or will write to such a great man in a less composed or more uncouth manner, I ask that you excuse me. Indeed, I do not quite remember what I wrote then, and it may be that I repeat something now. But you, with your singular kindness, will consider everything favorably. Meanwhile, my Lord Bullinger, while I was in the Valtellina (where I stayed for about 7 weeks due to my duties as syndic), as soon as I reached Sondrio, I wrote to you diligently recounting everything that was worth your knowing, and I fear you did not receive those letters, nor perhaps the one I sent to you later for the third time. The reason I fear this is because in your last letters to me (in which you also sent me your most elegant speeches on the end of the world and the coming judgment, which were exceedingly pleasing to me, and for which I give you singular thanks), you seem to accuse me of prolonged silence. If, therefore, my letters have not been delivered to you from time to time, you have reason to complain, and so do I; but we must both complain about the couriers, whose treachery causes letters to be lost. But henceforth I will be more cautious in entrusting them; for I will not entrust them except to messengers worthy of trust; for, like the fisherman, I will learn from being struck, and moreover, I promise not to give you cause to reproach me for negligence or prolonged silence in the future, since I see that you not only do not disdain my letters but also (such is your kindness) demand them from me. Meanwhile, if I have interrupted your holy studies with my most unpolished letters, you will forgive me. Now, indeed, I have almost nothing new to write; all is silent. The French army is stationed in the March of Ancona; where it will eventually go is unknown. The Venetians, although they enjoy perpetual peace, do not cease to survey and fortify their domain on all sides with all diligence, and to augment all their military forces, both land and sea, with reinforcements, lest they be found unprepared in case of some sudden uprising against them. For they suspect the Turk from the maritime side, who is said to have equipped a huge fleet to attack Austria, and on the other side, they fear everything, as they see themselves surrounded on all sides by the arms of powerful princes.</p>
      <p>Among us, it is whispered that in the name of the King of France, a regiment of soldiers should soon be enlisted and led towards France to suppress the attempts of the King of England, who is about to invade France. It is also reported that the French have captured Volfancram, a fortified and very strategically important place in the Duchy of Milan; but there was also a rumor that the town of Asti had come under French control, which I believe less. It has also become widespread among us that Ferdinand Gonzaga will make a journey through our regions towards Flanders, as he has been summoned by the King of England to take on the general command of the army; but I do not think the Lords of the Grisons will allow this, since it is stipulated in the treaty made with the King of France that passage should not be granted to his enemies through our regions. And these are indeed the news that I now share with you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my Lord Bullinger, I am eager to hear whether you and your entire family are well; for I wish for your and all your family's health no less than my own and that of all mine. For I love, respect, and honor you and your household as much as anyone, and as I confess this sincerely and without any pretense, so may the best and greatest God make all my affairs fortunate and safe. Therefore, my Lord Bullinger, when leisure permits, you will deign to gladden me with your letters, which are indeed most delightful, and you will inform me about my son, whether he has visited the baths and how he is conducting himself. Since I know he is no less dear to you than to me, indeed, since you consider him as much yours, while he is under your care, as mine, I do not commend him to you. For he is, without a doubt, most commendable to you, given your immense kindness. Whatever he may need, you will not hesitate to provide, whether in clothes, books, or anything else. For I will not regret any expense incurred for preserving health and forming a decent and honorable life. If, therefore, money is needed, I ask you to write, and I will send what you request, although, as I have previously informed you, I have persuaded myself that after the fairs in Chur, which are celebrated around the feast of Corpus Christi, as they say, I will come there to visit you and other pious and holy men (whose memory remains perpetually in my mind) and finally my son. Nor do I know anything now that could divert me from this purpose, unless perhaps I should be required to go to Venice by order of the Lords of the Grisons, although I hope that my mission can be postponed until after my return from Zurich. To Mr. Johann Fabricius, the preacher of Chur, whom you have so highly recommended to me and to all good people, I have written diligently, offering him myself and all my resources in friendship. I expect to meet him soon, and then we will also form a closer friendship and intimacy in person. Although this has already been quite successfully initiated between us, even though we are absent, under the auspices of such a great man as Lord Bullinger. If it happens that I can do anything to promote his interests and dignity, I will render such service to him that no kind of friendly duty will be lacking from me, and so that he will also feel that your recommendation has great influence with me.</p>
      <p>But I have been quite lengthy with you, and perhaps the time has come for me to sound the retreat. Yet there is this remaining, which I ask, that you continually hold me in your commendation and greet your most honorable wife and your entire family in my name and also in my wife's name, and I ask that you also, when it is convenient for you, bid greetings in my name to the distinguished gentlemen, Mr. Lavater, Zwingli, Josias, your sons-in-law, Mr. Rudolf Walther (whom I have long esteemed highly for his remarkable learning, which he seemed to me to possess, and now, having read his published annotations on the canonical epistles, I esteem even more highly), as well as Mr. Gesner, Mr. Frisius, and finally the entire assembly of pious and learned men known to me, to all of whom you will also earnestly commend me. Meanwhile, I beseech you not to forget the most venerable elders and those who have served the Christian republic so well, Mr. Bernardino Ochino and Mr. Peter Martyr Vermigli, but to greet them in my name as well and commend me to them and offer myself entirely, to whom, as to all others, I pray for a long life. Forgive me, I pray, my most delightful Lord Bullinger, if I have been too lengthy; for you are partly to blame, as you have admonished me to write more often. For from this I gather that you not only do not disdain my letters but also welcome them and receive them with a very grateful mind, which I indeed consider a sign of the highest favor and for which I therefore thank you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, the most singular glory and ornament of Switzerland, and may you always remember me.</p>
      <p>Given at Samaden on the 10th of May, 1557.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Bergomas, the true minister of our church, greets you greatly.</p>
      <p>The same who is always most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and patron, always to be highly esteemed and respected. In Zurich.</p>
