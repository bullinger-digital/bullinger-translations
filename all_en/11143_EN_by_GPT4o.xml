    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on what has happened since the negotiations of the Aargau pastors with the council [about the revision of the catechism]: Deacon Jakob [Meyer] was dismissed due to his resistance against the new catechism, but at the request of the Aargau people, he was pardoned and transferred to a rural community; the city pastors apologized to the Aargau people, approved their proposals, entertained them, and advocated with the city clerk for the correction of the catechism and the swift issuance of the farewell. The reason for this apparent change of the Bucerans is their fear of open rebellion; they are trying to cover up the change in the catechism. Meanwhile, the bailiff of Bipp was questioned about a song, during which he stated that a preacher from Solothurn had predicted Bern's imminent return to the Roman Church, referring to the [Lutheran] teachings of the pastor of Koppigen. Jakob Seckler also came under suspicion because of a verse, and [...] von Erlach was interrogated about it; the latter had already proven his discretion earlier when he was to be questioned about a conversation with Martin Zulauf. Rhellikan expects not to be able to stay in Bern much longer and requests a formal recall. He heard from Blasius that Megander in Aarau unintentionally offended Venner [Im Haag]; after [Anton] Noll also learned of this, Megander must prepare for difficulties. Greetings. Blasius, too, must expect a summons due to the message he delivered to Erasmus [Ritter] on Megander's behalf; he therefore asks Megander for advice. At the request of the pastor of [Groß-]Höchstetten, the council has allowed a disputation with Anabaptists to be held in Bern; further details are not yet known.</p>

      <p>Greetings and a peaceful conscience through Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you have already received news of what was done at the meeting of the Aargau brothers and what was obtained here from the smaller council. Therefore, I will only pursue here what has happened in the meantime, and then I will add a few things about my own affairs. On the very day you, Megander, departed from here, Deacon Jakob had his diaconate revoked because he refused to agree to the new catechism. However, the next day, at the intercession and request of the Aargau brothers, he was granted access to another priesthood, but not in the city. He awaits this while enjoying his previous stipend until he is appointed to a church in the countryside. On that very day and the following, three of our preachers apologized to the Aargau brothers for any offense they may have caused. They treated them with such humanity and benevolence that they approved everything they had reported to the council and wished to change, held feasts with them in a public inn, and in turn hosted them at an evening symposium in the provostry along with many others. For this occasion, Schleiphius sent honorary wine, two measures of Burgundy wine. Not content with this, the aforementioned preachers also brought eight booklets (if I am not mistaken) to the secretary, according to the number of chapters, so that a new gloss could be added. They also earnestly requested from the lord of secrets, after the departure of the Aargau brothers, that the writing of the actions be expedited so that it could be delivered to them while they were still on their journey.</p>
      <p>Although I am of slow wit, I easily guessed what all these things were tending towards, and I even communicated some things to the Aargau people, namely that everything seemed suspicious to me, since they had suddenly become so excessively kind from being so harsh, from malicious to benevolent. I thought - as was indeed the case and the event later showed - that the Bucerans, deterred by the imminent danger, were doing everything they could to prevent the matter from turning into a tumult; for not long after the departure of the Aargau people, they absolutely refused to acknowledge that they had changed anything from their previous institution, just as they previously wanted to persuade everyone that they had established nothing new in the catechism. In this matter, although they seem to imitate that papist of Calenberg in a dissimilar way; for he, through the tricks you know, persuaded his ecclesiastical colonists that he had painted the work of Apelles on the walls, when he had painted nothing at all. But these people, in broad daylight and with a sound mind, try to take away from us the common sense of seeing and judging, so that the renewed catechism is not new and the booklet newly interpolated has no interpolation. O blind minds of men, o blind hearts!</p>
      <p>In this way, returning from fox-like to bear-like cunning, they do not cease to lay traps for good men. Three days ago, the bailiff of Bipp was summoned by the council and asked for the reason for the composed song. When he said fearlessly that he was moved by the fact that he knew for certain that the people of Solothurn were exhorting their congregations to remain steadfast in their faith and religion, for it was at the door that the Bernese would soon return to the way of the Holy Roman Church, for a great controversy had already arisen in the metropolis over the cause of the Eucharist, and among many others, the pastor of Koppigen plainly agreed with them about the presence of the Lord's body in the bread, he was ordered not to publish any such songs in the future without first presenting them to the council.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Jakob Seckler was attacked with such intrigues (because of a rhyme in a pasquinade written thus: "O Aargau, you noble treasure, you have remained by the dispute") that they arranged for a young nobleman from Erlach, an adversary, to be questioned whether (since he is familiar with him) he recognized Seckler's hand. But they tried this in vain; for the aforementioned young man also gave another not obscure example of how tenacious he is of a secret entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>For when by chance he was walking in the cemetery with Martin Zulauf, the former mayor of Bruges, a certain Buceran immediately suborned another young nobleman to fish out what was said between him and Zulauf.</p>
      <p>But the young man, sensing the trick, said: "I do not know about what frivolous matters we were talking."</p>
      <p>From this (as I think), my excellent brothers and patrons, you can easily guess what is to be hoped for from the Bernese republic and how long I may be allowed to stay here. Therefore, just as you have labored for my promotion so far, please ensure that what you have begun is completed as soon as possible. I indeed prescribe nothing to you about obtaining a position, because we know each other and I do not doubt that you will, to the best of your ability, look out for me as much as and where I can benefit the church of Christ. However, I would like this one thing (if it seems the same to you), that the province already assigned to me would recall me home with letters written to our council, and that because they are here behind, neither my godfather Caspar nor I would be slandered at home and that our lords in Zurich would not hold us in contempt (despise us), as the Buceran boys mockingly say: "I see well, they do not want to recall the lent fellows" etc. Megander (as Blasius, his companion, reported to me) is said to have jokingly said to Sepinus the bear-bearer in the inn at Aarau: "What are you doing here, heretic?" This jocular remark was taken seriously by Sepinus's companion and reported here to Noll, and he is making a great fuss about it and is constantly complaining about something. I have therefore thought it appropriate to write this here, my Megander, so that you may reflect on what and how you said, so that, if necessary, you may remember, also considering the witnesses to whom it was said.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the night of February 12, 1538.</p>
      <p>Deacon Jakob and M. Johannes, formerly of the Fribourg organists, well known to Leon and Megander, greet you in the Lord. On my behalf, you will greet our Theodore and your other colleagues, and please inform me as soon as possible about my new province.</p>
      <p>Once again, farewell for as long as possible, safe in soul and body for the use of Christ's church and the preservation of truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellikan. Megander, what you instructed Blasius to announce to Erasmus is being exaggerated to the point that the matter has been reported to the council, and that apostate has told Blasius that he too will be summoned. Therefore, he asks for your advice on how he should conduct himself, and he wishes to be informed of this through Lutius or another who will soon come here.</p>
      <p>Anabaptism is taking root among us in astonishing ways, so much so that several of the first rank in the Bernese countryside have petitioned the council through the pastor of Höchstetten to be allowed to clear themselves in a suitable place with public faith and to be better instructed (if they err). This has been granted by the council on the condition that the disputation be held in the metropolitan city. Whether they will dispute under these conditions and when this will happen, I do not know. Blasius reminded me of this during lunch when I was about to seal the letters.</p>
      <p>For the third time, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious men, Mr. Bullinger, Leon, and Megander, the most vigilant pastors of the Zurich church, their most esteemed friends and patrons. Zurich.</p>
