    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received the forwarded letters and Stumpf's writing well, although he did not receive them. He is very pleased with Stumpf's plan to visit Joachim Vadian in St. Gallen. Stumpf should do this, but in such a way that the monks of the St. Gallen Abbey do not learn about these historiographical projects. Froschauer suggested that Stumpf would need about six days for his undertaking, and he was willing to spend two crowns for it. Bullinger has reviewed the 4th book of Stumpf's "Eidgenössische Chronik" about ancient Helvetia; he likes it very much. He does not believe that Vadian has more material on it, except perhaps about the old German monasteries. He encloses his remarks on Book 4 [not received]. - He has advocated for Stumpf's son [Johann Rudolf] with a letter of recommendation [No. 2169] to Ambrosius Blarer, who will show it to the schoolmaster [Matthias Schenk]. - Bullinger and his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] send their regards to Stumpf's wife [Regula, née Brennwald]. - Bullinger is eagerly awaiting Book 5 [on "Thurgau"] and 6 [on "Zürichgau"]. - He requests the return of the small, old chronicle [...], which belongs to Oswald Sägisser; he is demanding it back daily.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Christ be with you, etc.</p>
      <p>I have received the letters you sent back to me along with your writing and understood their content. I am very pleased with your intention and advice. Proceed further and complete your plan; do it as secretly as you can, so that the monks do not notice, etc. And when I negotiated with Froschauer regarding the costs, he was very willing. He said: "I think the matter will take 6 days; I would gladly give 2 crowns," etc. Be assured, you have his support. I have reviewed the 4th book - Helvetia Antiqua - and I like it immensely. Praise be to God, who has given you grace and abundant experience. I do not believe that Mr. Dr. Vadian has more, except perhaps from the old monasteries of Germania; he might add that to yours, etc. However, you will surely manage the matter well. What I intended to report to you regarding the 4th book, I have enclosed here; do with it as you see fit, for benefit and good.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dear sir and brother, I am very willing to serve you and yours. Therefore, I have written this recommendation for your son to Mr. Ambrosius Blarer. He will show it to the schoolmaster and will undoubtedly recommend your boy to him.</p>
      <p>Now I have nothing further, except to send greetings from me and my wife to your dear wife. May God protect you faithfully.</p>
      <p>I am eagerly awaiting the 5th and 6th books. I have given you a small, old chronicle. It belongs to Mr. Oswald Sägisser. Please send it back to me promptly, as he is asking for it daily.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, June 2, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To his beloved lord and brother Mr. Johannes Stumpf, pastor in Stammheim.</p>
