      <p>Salvation through Christ, the liberator of all our captivities.</p>
      <p>The fact that Ulrich Eckstein lost my letters was either due to the man's negligence or malice. While negligence can indeed be indulged, malice cannot. However, I fear neither fault. Although I do not know what I wrote, I do know that I wrote nothing falsely. I loved the man not for his talent, but for his misery, and all of us who are ours have strived to overcome evil with good. Now I hear that he is remarkably ungrateful for our kindness, but this is only to his own detriment. May he fare well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Paul Rasdorfer has been elected as a minister of the word of God in Kempten by two delegates who supported the Lutheran side, and this by divine counsel. For the people of Kempten had written to those in Nuremberg, Augsburg, and Strasbourg to consult for the concord of their church, which opinion was truer in the matter of the sacrament. For even the ministers of the church disagreed on this matter, although the Lutherans prevailed. The people of Augsburg fully agreed with our opinion, those of Nuremberg entirely with the contrary opinion. The people of Strasbourg also firmly supported ours, yet with a friendly exhortation for the peace of the church, and their advice (neglecting the previous ones) was read to the ministers of both parties. He who is of our party embraced it with open arms, as did he of the opposing party. But after a few days, they recanted. The magistrate, therefore, moved by indignation, deprived both of their office. Knowing this, I took care that Paul was called from Ulm. May the calling be happy and auspicious. Now I am also concerned about Vito, who was in Diessenhofen. May the Lord send workers into His harvest.</p>
      <p>The pastor of Rottweil, after miserably misleading his people and making many exiles, is now in the process of returning to papal teachings. May he have no companions.</p>
      <p>We hear not a word about the emperor's affairs. However, the notary here will report something about the emperor's meeting with the pope. What he has reported to me from you may perhaps be useful in its place. I am grateful to you for your concern. But let us pray to the Lord that He does not abandon His cause. Pray for our church, and we will do the same for yours. For our affairs are so arranged that we must fight only with prayers. May Christ pray for us, that we may be saved from the worst generations. May we not be ungrateful for God's benefits, and He will not fail our needs.</p>
      <p>Give my father Pellican a thousand greetings. He will forgive that he does not receive a personal letter. You too will forgive these unlearned letters. Your kindness has conquered me, so that I anxiously desire to visit you. I also wish Leo, Theodor, Carolstadt, and all good brothers well.</p>
      <p>Luther has written a more than bitter book, claiming it is impossible for us to agree on this matter of the sacrament. He means, we must believe that we also eat it with the mouth, the physical body of Christ, etc., and writes, we go with Mum Mum Mum around, etc. But this is to you. For my small judgment, I would not want anyone to respond to him.</p>
      <p>Forgive the hasty writing and farewell in Christ, our savior.</p>
      <p>In Constance, etc., March 10, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
