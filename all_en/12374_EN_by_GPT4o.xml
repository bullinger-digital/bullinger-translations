    <p xml:id="regest1">Since [Johannes] Haller will personally report on the Augsburg matters, Frölich does not need to write everything to Bullinger. Hopefully, Haller is not offended by the impudence of a few! But he is strong. Some of the [Augsburg] church servants thought that no one from Zurich should have been called to [Augsburg]. However, they could be silenced with little effort. Haller has aligned himself exclusively with the Zurich faith in [Augsburg]. When asked by the pastors about his stance on the [Augsburg worship order], he replied that he would sign it, provided it is interpreted correctly: an answer that Frölich had previously agreed upon with Haller. With this, all the church servants were satisfied and accepted Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [Augsburg] council and Haller have agreed on a salary of 200 guilders and a fee, which Frölich set at 50 guilders. For the journey [to Zurich], Haller received 42 Rhenish guilders. When the weather becomes milder, hopefully at the beginning of March, he is to return to [Augsburg] with his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and his household. Bullinger should ensure that Haller does not delay; the entire [Augsburg] church is waiting for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should read the enclosed articles of Luther [„Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum“]. Despite their almost cyclopean construction, they are entirely insignificant.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Since Sebastian Schertlin has not yet returned, Frölich cannot provide any information regarding Hans Wilpert Zoller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- It is likely that the [Protestants] will have to take defensive action this year, as Emperor [Charles V] and Pope [Paul III] are arming, and in Italy, soldiers are being gathered, supposedly to march against the French King [Francis I] and to occupy Piedmont (recently, the Milanese Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos] attempted to take Turin by treachery); according to other rumors, these soldiers are intended for the Pope and are to be maintained until spring.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Should the war begin, not only religion but also the freedom of the Germans is at stake. And if the imperial estates are subdued, [the Emperor] will also turn against the Confederates. Therefore, one must be vigilant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The Schmalkaldic [League] will send a message to the Confederates in Zurich. However, Bullinger should not tell anyone except the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The [Protestant] estates will not only extend their league at the [Diet] in Frankfurt but also expand it, as new cities and electors want to become [members].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Charles V] suffers from gout and other ailments. Nevertheless, he rages against the Gospel. He forbids laypeople from owning and reading the Bible, whether in Latin or German, and washes his hands in the blood of the [Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Paul [III] does not want to die until he has secured the authority of the papacy; yet this too will perish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Duke Heinrich of Brunswick and his son [Charles Victor] are well guarded; however, attempts are being made to free them. [Charles V] wrote to [Philip of Hesse] regarding this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Frölich recently sent Bullinger his [„True Account of the History, What Happened to Duke Heinrich of Brunswick... this Present Year...“]; hopefully, Bullinger has received this writing. Recommendations to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to the Zurich scholars, and to Hans Wilpert Zoller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- A few days ago, Frölich was near death; perhaps Haller will tell more about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- New Year's wish.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since I have received a letter from Mr. Haller, there is no need for me to anxiously think about how to convey many things to you, my brother, esteemed above all others. Haller has seen and heard firsthand what is happening in our city. I hope he is not offended by the importunity of some, although I trust his virtues are far stronger than to be broken by the madness of a few. There was some discord among the church ministers, some of whom thought that no one from Zurich should have been called to us; but this minor issue was easily resolved. Haller preached nothing but the Zurich confession here, which he also declared he would defend and embrace before all the ministers. And when it came to the articles of concord, and what he thought of them, Haller said he would subscribe to them as long as they were accepted piously, namely according to a pious understanding; this was previously agreed upon between him and me. With this response, all the fellow ministers were satisfied, and Haller was added to their register. You will hear the rest from him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>An agreement was reached between our council and Haller: He will receive 200 guilders annually and an honorarium, which I set at 50 guilders. He has now been sent off with 42 Rhenish guilders for travel expenses, on the condition that whatever he spends beyond this until he reaches our city will be reimbursed. Haller will therefore take care of his affairs, and when the weather becomes milder, which we hope will be around the beginning of March, he will return to us with his wife and belongings. You should ensure that nothing delays him on your end, as the entire church of Christ eagerly awaits his return.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you do not wish to be moved by the foolishness and madness of a frenzied man, read these articles of Luther. Some say this Cyclops is now forging many thunderbolts and torments to disturb the truth; but they are just smoke and bubbles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I cannot yet provide you with any detailed information regarding Hans Hilpert Zoller, as Mr. Sebastian Schertlin has not yet returned home. However, I am hopeful of finding a solution to the matter, and whatever I accomplish will not be kept from you or him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As all events and matters indicate, we will likely have to use and engage in defense this year, as the Emperor and the Pope are arming and raising a lot of money. Soldiers are reportedly already marching into Italy to support the French in occupying Piedmont (as the Marquis of Milan recently attempted to take Turin by treachery); however, some say the soldiers are intended for the Pope and will be maintained until spring.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If the war begins, it will not only be about religion but also about the freedom of the Germans (in which they are unique among all peoples, while all others are under tyranny). If the imperial estates are brought into servitude (which God forbid), it will also affect the Confederates. Therefore, vigilance is necessary everywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Schmalkaldic League will send a message to the Confederates, primarily to Zurich. Keep this confidential except with your mayor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Christian estates will now not only extend their agreement in Frankfurt but also expand it with more estates (such as electors and cities that wish to join).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Emperor is very ill with gout and other ailments; nevertheless, he is so fiercely opposed to the Gospel that he has forbidden all laypeople to have or read the Bible in their homes, whether in German or Latin, under penalty of life and limb. He continues to rage against the Christians, washing his hands in their blood. I hope God will take away this scourge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Pope Paul is determined, according to his nature, not to die until he has secured his seat and pacified himself along with all future beasts. And although the Babylonian whore is enraged, she must also perish in the temporal realm; it is not unfitting for this to happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Duke Heinrich of Brunswick and his son are well guarded; however, very unusual means are being sought for his release. The Emperor is also making efforts on his behalf. He has written to the Landgrave, etc., and has sufficiently explained whether he was pleased or not with Duke Heinrich's past misfortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I recently wrote to you and sent a print of the past war. I hope you have received it. Convey my willing service to my esteemed mayors, city clerk, all your scholarly friends and brothers, and also to Johann Hilpert Zoller.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>A few days ago, I experienced an unexpected incident, so much so that the exchange of life with death was very near to me; but the Lord miraculously delivered me. Haller may perhaps explain the matter to you, as he understood these events from my account.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Farewell. January 5, 1546.</p>
      <p>May this year be so happy, fortunate, and prosperous for you that no one is equal to you in good fortune.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Georgius Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most closely united brother, etc.</p>
