      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. von Rischach gives thanks to your kindness; but since Mr. Paulus von Mülinen has not yet been present, he has decided to deliberate on his business in the meantime. Regarding the boy von Salis, I would indeed take care of him for your sake, even though he lives far from me; but his fellow countrymen, among whom he lives in such a way that he can hardly bear another advisor, are an obstacle. But I will ensure that you know about him if there is any need.</p>
      <p>As for why I wrote about the Davidic sect and what is happening here, I will write more extensively at another time; for now, it is not possible due to the promise of silence; and even if it were entirely possible, the matter is too lengthy to be described in a few words. If there is anything new, you will hear it from my son; I have nothing at present.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 20, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, his venerable lord and dearest brother.</p>
