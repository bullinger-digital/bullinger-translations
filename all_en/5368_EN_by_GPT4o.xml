      <p>S. I have read what your council writes.</p>
      <p>Our people will respond diligently.</p>
      <p>However, I am very surprised that Condé needs soldiers, yet never asked the Rhaetians; I have no doubt he would have obtained them. You see Hercules from Salis offering himself.</p>
      <p>One should request two flags from each pound. Although I cannot deny: there is some concern about an uprising in the Etschland against the Engadin; because the government in Innsbruck is acting very defiantly. Therefore, this Monday, Mr. Tscharner, Mr. Rozins, and the Landammann from Davos will travel to the Roman Emperor to complain about these grievances. I hear that the nobility in Etschland would like to start something; so they must pacify their own peasants, who are otherwise restless. If Condé were to write (if indeed he were to request soldiers), it would also be necessary to write privately to G[regor] Carli and Hercules, and then collectively to the Three Leagues. I have deliberately not written to Mr. Coignet for a long time, so as not to create any danger for him with my letters. Please, if your people decide on a delegation to France, let me know, so that I can inform Hercules from Salis about it. I recently sent letters from Mr. Augustin Maynard and hope they have been delivered to you. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your people.</p>
      <p>Chur, 19th of June, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the Church of Zurich, and his reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
