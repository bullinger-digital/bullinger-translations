    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger urges the recipient of the letter to see no innovation in the evangelical doctrine of the Lord's Supper, but rather the original view, also shared by the Church Fathers, and to renounce the teachings and terminology of Scholasticism. He applies the threats from Revelation 14:9 ff to the Roman Church, points to the spiritual struggles before his own conversion, and wishes the addressee the recognition of the true worship of God.</p>

      <p>- - - writings. Behold the abundance of the horn. If you distrust the interpretation, see how we have illuminated the place with another place. Let the anointing judge rather than the polluted darkness of the flesh. Do you wish to hear the fathers? Who is more ancient than Tertullian? Who is more diligent than Lactantius? Who, finally, is more pious and learned than Cyprian? Perhaps you claim something new or unheard of; but what indeed is unheard of? Who among the apostles ever treated this bread in such a way? Who in the early church ever regarded it as God? From where, I ask, do you say these words have been derived: transubstantiation, accident, substance, form? Do you not smell the impostor philosophy that has submerged Thomas or Scotus under the guise of Christianity? Are you so deprived of the organ of smell that you no longer know how to distinguish the pious from the impious, the foreign from the domestic, or finally, water from wine? As for persecution for the sake of truth, I believe you are so far from fearing it that I see you in spirit already rejoicing and exulting for the sake of it, following the example of the apostles. It remains, therefore, that having denied the impiety of adoration, you amend your life according to the prescription of the scriptures. And what is more impious than idolatry? Who does not recognize that the adoration of bread is a most shameless idolatry that insults God?</p>
      <p>Listen to what the Spirit of God promises to idolaters: "And the third angel" etc. [Rev 14:9ff]. I (to warn you of this first) do not in any way agree with those who completely reject this book; for I find such great mysteries and such diligent citation of scriptures, such consolation in the cross, and such diligence in explaining the resurrection, that I cannot wonder why other keen-eyed Argus did not see it. But these things, as extraordinary as they are, must again be brought into the circle. The apostle teaches that there will be an image of a beast, that is, the pope, which whoever worships, taking the mark in hand so that he may serve the image [Rev 14:9], that is, with episcopal anointing, will suffer those horrendous torments which the apostle recounts. Namely: "He will drink of the wine of wrath" [Rev 14:10], that is, the wrath of God will fall upon him, so that in blindness he will go from sin to crime and from crime to wickedness: Rom. 1 [18ff]. Led into it by the false doctrine of the pope, which meanwhile has the appearance of piety; which John calls "mixed with pure wine" [Rev 14:10], similar to Isaiah: "Your wine is mixed with water" etc. [Isa 1:22]. Although I am not unaware of how reluctantly this opinion about the sacrament is persuaded to the flesh, nor is it surprising, since so many deserted Christ himself, who had both grace and authority in speaking and teaching, at the very time when he moved the same matter, as we read in John 6 [66].</p>
      <p>The fourth year is now underway, as you know, since I began to hold this opinion, and certainly I have struggled so much in this cause that, like a little fish thrown out of this sea of little integrity, I have often despaired of life. But thanks be to God, who has so calmed my conscience that now not even a little, even when the whole sea rages with the most violent storms, does it move my mind from the sacred anchor. And I pray to God that he may so open this opinion to you, if it is indeed true, about which I have no doubt, and to the other brothers, that you may truly begin to worship the true, only, and omnipotent God in spirit [John 4:24]. To whom be glory and dominion forever [Matt 6:13].</p>
      <p>Consult this forest, that is, the rough and unpolished heap of arguments or material of good, I ask; for more polished or even more abundant occupations did not allow. Pray for me and for the church of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may increase it daily more, so that it may have due honor and glory.</p>
      <p>Grace be with you.</p>
      <p>From my hermitage, April 17, 1525.</p>
      <p>Greet Wernher Steiner and other brothers in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the learned and truly pious man Leo Jud, beloved brother in Christ.</p>
