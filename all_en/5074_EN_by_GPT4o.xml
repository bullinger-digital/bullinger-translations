      <p>Greetings and blessings. First of all, we pray to the Lord that He may restore you to us in good health and preserve you for a long time; for we have heard with great sorrow that you are having difficulty walking and that your studies are so greatly hindered. But the Lord will support you.</p>
      <p>I am brief in writing because I did not want to add trouble to you, who are already very busy, and because these two captains or leaders of the most illustrious princes, Cond√© and the Admiral, will be able to inform you about everything I could have written. They have brought our dear Martyr here.</p>
      <p>He is cheerful and healthy, thanks to God; I believe he himself will write to you.</p>
      <p>It is especially remarkable that in the midst of such rage and power of the adversaries, the weak instruments of God have been able to accomplish so much in a kingdom so flourishing and strong. But in this way, our God shows how true He is in His promises and how great His goodness and power are. We also rejoice greatly, as is fitting, in the most beautiful agreement of our people.</p>
      <p>The theologians of Geranium who set out for France have traveled a long journey; for so our Martyr reported, who heard from any of them. When Mr. Peter left, they had not yet arrived at the court nor had they been heard. We are very curious about what they have accomplished.</p>
      <p>If you have certainly received anything from our Beza, I ask you to share it with us; likewise, if anything else certain has been written to you about the assemblies of the Guise and the Spaniards (about which they report amazing things here), I ask you to make us participants, etc. I think we must persevere in perpetual prayers to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending back to you the letter written to Count Erbach; I am very pleased with it and I thank you very much for it. If there is anything in which I can reciprocate your kindness, I will be most willing.</p>
      <p>The envoys of the Prince of Savoy have requested from the envoys of the Swiss, gathered in Herem, that, since they have once begun to intervene as horsemen between their prince and the Bernese, they should not cease but continue. This, however, was reported in the recess, as they call it.</p>
      <p>Vergerius was at the recent assembly of the Rhaetians and left without much favor; he is a strange busybody.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. All my fellow ministers send their greetings to you and all your colleagues.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 24, 1561.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
