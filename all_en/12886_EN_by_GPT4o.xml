    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Augsburg council has readily permitted the return of the two colleagues Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder to Zurich, especially since they were of little use to the Augsburg church and fleeing pastors arrive in Augsburg daily anyway. Haller tried in vain to persuade the two to stay. Neither they nor the Augsburg council were willing to do so. However, the council held back Thoman Ruman, who was accompanied by his wife [...], so that Haller would not be left alone. Meyer and Schwyzer will report on the situation and will likely exaggerate it to justify their return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The learned Meyer, whom Haller likes, is recommended to Bullinger. However, no disadvantages should arise for Schwyzer in Zurich, despite his impossible behavior towards Haller. But if he speaks ill of Haller, Bullinger should inform him. Haller cannot feel the apostolic spirit in him, which seeks the salvation and peace in the church and can even adapt to those of different opinions. Therefore, Schwyzer should rather stay with his peasants, who appreciate such preachers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hopefully, the imperial occupation troops will soon withdraw. Emperor Charles V is said to have departed from Ulm. Recently, the captain [Bernhard von Schaumburg] had a private mass held in the chapter room of the St. Ulrich monastery by a priest [...], who also serves as a soldier. The pastors reported this to the council, and subsequently, the mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser] spoke with the captain. The outcome is unknown. Haller fears that the devil is thus sneaking back into the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, the Augsburg Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, and King Ferdinand are negotiating their financial demands with the Augsburgers. It is tolerable that the coffers are emptied, as long as religion remains untouched!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] On February 27, Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg took the oath from the council in the name of the Emperor. However, the citizens, who were being led by the nose, refused to take the oath. The pastors suspect that they are only being granted religious freedom so that the priests and monks are also allowed to return to the city and practice their religion. Bullinger should advise Haller paternally in this regard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, to the other colleagues, and to Bullinger's family. Next week, Haller may report more extensively with an Augsburg resident traveling to Zurich [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Greetings to the father-in-law Ulrich Kambli, to whom Haller cannot write. Bullinger should deliver the enclosed letter to the stepfather [...].</p>

      <p>S. P. D. The two brothers, Laurentius (Lorenz Meyer) and Svitzerus (Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder), are returning to you, with the council easily granting them this permission, since they were of little or no use in our church, as many exiled ministers arrive daily. I labored much to retain them, if by any means this one church could be preserved; but I could not achieve this with them, nor could I compel the council to detain them against their will. They retained Romanus (Thoman Ruman), because he has his wife with him, so that I would not be left alone. They themselves will tell you how things stand now, although I do not doubt they will greatly exaggerate, so that their return may seem to have a more just cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I greatly love Laurentius (Lorenz Meyer) for his learning. I commend him to you again, as I have done before. The other (Rudolf Schwyzer) has acted unworthily with me. May the Lord forgive him, for I have long since forgiven. I do not wish that he should be less promoted by you on my account. I only ask this one thing, that if he is going to speak ill of me, you would let me know in time. I do not see in him the apostolic spirit, which seeks the peace and salvation of the church, which can adapt even to the minds of strangers. Therefore, it is better that he be retained among his own peasants, who greatly esteem such preachers.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We hope the soldiers will soon depart from the city. It is rumored that the Emperor (Charles V) has left Ulm. That supreme captain (Bernhard von Schaumburg) recently had a private mass celebrated by a priest (who is also a soldier) in the chapter room of St. Ulrich's monastery. We informed the council. The mayors (Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser) spoke with him. What they achieved, I do not know. I fear that in this way, Satan is gradually creeping back.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Duke of Bavaria (Wilhelm), the Bishop of Augsburg (Otto Truchsess von Waldburg), and Ferdinand are now also negotiating with our people about money. I think the coffers will eventually be emptied. But all things can be endured, provided religion remains safe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>On February 27, the council swore an oath to Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg in the name of the Emperor. The citizens (Bürgergemeinde) did not want to swear, but they are being led by the nose, so that none of us knows where we stand. We fear that we are only being left with free doctrine so that in the meantime, priests and monks may also be restored and allowed their religion in the city. I do not see what other end this business will have. Therefore, venerable father, advise me, as a son, on what I should do in these circumstances, and keep me commended to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I wish health to the venerable fathers and lords Pellicanus (Konrad Pellikan), Bibliander (Theodor Bibliander), Gwalther (Rudolf Gwalther), and the rest, together with your family. Next week, a certain citizen of Augsburg will travel to you, through whom, if I have anything, I will write more. March 5, 1547. Ioan. Hallerus, perpetually yours.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Greet my father-in-law (Ulrich Kambli) and tell him that all is well. I do not have time to write to him. Deliver the letters to the stepfather (vitricus) to be sent to him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. In Zurich.</p>
