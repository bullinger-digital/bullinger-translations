      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Christ, with the offering of our friendly greetings, all honor, friendship, and services, which we are capable of, first of all.</p>
      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, gracious, dear sirs, we have received and read your excellent letter of thanks sent to us, and we have never valued our service and work as highly as you have accounted it, yet we are moved by your manifold gratitude to desire ever more to serve you, although we have willingly and gladly served you thus far. We also pray to God that He may grant you steadfastness in all good things at all times. Whatever we can do to help you in all steadfastness and sincere truth, we will always be completely willing to do.</p>
      <p>Now coming to you are Mr. Michael Schlatter, your preacher, and Johann Leopold Frey, your schoolmaster, our dear brothers, whom we commend to your loyalty and love most faithfully. They have conducted themselves among and with us very honorably, blamelessly, peacefully, diligently, and faithfully, so we do not doubt that they will also conduct themselves among you in a Christian and faithful manner, according to your and all decency. May God of all honor, loyalty, and love uphold your church, you, and your servants in His divine grace powerfully and fatherly. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 3rd day of April in the year 1542. Your completely willing servants in the word of God of the church</p>
