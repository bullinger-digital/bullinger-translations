      <p>Coelius S. Curio through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I do not willingly interrupt your distinguished studies and your beneficial thoughts for the Christian republic with my letters, such necessity now presses that it seems in no way possible to either omit or delay what I am doing. Therefore, forgive me, dearest brother and most esteemed patron, if I now perhaps approach you with my letters at an inopportune time: and if you feel any annoyance from this discourse, you will blame not me, who, as far as I know, have never offended anyone even with a word, but rather those who have compelled me to write these things. How freely and sincerely, even boldly, I have always felt and proclaimed not only about true religion but also about the ministers and bishops of religion, Italy, our homeland, is a witness, France is a witness, Germany and other more distant nations are witnesses, so that I do not produce a single witness in a clear matter: although you are my best witness. Nor do I now feel or act otherwise than I always have. To what end are these words, you will say? To what end? So that you understand, which I do not doubt you do, that those who think or speak otherwise about me are either mistaken or doing so out of some fault of the mind.</p>
      <p>However, I would not at all be surprised if those who are adversaries of our opinion on religion did this, whom I admit have sometimes been criticized by me both in words and writings: but when I hear that I am criticized in my absence by those who ought rather to have defended me, I will say, dearest brother, and I will not keep you in suspense any longer. A conversation arose there among some about certain verses brought from Italy by the bookseller Perna, as I hear, which contained something about the case of Servetus, and when the man of learning and piety, Rodulphus Gwalther, my very dear friend, was also present, he immediately without preamble said: I know, he said, who spreads such verses, undoubtedly your Coelius.</p>
      <p>Since some of my friends thought this pertained to my reputation, they therefore judged that I should write about it.</p>
      <p>When I received this, I could not indeed wonder enough what moved the man to pronounce so rashly about me. Nor perhaps did he do this once, but repeatedly, indeed wherever the conversation on this matter arose. Thus I, unaware and undeserving, am slandered everywhere, and that by friends, indeed brothers.</p>
      <p>Who persuaded him of this? Certainly not sober and sensible men, but either my rivals and envious ones, or some vain and deceptive thought. But I, on the contrary, solemnly affirm, and call God as my witness, that I have not written, devised, spread, or been the author of even a single syllable of those verses, nor have I been the author that they should be made or spread. If Gwalther ever proves, demonstrates, or shows that I am the author of them, I refuse no kind of punishment. Ask you, my brother, Doctor Massarius who is with you, and you will find that they were brought from Italy: but I have never known or thought anything of these. I do not concern myself with what is done publicly by the highest, or privately by others, always intent on my own goal. Christ alone, the true and eternal Son of God, is my sole care, my solid and perfect wisdom, way, truth, life, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I attend to my little letters: I enjoy my leisure, as much as the public affairs of our academy allow: I provoke no one either by deed or word, I strive to benefit all, to harm no one: rather, when provoked, I am silent, when harmed, I endure, I overlook, lest this peace and holy tranquility be interrupted by any movement of the mind. Therefore, I beg and beseech you by our old friendship, by the love of Christ, to take up my cause in my absence, to vindicate and assert me from any slander, if there is any: and also to tell Mr. Gwalther that he should not have uttered that word about me and against me. For he knows that love is not rash, does not presume evil, does nothing through the impotence of the mind. Let him therefore see what he has done. I will indeed bear it, as I can. I will pray to God, that He, the parent of truth, will take up the defense for me. But I wanted to write to you rather than to him about this matter, both so that, since I have never written to him, I would not begin writing with a complaint, which would be an omen not quite happy, and also so that I might call upon you there as my patron in this cause, whom I have always known as a patron by duty, a parent by kindness, a brother by love. There is also your authority, by which you can not only refute but also restrain those who detract from me: which I have done before for you and your church, and will continue to do. Farewell. Basel 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
