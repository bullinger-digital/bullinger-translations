      <p>S. I have received all your letters that you sent. I also immediately arranged for those that were relevant to be delivered to Geneva. However, I wrote to you the day before yesterday and retracted what I had written in previous letters about the arrival of the deacons from Geneva and Lyon to you. They had indeed planned to travel there, but they changed their minds here. I wrote more extensively about this recently; however, since I do not know when you will receive those letters, I wanted to repeat it here.</p>
      <p>At the moment, I have nothing else, except that the rumor about the conflict in France is confirmed. This seems plausible; for it is known that the papists followed closely on the heels of our people, and perhaps they wanted to decide the outcome of the matter before the German cavalry could join our forces. But we cannot yet affirm anything for certain; the people of Fribourg and Solothurn are remarkably silent, and this seems to be a good sign for us; for if they had won, it would already be proclaimed on everyone's rooftops. Some think this rumor originated because only three enemy troops were defeated by our forces in Champagne; but I affirm nothing certain here. They made the skirmish at Saint-Denis seem so great, even though it did not go half as badly afterward. Therefore, I will leave it until more certain news comes. Steiger, Gravenried, Manuel, and finally all friends and brothers greet you and wish you a most fortunate and happy year.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 27, at the end of the year 67.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
