      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Vogler, my godfather, who was with you for half a year, has abundantly indicated the critical situation of our affairs. Various rumors are heard, the outcome of which we wish to see happily concluded at last. It is time to pray in spirit and truth, lest our faith fail.</p>
      <p>The Antichrist rages; the high priests have conspired with the princes of darkness against the Lord and His Christ.</p>
      <p>What was done in Augsburg with the ministers of God, you have understood from our prince; for he has given to you what he received from Duke Christoph, while I was in Basel last week.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg are trembling, fearing that they may be forced to flee in winter due to the inconsistency of the magistrate. The Bishop of Strasbourg, once a public defender of the truth and a singular patron of the ministers of Christ, has now become a complete deserter, a public traitor. With eight horsemen, he has gone to Trent to the council of the impious, intending to betray our homeland with his bloody schemes. They think he will return shortly, but with the title of legate, to execute what those conscript fathers have decreed. They do not wish to delay the bloodbath any longer, lest anything come between the cup and the lip, and lest the living corpse of the Emperor, which they use as a specter to terrify the pious, be intercepted by death. But God, unexpectedly, etc., who must be earnestly prayed to, lest the adversaries triumphantly slander the holy name of God forever. Would that, before I lay down this earthly dwelling, I might see the vengeance of God; with a more cheerful spirit, I would sing the swan song: "Now you dismiss your servant, Lord," etc. All the brothers greet you, who were at the wedding of our scribe today, especially Nikolaus König. Pray for us, that we may bear the cross of Christ with patience to the end. Amen. Riquewihr, September 15, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, the overseer of piety and true religion, Heinrich Bullinger of Zürich, his ever-observant brother.</p>
