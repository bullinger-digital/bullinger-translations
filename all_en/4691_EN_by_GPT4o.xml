      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, honorable compater (godfather), and since I assume you have also received mine in the meantime, there is no need for me to add more to them now, nor can I due to various occupations and the imminent departure of the messenger. Kiener writes to Zwingli, your son-in-law, about Tremp's affairs.</p>
      <p>He died intestate (without a will), as I hear, and before him, his wife also died similarly; he himself prevented his wife from making a will, and later he was prevented by the heirs, who like harpies (as I remember having written to you several times before) or vultures sat around the half-dead corpse, impatiently waiting for his last breath. They behaved in such a way that I noticed my presence was suspicious to them, and therefore I visited him less frequently in the end. Some friends from the Thurtal have been sent here; three of them are here.</p>
      <p>But I do not know what will happen to them. I hear that no one will get anything except the daughter of Batscheler, whom he raised, 100 pounds. There is otherwise much wealth. He had too many dealings; thus, his wealth goes where he will not be much thanked.</p>
      <p>They have driven out the old maid so that they can better guard it, even against his own will. What news I have, I have written to my brother; he will share it with you.</p>
      <p>I will soon return that Savoyard treaty. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household and Mr. Gwalther, to whom I cannot reply now.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 4, 1561. Your Haller. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable lord and dearest compater. Zurich.</p>
