    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Medmann received Bullinger's letter from April 9 [not received] from the hands of the Cologne printer Johann Birckmann and thanks for Bullinger's kindness. Although he is currently very busy, he wants to take the opportunity to send a letter with this reliable messenger, who is traveling to Frankfurt. It may be that Medmann returns to Strasbourg. Then he would (God willing) immediately visit Bullinger to discuss various matters with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He would have enclosed the announced writing [about purgatory] by Johannes Campanus with the present letter, had he now been with the steadfast "Nestor" [Hermann von Wied]. Bullinger should know that the latter, solely because of his [Cologne] reformation attempt, can hardly find a [refuge] place in this vast [archiepiscopal] territory! His persecutors do not leave him alone, but claim in their writings, speeches, and embassies not to want to fight the Reformation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A few days ago, a new decree of the Roman Antichrist reached [Cologne], which Medmann and some others learned about indirectly. They are threatened with expulsion from the country if they do not return to the Roman whore. In addition, Medmann loses his canonry. The reason for this is his religious views, his loyalty to the archbishop, and a letter he wrote, intercepted, and sent to Rome. Its content is said to be devilish and inappropriate for someone in his position. The letter is even said to have been read in a conclave before the Pope and the cardinals! If Medmann had known that, he would of course have formulated the letter more elegantly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Medmann read Rudolf Gwalther's "Endtchrist" with approval. The book should also be read to the Roman "Aposcopus" so that he learns that the godly know exactly that he is the Antichrist announced by the prophets, by Christ, and the apostles!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Now to Bullinger's letter. Medmann is pleased that Bullinger received his letter written from the princes' camp [near Giengen] [HBBW XVIII, No. 2665, from November 8, 1546]. He completely agrees with Bullinger's opinion about the [imperial] cities. They should have thought more about their freedoms, but like the Phrygians, their insight comes too late! Due to the strong urging of the Louvain "sophists," the Spanish Inquisition was introduced in Arnhem. The inhabitants of Bremen remain steadfast. There, Albert Hardenberg teaches, to whom Medmann conveyed Bullinger's greetings in his last letter. Medmann received only four letters from Bullinger, all of which he answered. He will soon send the decree against Hermann von Wied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He will gladly forward any shipments to Hardenberg. Bullinger should write again. Medmann will reply as soon as he can. Greetings to Gwalther. Bullinger should excuse the fleeting little letter!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, which you sent to me on April 9 through Johann Birckmann, a citizen and printer of Cologne, most learned man, in which I easily perceived your singular benevolence towards me. Although I am currently very busy, I wanted to take the opportunity to send you some letters with a reliable messenger who is going to Frankfurt. If I return to Strasbourg, as it may happen, I will immediately visit you, if the Almighty Lord graciously permits, so that we can discuss various matters in person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I would have sent the promised writing by Johannes Campanus now, if I had been with our most steadfast Nestor (Hermann von Wied), who can hardly find a place left in this vast dominion solely because of the begun reformation of the churches; and still, those who try to instill in writings, embassies, and speeches that they do not seek religion, do not cease to persecute him!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>A few days ago, a certain new mandate from the Roman Antichrist was sent here (which was insinuated to me and some others, as they say), by which we are forbidden water and fire if we have not consorted with the Roman whore. The canonry is taken away because of the profession of doctrine and because I steadfastly adhere to the best Nestor and because of a certain letter of mine, which was intercepted by some unknown persons and carried all the way to Rome, in which I did not describe the most satanic, as they interpret it, with due dignity. They affirm it was recited in the very consistory before the Pope and cardinals! If it is true, I wish that letter had been written by me with the utmost diligence, which I never usually do in letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I read your Gwalther's "Antichrist," which pleases me greatly; I would also like it to be recited before the Roman "Aposcopus," so that he might understand more clearly that the pious know well that he is that great Antichrist, of whom the prophets, Christ, and the apostles foretold!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But to yours: I am glad that you received mine, which I wrote in the princes' camp, about the cities it is entirely as you write, which I wish they had thought more about their freedom! But the Phrygians are wise too late! In Geldern near Arnhem, they have begun that Spanish Inquisition, which the Louvain sophists strongly urge. The people of Bremen still remain constant, among whom our Dr. Albert teaches, to whom I included greetings from you in my last letter. I have received only four letters from you, to which I have also replied. I will soon send you the mandate against our Nestor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now farewell well and happily, most illustrious man, and know that I am entirely yours. September 10 from my study, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Whatever you send to Dr. Albert, I will ensure it is delivered. I pray that you write sometime. I will always reply when I can. Greet Gwalther from me. Excuse the brief notes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere teacher of the gospel among the Zurichers, etc., to be respected. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
