      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I send to your kindness, most illustrious Bullinger, through your messenger, who delivered your letters to me, the oration of Cydonius on despising death, which you desired in your recent letters. I would have also sent the canons of all councils extracted from the three volumes of all councils, if I had dared to burden the messenger with this rather heavy load. However, they are being sold to booksellers and friends for nine Constance coins by our Oporinus, who did not wish for me to count anything in your name for Cydonius's oration. I do not have the time to write more now, as the messenger demands the end of the letters. Farewell most happily with your family and all the brothers, whom you will greet in my name. Given in Basel on the 29th of October in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zürich, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
