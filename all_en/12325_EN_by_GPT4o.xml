    <p xml:id="regest1">Naturally, Myconius had considered [Bullinger's] words and drawn conclusions about [Bullinger's] disposition from them! No one except Jakob Held [von Tiefenau] advocated for Schwenckfeld with Myconius. If Bullinger had expressed his opinion on a separate sheet (as he does now in [Nr. 2271]), Myconius would have understood him correctly. In summary: [Myconius and Bullinger] agree not to contaminate the [Confederation] with Schwenckfeld's acceptance and dogma. Myconius forgives Bullinger's excessive contentiousness due to their friendship. - The enclosure [not received] from [Johannes] Gast provides information about the victory of [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse as well as the capture of [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick and his son [Karl Victor]. However, the following is not mentioned there: The bishops of Trier [Johannes IV. Ludwig von Hagen] and Würzburg [Melchior Zobel] as well as the Mainz canons, whose bishop [Albrecht V. von Brandenburg] died a few days ago, sent auxiliary troops to [Philipp of Hesse]; but not the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], who was probably busy enough at home. Emperor [Charles V] wanted to impose a son of [King] Ferdinand [I] on the Mainz bishopric, but the canons preempted this by electing the cunning hypocrite [Sebastian von Heusenstamm]. The Trierer [von Hagen] is said to be mortally ill. It is confirmed that [King] Ferdinand [I] is tributary to the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] in order to destroy the [Protestants]. - Those from Kempten are holding back up to 20,000 arquebuses from Italy, which were claimed to be intended for Ferdinand; in reality, they were for [Heinrich of] Brunswick. - [King Henry VIII of] England and to a lesser extent [King Francis I of] France have asked the Protestants to mediate the [Anglo-French] war; they have appointed envoys for this, who were well received, especially by France. [Charles V] managed, however, to act as a mediator for the deceived [Henry VIII] before the Protestants. - Myconius is satisfied with the outcome of the Diet at Baden. The [Confederate] envoys to Milan will see if [the news about troop movements in Italy] is true, as 10,000 imperial Spaniards are expected in Milan. This news would confirm Bullinger's earlier communications about the Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos]. - Greetings, also to Theodor [Bibliander]. - [P.S.:] The messenger [...] practically snatches the letter from Myconius's hands.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Naturally, I have considered the words and drawn conclusions about the disposition from them! Indeed, it was not possible otherwise. No one except Jakob Held (von Tiefenau) advocated for Schwenckfeld with me.</p>
      <p>Many speak against him. If, therefore, your disposition was as you now indicate, you should have signified it with an attached note, and I would have interpreted everything as I do now, most skillfully. In summary: We agree not to contaminate Switzerland with the presence of Schwenckfeld, even less with his dogma. The rest, in which you seem a bit more contentious, I forgive due to our friendship.</p>
      <p>About Hesse and his victory, about the captured Duke of Brunswick and his son, if you do not know, read what is enclosed here; it is a note from Gast. However, the following is not contained there, and indeed they are admirable: The bishops of Trier (Johannes IV. Ludwig von Hagen) and Würzburg (Melchior Zobel), furthermore the canons of Mainz, whose bishop (Albrecht V. von Brandenburg) passed away a few days ago, sent aid to Hesse. Cologne sent none! Perhaps because he has enough to do at home.</p>
      <p>The Emperor (Charles V) tried by force to impose Ferdinand's son into the Mainz bishopric, but the canons preempted him. They elected a certain nobleman of lesser note, and the same a cunning and marvelously hypocritical doctor, as they say, and thus the Emperor must desist. They say the Trierer (von Hagen) is mortally ill, and it is certainly reported that Ferdinand has made himself a tributary to the Turk (Sultan Suleiman I), for no other reason than to destroy us.</p>
      <p>From Kempten, arquebuses, which they call haggen (Hakenbüchsen), are said to be detained to the number of 20,000. They were attributed to Ferdinand. But upon discovery, they were being led to Brunswick from Italy.</p>
      <p>The Protestants, more solicited by the English than the French, to attempt to mediate the war among themselves, sent envoys. They were admitted quite comfortably, and the French seemed not to abhor equitable conditions. However, the Emperor found ways for the English, already shamefully deceived by him, to admit him to action before the Protestants. We await what will happen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Diet of the Swiss which you write about, I am quite pleased. The envoys, after they arrive in Milan, will find out whether it is true or not. For there is a rumor that 10,000 Spaniards are expected there, which pertain to the Emperor. The rumor confirms, as much as in itself, what you previously wrote to me about that marquis. Farewell together with yours and Theodor (Bibliander). Indeed, I could not write more, for this is soon after lunch.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 2, 1545.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>The messenger practically snatched this from the hands of the writer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
