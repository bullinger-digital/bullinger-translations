    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Cochläus’ letter and writings [„Replica brevis“ and „De sanctorum invocatione“]. - Cochläus can see Bullinger's opinion from the enclosed response [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“], which he sent last month through friends [Wolfgang Musculus and Adam Bartholomäus] and is hereby sending again personally for security. Cochläus may judge Bullinger as he wishes; Bullinger submits himself to God as the supreme judge and defends the apostolic faith in all his actions and deeds. Cochläus, on the other hand, should remember that he must soon give an account before God. - Regarding the council question, Cochläus should consider that one must submit solely to the judgment of God; for even if Bullinger does not set a specific time like Osiander in his [„Coniecturae“], he expects the final judgment soon in view of the already fulfilled signs. Cochläus is not unaware of his opinion about a council: The authority of Christ and his prophets and apostles requires no council. Bullinger maintains peace with the peaceful and fights only in defense of the true religion. - Cochläus calls Luther a renegade monk and wonders who Bullinger is: He is a sinner who places his hope in Christ; he was elected pastor of the Zurich church; previously he taught; from childhood, he believed in Christ and studied the Holy Scriptures and the Church Fathers; he was neither ordained as a priest nor as a monk; he was a studying layman. Cochläus will therefore find nothing of which the sinner Bullinger should be ashamed. - May God grant Cochläus the gift of righteous judgment!</p>

      <p>G[race] and p[eace]. I received your letters, Cochläus, along with the booklets you sent me through the public courier. What I think of your reply, you will understand from this my response, which - although I sent it a month ago to friends whom I had asked to ensure it was delivered to you promptly - I do not doubt you have now received. Nevertheless, I wanted to add this copy as well, so I could be more certain that you have received mine. Judge my writings as you will, Cochläus! I cannot and should not speak otherwise than I feel in my heart and mind. And the Lord, the most just judge of all, knows and sees what each one aims for and seeks. To Him, I entrust my cause for judgment, indeed I humbly offer it. I will defend the apostolic faith, which I hold deeply rooted in my heart from the Spirit of God and the Holy Scriptures, both privately and publicly, in writings and speeches, as long as the spirit governs these limbs. For I know whom I have believed. I know on whose testimonies I rely, and no adversaries will terrify me here with any insults, writings, or tricks. Nor will I spare any labors.</p>
      <p>And I am well aware that the Lord Himself will never fail me, in whose hand my fate lies. Meanwhile, see to it, Cochläus, what you do! Soon you will render an account to the Lord for all that you have done.</p>
      <p>You tell me I know not what about a general council: Would that you would consider what the Lord has left us to ponder about His universal judgment! Which, although I do not affix to a certain time like Osiander's calculation, I nevertheless think is not far off, since almost all things that are said to precede the judgment have been fulfilled. You are not unaware of what we think about the council that the Pope has instituted with his followers. We have the angel of great counsel; we have the sacred council and assembly of the prophets and apostles in heaven, whose definitions and decrees are read in the Bible. By God's favor, we will die with these. The prophet declares: "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of pestilence, but his delight is in the law of the Lord," etc. [Ps 1, 1]. I will gladly think of those things which are of peace, and I will have peace with those who do not oppose the word of peace, namely the preaching of the gospel. I prefer to contend with those who attack than to collude.</p>
      <p>If we deny Him, He will also deny us. Therefore, as long as others continue to attack the religion and doctrine handed down by the Scriptures, I will not cease to defend and uphold it to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>You call Luther an apostate monk. You add: "Who you are, or what you once were, I have not yet been able to understand nor do I inquire curiously." You suspect something, then. Go ahead! Inquire curiously, even if you may. However, I am not allowed to boast in anything. I am a sinner, but one who has meanwhile fixed all hope in Christ. Now I am a minister of the Zurich church, lawfully called to this office by the church. Before I was called, I openly taught good and pious letters. From childhood, I believed in Christ the Lord. From childhood, I exercised myself in the sacred letters and the reading of the holy fathers. I never swore to the prescriptions of any bishop, abbot, or prior. They never anointed or shaved me. I never had any dealings with them. I lived as a layman, indeed a student of good and pious letters for myself and the muses. Inquire, then, if you may!</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, you will find nothing in my life of which I should be ashamed, except that I am a sinner before the Lord; nor would I be ashamed of the fact, Cochläus, if I had once imprudently given a name to men, but now having learned better and repenting, I would have consecrated myself to Christ the Lord alone, having deserted men.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep me in His holy will and grant Cochläus the ability to judge rightly about sincere piety! For the Lord will come to judgment soon.</p>
      <p>Blessed are those who have truly put on Christ. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 1, in the year of our Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours sincerely, if you are in the apostolic church of Christ.</p>
      <p>To Lord Johannes Cochläus residing in Eichstätt.</p>
