      <p>You are right indeed, my Heinrich, but you advise too late and to someone to whom this opinion is not very pleasing. What can I say? If I judge, I am not very dutiful and expose myself to danger; if I praise, I will be an accomplice to guilt; if I ignore, I am judged as not very candid and skillful; if I write that I was not present at the judgment when the sentence was passed, who will not mark me with arrogance? Therefore, nothing remains but to knock on God's door with anxious prayers, so that He may grant us all not to be carried away by passions, which if done here, may He spare us. However, there is also some fault in the one you commend to me, who, as I hear, conducted his sermon sluggishly, coldly refuted the arguments of the opposing party, and neglected what he ought to have spoken most. You know what spurs and stings a speech has to arouse the minds of judges. But I grieve here for what Pliny the Younger writes in his "Letters": "There is," he says, "less force in good people than in bad, and just as ignorance brings boldness, reason brings hesitation. Thus, modesty weakens upright minds, while audacity strengthens perverse ones." I indeed advised the man to speak vigorously and strenuously before the senate and to make up for his previous cowardice. But if the senate confirms the previous sentence, however they may have sinned, I have no doubt that by divine providence he is freed from the worst prostitute and has nothing to grieve or complain about.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my best brother.</p>
      <p>From ZÃ¼rich, July 11, 1530.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
