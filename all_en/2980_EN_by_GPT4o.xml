      <p>Because I mentioned the sermons of Brenz and earnestly desire their refutation, here you have them. It is an admirable transformation and confusion of words, which, however, is not only valued by some inept people but even worshiped.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon sent me a booklet about the judgment of the church, etc., where both sacred and secular politics are discussed, but how successfully, I do not know. Farewell, my most prudent brother, tomorrow or the day after, our prince will arrive, from whom I might learn what we can hope for regarding Christian piety in this territory.</p>
