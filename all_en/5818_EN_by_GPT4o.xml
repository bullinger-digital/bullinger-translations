      <p>S. D. I am very delighted by your lengthy letters, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I, however, always write briefly.</p>
      <p>But please be understanding, especially now, as I have been bedridden for over 14 days and still am with completely exhausted strength.</p>
      <p>I received your letter written on July 1st and shared it with the brothers.</p>
      <p>We are always eager to hear good news about the affairs of the French churches.</p>
      <p>You did not write unfortunate news; we expect happier news, indeed we pray to the Lord, that He may be with us and thwart the bloody plans of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>I would indeed be pleased if you would compile commonplaces from the books of Mr. Peter Martyr, and indeed briefly and composed in a didactic order; if anyone else can accomplish this, you can especially.</p>
      <p>I do not think our printers can justly complain, as this seems to be a new work.</p>
      <p>Mr. Martyr wrote very elegant commentaries on the books of Kings, which Mr. Froschauer will soon publish; these will be useful especially for your purpose.</p>
      <p>But first, I think the commentaries on 3 Kings should be published, then what remains on the 4th book; finally, the commentaries on the books of Samuel will be added; now the commentaries on Aristotle's Ethics are being printed.</p>
      <p>I am eagerly awaiting what you will write about the French affairs and that English war, whether it is pacified or continues.</p>
      <p>I see amazing things being woven by the Roman pontiff and his advisors; I would therefore wish those English, Danish, and Swedish wars to be pacified.</p>
      <p>We will pray to the Lord, that He may be with His church and scatter the bloody plans of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>I commend to you these Polish students; one is Wenceslaus Ostrorog, son of a very great and pious man in Poland.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Crispin, Mr. Badius, and other good men; all of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 26, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Théodore de Bèze, most faithful minister of the Geneva church, esteemed lord and my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
