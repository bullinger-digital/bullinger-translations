      <p>Most illustrious man, I return the horses and release you from the pledge. I have given money to the servant, who will pay everything. I hear that Cardinals de Tournon and de Ferrara have left Rome, which means that open war is imminent. This is confirmed to me by Morelletus, from whom that Florianus swindled forty crowns; I forgot to mention this when I left you, having been overwhelmed with so many other matters. Again, I would think it necessary for you to write to England on my behalf, indeed I ask you to do this. Farewell and pray to God for us with those brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Having already written the letters, I dined with the royal envoy, who gave me to read a copy of the papal brief, where these words are found: "Send each of your most chosen prelates," etc.</p>
      <p>I have seen nothing about the sessions. I will have a copy with me; but I still long for those writings of yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
