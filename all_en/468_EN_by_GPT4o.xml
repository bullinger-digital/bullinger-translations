      <p>Greetings. I was not able to respond to all your matters. I have received your letters and I thank you.</p>
      <p>The messenger hurried here. I am saddened that the church in Strasbourg is scattered; may the Lord gather it again. I rejoice about LÃ¼beck; may the Lord strengthen it. You will give copies to Richer and to others whom you see listed; I could not add even a word.</p>
      <p>You will tell Gast that I have received his letters and thank him. You also have the sheet that was incorrectly printed. Greet Richer for me. I strongly suspect that the princes do not disagree on everything. My lords have recognized each other on Saturday, not to bind themselves, but to remain as their predecessors and to faithfully keep everything they have committed to others. Farewell forever. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>I hope that Muculus has been received in Bern into the ministry of the church; for he is in Bern with Haller. He wrote to me yesterday, etc. March 18, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest lord and colleague. Basel.</p>
