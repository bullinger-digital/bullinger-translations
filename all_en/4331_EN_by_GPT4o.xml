      <p>Recently, I received a letter from England addressed to Mr. Gesner, which I ask you to deliver. The war between England and France is intensifying; for the Queen of England does not want to leave the Scots, her neighbors and allies, defenseless, as they are attacked by the French due to the religion they have adopted. For under the pretext of religion, the war initiated by the French is directed towards the suppression of the entire island. The King of Spain is also being drawn into this alliance of arms under these specious titles, namely of heresy and rebellion, forgetting the very ancient treaties and the benefits often received from the ancient and our contemporary kings of England.</p>
      <p>There is hope that the true Germans, mindful of their duty, will not fight in this nefarious war for the French. If the Swiss also refuse to take up impious arms and draw swords against the innocent, it is likely that the king will achieve nothing remarkable. The Queen has moved her forces by land and sea to Scotland, and unless the King of France accepts and offers the most equitable conditions, the Queen will strive to assert Scotland's freedom by arms. I have not yet received anything about the Queen's marriage; it is said that the elder son of the King of Sweden is about to arrive in England. The Emperor's envoy also remains there; however, many doubt whether he will be successful in his mission. It is said that the Queen does not wish to engage in gloomy nuptials amidst the horrors of war, lest it be said that she married a liberator more out of necessity than to a chosen husband. Religion in England is having successful outcomes, and to ensure that these become more successful every day, God must be implored. I ask that you commend me to Mr. Martyr.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strassburg.</p>
