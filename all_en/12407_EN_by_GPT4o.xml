    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received Erb's shipment [No. 2333] with thanks, but due to his workload, he cannot respond as he would like. Erb should continue to write, especially since his letters are very welcome.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The young Johannes Haller was sent to Augsburg, where he was received very kindly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger sees daily how necessary his "Resurrectio" is, as Epicureans are appearing everywhere. A stop must be put to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Erb should remain strong in the fight for [the Gospel], like Moses and Aaron once did in their fight against [the Pharaoh]. If the servants of God perish due to their divine mission, then [merely what] is heard [from the Holy Scripture] occurs. Therefore, Erb should be without fear. The Lord will stand by him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger is very pleased that the Mömpelgarder Church has been restored.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The council in Trent opened its second session on February 4th. Soon the heretics from Germany will be summoned there. May God expose [the Papacy]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion, which began with great effort, is ending in a ridiculous manner. Others will report on this as well. If only the [Protestants] would beware of the [Catholics] according to 2 Timothy 3:5!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Johannes] Hoffmeister is a real fool, like those kept at the courts!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Emperor [Charles V] opposes [Christ]. Bullinger knows Charles's stubbornness and pride well enough to know that he will not easily retreat; yet he too will perish like the Pharaoh in the floods.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- It is good that Elector [Friedrich II] has converted to [the Gospel]. However, Bullinger fears that he [still depends too much] on Luther and, like the kings of Israel once did, only abolishes the temples of Baal and not the high, [pagan] cult sites. Erb should write if he hears anything reliable from the [Reichenweier] court or from Strasbourg about the electoral reformation. [News] can be sent to Johannes Gast in Basel, who will forward them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- What should Bullinger say about Veit [Dietrich's] writing [“To the Christian Church in Regensburg”]? He would have expected something different from [Dietrich]. He is a monkey of Luther. He treats the arguments of his opponents very superficially. Although he uses many words, they say little. He talks about enthusiasts. These are people who confuse everything and know no [logical] order, [which by no means applies to the people of Zurich]. Dietrich's position on Eucharistic adoration gives both the [Protestants] and the [Catholics] reason to laugh.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- In [Zurich] things are going well, except that Erasmus [Schmid] suffers greatly from dropsy, yet proves to be steadfast. He will [soon die].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings to [Sigismund] Stier, the scribe [Oswald Fürstenlob], [Nikolaus] König, and Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger]. Greetings from the brothers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Bullinger would have liked to see Erb's letter to Veit [Dietrich].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I received the bundle of letters sent by you, dearest Erb, and I give you my greatest thanks for your faith, diligence, and charity. Meanwhile, I am so overwhelmed with the burden of affairs and writing letters that I cannot do what I would gladly wish. Therefore, please accept these few words kindly and nonetheless write back briefly and frequently. For all your letters are very welcome to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We sent the learned and pious young man, Johannes Haller, to Augsburg. He was received there with great joy. Pray to the Lord that He may bless his ministry.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I see daily how necessary the discussion on the Resurrection is, as flocks of Epicureans are emerging everywhere. Therefore, it is good to oppose them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Be strong in the struggle for Christ. This is our calling, to fight against Satan and impure men. Moses and Aaron approached the rebellious king so many times; they suffered rejection so many times; they returned so many times. They finally freed the people. We are dealing with a stiff-necked and rebellious people, with the most corrupt people of the last times. Therefore, we must not cease; we must press on continuously and perpetually. We are ministers sent by our Lord to demand fruit from the tenants. If our heads are then struck off, it happens as it is heard. Therefore, be strong and fearless. Pray to the Lord. He will not fail your efforts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am very glad that the Mömpelgarder Church has been restored. May the Lord strengthen it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Council of Trent held its second session on February 4th. Soon it will summon heretics from Germany. May the Lord expose the many-headed beast and crush impiety and idolatry along with the teachers of superstition and magic soon. Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The colloquium, begun with great expense, has ended in laughter. You will understand this from others. If only our people would begin to be wise now and shun those men according to the apostle's command in 2 Timothy 3:5!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The court jester wants to prove and make it clear that he is a true, real court jester, as they are kept at the lords' courts in fools' caps. Since he is a court jester, he gladly imitates the lords' courts.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Emperor kicks against the goad. He will one day experience the hardness of the rock. If only he would come to his senses! I have known the man's inflexible and proud neck so far, that I do not think he will easily yield, but will first try everything until he, like Pharaoh, is submerged in the midst of the waves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I am very glad that the Elector Palatine has converted to Christ. However, I fear that he may not fully demolish the high places. Perhaps he follows Luther and, like the princes of Israel, destroys the temples of Baal, but does not yet hate the high places of Luther. May the Lord open the mind of the most illustrious prince! Please write diligently if you hear anything certain from the court or from Strasbourg about his reformation. Send what you wish to give me to Basel to Johannes Gast. He will take care to have everything delivered to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What should I say or judge about Veit's writings? I pity the man. I expected something different from him. He imitates Luther's Thersitic wit most ineptly and affectedly, thus revealing himself to be a more than ridiculous monkey of him. He asserts and confirms our matters coldly. He dissolves the arguments of the adversaries even more coldly. Moreover, he says very little with many words. He mentions the enthusiasts. Unless everything is mixed up for the man himself and he discusses with no proper order, I do not know what enthusiasts are. On the adoration of the Eucharist, he is so inept that he provides material for laughter to both our people and the adversaries. But the Lord's goodness and justice thus expose such teachers who attribute everything to themselves. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I write nothing else about our affairs except that, by the grace of the Lord, things are going well, except that Erasmus is now suffering from dropsy in his last days. The man's patience is remarkable; his faith and hope are admirable. We will therefore soon send him ahead, not lose him. We will follow shortly. Pray for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell with all yours, especially Taurinus, the scribe, Rhegius, Gerold, and the others. All the brothers greet you.</p>

      <p>Zurich, February 19, 1546.</p>
      <p>For the book of Veit, I give great thanks. I would like to see your letter to him.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It was not possible to reread this due to these affairs.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Matthias Erb of Reichenweier, preacher of Christ, always to be honored as lord and brother.</p>
