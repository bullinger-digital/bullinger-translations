      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>When our Konrad Funck, minister of the church in MÃ¼lhausen, was hurrying home from the Strasbourg fair and stayed overnight with me, he mentioned that he would soon be going to you. I wanted to send this to you, most kind Bullinger, and I ask that if your "Repetition" cannot see the light of day against Brentius, it be returned to the lady; she will have a cave where it can be hidden. You will diligently advise Johann Wolff to complete the encyclopedia as soon as possible and successfully, so that he may someday be appointed to the school and establish a nursery for the republic, etc.</p>
      <p>His other colleague, Regius in Basel, as I hear, will be stuck with suspended studies and neglected arts. A constant rumor and suspicion is spreading that he has married the widow of the late Thomas Girfalck, who is said to be either kind or, if you prefer, if it is true, malicious.</p>
      <p>If true, his study will be foolishly neglected. I commend our Konrad to your piety, who will report on our situation.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet all the brothers, Mr. Gwalther, your sons-in-law and family, and pray for the old man nearing the grave. On the 18th of July, 65.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety, learning, and holy life, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, sincere theologian and faithful Antistes of the renowned city of Zurich, his brother.</p>
