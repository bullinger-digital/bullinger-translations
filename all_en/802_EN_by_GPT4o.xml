      <p>Greetings. After I had already prepared extensive letters to you and the envoys, about whom I recently wrote, were to depart tomorrow, behold, your letters are brought to me, in which you write about the four Cantons coming to Zürich concerning the Wedischwil matter. I immediately shared this with certain trusted individuals; the matter reached the council. Therefore, the mission has been suspended until they find out what is being done by those in Zürich. Please inform me as soon as possible. Meanwhile, nothing is being done with me except empty promises. However, let the will of the Lord be done, whose I am, as much and as I am; wherever I am, may His glory be promoted through me. Nevertheless, I am quite offended by the tenacity and ingratitude of our people; more on this next time. The book, which I send with these letters, was sent to me by Mr. Viret; it is your work "On the Origin of Error" translated into French and printed in Geneva. Mr. Gwalther can read and judge the translation.</p>
      <p>I do not think Knechtenhofer should be received here due to the weakness of his voice. If I were to remain here, what if my brother, who... Bern, were to be requested and granted to us once? I still have nothing certain about Gervasius, whether he has been called to Biel or not.</p>
      <p>In the Wedischwil matter, the treasurer has neglected nothing; although he has not yet entered the council, your letters, which you wrote to him, have been read in the council. But what effect they or my suggestions have had, we see with sorrow. From many things, I have again extracted a few. I commend myself to you.</p>
      <p>Musculus, my wife, and his wife also send many greetings to you and yours. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to all the brothers. Bern, January 10, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and compatriot. Zürich.</p>
