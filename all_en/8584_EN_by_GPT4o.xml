      <p>S. P. We all wish and pray that you are well in the baths and that they are beneficial to you, as we are at home; indeed, by God's grace, we are well. I received a bundle of letters addressed to you yesterday; however, when I noticed that there were several letters, some of which were intended for others, I cut the thread and delivered one letter to Gwalter, another to Lavater, and a third to Hochholzer. I am sending the remaining ones to you along with other letters that Lavater gave me. Our fellow citizens are preparing a gift for Johann Müller, our teacher, for the baths, each contributing a French teston. When I was asked if you would also like to be included in this number, I replied that you would not separate from the other fellow citizens and gave a teston in your name; for your relative Heinrich, his wife contributed one. I am writing this while the senate is in session; therefore, I will add the names of other magistrates here once I have consulted, where I fear the wine-bearers; for Foraminander is very ambitious for that position: Guild Master of the Smiths: M. Caspar Haffner. Felix Sprünglin, councilor. Member of the Twelve at the Meisen: Heinrich Walder, elected for the Foraminosi. [...] of the Smiths: Jacob Rapolt. [...] of the Clothiers: H. Brunner, the son of the bookkeeper. To the lord of Sax, the preachers: Jacob Finßler, Ulrich Holz. Hügelin's matter has been postponed. It should be learned in the meantime how he departed from Heidelberg. My lords are not willing with him; but one in the council has spoken, as you and Gwalter especially desire him; otherwise, he would not have been admitted to the examination. Kamblius is the consul.</p>
      <p>In front of the town hall, there is a large ox, the likes of which have never been seen here, as tall as a tall man; it is being presented to the new lords, as I think, the butchers. Zoller has been appointed as an envoy across the Alps; for recently, he hosted a banquet at the Snail's Inn in his name and at the expense of the bread master. M. Peter Hafner F. Meierin on the Bach.</p>
      <p>This week's wedding: Mr. H. Fabricius Vogel's daughter. Oswald Grob N. Korder's daughter. Johannes Baptista Müller (who arrived the day before) reported that he heard from the Curia's envoy that it is considered certain that there will be a war between the Most Christian and the Catholic. He also said that the Five Philistines are engaging in significant negotiations, especially against the Zurichers. But if this war happens, many plans will be in vain. Meisius writes from Ferrara that he expects a war against the fat cardinals. May God bless your baths. Lavater and his family, Julius, my wife, and Müller all send their greetings to you; others do the same through letters, and I join them.</p>
      <p>Simlerus.</p>
      <p>The cloth has now arrived, it is 65 1/2 ells, and must be sent to the bleachery.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father. To Girenbad.</p>
