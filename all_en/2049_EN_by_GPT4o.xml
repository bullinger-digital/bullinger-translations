      <p>Greetings and best wishes. The one who brings you my letters, most illustrious Bullinger, is indeed my stepson, whom I love no less for his rare talents than if he were born from my own mind.</p>
      <p>He devoted himself to the study of philosophy and languages in France for almost five years, where he made quite satisfactory progress under the most learned teachers. I called him back two months ago and wished that he would devote himself to sounder theology with us and, when called to the ministry, benefit the church; however, since the study of medicine pleased him more than I had hoped, I did not want him to attempt something else against his inclination, as nothing good and perfect is born from an unwilling mind. Therefore, I wish him to travel to Italy with Peter Bernate, an excellent man, and to devote himself to medicine in Padua for the span of a year, where I hear it flourishes greatly. Since they have planned their journey through Zürich, I did not want to send my son to a friend completely without my letters. Nothing new is circulating with us now, as we continually seek something from your letters. I recently sent you a catalog of books printed with us this summer, which I hope you have long since received, and I am eager to hear in your next letters whether you have chosen anything from them for yourself. Farewell most happily with Theodor Bibliander, Gwalter, Frisius, and other friends and brothers. Given in Basel on the 25th of October in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, true bishop of the church of Zürich, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
