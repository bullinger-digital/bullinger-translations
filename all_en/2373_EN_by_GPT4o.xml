      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Not unjustly does that historian testify that good laws arise from bad morals, most beloved Bullinger; for daily experience teaches this. Hence, the governors of republics can hardly foresee enough to prevent any fraud from being mixed into even the best-established matters.</p>
      <p>Our most honorable senate has decreed that some children of citizens, born for good arts and good studies, be supported from the treasury of our church to succeed in the place of our monks. However, they fear that when they reach a suitable age, they may be withdrawn from the republic by their parents and applied to private uses. They do not doubt, however, that you have long since taken precautions through just decrees, so that nothing of the sort can be admitted to the detriment of your churches. Therefore, our school officials pray that if you have anything already decreed on this matter, it be communicated to them through you, offering in the meantime their service to you and your entire church, if they can be of any use or benefit to you in any matter.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new except those miserable fruits of the French confederation, which that recent Rhaetian disaster brought forth, and would that we are not compelled to expect greater harm in the future, as we desert those who have been entrusted to our faith, while we bring aid to those who persecute Christ to the extreme.</p>
      <p>If you have any articles concerning students, I would like you to send them to us in the German language, so that if necessity demands, they can be proposed for our senate to consider. Farewell in Christ, long safe from the church itself. Hastily from Schaffhausen, 8 days before the Kalends of September, in the year 1554. My fellow ministers greet you, as does Martin, the consul, and the others.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and esteemed brother. In Zürich.</p>
