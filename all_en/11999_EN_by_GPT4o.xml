    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices that Bullinger in a letter to Gervasius [Schuler] inquired about him; may the Lord preserve this friendship. Remained silent for a long time so as not to disturb Bullinger's work in building the Church of Christ; to this very church he took refuge; he sees himself as a silent disciple of Christ and all apostolic scholars, among whom Bullinger is included, under whose guidance he engaged with the [mysteries of faith] during his five years of silence. In difficult-to-understand passages, he seeks Bullinger's works for assistance, for Bullinger has excellently interpreted the [apostolic] letters and recently the Gospels of John and Matthew, as letters from the remotest Alps to Bertlin testify; and Melanchthon also thanks him, as is evident from Bullinger's letter to Gervasius [Schuler]; now the promised commentary on the Gospel of Luke is expected from him. Bertlin will constantly think of Bullinger, prays for him, and wishes to be regarded as his disciple. He asks for indulgence for stylistic shortcomings, as he suffers from a severe catarrh.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>That in the letters to M. Gervasius, our church's both pious and learned bishop, you, Bullinger the most learned, seemed to me to tug at the ear of one dozing, was both pleasant and gratifying. For from this, I gather that you are not only mindful of me, a mere little man, but also perpetually concerned for my well-being and safety. May God, the best and greatest, reward and preserve for us such a pious, truly Christian friend and affection towards me and, as I see and hear, towards all who are devoted to true piety.</p>
      <p>However, that I seemed to you to have snored so deeply and to have slept the dream of Endymion, as the proverb goes, or to have been entirely removed from the living, since I have neither written nor spoken a word for several years, I do not want you to believe, most humane Bullinger, that it was done and committed out of forgetfulness of you, laziness, negligence, or any other sinister disposition of mind, but rather because I did not want to sin against the public good of those devoted to sacred literature, namely by interrupting or disturbing your pious, chaste, and most delightful muse with my unpleasant trifles, or by delaying even slightly your holy labor and course, which is most successful in purging, restoring, adorning, and sanctifying the Church of Christ. To this restored church, having left the Babylon of papist filth, I have come rejoicing, exulting, and celebrating the holy Passover with the returning faithful in the renewed church, giving thanks to God Almighty, the leader and protector, who has brought me, extracted from the densest and most perilous darkness, with a strong hand into the light of His restored church. In which I now sit at the feet of Christ the evangelizer, that is, at the feet of all who teach in the spirit of Christ, as a silent, admiring, and indeed astonished disciple at this gift of the spirit, by which we see, hear, and perceive apostolic men, enlightened and inflamed, proclaiming and trumpeting the great works of God in various languages with pen and voice. Among whom the Lord has also marked you, Bullinger, called and endowed with the gifts of His spirit above many others; which you, as a faithful servant, do not allow to lie buried in the ground and become sterile or vanish, but you generously bestow upon the Church of Christ with utmost faith and sincere spirit, dispensing with mouth and hand, and that with marvelous success, pious dexterity, and thus with the most abundant fruit and most plentiful interest. May Christ, the treasury of gifts, grant that in such a holy and salutary calling you may live long, surviving in spirit and body, happy for us, indeed for His church. These things in excuse for five years of silence, during which, while I examine the symbols of Pythagoras, I imbibe the mysteries of Christ more fully and clearly, and that with you not only as a monitor and guide but also as a most generous and faithful cupbearer.</p>
      <p>You are mistaken, my Bullinger, when you think your Bartholom채us is either dozing or languishing in love and respect for you. Let it be so that this rustic and creaky pen has ceased and rested; but how could my spirit, burning with faith, zeal, and love for you, cease, when not a day has passed without a line in your holy studies? For whenever a difficult passage occurs, either with a more confused order or with a more abstruse sense or with the novelty of expression or the diversity or negligence of interpreters, there always occurs what the divine Cyprian is said to have said about his Tertullian: "Give me the master." For with what dexterity and success you have explained to us the Pauline epistles with the canonical ones, now the two evangelists, is testified by the pious and those devoted to true piety, who also testify in their letters to me from the innermost and most hidden recesses of our Alps. The whole Church of Christ testifies, in whose name our Philipp Melanchthon, most deservedly of all, gave you thanks, as you wrote to our Gervasius. This we received with such joy of spirit that I cannot adequately express it, and that for more than one reason, which it would not be difficult for you to conjecture, most prudent Bullinger. We now expect your Luke; for so you promised in letters to several good friends and students of your sacred studies, among whom you promised me some years ago. Therefore, respond to our expectation and return to us the Gospel of Luke, illustrated with your commentaries in that majesty of expression with which he gave the Gospel to the Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>I know you will now think: "I did not tug at the ear of a dozing Bartholom채us, but plainly seized a noisy cicada, a most hoarse and unpleasant little creature, or rather I have stirred up hornets, poor me." But be of good cheer; for I will desist with this one addition: Wherever in the world or on the sea Bartholom채us may be tossed about, however he may cease, doze, and indeed sleep on either ear, he will remember you, wish you all good things, and commend your health to the Lord with constant prayers. For so your pious affection and ardor for the restoration of the Church of Christ deserve. Then may all students be brought to Christ the master, that He alone may be heard. In which sincere and pious affection, with a constant and unbroken spirit against threatening storms, may He protect and preserve you for us and His church eternally.</p>
      <p>In this, farewell and live, my teacher, and recognize me as your disciple, even silent and mute, and love me as you have consistently done until now. To your holy house, indeed to the whole Church of Zurich, I pray for eternal salvation in the Lord; to whose prayers I commend myself.</p>
      <p>From Woringen in the district of Memmingen, the day before the Ides of August in the year etc. 44. Your faithful disciple</p>
      <p>Bartholom채us Bertlin, minister of the Church of Christ in the word at Woringen.</p>
      <p>Forgive the rude and unpolished pen and the errors. I bear a most troublesome catarrh during these dog days, nor can I hope for any end, according to the judgment of the physician, until they have passed. By purgation, phlebotomy, and I know not what potions, cataplasms, then I think by death I will cure this. But let the tyrant physicians be damned, and may the one and true chief physician and savior, Christ Jesus, true God and true man, live and heal us according to His good will. Amen.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his superior in the Lord.</p>
