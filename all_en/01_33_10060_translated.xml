  <input>Gratiam et pacem a domino.

Fovet hic miserandus senex filium domi (quem nosti Ioannem Gingium) paralisi deiectum, cum interim ab hoc exigatur docendi offitium. Ceterum cum non ignoret, quanti referat, quem suis praefitiat, nemini arduum hoc negotium citius concredidit, atque tibi, Zuingli doctissime, quippe qui pro ista tua vigilanti ecclesiarum cura et possis et velis adminiculari. Sunt enim illic apud vos plurimi ad hasce res eidonei. Obsecramus itaque, ut te nobis, imprimis vero ovibus Christi hac in re impendas, denique boni consulas temeritatem nostram, qua severiora tua audemus interturbare studia. Dominus Jesus te nobis diu servet incolumem.

Huldrycho Zuinglio, fratri charissimo.</input>
  <output>May the Lord grant you grace and peace.

This wretched old man is nurturing his son at home (whom you know, John Gingius) who has been laid low by paralysis, while he is required to do the duty of teaching at the same time. However, knowing well how important it is to have someone in charge of his own, he quickly entrusted this difficult task to no one else but to you, most learned Zuingli, since you can and are willing to help in this your vigilant care for the churches. For there are a great many suitable people among you for such matters. Therefore we beg that you may devote yourself to us, particularly to the sheep of Christ, in this matter, and finally advise us in our rashness for daring to interrupt your more serious studies. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and well for a long time.

November 24, 1529.
