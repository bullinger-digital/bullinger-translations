    <p xml:id="regest1">Not only the scholars from Zurich, but also those from Basel were not included in the meeting [of March 27]. Myconius discussed Bullinger's letter [No. 768] with [Simon] Grynaeus, [Jakob Meyer], and [Werner Beyel]. Capito came to Basel in vain because of [...] von Wattenwyl, but also to warn against the misuse of church property. Myconius promises a detailed report and also intends to write to Utinger. Bucer has been summoned to Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Just as none of your people were called to this meeting, none of ours attended either. Before I could know what was done, everyone is preparing to leave. It may be that you will understand everything here before we do. Indeed, regarding the matters you advised, I first discussed them with Mr. Grynaeus, then with our consul, and finally with your scribe. After a longer consultation, I sent back whatever you wrote to your delegates.</p>
      <p>Capito was present, but mainly because of von Wattenwyl, who did not come due to eye pain, and also to privately advise that church property be properly managed. There are many things, he says, for which we are reproached by adversaries, which can nevertheless be excused properly and rightly; but regarding those properties, there is nothing to be said in response.</p>
      <p>I cannot discuss more now due to the brevity of time. Soon I will be more detailed, and necessarily so.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and our Utinger, to whom I will also write shortly.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>Bucer, having been summoned, has gone to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
