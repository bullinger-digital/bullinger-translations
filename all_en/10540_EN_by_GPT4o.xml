    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Zürich are surprised that the people of Bern did not sign the [Zürich Communion] Confession [No. 482], even though they essentially confess the same thing [in No. 489]; apparently, they did not understand the structure of the argument. Following two summary theses, the people of Zürich first explained in detail what is meant by the "Body of Christ." This is in heaven, therefore it is not physically present in the meal, but spiritually through faith; in this statement, they rely, as Zwingli did, on John 6. The people of Bern wrongly accuse them of mixing spiritual and symbolic nourishment; both are to be distinguished, yet believers partake in both. The statement that the body and blood of Christ are distributed in the Communion does not contradict the fact that believers have already received both in faith beforehand; even Paul had to have his sins washed away through baptism, although he had already been cleansed by grace beforehand. When [the people of Zürich] confess that the external signs serve as confirmation in a human way, they do not deny that the spirit of man can only be strengthened by the Holy Spirit. The letter from Leo Jud and that from Theodor Bibliander to the pastors of Brugg deal with everything in more detail. Since they were disappointed by the response from Bern [No. 489], they refrained from sending it along with the [Zürich] Confession and the statements from Basel, St. Gallen, and Schaffhausen to Konstanz; the enclosed copy of a letter [No. 496] provides information about the meeting of delegates from Swabian churches with Bucer, which they themselves did not attend. The letter [from Zürich] is to be shown to all pastors. They hope for a better response.</p>

      <p>To the dearest brothers in the Lord, the ministers of the church of Bern, we who preach Christ in Zürich wish grace and innocence of life.</p>
      <p>Although you testify, dearest brothers, that you cannot subscribe to our confession in all respects, you have nevertheless confessed as much in your brief confession as we have in our more extensive one, if you consider the words, but the same, if you carefully weigh the meaning. Hence, we cannot sufficiently marvel at the reasons why you have not joined us. For those you have noted are such that they clearly show you have understood our matters very little and have not diligently observed how we have arranged each point or in what order we have discussed the matter. We certainly, dealing with a difficult but simple matter and disputing simply, have followed this order:</p>
      <p>At the beginning of this matter, we encompass the whole sum in very few words and compress it into two judgments, or if anyone prefers to call them articles. Then we explain each point more fully, taking the utmost care throughout that no one derives from our judgments what you strive to achieve. Indeed, from the beginning, we have given a certain meaning to the word "body" especially for those who attribute to Christ some third thing, invisible indeed, but corporeal, that is, an imaginary and miraculous body, which is present in the action of the supper. Therefore, we confess that Christ has a true body, so much so that he has not lost the nature of the body even when glorified. We confess that this true body of Christ is present and eaten in the supper.</p>
      <p>Now, since there is controversy about the mode of presence and eating, we immediately set out to explain that mode. However, since it is established that the true body of Christ has not lost the nature of the body through the resurrection, it necessarily follows that it is "in some place in heaven" (we use Augustine's words) "because of the mode of a true body," and therefore the body of Christ is not present in the supper carnally or naturally, but spiritually or through faith, and is eaten. Furthermore, since the opposing party contends that Christ is present and eaten carnally by the power of the words "This is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par], we approve our mode, namely that Christ is eaten only through faith and spirit, from John 6. For Zwingli also used John 6[26-65] to prove that Christ's words in Matthew 26[26] "This is my body" are to be understood not carnally, but spiritually or sacramentally. We do the same in our confession. For when disputing in general about how Christ is eaten and present, we bring in John 6. In general, I say, we spoke, even when the sacraments are not used. However, having explained this, we descend to the particular presence in the supper, or, to speak more significantly, we first prove this general: Christ is present and eaten in no other way than spiritually. Then we descend to the specific: Therefore, he is not present and eaten in the supper in any other way. Our words testify to this, which are read in this manner: "And although the body and blood of Christ are always present to the faithful in the manner we have explained, even without the use of symbols, and the pious partake of them, yet they are present, eaten, and distributed only through the same faith and in no other way than this, even when celebrated in the symbols." Thus far, we have faithfully recounted the words of our confession.</p>
      <p>What can you desire in these? You make a double eating: one, which is done by faith alone without the use of symbols, and another, which is done with symbols. We do the same. You contend that the internal, which is of faith, must precede, and the symbolic must follow. We affirm the same. You say that the symbolic is useless without faith, indeed even pernicious. We say the same. "But you," you object, "mix both." We speak of the eating and supper of the saints. They do not eat bare bread, but true flesh, not indeed united to the bread, but present by faith, signified by the bread, and offered to the senses in its own manner. Hence we have expressly said: In the supper, Christ is present and eaten "only through the same faith and in no other way than this." Consider, I beseech you, each word and, setting aside emotion, judge what we have said, and you will see that we have erred in no part.</p>
      <p>But you think we have erred in that we confess that the body and blood of Christ are distributed in the supper; for from this, you conclude that they are then first brought by the benefit of the symbols as by a vehicle. But you infer this in your own way. We have never thought of such a thing. For as we confess there is a double eating, so we confess there is a double distribution: Christ alone distributes his body and blood to the faithful; the sacraments distribute in their own manner. But unless Christ himself is partaken by faith by the one receiving, the minister distributes nothing to him but the sacred symbol. However, no consequence follows in the sacramental matter: "Christ was eaten by the faithful mind before the supper, therefore he is not eaten in the supper." For thus the sacraments would become useless. Paul, washed from sins by the grace of the Lord, nevertheless hears Ananias saying to him: "Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of Jesus" [Acts 22, 16]. Baptism indeed washes away the sins of no one except him whose sins grace has washed away. Nevertheless, the truth says: "Be baptized and wash away your sins." Imitating this manner of speaking, we have confessed that in the action of the supper the body of Christ is distributed.</p>
      <p>The third point, which offends, is more minute than to require much response. It is this: "This is what we do not understand, namely that the church is made certain and undoubted by the symbols, that is, that the body of Christ is given for us." We have indeed produced this word from a certain similarity. For we wrote a little before: "Among men, the delivery of anything seems more effective in a certain way when it is transacted not only with words but also with signs." Alluding to this now and introducing the other part of the comparison, we add: "Therefore, Christ, wishing to lead his church into the contemplation of God's benefits, especially his death, and further to make it certain and undoubted" etc. Therefore, our speech was to be explained from the material of the statement. We had spoken in the first part about that certification, which in a certain way is usually done among men through external symbols, and so in the second part of the speech, we could not speak of another. For who does not know that the heart and spirit of man are satisfied and confirmed only by the Holy Spirit of God? This we have also sufficiently explained in our confession to those who soberly examine it without emotion.</p>
      <p>Our dearest brother and fellow minister Leo Jud will provide more. Our beloved brother and teacher Theodor Bibliander has also written more to the brothers in Brugg. Certainly, we expected anything rather than such a letter from you. Hence it happened that we sent our confession to Konstanz along with the assent and subscription of the people of Basel, St. Gallen, and Schaffhausen, promising to send yours immediately to the messenger. However, we hoped for other things than what happened; therefore, we sent nothing. For even today we conceal our dissension, which we believe has now vanished with our purifications. The most learned and pious ministers of the Swabian churches gathered in Konstanz. Bucer also came, who was not summoning us with one message, but for certain reasons, especially because we had once expressed our opinion in writing, we delayed coming. What they have done or with what mind they are affected towards us, you will understand from the letters we have appended after these.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, brothers, to show these to those brothers whom you summoned to the first message, among whom our reputation and integrity are somewhat endangered by a vain opinion conceived about us. We hope, however, that you are now appeased and will respond better. For we are yours, strive to be ours, but that we may all be Christ's, to whom be glory forever.</p>
