      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, peace has been established between you and Bucer, and thus with Luther himself. May it be happy and prosperous, and would that it were the end of the contention! May our Christ also ensure that what is given and received is solid and firm, so that the concord itself may be solid and firm. I sincerely hope that Bucer will not disturb you henceforth.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased that you have helped Landenberg, for I hear that he has obtained everything. He has expressed many thanks to me, in such a way that I understand he attributes this victory to my recommendation and your diligence. In turn, I have shown the same diligence on behalf of Kotter, as he will report. It was successful; many thanks be to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Also, cheer up Leo with this news. And farewell in Christ; for I cannot say more. I send back the confession and the other documents with thanks.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz.</p>
      <p>Our consul Thomas sends you a thousand greetings. He is very busy, otherwise he would have responded himself.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican in my name. May 27, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
