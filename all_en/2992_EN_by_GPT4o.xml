      <p> Greetings. Satan tries every way, not only to hinder but also to overthrow the kingdom of Christ, and he attacks where you least expect it. Our Geneva, a notable home of true religion and piety, is in danger, and this is due to the schemes of the French and the Pope, both of whom aim to devastate that holy and illustrious church once again with the abomination of the Antichrist. It is not unlikely that some votes from the confederate orders are also contributing to this, as we see them almost more fervently intent on suppressing the light of the Gospel than most of our own are on preserving or spreading it. However, I think that both the French and any others would easily remain quiet if the alliance and treaty of the two cities could once again be consolidated. But since, through the cunning of the deceiver, human emotions are indulged a little too much on both sides, the bond remains broken, which, in my opinion, must necessarily be very tight, unless it is not necessary to maintain the safety of both the republic and the church. For this [Greek] opens a very wide door to the worst plans destined for the destruction of both. And indeed, my dear Bullinger, there is no need for me to warn you about this, as you easily foresee the loss and grieve for it due to your piety. However, so that you are not unaware of what I received today from Bern from a very serious man of senatorial rank, I wanted to write to you immediately through this messenger dispatched for this very purpose, in case you might wish to confer with the most illustrious and prudent magistrate on this matter, so that by the authority of him and other evangelical orders, an attempt at reconciliation of the two cities might be made again, to counteract the pernicious efforts. I will also deal with the same matter with our people without delay, preferring to be considered an importunate intercessor in this evil than a somewhat unhelpful idler in such a great matter. I commend you to the grace of God with all yours. </p>
      <p> Written hastily in Basel, August 22, 1556. Yours, Simon Sulzer. </p>
