      <p> Most revered father, recently Franciscus Bettus reported to me in person certain matters regarding financial business, and that in your name and by your mandate. I was glad on both accounts: that there was some hope and that I was allowed to see this Mr. Bettus, whom I had not known by face until now, in person and to confer with him on certain matters, as I had not yet forgotten from whose number and order he is. However, I was saddened because he affirmed that you were becoming weaker by the day; may the most good and great God alleviate your pains and sufferings and preserve you for all of us as long as possible, as a learned and venerable father, in good health. Meanwhile, I did not want to conceal from you what has been announced from Italy, especially since we learned this through the kindness of Mr. Lentulus, who repeatedly wished your eminence, most holy father, well. I most humbly commend myself entirely to your paternal favor. </p>
      <p> Swiftly from our Chur, 13th September 1574. Your most devoted admirer of your illustrious name, Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and most esteemed man of all virtue, piety, and learning, Mr. H. Bullinger, primary and most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
