      <p>Most illustrious and distinguished Mr. Bullinger, I received the letters which you sent to me, written in a very friendly manner with a certain student, from which I clearly perceived your benevolent disposition towards me, to which I wish I could respond appropriately, and indeed through the occupations with which I am daily overwhelmed in typographical matters. For you have bound me to you in such a way that I gladly acknowledge that I owe you everything that is in me. But since I am less able to fulfill this, you will pardon me, and while you see that strength is lacking, you will praise the will, until I can do so more conveniently.</p>
      <p>I confess that I act unjustly: as we can, however, when we are not allowed as we wish. - The greeting which you ordered me to impart to the lord, I have announced, who gives you great thanks, and wishes the same in return. He also wrote himself, if I am not mistaken, with this master who brings you these letters. Regarding the index in Frisius, which is mentioned in the title, you indeed remind me well; for due to the upcoming fairs it could not be added, otherwise it was completed. But when we have entrusted this to the press, I will send it to you at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>I gave the coin to the printer, as you wished, who ordered me to give you the greatest thanks, and earnestly asks that you forgive him for not returning as he promised. I thought these things should be briefly indicated to you, which I strongly ask you to take in good part. Farewell, the sole ornament of studies, and keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, 13th of November.</p>
      <p>Your Jeremias Mylius of Leipzig.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, most excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and patron. αω or αει in Zürich.</p>
