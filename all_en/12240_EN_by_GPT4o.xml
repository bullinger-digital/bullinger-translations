    <p xml:id="regest1">The reason Gast did not respond to two of Bullinger's letters was not due to [Capilupi's "De vita monachorum"], a work that greatly amused Gast, for which he could also provide witnesses. However, Gast has already sent three letters [to Bullinger] without receiving a reply. The messengers and Bullinger's official duties are to blame. - According to a brother [...] from the Bern area, a letter written by [Martin] Bucer (presumably to [Simon] Sulzer) is circulating there against Bullinger's ["Warhafftes Bekanntnu√ü"], in which many passages allegedly mishandled by Bullinger are clarified and [it also states] that Bullinger or the Zurichers responded to Luther in a childish manner; as a result (according to Sulzer), the Zurichers and their doctrine lose authority and credibility. If Bullinger has this or another letter from Bucer, he should send it to Gast; otherwise, Bullinger should secretly inquire about Bucer's letter. - Gast hears with sorrow about the discord between the [Zurichers] and [Theodor] Bibliander, but has heard recently that the matter has been settled. Bullinger should not allow the plague [of discord]! - Gast is expecting news from Strasbourg. - [P.S.:] Bullinger should also share something about his current work on the Holy Scripture.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have complained in two letters that I have not responded at all, and rightly so, for you feared that I was upset because of the poem sent, which not only greatly delighted me but also filled me with great pleasure. I could bring forth witnesses with whom I shared the poem; but let these things be. However, I have now sent three letters and cannot extract a single word from you; but I place all the blame on the messengers and your official duties.</p>
      <p>However, I have something that I cannot conceal from you; for it particularly concerns you, and your name is being tarnished. A certain sincere brother from the Bern area told me that a certain letter is being circulated among them, which they say Bucer wrote against your booklet, in which many passages allegedly mishandled by you are clarified, and then it states that you or the Zurichers responded childishly to Luther and the letter contains other such jibes; they say it was sent to Sulzer and spread by Sulzer, so that the Zurichers and their doctrine lose authority, and among those who wish well for the churches of Christ, doubt about your doctrine arises. For I know Satan's schemes in this matter, although I do not make Sulzer the author of this thing, since I have nothing certain; but I conjecture so. If you have that letter or it was written to you by Bucer, I beg you to share it with me; I will return it shortly and show it to no one. But if you have not yet seen it, inquire secretly about that letter; without a doubt, they will share it with you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hear and with great sorrow perceive that there is discord between you and our Theodor! How this happens, I cannot guess, but, praise be to God, I have heard again in these days that the whole matter has been settled between you most excellently and happily. Praise be to the Lord forever. O dearest brother, do not let this plague invade you! You, who have the greater part, who excel in doctrine and prudence over the rest, resist with all your might. Satan wants to disturb and sift you, and the Lord is trying to test you, whether you wish to remain steadfast in the work of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and write back about all matters. I have not yet received anything from Strasbourg, but I expect letters every day. After reading these, if they have anything worthy of knowing and truth, I will not conceal it from you.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 9, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Gast from the heart.</p>
      <p>Also write back about what you are currently meditating on in the Holy Scriptures and what you are about to publish.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and most humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church and his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
