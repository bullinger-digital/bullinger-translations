      <p>Greetings. I have long since relieved you of this concern, dearest Bullinger, so that you may not think I am offended by the rarity or brevity of your letters. However, because I trust that I have obtained the same from your kindness in return, I did not hesitate to give this young man, Johann Konrad Major from Schaffhausen, a very small letter to deliver to you. Therefore, know that the letters you wrote to me and Haller on April 20th were delivered to me on the day after the first of May, and I have already sent Haller his letter from Mr. Stettner. I have not yet been able to learn what you wrote about French affairs, because living in the castle with his family, he visits us less frequently, and because I have been using Guaiac wood decoction this past month, I have not left the house. If I receive anything from Mr. Haller, I will ensure it is returned to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, farewell and give my regards to Mr. Gwalther and your most delightful family and son.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, the day after the Nones of May 1568.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most kind and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, my esteemed lord and friend.</p>
