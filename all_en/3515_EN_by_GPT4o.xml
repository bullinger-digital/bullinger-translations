      <p>Greetings. I congratulate you, most illustrious man, that you have returned home safe and sound and found all your family and affairs well. May Master Peter from Bergamo recover, and may you write happy news about our Travers! Our affairs here, by the grace of God, are quite well. We are in good health, and everything is peaceful.</p>
      <p>I praise your son, Johann, as always; he is as dear to me as a son; for he is of an honest, sincere, and good nature. If he continues in this way, which I hope and pray to the Lord to grant him His grace, you will have abundant reason to rejoice in him; however, much care is needed to prevent him from being corrupted. He has lived with me so far in such a way that I have never had to discipline him with the rod.</p>
      <p>But with Hector, although he has been with me for a very short time, I have been forced to exercise this right. He is of a vehement and stubborn nature and is not easily moved by words; he is very reluctant to turn away from his undertakings and accustomed habits. Nevertheless, I will try everything with fatherly care, kindness, and moderate severity to correct his faults.</p>
      <p>Whatever the outcome, I will write to you diligently.</p>
      <p>To me, it seems that he is too focused on too many things at the beginning; he could learn to play the lute more conveniently at another time; I would prefer him to devote himself now solely to school, language, and writing, etc. Many new things are being circulated: King Ferdinand is hastening to Frankfurt, and other electors are also expected to go there; many serious German princes are making military expeditions, uncertain against whom. But I will write about these when I have more certain information; for now, I could barely write these things.</p>
      <p>Do not be anxious about your sons; for what serves honor and necessity, nothing will be lacking for them. I wish to be commended to Master Travers and your parent and other good men, whom you will greet on my behalf, especially the ministers of the word and church among you. My wife and my family send their greetings to you, your most honorable wife, and your entire household. Farewell in Christ, happy and blessed.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 25, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Friedrich von Salis, in Samaden, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Samaden.</p>
