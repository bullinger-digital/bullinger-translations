    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As the letter bearer Hans Stadelmann, pastor in Altnau in Thurgau, will also report himself, the Thurgau governor Leonhard Holzhalb accuses him of being an agitator because at the beginning of the [Schmalkaldic] War he asked several men why they did not also go to war, especially since it was not to be assumed that they would be accused and punished for it. When Blarer was asked for advice by Stadelmann, it seemed best to him to provide him with the present letter of recommendation so that he could soon get out of the matter and not have to appear before the Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should therefore, in Blarer's name, ask the people of Zurich, especially the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, to write to Holzhalb in this matter, so that he may exercise leniency as much as possible. Blarer will be most grateful to the mayors and Bullinger for this, all the more so as Stadelmann is a good pastor and any righteous man would have acted as he did, and indeed would still act.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since Blarer does not know when Stadelmann will come to Zurich, he reports nothing further, as a messenger to Zurich will soon be found anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.]: May the bearer feel that Blarer's intercession with Bullinger and the Zurich mayors is effective, which Thomas Blarer also requests.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved, trusted lord and brother. The bearer, Mr. Hans Stadelmann, pastor in Altnau in Thurgau, is now being accused by the governor as an agitator because at the beginning of this unfortunate war he said to several people, why do they not also go, etc.; he did not think that they would be accused and punished for it, etc., as he will explain to you himself. Since this matter is very burdensome for him, as you can imagine, and he asked for my advice, I thought it best that he should go to Zurich and, with my recommendation, ask you to help him so that he might soon get out of the matter and not have to appear before the Diet; this advice pleased him well, and so he has set out on his way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly and brotherly ask you, on my behalf as well, to appeal to your lords, especially my kind and dear lords, the mayors Lavater and Haab, so that your governor in Thurgau may be written to regarding the aforementioned pastor, that he may be shown leniency as much as possible. I ask this of them and you, if possible, in the most friendly and obliging manner, for this pastor is a good, capable, and agreeable pastor and preacher, and the matter has developed in such a way that many an honest man has spoken such words and would still speak them in similar cases, so it is well to have compassion in such cases and to act in the best way. I trust you will do this and convey my most willing service and best regards to my aforementioned kind and dear lords, the mayors.</p>

      <p>Since I do not know how soon the bearer will arrive, I have not wanted to write anything else, as I think a messenger to you may be found today. Dated the evening of February 9, 1547. Ambr. Bl.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>May the bearer, along with my kind and dear lords, the mayors, find that my intercession has been effective. I desire to repay this in every possible way. Likewise, I also ask this of you, my dear brother.</p>
