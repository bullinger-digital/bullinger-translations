    <p xml:id="regest1">[Valentin] Krautwald and Fabian [Eckel], as well as other pastors in Silesia and Prussia, are being severely pressured due to their resistance to a concord with Luther; in Strasbourg, an abbot - likely [Paul] Volz - is said to have gotten into a dispute with Bucer over his concord plans. Thus, the concord casts its shadows ahead and could even prove to be a threat to the Gospel.</p>

      <p>Valentin Krautwald, a pious man who shares our views on the matter of the Eucharist, and Fabian Eckel, whom Theodor knows, are suffering much from the Lutherans in Silesia because they refuse Luther's concord. The monks in Silesia and Prussia, following Luther in this matter, oppose the other priests so much that they try to expel them all. An abbot, a preacher among the people of Strasbourg (I think it is Paul Volz), opposes Bucer in such a way that he does not want his concord. They say something unhealthy has certainly arisen between them in recent days. Thus, the concord gives a foretaste of what is to come, even before it has truly begun. What do you think will happen if something is denied to Luther here? This news makes me think that the beginnings are promising for extinguishing the Gospel. Let us persist in prayers, I ask, so that God may extend His mighty hand at some point. I did not want you to be unaware of this. The writings about Silesia and Prussia have reached us, and there is a rumor about the abbot.</p>
