    <p xml:id="regest1">In the church of Zürich and other Swiss confederate cities, they thank God that the Archbishop of Cologne has accepted the Gospel; after [the people of Zürich] heard in recent days that [the reformation draft by Bucer and Melanchthon] was accepted by the estates and only the cathedral chapter, the university, and the citizens of Cologne resist, they pray to God to open the eyes of the city. As a faithful shepherd of his sheep, von Wied is a model for other bishops; Bullinger wishes him steadfastness and offers him support through the pastors and teachers of Zürich. He sends his commentary on John as a sign of his friendly disposition.</p>

      <p>To the most Reverend Father in Christ, the most illustrious Prince Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne, Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire for Italy, Prince Elector, Duke of Westphalia and Angaria, my most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot easily express how much joy not only the church of Zürich but also the churches of neighboring cities in Switzerland, which favor the truth, felt when it was announced that even the Archbishop of Cologne had received the word of God.</p>
      <p>We gave great thanks to the most gracious Father and prayed with all the saints that He would grant your piety, counselors, and subjects the spirit to stand firm in the severe temptations of this world. The Lord did not reject the prayers of His saints. For in recent days, we heard that a reformation was composed by the pious and learned, offered to the churches, and accepted by all the estates, with only the cathedral chapter, the university, and the citizens of the city protesting. Thus, filled with new joy, we do not cease to pray to the Lord to confirm what He has begun and to open the eyes of the otherwise illustrious city of Cologne, so that it too may see and embrace that saving word of God offered to all nations for the safety of soul and body.</p>
      <p>Your piety alone among so many bishops of Germany, France, Italy, and other kingdoms has responded to its name and the function divinely assigned through Christ the Lord. He willed that your piety act as the shepherd and watchman of His sheep, which He redeemed with His own blood. He willed that the mystery of His redemption be made known especially to these sheep. Therefore, with utmost faith and diligence, by His grace, you care that they are fed with the word of truth, that they see and understand how they are justified and saved. Thus, you win many for Christ the Lord. Thus, you free your soul. For your piety is not ignorant of what the Lord says in Ezekiel. Since you care to announce the judgments of the Lord, it is well; you have freed your soul, the servants, and those entrusted to your faith. You leave an example for all other bishops to imitate with great glory and benefit. What is more, in that venerable old age of your piety inclining towards rest and soon promising a better life, you can, with the most just of men, Simeon, not without the joy of heart, cry out: "Now you dismiss your servant" [Lk 2, 29]. For your piety has seen the Lord Jesus in the truth of the gospel through faith. The doctrine we deliver is certain and undoubted, evangelical; although it is called new, although the world rages and considers it heretical. It will prevail; for the truth remains forever. Therefore, be strong in virtue, most holy prelate, perseverance leads to the stars; thus your piety will please Christ, the prince of pastors. Having served Him for 20 years now, and as He willed to use me here as a minister and herald of His word, I wished to congratulate your piety with this letter and at the same time offer my services to you. If in any way I can gratify or assist your holy endeavors in the gospel, I will be ready. My fellow ministers, the ministers of the church of Christ, pastors, and professors of our school, pious and learned men, will also be most ready.</p>
      <p>I wished to declare my goodwill towards your piety with some special token; but since I could not do so now as I wished, I at least deposit some indication of my zeal towards your piety, an example of my commentaries on the Gospel of John, which I wrote this summer for the use of the pious. I pray your humanity, most illustrious prince, to consider these my letters along with the book of the good gospel and receive them with a kind heart. For I embrace your piety and what I have done, I have done with the most loving heart for you. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for His church and for us all for a long time.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
