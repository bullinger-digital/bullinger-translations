      <p>That Staphylus or Strophilus of Plautus, when he was still six miles away from the city of Prague, being carried by carriage, a severe storm suddenly arose near a small grove under a clear sky, and lightning immediately struck his driver sitting on the front horse. The driver fell lifeless from the horse, while the horse he was steering with his right hand towards the pole also lay prostrate on the ground. Staphylus, barely collecting himself with his scribe, placed the driver, who was somewhat recovering from a fainting fit but consumed by a stupor similar to apoplexy in the middle part of his body, with difficulty onto the carriage and proceeded to the nearest village. There he encountered his relative, Mr. Johann Hess, a jurist, in an inn, to whom he revealed the entire story, hoping to find a friend who would sympathize with him. However, when he presented the example of Saul to Staphylus and encouraged him towards the steadfastness which is the integrity and prudence of a man, the furious sycophant burst out against him with these words, saying: "You have always opposed me until now. Do you not know that these things can happen by natural reason? Indeed, if divine clemency had not been so great towards me, why would you not think that the wrath of God should have flared up against me in the same way, which also struck down my driver?" Finally, when the excellent man could achieve nothing with the deserter either by advice or exhortation, he indignantly declared him to be hard-hearted and deserving of greater punishment, and when he had arrived here as a delegate to the assembly, he explained everything fearlessly to all. You can believe these things, my most excellent lord Bullinger, because the whole matter has already begun to be openly confessed among us for three weeks now. Greetings to the whole church and your college, to Mr. Gesner and to each and every one of the others.</p>
      <p>Most observant of your kindness in all things, Raphael Seiler, jurist.</p>
