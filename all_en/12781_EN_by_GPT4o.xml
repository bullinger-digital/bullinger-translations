    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger wishes Blarer a good new year, even if it begins so poorly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger received Blarer's letter [No. 2731] with sadness. It shows how little the Gospel is valued. And this council that the papal Emperor [Charles V] wants to convene! This would only lead to the denial of faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger comforts himself with the thought that the people of Constance will risk everything before accepting such peace terms. Even before the war, nothing else was expected of them. Given the importance of Blarer's message, Bullinger immediately informed the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater]. He was appalled by the unreliability of the [Protestant] cities [of Southern Germany]. Consequently, he convened the [former] mayor [Johannes] Haab and the three trustworthy and pious chief masters Georg Müller, [Itelhans] Thumysen, and [Hans] Wegmann. After a lengthy consultation, the mayor informed Bullinger that Müller would ride to Stein am Rhein on Sunday [January 2, 1547], under the pretext of visiting the local steward [Hans Zubler] as the chairman of the church properties. To avoid arousing suspicion, Konrad Zwick should stop at an inn in Stein on Sunday noon. Then Müller and Zwick will seriously discuss the matter. Müller is a trustworthy person, on whom Zwick can rely as much as on Bullinger himself (who unfortunately cannot come).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The people of Constance should risk their lives for [God's] covenant and the fatherland like pious Christians and not be intimidated!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The messenger [...] leaves Zurich at five o'clock in the afternoon. Bullinger asked him to travel through the night by moonlight so that he would arrive in Constance around 4 o'clock in the afternoon on New Year's Day. Bullinger justified his request by making the messenger understand that Blarer urgently needed to know something. He spent 12 Constance batzen for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Just now Müller passes by. He sends word to Zwick that he will ride to Winterthur on New Year's Day and arrive in Stein around noon the following day to wait for Zwick. Once Zwick has arrived, Müller will send him a messenger and invite him to a meal. Zwick should decline the invitation, stating that he has too much to do and must leave soon. Then Müller will send a second messenger to say that he too will leave soon and wants to eat quickly; whereupon Zwick should agree. This way, the meeting will not appear suspicious to anyone. God will turn everything for the best and will not abandon His own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] In haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] The mayors [Lavater and Haab] send their regards to Blarer and his cousin [Zwick].</p>

      <p>May the almighty, eternal God grant you and us a prosperous good year, even though its beginning seems so rough to us! May God have mercy on us!</p>

      <p>I received your faithful, friendly letter with sorrow and great distress, because I see how there is no Gospel among the people. Oh, the council that the papal Emperor [Charles V] is convening! To place religion on such a council is to deny it entirely! Eventus probabit (The outcome will prove it).</p>

      <p>Regarding you, I still have the comfort that you will do everything you can before accepting such conditions. Even before the war, nothing more was demanded, etc. And since this matter is dear to you and us, indeed it concerns soul and honor much more, I have immediately informed my lord mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] of your letter. He was somewhat appalled by it, as he always considered the cities to be more reliable. Consequently, he convened the former mayor [Johannes] Haab and the three chief masters, Mr. Georg Müller, Mr. Thumysen, and Mr. Wegmann. They are all, by the grace of God, faithful, sincere, and truly pious, of one mind and heart. He confidentially presented them with a summary of your letter, upon which they deliberated for a long time. Then my lord summoned me. He instructed me to thank you most sincerely and to inform you that this matter has deeply touched my lords. They have deemed it good that now on Sunday at noon, your chief master, Mr. Georg Müller, who will ride out tomorrow, will arrive in Stein as a representative of the church properties, as if to deal with the steward. There is your friendly request that C[onrad] Z[wick] come there, so that he too may arrive at an inn in Stein at noon to avoid suspicion. Mr. Georg will arrange to meet him and has spoken sufficiently. Therefore, I beg you for God's sake that Conrad Zwick does not stay away. Mr. Müller is such an upright, fervent friend of God and such an honest man as we have here. He can trust him as much as if I were with him myself. The matter cannot wait. It was not possible for me to come.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Act like faithful, devout Christians who place their lives and love for the covenant and fatherland! Do not let yourselves be intimidated! Let us call upon God from the heart!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I prepared the messenger last night and now at 5 o'clock at night. I asked him to travel by moonlight. He was willing. I gave him 12 Constance batzen. He said: "Mr. Ambrosius writes to me, asking to learn something through me. It is almost too late. But if you are in Constance tomorrow on New Year's Day at 4 or before night, it is early enough." I write this so that you know how to prepare for the messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>And just as I wrote this, Mr. Georg himself comes and says: "Write to Mr. Conrad, I will ride to Winterthur tomorrow. At noon on Sunday, God willing, I will be in Stein. So he should ride early on Sunday, so that he arrives around 12. Then I will be aware of him. And when he then rides to the inn, I will send him a messenger to come to me and eat with me; I have just arrived too. He should decline, saying: due to business he cannot; thank him very much; must leave again. Then he will send another messenger and ask, as he too wants to leave soon and eat quickly. Then he should come." Taking care that no one will suspect anything. God will arrange it well, for I know that He will not abandon us.</p>
