      <p>This morning, right after the sermon, Mr. Charles spoke to me, saying that letters had come to the envoy, which had greatly cheered him; but he did not know the content of the letters. However, from the subsequent events, it is quite clear: it has been decided to recall the captains and to recruit a separate regiment of soldiers. He insists again and persistently that it is not about religion, and this should be evident to us because the religious themselves, the people of Schaffhausen [Swiss], Basel, Appenzell, and others, are sending their soldiers. Mr. Charles eagerly wonders if this is the case, if they are indeed departing. He also wishes to be informed by you and, if there is any certainty, to be told. I beg you, my revered lord, if you have a moment of leisure, to spare a single minute. The envoy is very displeased with our sermons.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, the immortal glory of the entire world. November 4, 1567. Chur.</p>

      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Bullinger, pastor in Zurich.</p>
