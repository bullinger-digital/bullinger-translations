      <p>Dear son, I am sending you a letter with the intention that you, at a suitable time, when you think it is appropriate, give it to my dear, kind young lord of Ulm to read; not that you say: my father sent me the letter to give it to you to read, but rather say: My dear father has written something to me and instructed me to speak with you about it verbally; however, since I am not so fluent, I want to give you the letter to read yourself, which he wrote to me, and give it to him to read.</p>
      <p>Add your words to it and also ask him to give a generous gift to the poor brother; he can well afford it and now has only one child.</p>
      <p>If you can do anything with the lady, then also ask her faithfully and write back to me what he answered. I also desire from you that you send back the letter I sent you, after the young lord has read it, or that you copy it, which concerns Mr. Hansen, from there: "My dear father, noble, steadfast young lord" etc. until: "also know that I" etc.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Mr. Hans also gave me this sealed letter to deliver to you; I cannot know what he writes to you. However, I have understood well from him that he does not want the letter he wrote to you here to be read by the brother, young lord Hansen. Do your best in this matter. God be with you. All our people greet you, etc.</p>
      <p>From France and elsewhere I have much news, but I do not want to write more; consider it good. Dated as below or above.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor and servant of the church in Berg.</p>
