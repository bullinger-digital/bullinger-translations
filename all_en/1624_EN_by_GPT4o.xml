      <p>Greetings. I wrote to Viret about the distribution of the French copies. He replied with these words: "I met here a bookseller, whom we have, a man of German nationality and of proven integrity, who has lived with us for a long time and is approved by the testimony of all good people, regarding the books of Mr. Bullinger, about which you wrote to me. He promises all his effort and faithfulness, if he can do anything in this matter; because he is poor and there is not a great influx of merchants buying books here, he cannot undertake the distribution as a merchant who would take care of them at his own risk, because he does not have the present money; but if the books are sent, he will gladly take care of their distribution with the same faithfulness as he does his own."</p>
      <p>We also wrote to the booksellers in Geneva, who will be able to do this much more conveniently; when we receive a response, we will inform you." This is what he said, which I wanted to write to you word for word, so that you can better understand what hope there is in this matter and explain it to Gessner. If I hear the response from the Genevans, I will also inform you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, nothing new. I received yours along with the booklet by Mr. Negelin; I presented it to him, and he expresses great thanks and sends you many greetings, as does Mr. Johannes Rudolf von Erlach, the treasurer, Hagius, and others. Yesterday, a messenger from our lords came from the Mauritian camp, who left on the 17th; however, Ulm had not yet surrendered, but there was hope.</p>
      <p>He says the princes are having a meeting in Linz; Maurice is there, and Ferdinand is also supposed to come there; but I can hardly believe it, unless there is a great betrayal. If you learn what response has been given to our Cantons, please let us know. Lindau, having rejected the Interim, voluntarily accepted the gospel; may the Lord preserve them! I fear that Musculus may be taken away from us again; he could easily be retained, but his wife is already preparing to leave and cannot be persuaded by any means to stay.</p>
      <p>This is written hastily, because a convenient messenger was at hand. I cannot bathe with you in Urdorf now due to many other tasks, and because it seems unwise to be away from the city for long in these times. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Our people send you greetings; may all yours be safe. Bern, April 25, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
