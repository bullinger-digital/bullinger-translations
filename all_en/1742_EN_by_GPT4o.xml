      <p>To the most beloved and learned doctor, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, Charles du Moulin, a jurist, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>While I was staying with Lord Maurus Musaeus, the envoy of the King of the French to the Swiss in Basel, he showed me your letters to him at the beginning of August, in which you expressed that you had read my book against the abuses of the Roman court and the popes with great pleasure, and you also sent your greetings to me. I was certainly very pleased, as I had benefited from your holy books, both on the Origin of Error and on the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles of Paul, in Paris. But to have been mentioned by name in your register was a great honor and joy for me. Since then, I have wanted to write to you, but partly there was no one to deliver the letters, and partly I was hurrying to revise the same book and to give it to Michael Isingrin with not a small and sharp addition (whom, as I heard he had completed it, I wrote to him to give or send one to you in my name, which I ask you to accept as a memorial) to be printed, with the French parts indeed made into Latin for the benefit of the Germans. After completing this before the end of August and handing it over to the printer in the presence of the most illustrious and learned jurist, Lord Bonifacius Amerbach, who often assisted me most courteously and amicably, I departed. At the beginning of July, the prefects, consuls, rector, and professors of Basel received me most kindly and honorably (a favor that will never fade from my memory) and chose a place for me at Grynaeus's, so that I would not have to stay longer in the inn, where I would have gone if Lord Maurus, the envoy, had not arrived and received me into his home, where, remembering our old friendship and services, since he had heard most of the documents of law and practice from me twenty years ago, he treated me most liberally and splendidly as a brother. But I am of the mind that I would rather have less than abuse the kindness of friends. For I considered it known in the court and in France that I had been staying with the envoy for a month and a half, and indeed without offense: but henceforth perhaps some envy might be cast upon the aforementioned envoy by the King of France, the cardinals, and his papists, if I stayed with him longer. Not so much because of the new papist envoy, urging with the Sorbonnists against me to decree and act by law, as because of the revised and more sharply augmented book: lest they should slander the envoy that he was supporting me in these matters and that worse things were done and published by me in his house. However, I did not tell this reason to Lord Maurus, but another which was also true, namely that it was worthwhile to secretly head to Paris to consult on family and domestic matters. So suddenly, having been informed of the conspiracy of the cardinals, I had to leave, so that it was necessary to omit a prepared lunch with friends. Thus, at the end of August, by the same route I had come, now less safe, through Switzerland, Lausanne, Geneva, I was quickly transported to Paris, entering my home alone at night (leaving the horses at the inn, so that I could withdraw if by chance the house was occupied) unexpectedly, I found everything disturbed and growing in danger. My wife, having hidden the rumors in various places, was expecting the bailiffs to break in. For she had heard that the king, at the urging of the papist envoy, the Sorbonnists, and Cardinal Lorraine, now most hostile to me, and also Bruslard with his advocates having been heard, had referred the matter, which had been called to him in May, back to the Parisian senate, and had ordered proceedings against me in the manner of criminals. It was in mind, at least having sold a quarter of the goods, to take my wife and three children with part of the books away: but it was utterly impossible.</p>
      <p>For it would not have been allowed to sell even a palm's breadth of land, and much less of other revenues. As for the movables, as the matter stood, a thousand livres could not have been elicited. My only daughter, suffering from fever, could not be moved even if it had been allowed. Nor could the family's exit be concealed in that situation, and everything would have been more open to plunder. I set aside only a third of the books to be sent to me as soon as possible, along with my writings, for the correction of the law and on the Customs, which had already been transferred to another house to be safer. Friends announced that my arrival in the city had become known to the adversaries, and that spies were patrolling the streets near the house at dawn and night.</p>
      <p>Changing clothes, I left the house alone at noon, mounted the horses outside the gate, and returned, indeed hurrying for two days: but on the third day, the fever, which I had contracted in Paris, afflicted me so much while riding that I was forced to lie down for four days in a certain castle apart from the journey. And thereafter, riding for one or two days (having to rest for two or three), I was received apart from the inn in the houses of friends, even those I had never known before, who treated me most courteously in favor of the gospel. I had known many in France who favored the word of God, but on this last return, I recognized many others.</p>
      <p>So much so that France, by the grace of God, is almost everywhere sprinkled with Christians, both from the nobility in the countryside and from the prefects of justice and more honorable citizens in the towns. Many offered me remote and safe places and camps, so that I could spend the winter there with my books due to my adverse health.</p>
      <p>But I did not want to, not out of fear of enemies, but to execute the decision with friends in Paris, namely to head to you and your most learned and humane men in Zürich. I found in Lyon, in the midst of enemies (namely Cardinal Tournon, Matthaeus Ory the inquisitor, from whom, or his deputy, I had appealed as from an abuse, because he was ordered by the pope and his consistory to write against me) and also the clergy who soon took me from the inn to another house. And on the third day (for in the meantime I had to use doctors) before dawn, they sent me to the banks with one or another boat a league from the city, where, having found horses, I came here on the third day. Friends from Lyon also wrote letters to you and other excellent men in Zürich, which they gave to a citizen of Schaffhausen who was soon to follow me to Zürich. But I, enticed by friends here and deterred by the distance of the journey and the air, feared to go there not only because of the recent health from which the Lord also delivered me on the journey itself, but more because of the triple winter, namely of age (for I have now passed the fifty-first year), place, and time. If I had still been in August or mid-September, I would have certainly gone to Zürich, and the desire to see and greet you would have been urgent enough and a just cause for me. But on the day that German was departing from here, seeing the impending winter rain, I feared that I might again fall into ill health due to the long journey, a loss of time always dear to me, but now most dear. For only a few years of vigorous age and senses remain for me, but fleeting, as Horace says: which therefore must be cared for more sparingly, and the more so as I have decided to devote them to helping the church and, if necessary, refuting enemies and publishing books.</p>
      <p>For thirty whole years I had practiced the office of advocacy in Paris when the papist war against me broke out there.</p>
      <p>I published many books both on Customs and forensic style and on Law. To these, I finally wished to serve not only the external but much more the Christian republic. Therefore, having seized the opportunity of the war undertaken by Henry II against Julius III, I wrote and published throughout France, Against the Abuses of the Roman Court and the Popes, much more effectively than I had thought, with the Lord giving increase and blessing my labor with afflictions. For nowhere in France was a book more accepted, nor more eagerly bought or read, even by those who were held by papist errors, except only by the pope's conspirators. The first attack was at the end of March.</p>
      <p>Called, I immediately appeared before the king's advocates, incited by the Sorbonne, which had given them the book with fierce complaints, and I acknowledged it. Asked (for they acknowledged that they had been my disciples and showed me as much deference as they could) to retract the French letter to appease Lysetus, who was clamoring against his book, I refused, saying I wanted it to be read by the king. But the king had already heard it in the camp, through the work and diligence of that envoy from his side, who, returning to Rome, was incited by the hostile clergy to me in Lyon (for I had been an advocate for the poor and the hospital of Lyon against that rich clergy, which cause, as it greatly burned them with avarice, so it made them most hostile to me, and they threatened to lay traps for my books, which they diligently did; otherwise, the book would have been examined or sold three or four times before the enemies had awakened) had sent a copy of the book with fierce complaints to the king, who, initially irritated, was pacified upon hearing the French letter, as one who was in that council of the king informed me. Returning to the royal advocates, I added that I had not seen Lysetus's book, and if he had written badly, it was for him to eat his own words. Again, they warned that the Sorbonne was very irritated: therefore, it was necessary to approach them and remove some articles they had noted from the book or otherwise agree with them to placate them, otherwise, they would attack most persistently, and at the very least, they would bring me into a negative opinion towards the king, who was timid and superstitious (as one of them spoke), and consequently, I would lose the favor I had acquired with the king and the nobles, and the hope of future honors and dignities. I refused to approach the Sorbonnists or to retract anything for their favor or hostility: but if they had any reasons, they should give them, and if they were valid, I would correct myself at my own expense and gladly profess to have learned from them; otherwise, I offered myself to public disputation. Moreover, I would prefer the truth to all favor and hatred, even royal, and it was clear that the adversaries themselves were seditious and enemies of the king, as they were trying to detract from his power legitimately asserted by me with their tricks and deceptions. Thus I was dismissed, after one of the royal advocates separately, but in the presence of three or four, said that he had read the book corrected by Maillard the Sorbonist and found it true and Christian in his judgment and odious only to the superstitious. In the following April, I had peace, with almost all the advocates and the greater part of the senate applauding. Meanwhile, the book was being eagerly bought and read everywhere; but the impious and inveterate heads of the Sorbonne were tormented, laboring everywhere and not succeeding; for they found no favor against me with the king in the court nor with the senate, but only with Cardinal Bourbon, whom the king had appointed as pro-regent in Paris. Meanwhile, however, they often approached and disturbed the senate with great and hostile clamor, but only with furious clamor. Ordered to state the articles they considered heretical, they shouted that the whole book was more than pernicious, heretical, and should be burned with its author. Ordered by two decrees given in their presence to give the erroneous and heretical articles specifically, and in the meantime forbidden to clamor in general and to attempt anything, they refused to comply. For they say they are in this matter not subjects of the king or the senate, but only of the pope, and not without reason, since they are handling his business alone.</p>
      <p>However, there were a few from their college who agreed with me. I heard from a certain senator, who said he had seen and heard, that when in April, in the second meeting, the Sorbonnists came in great numbers, about thirty (for they had been accused of being only six or seven clamoring), there were three who openly said they had read the book and found it good, true, and useful, while the rest of the crowd vociferated the opposite. At the beginning of May, relying on the favor and protection of Cardinal Bourbon, the pro-regent, contrary to what was provided by two decrees and without giving the articles specifically as they were ordered, they began to rage rabidly against me and the book in their sermons, attempting to incite the people to sedition, because I was still walking in the forum, because I seemed to go through the streets, that either they or I should be burned, the people being filled with these clamor, they had me personally cited on the tenth of May as already defamed and suspected before one of their college and faction acting as deputy of the said Ory, the inquisitor of faith. Publicly cited at the steps of the palace, I had my response and appeal as from an abuse to the king publicly written, rescuing the citer from the palace scribes, lest he be torn apart, and the same hour late I returned home, entering the house of Cardinal Bourbon, to know what his mind was. He came to meet me in the garden, speaking most familiarly and kindly, even excusing what I had written more sharply. But he was hunting for this, that, just as in those things which were of law and my profession, he made me a judge as an expert in that matter, so I should allow the Sorbonnists (in those things which concern theology) to be judges as experts in that matter; at least I should let them decide and not respond to them in theological matters, promising in the faith of a prince that everything would be safe and intact for me.</p>
      <p>But I said that I had satisfied the royal advocates about this matter a month and a half ago, namely to yield to reasons if valid ones were offered, otherwise to undergo public disputation. He pressed whether I considered the Sorbonnists judges and experts in their art. I conceded, so that not as to me or any advocate in my art, to whom even a petty judge is not bound to adhere, indeed even the least advocate can contradict or any cobbler can despise. While he began to grow angry, I soothed him, saying: "You are a prince and pro-regent, and by both names, you are bound to defend me, because I am defending the rights of the king and the crown." He replied: "Indeed I am a prince and I love the king, but I love the church much more, the church, I say, through which kings reign."</p>
      <p>Then I: "The crown of France does not depend on the Roman church" and saying this, I called the crowd to approach and hear. Then he, leaving me, rushed away angry and threatening. The crowd reproached me for daring to call witnesses against a prince.</p>
      <p>I replied: "Do you not see what kind of pro-regent we have, who loves the pope, the king's enemy, more than the king himself?" At the same time, I was seeking an occasion so that he, as suspect, could no longer interpose his parts. Someone from the crowd said I should not have spoken of serious matters with such a person after dinner. I left them, saying: "God and truth will protect me." The next day, having spoken with Chancellor Olivier and others of the strict council, they said it seemed I had spoken a little too freely, but nevertheless, the cardinal was pacified and there was no danger. But feeling the secular arm (as they call it), granted to the said inquisitor because I had not appeared nor acknowledged such a judge and (notwithstanding my appeal) granted, I approached the Cathalans before the regent queen on the ides of May, heard. I had as an antagonist a Sorbonnist bringing accusations, which I openly refuted one by one even more freely and sharply than I had written. Among other things, I was accused of having written that the decretals were erroneous; I added and showed them to be heretical, etc. With many standing by and the queen kindly listening, who, having received the petition (in which I requested that everything be referred to the king himself), presided on the fourth day in council, and I obtained whatever I requested, my appeal was called, all judges whether papal or episcopal or secular (as they call them) and the senate itself were interdicted, reserved for the king himself upon his return and instructed with cognition, also added that I should not be molested in the meantime nor my family either on account of the contents of the book or otherwise for the sake of religion. While these things were being done, I had given a booklet to be printed in Paris in the cause of the Landgrave of Hesse. In which, incidentally, but openly, I defend the Protestant religion, and I specifically mention and praise the faith and constancy of the Duke of Saxony. This booklet began to be sold and circulated through the middle of the palace while I was with the Cathalans. When some Sorbonnists, soliciting against me, heard this, without inspecting the matter, they ran to their cardinal and burst in while he was dining, shouting that his authority was being disregarded, that the impious book against abuses was being sold openly contrary to his orders. He referred it to Bruslard; they said they were being neglected by him (since the senate, in the meantime, did not want to decree anything against me, having gone to the king), Bruslard was also called from dinner and rebuked by the cardinal. He said he had taken care that it should not be sold, he was convicted by the testimony of the Sorbonnists, who testified that they had seen and heard that book being sold openly. Officers were sent, it was found to be another new and small booklet, but one that stung more openly, if they had inspected it. Having returned, I immediately had the royal program announced to the inquisitor, the Sorbonnists, and the senate; Cardinal Bourbon fumed and threatened that he would at least throw me into custody until the king's arrival.</p>
      <p>Warned by friends, some of whom are around him, I withdrew to twelve or fifteen French leagues in the houses of Christian nobles for fifteen days. Meanwhile, my wife again sent to the court and received letters signed by the hand of the queen and Margaret of France, and thus that cardinal was silent. So I returned and for another fifteen days I was frequent in the palace as usual, with everyone congratulating me, until Cardinal Lorraine, saying he had the king's ring, persuaded the Sorbonnists to obey the senate's decrees by giving articles against me specifically. Although in the senate, whenever it was forced, not only the saner but also the greater part stood with me, so that some of the presidents not only openly praised but also judged me worthy of great honor and the office of president for that work, yet, since it was being conducted out of order, as against a criminal, the senate was not convened, but only a few selected, unlearned, bloodthirsty were called, through whom they wanted my appeal to be judged and by the articles of the Sorbonne to be condemned to the fire and that to be completed in three days, so that the king (if the Germans complained) could claim he was unaware. Warned both by some from the Sorbonne, to whom what they were doing was displeasing, and by some senators, even by the royal advocates themselves, who now calling me, now approaching with dire threats, saying it was necessary for them to conclude with fire if I even slightly dissented from the Sorbonnists, they sufficiently indicated the present danger, but in such a short time that, unable to consult on domestic matters, I came to Basel by a great journey through Lorraine. Immediately I wrote to the king, queen, constable, and others the reason for my departure, offering myself to public disputation upon the king's return. I sent that booklet dedicated to the firstborn of the Landgrave through a Basel officer to the camp. For I hoped that the princes of Germany would assist my cause, as they would have done, if the matter had not fallen otherwise with the king having a nefarious alliance with both Antichrists by the counsel of Cardinal Lorraine and the constable. Indeed, in the very first council of the king, the Cathalans said to me that the leaders of the council had victory in their hands if the cardinals were absent or did not possess the king. However, by incautiously favoring me, they harmed me, making me too secure, both by the favor of the queen and their own, so that I could not foresee the latent danger before it threatened my head.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, if I had foreseen that I would not obtain a public disputation, having sold part of the goods early, I would have taken the family out together. Now I am deprived not only of the family, not only of the exercise of advocacy, which could now be a solace for labors, but also of goods. Nor does it matter to me if I may enjoy a third of the books recently selected in Paris, so that I may spend the remaining years of fleeting age in the service of the church.</p>
      <p>Indeed, many safe and remote camps in France have been offered to me, so that I could philosophize for myself at no expense.</p>
      <p>But I preferred to act even more remotely at the expense of my wife and children than to interrupt the fight I had undertaken.</p>
      <p>You have a too long tragedy. But for you, who have such candor and perpetual zeal in promoting the church, to whom it is most delightful to read a longer book, as it contains many things pertaining to soothe and awaken the French, it will not be unpleasant to read these things. Recently I wrote to the princes and consuls of Bern, revealing my intention to complete and publish the correction of Civil Law, begun many years ago: if they give a place in Lausanne, I want no stipends, but only simple habitation, at least for four or five years. I do not know if they will decide anything. The matter is more serious and useful than they think. Unless I feared to interrupt your serious matters with the prolixity of writing, I would add reasons by which you might also interpose your authority with the Bernese for this. Your republic is more worthy of this splendor than any of the monarchies of these ages. While I hurry, there is no time to remember if I wrote to the Bernese about the work of depicting all papal and papist councils' decrees in French, Latin, and German, a work begun but requiring free leisure. I am ashamed to pour out my own things, fearing lest I seem to seek others' while I seek an occasion to pour out everything once. But so that you may understand why I seek the favor of the Bernese without their loss, a simple pretext of their favor will profit me more than five hundred annually. For thus it will happen that the treasury will not seize the remaining goods and thus the family can not only be fed but also supply me, and gradually arrange things so that it can be transferred here, unless the gospel emerges there: otherwise, the family is oppressed and I am reduced to extreme servitude by the census. Farewell, most esteemed doctor and teacher, and always inscribe me in your register. Geneva, October 14, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Charles du Moulin, J.P. Having written these, I received letters from friends in France, that it was over for the family if it became known to the court that I was staying in Geneva, and that it was already known in Paris: wherefore the family is in great trepidation. Moved by these, I immediately came to Lausanne, where I was received in the home of Francis Hotman, a learned jurist who also gave a suitable place for studies and books. Therefore, I wrote to the most excellent doctor Lord Wolfgang Musculus, and to the most honorable men Nicolaus Zerchintem and Peter Giron in Bern, that I do not need habitation but simple favor, by which they might receive me as an advocate or counselor or otherwise from their own without any stipends, if they also wished to support my studies destined to help the church in this part.</p>
      <p>I desire to be commended to the venerable father Lord Conrad Pellican, Lord Bibliander, the very learned and multilingual, and Lord Gualter, who visited me in Basel in July, whom the blessed memory Lord Oswald Myconius, the true and holy bishop of the Basel church, called his son (as I heard from him).</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>From Charles du Moulin of France, a jurist of Paris.</p>
