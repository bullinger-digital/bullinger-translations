      <p>What has transpired in these days, you will learn from the records. I fear that new troubles are being stirred up in the Engadin, as they are very angry with the judges, accusing them of being only interested in money and not treating some with the dignity they deserve, etc. - Mr. Campell gave me 4 copies of the prodigy, and you acted very wisely in removing both the name Planta and the mention of bloody tongues; for the adversaries are not yet satisfied, and they are also displeased that the mention of the syndics of the Three Leagues is made right at the beginning of the description. But who could please everyone? - Today, the royal envoy is expected. I would have liked to attend your synod; but at this time it was not possible.</p>
      <p>I will come unexpectedly and I want my departure to be kept secret. - Few remain who are to be observed in these days, unless the troubles in the Engadin stir something up. 1572, May 6.</p>
