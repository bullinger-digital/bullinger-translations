      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Giovanni Beccaria sends greetings through Jesus Christ, the only redeemer.</p>
      <p>Although I had nothing specific to write to you, most illustrious man, I did not want to neglect my duty of greeting you through letters, by which you may at least understand that I have engraved the memory of your name so deeply in my heart that I contemplate you as if present, night and day. If I did not do this, I could justly be counted among those in whom bestowed benefits are said to have been lost. May it never be that anyone could truly accuse me of such a great crime. Although I am not able to return thanks worthy in reality, who prevents me from doing and owing it?</p>
      <p>There is one thing I do not know, whether I should grieve more or rejoice, that I am so overwhelmed by your services to me that even my mind cannot grasp how to repay them. However it may be, I rejoice that I am here conquered by you, and it will never shame me to proclaim this to everyone and everywhere. Why should I not rejoice, unless I am completely devoid of sense, to be overcome by him to whom it is as disgraceful to resist as it is beautiful and honorable to yield? Bear with me, I beg you, most upright man, bear with me, I say, as I speak the truth about you, and would that I might someday be able to proclaim your praises as eloquently among wise and honorable men as there are many good qualities in you, both of body and mind, with which you honor not only the city of Zürich but also our age. Thanks be to God, who perfects the work begun in you every day to His own glory! But why do I dwell longer on these matters beyond my intention, since I have proposed to greet and inform you of the state of my affairs? They are indeed in the best condition through the mercy of Almighty God. For as soon as I arrived in this valley, the order of priests began to fear for themselves, as if a deadly enemy had invaded their kingdom with countless troops, and they soon stirred up a crowd against me and did not rest until they had obtained from the superstitious old men that I be expelled from there, as if I had brought heretical doctrine to them. Therefore, having been expelled from the town (which they call Roveredo), I came here, whence I had previously traveled, having come here at the call of the Lord, to build upon the foundation of Christ according to the grace given to me by God.</p>
      <p>For here there are many from whom all the inventions of the papists are so banished that the profane mass has now contracted a deplorable condition, from which it can scarcely ever recover. I wanted to inform you of this, partly so that you may understand that from this place a path can be laid to Italy, since this region is at the very gates of Italy, and partly so that, when you see that I am called by the Lord to this task, you may not hesitate to act with your most upright councilor, so that in the next assembly a return to my homeland may be granted to me, unless I am completely allowed to safely and freely defend what I believe in matters of religion. For the people of Locarno, as I see, will leave nothing untried to have me live among them. Although their affection according to the flesh is not to be despised, it must nevertheless be directed according to the rule of the divine word, namely, that they patiently hear that saying of our Savior: "I must preach the gospel to other cities also."</p>
      <p>Therefore, unless a return is granted to me with religion preserved in every respect (which I now consider not only difficult but also impossible), I wish to prohibit your most distinguished councilor along with the other evangelicals from deciding anything for me, lest I perhaps obtain poison (as they say) instead of a remedy. All these things you will manage according to your wisdom better than I can achieve in writing, so that you may use the gifts divinely received for the benefit of all the brothers. As you do this most diligently, so will He, whose business you are conducting, repay you most abundantly.</p>
      <p>I would like to receive from you a copy of the disputation that Peter Martyr had in England on the matter of the Eucharist; for here it is trampled upon by the other trifles of the papists everywhere. Greet the most upright and distinguished men, the councilors and the chief scribe, in my name, to whom you will add your family along with the most learned and pious men, Mr. Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, Otto, Gesner, Frisius, and all the fellow members in Zürich, to whom may Almighty God increase the gifts of His Spirit daily, so that they may confound in reality those who oppose evangelical truth, which they teach in words. Amen.</p>
      <p>Although I have written to Mr. Lelio about the new Antichrist, I will not be silent with you that he has long been ill-spoken of among many for his masculine love; you can infer the rest from such a crime. Farewell, my father, and command, if there is anything in which you need my service. Misox, the day before the calends of March 1550.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zürich, his friend to be respected for many reasons.</p>
