    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to the delayed inquiry about how he would respond to an appointment at a Zurich school; has been hoping for his recall for nine years, which was assured to him multiple times by Heinrich Utinger through letters after his departure, which was forced by poverty; his old connection to Zurich has made it difficult for him to live outside the Confederation, but for a return, an appropriate position would need to be available, and he also has to observe a three-month notice period. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I received your letter, most kind sir, but perhaps later than you had hoped, and certainly later than I would have liked. And since you wish to be informed of what my response would be if I were ever called by you to take up a teaching position at your school, I will say briefly and promptly that I have been waiting with great desire for nine continuous years for the time when I would be recalled by you, from whom I once departed driven by poverty. This was promised and confirmed to me as I was leaving, with great assurance, in a public document sealed with the seal of your (indeed, also our) college, and this hope was also shown to me in two or three letters from Heinrich Utinger, a man not to be named without a title of honor. Therefore, most sincere man and singular patron of the learned, know that I will not refuse if a somewhat tolerable condition is offered to me by you. For although I have lacked nothing here so far, neither in terms of the splendor of life nor in terms of sustenance, yet that long-standing association and the labors (which indeed unite the minds of men no less than kinship) endured at home and in the field have made me so much yours that from that time living outside of Switzerland has not been sweet. But as I neither aspire to nor will undertake anything lofty and beyond the measure of my ability, so I wish to be excused from being called to some menial or non-literary function; but about this, you (as I know) will decide better than what is necessary to write. I also wish to remind you that, according to the agreement, I cannot leave here unless I inform my lords of my departure in advance and resign from my position, so that they have time to look for another suitable schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your entire family. Please convey my greetings to Pellicanus, Megander, Theodor, and all the men of your college, my lords and patrons, whom I wish to be very well. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Kempten, on the 13th day of October in the year 1542. Your Benedict Euander.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, a man adorned in every way, the primary bishop of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
