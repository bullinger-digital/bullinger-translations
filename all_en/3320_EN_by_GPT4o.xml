      <p>Highly learned, Christian, dear lord and fellow brother in the truth of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>In these last days, out of pure grace of God, dear Lord Bullinger, it has been revealed again, may you understand everything that I, with love and service, can do to promote the truth of Christ and to hinder the lies of the Antichrist, with all my heart ready. I have received your two letters from June 24 and August 8, the first one through your son Christoph. You often do not need to ask or thank, if I can do for him what pleases him, he should indicate, and he will find me willing.</p>
      <p>He is a fine, modest young man, and should conduct himself well; may God the Lord grant him His grace. You will already know how the King of England has overtaken and defeated the King of France, captured the constable and other lords, then stormed Saint Quentin, and finally also took the castle of Ch√¢telet on September 6; where he will go from here, we shall hear. The King of France also does not rest, strengthening himself bravely with Swiss and other troops in the empire, so that he might hold Paris and Lyon against force.</p>
      <p>It is to be considered that it might come to a peace; for neither side will be able to endure the great costs for long, as they have already waged much war and taxed their lands. The talks in Worms are nothing but verbum honoris (word of honor), to delay matters, in case a suitable time comes when one might be able to act forcefully and not have to deal with the matter, to spread the truth of Jesus Christ with force and to hold it powerfully with an incision as in Spain. The Lord often has these plans, can still break them, preserve His truth in the hearts of His believers. Therefore, dear lord, we should cry out to the Lord for help, pray that He will not let His word be taken from us or suppressed, which we believe in; I ask from the heart.</p>
      <p>Your honorable wife and yours I, along with mine, greet warmly. Thus, you know from all of us as well.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God grant you and us His grace for a long time and after this miserable life, eternal life. Given in Augsburg on the 17th day of September 1557.</p>
      <p>Your always willing in the Lord Christ, Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of God in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
