      <p>Greetings. My dearest wife, my dearest Bullinger, in utmost patience and no less faith, returned her soul to God today between five and six, bid farewell to you and yours in the Lord, and commended me and all mine to you. She was very grateful to you and the excellent man Zwingli for yesterday's visit. Tomorrow, she will be taken care of through burial. My sons and I pray that another may be appointed in place of my son to perform the divine services in Schwamendingen, so that he is not forced to be absent from his dearest mother's burial. Farewell, always happy.</p>
      <p>From HÃ¶ngg, the penultimate day of May, in the year 50. Johannes Hug, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Dear son, I beg you to preach tomorrow in Schwamendingen.</p>
