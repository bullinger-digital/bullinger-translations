    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is thanked for sending Engelbert Milander to Aarau! This is entirely in line with his accommodating nature. Dean Johannes Zehnder, [city clerk] Gabriel [Meyer], and the other [councilmen] also thank Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] However, [Niklaus] Ryhiner has caused confusion in this matter! As Bullinger knows, Aarau has an Aarau citizen [Ulrich Trog] as a schoolmaster. However, it is hoped that he will soon be appointed to a preacher position, which has not yet happened, so the position of schoolmaster is neither vacant nor has the somewhat conceited Ryhiner (who attended the council meeting where the position change was discussed) been commissioned to discuss the succession of the schoolmaster with Bullinger. The people of Aarau were very annoyed with Ryhiner: Bullinger was bothered in vain, and Milander came to Aarau in vain (to whom nothing can be promised), which Ryhiner now also regrets! Bullinger should not take offense at the return of Milander and should not feel exposed. When the Bernese have appointed the schoolmaster as a parish assistant, efforts will be made in Aarau to effect the appointment of Milander, but nothing can be promised, especially since (as Bullinger well knows) the uneducated populace will ultimately decide! And often, the very people one least wants are chosen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should continue to support the people of Aarau so that they feel gratefully connected to him. God, who may keep him alive for a long time, will ensure his reward.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Hochholzer is dismayed by the news from Augsburg. It is hard to believe that others are in such a bad state while the Swiss, living in safety, do not feel affected at all! Surely God will punish them harshly for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Hochholzer and his family are otherwise well. He will soon come to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also from Gabriel Meyer, Johannes Zehnder, and from Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf]. Bullinger should also send greetings to his family, Rudolf Gwalther, and everyone else. In haste, as Milander wants to return to Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. That you sent this Engelbert to us, esteemed lord, you do according to your usual kindness and faithfulness, with which you strive to benefit everyone! Therefore, we, Dean Johannes Zehnder, Master Gabriel Meyer, and I, along with the others, give you and Lord Rudolf Gwalther our greatest thanks.</p>

      <p>However, the situation is different than Ryhiner might have indicated: We have a schoolmaster, a citizen of Aarau (as you know). He has not yet been called elsewhere and cannot be conveniently dismissed now. We hope, however, that he will be called to the office of preaching the gospel. Once he has been called, then it will be possible to consider another. No one had entrusted Ryhiner with this matter. Therefore, we were displeased that he bothered you and that this good Milander came to us in vain, as we have nothing certain to promise. Therefore, because we do not accept him nor promise him anything, we earnestly ask you not to take it badly nor think yourself deceived, nor consider that he has not yet been accepted for any other reason than that another is still present, and no one knows that Ryhiner acted in such a way. He himself regrets having sent him in vain. Sometimes, as an arrogant man, he tends to attribute much to himself. Recently, indeed, while we were deliberating about the school and other church matters, we mentioned the schoolmaster, hoping he would become our deacon. If that happened, then it would be necessary to have (with the help of the Zurichers or other learned men) a pious, faithful, learned, and sincere person. Hence, Ryhiner asked you, if you knew of such a person, to inform us. But when our schoolmaster is called by the lords of Bern, then we will ensure, as much as we can, that he is called here, although I dare not promise anything certain. For you have long known what happens when the uneducated populace calls with their votes; for the most part, those are chosen whom we would least want.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In the meantime, we nonetheless ask you, if ever we need your help, as you have always done so far, to continue not to deny it. Thus, you will bind us and our entire church to you, which, since we cannot repay with benefits, we will nonetheless intercede with God, the best and greatest, the rewarder of all good, with pious prayers, that he may return a worthy reward for your benefits with his abundant and infinite goodness and keep your kindness safe for a long time for us and all the pious. Amen.</p>

      <p>As for the rest, I read with the greatest sorrow what is written from Augsburg. I cannot sufficiently marvel that while others are in such a bad state, we meanwhile take care of our skin so securely and sleep on both ears, not weeping with those who weep. I fear that by God's just judgment we will be punished more severely.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As for me, I am quite well with my family, praise be to God. I will soon come to Zurich for a certain business, God willing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Master Gabriel Meyer, Lord Johannes Zehnder, and my wife Agathe send you their most dutiful greetings. I pray for the health of your entire household, Lord Rudolf Gwalther, and the others. I had to write in haste because he is hurrying home. Farewell in the Lord. Aarau, September 9, 1547. Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord as to a most esteemed father.</p>
