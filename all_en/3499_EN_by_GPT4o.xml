      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I will be brief; you have a living letter.</p>
      <p>But regarding those matters about which I did not remind him and which he does not know, I will respond briefly. The amicable resolution of the dispute between your people and the abbot is entirely commendable.</p>
      <p>If our people, as I wrote, are appealed to, they will willingly and diligently offer their assistance. I have discussed at length and in detail the reformation of the bishop and the entire college with Mr. Friedrich, and he has shown me serious cases and the greatest difficulties. However, it is agreed on both sides that we should not despair in such a good cause.</p>
      <p>He promises all his efforts; how could I deny mine, who first addressed him on this matter? But listen: I have imposed labor on myself, already burdened with labors; for I promised to write about the reformation in general, how it might be attempted, what should be given on both sides, etc. I will fulfill this as soon as possible; for I know that delay in these matters is fraught with dangers. I have received back all the writings I shared.</p>
      <p>If you can obtain the history of the capture of Calais, I beg you to share it; I desire nothing so much; they say it has been printed, but nothing has yet reached me.</p>
      <p>The old woman you commend to me, who is the sister of the mayor of Mellingen, is related to me by blood; she rightly said her mother was a Bullinger. She is utterly miserable, married to the devil rather than a husband, and it is a wonder she could live with that wild and rabid beast; but he has his judge. Now she is staying with a maid in my house and will leave in a few days to her brother with my letters of recommendation. She praises the benefits you have bestowed upon her, for which I thank you.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell together with Mr. and Mr. consuls, Pontisella, and other friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 6, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my godfather and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
