      <p>Most illustrious man, I finally send something that I was able to fish out from the Tridentine synagogue, certainly not without great labors, expenses, and dangers. The one who sends this writes to me thus: "I hear that they have not only discussed the Eucharist but have even completed it; I will send the decree shortly." And I will send everything to you immediately. Give these to my nephews, indeed help them, so that they have someone to transcribe them; for I have ordered that two copies be sent to other brothers. Farewell and greetings to you with the whole family, school, and church. Vicosoprano, November 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
