    <p xml:id="regest1">He hears uncertain and contradictory reports about the war in Württemberg. Wolfgang Mösel has asked for news. Fears that the war will continue. Greetings. News about the situation in Württemberg: Duke Ulrich and Landgrave Philipp are in the vicinity of Riedlingen. There has been no response yet to the inquiry to King Ferdinand about whether Ulrich will be reinstated in his recaptured duchy. The Bishop of Constance and the abbots of Salem, Weingarten, and Weißenau are fleeing to safe places.</p>

      <p>Most illustrious and venerable senior, the reason I write late about the war in Württemberg and the camps of the princes is that I have not yet received any certain information. I hear indeed many things, but they are vague, diverse, and conflicting. In my recent letters, I urged Lord Wolfgang to share any news worth knowing, which at least should be revealed, to satisfy the desire of my brother lords. But he has not replied, except for what you can understand from the enclosed letters. He sent these enclosed letters to me on the day of John the Baptist. After reading them, there is no need to send them back to me, but rather to destroy them because of the inserted matter about a certain fisherman known to you. He earnestly urges us to pray, not because he fears for the safety of the princes, but he fears for Germany and Swabia. From conjectures, we can understand that if the princes do not achieve the peace they not only seek but also offer, I fear the beginning of the war is not yet concluded. Furthermore, when I meet again with my aforementioned father in these days, God willing, if I learn anything worth knowing, I will not conceal it.</p>
      <p>I also kindly ask you to bear with my foolish and rustic writing. However, I do not want you to think anything of me, but to bear with the weak and love the loving. I always mean well, but much is written differently, but the time is patient.</p>
      <p>I wish Erasmus and Dr. Leo, especially your family, to be well. I did not think it necessary to write to everyone, as you can communicate what you wish yourself.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>From Stein am Rhein, June 28, 1534.</p>
      <p>Brother Georg W.</p>
      <p>It will be eight days from Monday that the news came to us in Stein that the Duke with the Landgrave is lying at Riedlingen, Mengen, Sulgen, etc., in the Truchsessian territory, as it is indeed true, but in what manner, meanwhile, no one knows, neither conquered nor taxed, which way it will take. But it is known: They have sought an answer from the king's side, whether Duke Ulrich will be allowed to remain in his regained and conquered land or not. There has been no answer from anyone until St. John's Day. Now it is known: If he is not assured of peace, he will seek another way, which I fear will be a harder and greater attack; although he has not yet been offended or harmed, the obstinacy and blindness are so great and the terror so strong that they do not recognize what would serve the common good and peace. The powerful are fleeing to safe cities: the Bishop has gone over to Arbon, the Abbot of Salem to Überlingen, Weingarten, Weißenau to Ravensburg. They act like naughty children, scream, and no one calls them. Those from Zell would like to have peace, yet they say the king is not their lord, but their father, therefore they want to act like brotherly blood and commit body and goods to him, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and venerable man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed patron.</p>
