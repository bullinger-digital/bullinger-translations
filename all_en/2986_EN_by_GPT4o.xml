      <p>Greetings. Your incredible kindness, most distinguished man, with which you recently received me, otherwise unknown to you, and the exceptional benevolence with which you embraced me so easily, compels me to take this opportunity to write, lest I be considered and indeed be the most ungrateful of all. There is also my promise, which I made to you when departing, to write to you frequently. Therefore, whatever these letters may be, consider them kindly in light of your humanity. For I hardly know what to write. Nevertheless, I did not want to remain silent towards you now.</p>
      <p>One thing I wish you to understand: Charles sincerely acknowledges and openly professes that he owes you first, then all your colleagues, and as many good men as there are in Zürich, as much as a man can scarcely owe to men. If only I could testify to this with some deed someday, may it be granted to me by the Lord: but in the meantime, I will proclaim everywhere that I am entirely devoted to you. As for our return, know that we were brought back here safe and sound by the Lord, and the journey was completed in four and a half days without any danger, which could have been feared: although not without the troublesome heat of the dog days, which almost killed us with thirst. You will understand from the response that I delivered your letters: and the document you gave me for memory's sake was explained to our Crispin, who sends you many greetings. He gave me two copies of the Consensus and both defenses of Mr. Calvin to deliver to you, which the same Mr. Calvin took care to have delivered to you with these letters. I have nothing else to add at present except that I commend myself greatly to you and your prayers. I wish all friends there to be safe. Budaeus, most dear to me and most devoted to you, sends his respectful greetings to you and all others. So does our Jacob, who was with me at your place.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, and forever venerable to me. May the Lord always be with you and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 15, 1556.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>When I was about to seal this letter, the most excellent and noble Marquis de Vico, who is very fond of you, was present at our home. When he understood that I was sending it to you, he requested, with his singular modesty, that I greet you in his words. I replied that I would do so all the more willingly because I know for certain that you wish him all the best. Therefore, you will receive the greeting that he sincerely prays to the Lord for you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
