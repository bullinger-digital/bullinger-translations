      <p>Greetings, most kind Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I received your book against Brentius on May 16th: I have not yet read it; for I gave it to the bookseller to be bound. But I will read it within these few days, as soon as the bookseller in Norwich sends it back. For it, I give great thanks.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, always send me your most learned writings: you can do nothing more pleasing for me. Storer, a lawyer and most impudent papist, in the western parts of England, dressed in courtly fashion, has been captured, as I hear: for I have nothing beyond hearsay.</p>
      <p>Fabricius came to me on May 15th, whom I treat as a citizen of Zurich and as myself. I regret that he will not stay with me longer.</p>
      <p>I would prefer to keep him with me for several months, indeed several years, rather than a few days. I speak with him in Latin, English, and (which you may wonder at) German: he also marvels that I can speak German so well. The dizziness in my head has not yet left me, but it is somewhat milder.</p>
      <p>The rest from Gwalther.</p>
      <p>I wrote letters to you around the end of April, to Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gesner, Lavater, Simler, Julius, and Forschover, which I hope you have received.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalther Haddon dined with me three days ago, a learned and pious man. He asked me to send greetings to you, and to Mr. Martyr and others.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>I wish all prosperity to all in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Bullinger, and love me, as you do, and pray to God for me.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>In Ludham, May 25th, 1562. All mine to you all.</p>
      <p>I sealed this letter on the last day of May, 1562. Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
