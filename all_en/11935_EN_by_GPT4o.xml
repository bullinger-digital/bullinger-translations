    <p xml:id="regest1">Will never forget the benefits Bullinger bestowed upon him during his stay in Zurich; remembers gratefully the friendly reception for him and Johannes [Pincier], the reading of confidential letters, the recommendation Bullinger wrote for him to Thomas Blarer, the free access he granted him, the books he allowed him to copy, the gifted wine, the festive meal, and the farewell words as he accompanied them out of the city. Refers to the letters addressed to [Konrad] Pellikan and [Theodor] Bibliander; greetings.</p>

      <p>I cannot restrain myself from expressing my gratitude to your kindness, most humane Bullinger, for almost every single favor you have bestowed upon me, even though I do so with a sense of shame. For the close relationship you have chosen to establish with me does not seem to require expressions of thanks, nor do I willingly discharge such a great debt of gratitude with mere words. Indeed, I would much prefer to show my gratitude to you in person through constant attentiveness and service, and if my modest circumstances allowed, through tangible means as well. Your love and judgment of me have brought me not only dignity and honor among you but also lasting pleasure, and I cannot easily determine which of these is greater. Certainly, both have resulted in my being honored and benefited by you and other excellent and learned men like you in Zurich. And, to pass over in silence what others, inspired by your leadership or example, have done for us, I will recount some of your own merits towards us, so that you may understand that they still cling to my memory. How great, I ask, was your kindness and benevolence, that you received me and my Johannes with a splendid banquet, read certain letters of great importance, and revealed secrets not to be entrusted to just anyone, and, beyond all my expectations, gave me letters of recommendation to the excellent and eloquent Thomas Blaurer, which resulted in my being honored and benefited greatly there!</p>
      <p>What is more, you opened free access to you for me and did not hesitate to engage in friendly conversations with me on various matters, shared some of your books with me to copy, and, not content with all this, you also graced our dinner with your presence and cheerfulness, deemed us worthy of a large and long glass of fragrant wine, and finally ensured that we were honored with a public and celebrated banquet, accompanied us on our journey from Zurich, instructing us with the most sacred doctrine and commending us to the Lord's mercy and grace. For such dedication, love, and utmost faith towards us, I give and will give eternal thanks as long as I live; for I cannot confidently affirm that I will be able to repay you. For I do not seem to be able to ever respond to your great services and benefits, unless perhaps you will consider it repayment that I hold them in memory. Nevertheless, whatever the case may be, I will certainly never easily overlook an opportunity to gratify you.</p>
      <p>It seemed right to me to write these few things to you. If you wish to learn anything else from me, you may ask Lord Pellican, our revered father in the Lord, and Lord Bibliander, our uniquely esteemed teacher, to share my letters to them with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord, most excellent man, and kindly overlook my rusticity in writing; I know you are not at all delighted by many titles, which is why I refrain from using them. Please convey my most familiar greetings to your entire household and especially and diligently to Mr. Gesner, Mr. Otto, and the provost, good and learned men. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt, in the year 1544 from the Virgin's birth, on the eighth of April. Yours with all my heart, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy and vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord and patron. Zurich.</p>
