    <p xml:id="regest1">The day before, the two councils, after a long discussion about the letter from the Zurich pastors [No. 1073], decided to publish the amended catechism and to dismiss the pastors who do not want to accept it; while [Meyer and Kunz] readily accepted the decision communicated by the Schulthei√ü of Wattenwyl, [Megander and Ritter] asked for time to consider. These two are so opposed by the majority of the Great Council that only a delegation from Zurich and St. Gallen would be able to persuade Bern to wait for Luther's response; utmost urgency is required. Furthermore, he refers to the letters from Megander [No. 1082] and Erasmus [Ritter] [No. 1081], and inquires whether Bibliander has received the writings sent to him; he asks to be provided with a position, as he expects his imminent dismissal.</p>

      <p>Greetings and a peaceful conscience through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>The day before I wrote this, most learned Bullinger, the council and people of Bern were compelled to publish the revised and amended catechism. In this matter, your common letters to us, the ministers of this church, were diligently read by Cyrone, the secretary of this city, and after long and thorough consideration, both councils finally decreed: The aforementioned catechism is to be published and printed immediately. However, if any of the ministers of the word do not wish to catechize the catechumens in this way, they have been given the opportunity to leave amicably. When the praetor of Wattenwyl announced this decree to the church members gathered in the temple that same evening, two of them readily embraced it; but others (whom you can easily recognize) requested time to deliberate with the learned and promised to give the council a response shortly.</p>
      <p>Hence, my dear Bullinger, you can easily perceive that our church is partially torn from yours and, unless help is provided in time, will be completely separated. Certainly, as far as Megander and our Erasmus are concerned, both have been attending to their affairs diligently; but I do not know by what fate or means both have become so odious to most of the two hundred (members of the council) that even the clearest truth is rejected, and they are said to act not for the sake of retaining the truth, but out of a desire for contention. Therefore, I think it is necessary for you and your fellow ministers to consider what remedy should be applied to such a great plague. I have no doubt that if some delegates from you and the people of St. Gallen were to come here and explain your opinion and the controversy that still exists in the matter of the Eucharist, the Bernese, out of respect for your authority, would not make any private innovations until we receive a common response from Luther regarding the resolution of the concord. This is my opinion, shared with other brothers. In the meantime, however, I do not wish to prescribe anything to you or others; for I know that you, with your learning and prudence, can find something better. Whatever you devise and provide, I ask, beg, beseech, and implore by Christian charity that you bring help to our church, which is in more danger than can be believed, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>I would discuss this matter with you at greater length, but I know that both Megander and Erasmus are writing more extensively on the same subject. However, I would like you to share these things, whatever they may be, with our Theodore. And tell him that I have sent letters to him through Huiufius the turner, in which I not only included his writings sent to me but also the catechism corrected and augmented by Capito and Bucer. All of which have not yet been delivered to him, as Hager was setting out to us, and your silence and his silence are to blame; for I had written to Bibliander to compare the corrected catechism with you. I would like to be informed about all these matters through Theodore, whom you should greet warmly along with your fellow workers. And make sure, especially you, my patron, that you provide for Rhellicanus, who has long been excommunicated and is now about to be completely banished, with some position among you, if any use of me can be made among you. If there is no hope for me there, I would like to be informed of that as well, so that I might perhaps be able to provide for myself elsewhere, or even ask the Lord that, just as he appointed me here through Zwingli, a man of blessed memory, he might appoint me elsewhere through you or others. For nothing is more certain to me than that, with things being as they are and remaining so, I will soon be removed from office because of the neglect of Buceranism.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern, exceedingly troubled, December 22, 1537.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellicanus.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant shepherd of the Christian flock among the Zurichers, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend and patron.</p>
