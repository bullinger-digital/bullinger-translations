    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has asked him to organize the delivery of letters to Zurich, and he will make a great effort to do so, especially because his fellow believers are urging him. A young merchant is taking the letter and will hand it over to a Zurich resident in Frankfurt am Main. He has sent further mail to Zurich to Bucer. The Bohemian fellow believers, to whom he presented Bullinger's explanations on the Lord's Supper in the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, were very pleased to hear that their rite corresponds to that of Zurich. This was also confirmed to them by Theodor [Bibliander] through his preface in the edition of the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God our Lord.</p>
      <p>You rightly reminded me, most learned Bullinger, in the last letter, which I received from you in February 1534, that I should finally find a way or method so that your letters could often reach us and ours could reach you. You reminded me, and although I clearly feel that I have a rather limited supply for writing, especially in Latin, I would willingly undertake no labor with such a cheerful spirit as to send letters more often to such pious, learned, kind, and humane men. The brothers and citizens of this city, as well as those of other cities, and especially the Bohemians, urge me to fulfill what you write, which I consider a sin to resist. I have now found a young merchant from Frankfurt, who is currently staying in Kutn√° Hora, a famous city in Bohemia; he promised to deliver our letters to Frankfurt twice a year and to faithfully offer them to Zurich merchants with prayers that they be delivered into your hands, making an attempt with these letters. I also sent other letters to Martin Bucer in Strasbourg, asking him to send them to Zurich.</p>
      <p>The custom you observe in the Lord's Supper, as you indicated in the commentaries on the tenth chapter to the Hebrews, I have explained word for word to the brothers who are in Bohemia; for they greatly desired it. With what joy they were filled upon hearing it, others will declare; for their custom, which they are accustomed to observe in the most sacred Lord's Supper, is so similar to yours as an egg to an egg. Now comes the preface of our Theodor [Bibliander] in the Four Books of Letters of Johannes Oecolampadius and Huldrych Zwingli, in which he also did not want your custom to be unknown to us.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write more, excellent Bullinger; the messenger stands ready to receive the letters. First, Friedrich Weigand, the leader of this council, Helvetius, Wenceslaus Lankisch, the judge, Caspar Guttel, Onofrius Herzog, Celestinus Hennig, Johannes Becherer, the surgeon, Martin N., citizens of our republic, from Luban, Franciscus Boarius with his dearest ones, and finally very many from Bohemia greet you; I truly devote and dedicate myself to you and your assistants.</p>
      <p>Farewell, glory of theology.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau, on the 20th day of the month of February in the year 1537 from the birth of Christ.</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, from public letters.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, and the other brothers proclaiming the word of Christ in Zurich, his sincerely esteemed brothers.</p>
