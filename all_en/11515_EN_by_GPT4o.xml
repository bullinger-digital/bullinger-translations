      <p>Yesterday, a friend said to me: "The envoy of the King of France, Lord Morlet, together with Sleidanus, a learned and pious man, has already arrived at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Hesse himself will go there after the Archbishop of Mainz has set out. The Emperor pretends to be such that he seems to seriously want to promote the colloquium and reformation; however, there are those who find all his plans suspicious."</p>
      <p>A student from Wittenberg wrote to a friend in these words these days: "We have nothing new here, except that the Emperor's utmost inconsistency, malice, and vanity, as well as the author of horrible arsons, are explicitly criticized from our pulpit. Heinrich, Duke of Wolfenbüttel, called the Brunswick, is the author of the arsons, and here 20 people are held in custody, who are reserved as living testimonies. They have received counted money from him. Luther calls him 'murderous arsonist' in his sermons.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Mainz, priest Albrecht, has demanded an immeasurable amount of money from the citizens in Halle and Magdeburg; but they refused and will undoubtedly curb his wicked and nefarious greed. Furthermore, he is collecting a great amount of gold for himself; he has sold several monasteries, abbeys, church ornaments, and the salt mines of Halle. But he will be frustrated in his plan. The Emperor seems to confirm and stabilize the plans of the Papists in the Worms assembly with his edict (if it is indeed the Emperor's). Luther said in a sermon yesterday: 'If it cannot be otherwise, we will try the long spear and confront the Emperor along with the beggar Ferdinand.' This is what the Wittenberger wrote.</p>
      <p>Now another friend writes: "You have heard, I suppose, about the Waldensians in Provence, many of whom have fled to Avignon and elsewhere out of fear of persecution. They finally petitioned the king to be allowed to leave the Kingdom of France with their goods.</p>
      <p>The King, having discovered the innocence of the people, ordered them to return safely to their homes and believe whatever they want, as long as they do not disturb his kingdom." He adds at the end: "If only the Zurich brothers, the most learned and pious men, would stop mocking because they do not want to help! For some of them write to friends that there has been a great and Sorbonne-like disputation in Worms and I don't know what else. If this is a Sorbonne-like disputation, then Augustine was also a Sorbonnist in his books against the Pelagians, Donatists, and others." But this is for you alone.</p>
      <p>Another brother writes: "The Emperor has instructed the judges of the Imperial Chamber in Speyer through his counselors to punish the Lutherans among them according to the Augsburg decree. He has urged the ecclesiastics of the first temple to strongly defend the religion of their ancestors; the college is royal and most pleasing to him, and he will not abandon them if any danger arises from it. He has also very gravely ordered the Senate to immediately expel from the city the monk and another parish priest who teach Christ by their command, and to remove the deposed Lutheran senators from the senatorial order," etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot remain silent about what a very good man and distinguished friend wrote: "I hear that the Zurich brothers are laughing heartily at our plans; but what, I ask, should we do? Should we refuse the opportunity and space for a colloquium given to us? How great a loss to the churches, or even the suspicion that there are those among us who refuse to explain the cause! 'Our books,' they say, 'are available.' That is true; the Anabaptists' and Papists' books are also available; therefore, should what has emerged publicly be tolerated and considered approved?</p>
      <p>By what example, I ask, should we avoid the opportunity to give an account of our faith, for which purpose moderate debate is often necessary? Without sophistry, Philipp acted with such grace that I do not doubt he achieved more with many in a three-day colloquium than with ten years of writing. For there is no end to writing books, nor are all read by everyone. Furthermore, we must obey the magistrate who commands us to advocate for our cause. Although, to be honest, there is no one among us who would not prefer to teach his own church than to expose himself to adversaries equipped with so many arts and traps." These things, which I have now received from the brothers' letters, I also thought it right to inform you, whom I know to be of the most modest spirit and calmest disposition, so that you may obtain from your people, by your authority, which you have among them, that they write more circumspectly for the common cause of the church. Truly, they seek the Lord and are the Lord's men, and there is no reason to disdain them, even if not everything they undertake is entirely pleasing.</p>
      <p>From Nuremberg on February 19: On the 16th of the same month, at three o'clock in the afternoon, His Imperial Majesty rode in here with great honor; for a respectable council, together with the citizens, met His Majesty about a quarter of a mile from the city, up to 450 horses, in one color with red coats and in the sleeves the color of His Majesty, yellow, brown, and ash-colored, and the oldest of the council dismounted from their horses, went on foot to meet His Majesty, and received him as is proper, and when His Majesty came to the city, all the artillery was fired, and when His Majesty entered the city, all the bells were rung, and then His Majesty was led under a canopy (Baldachin) with great splendor to the castle, but not far from the gate, on both sides stood from man to man with weapons and armor, very well equipped, 4000 men on foot, who made the way for His Majesty. In the streets everywhere, His Imperial Majesty's coat of arms was hung, and in front of the castle, a gate was decorated with great adornment, upon which the city's pipers stood with all kinds of music, and above them a large eagle, two men high, which bowed three times to His Majesty. And as His Majesty rode through the gate, the eagle also turned and bowed again, and the gate was adorned with many beautiful figures and 14 royal coats of arms, also with carminibus. And when His Majesty came to the castle, the lords presented His Majesty with 6 wagons of oats, 3 wagons of wine, and six tubs of fish.</p>
      <p>And it was expected that His Majesty would go to the churches; but it did not happen. But the next day, that is February 17, the elders of a council presented His Majesty with a gift, a large gilded cup and inside a hundred guilders in gold, minted in such a way that the first weighed one gold guilder, the second two, the third three, the fourth four, and so on, each one more than the other up to 100 guilders; that makes a total of 5050 guilders in gold.</p>
      <p>Such a gift was graciously accepted by His Majesty; thereafter, His Majesty was greatly honored for two hours into the night with fireworks and other things. On the third day, His Majesty requested to see the armory and granaries, which were shown to His Majesty with great ceremonies and led around the city, and everyone expected that His Majesty would leave on the 19th day, but there is still another matter, namely that His Majesty must be paid homage, but in what form this will happen, I cannot yet know. The Duke of Savoy's [...] mass equipment was also prepared in St. Sebald's Church, intending to read mass for the Duke; but this was not allowed, etc.</p>
      <p>I almost forgot what Capito wrote to me six days ago: "Send greetings to the Zurichers from me, whom I observe in the Lord, and I do not envy them their holy and learned and also very joyful success, nor do we regret our own labor. Thus are the diverse gifts of the same Lord. May the Lord keep us all!"</p>
      <p>Greet the most illustrious and best men Pellicanus, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and the others, whose pious wishes I uniquely desire to commend to the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and dearest Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc. Zurich.</p>
