      <p>Greetings. I would have gladly written to you long ago and responded to your letters, dearest lord and godfather; but messengers have been lacking, and I am surprised at how rarely they come to me. I think the reasons are, first, that due to the high cost of things, fewer people are traveling, and secondly, that I rarely, indeed almost never, go out; for I can only go to the temple and the pulpit, where I still do what I can, and then I return home, so that fewer people meet me than if I were to go out in public as I used to. Hence, it also happens that I learn about new things later or sometimes never.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly written to you recently when I was writing to my brother; but because of our synod and other reasons, I could not; so I wrote to my brother about what occurred to me at the time, asking him to share it with you.</p>
      <p>But to set these things aside and get to the matters themselves, first of all, I have special thanks for you for that judgment of Dr. Erastus about our H., and for taking so much trouble to write it out in your own hand; it will be useful for us to collect more of such things, so that if the need arises, we can use them. We could not acquire more certain testimonies of his perversity from anywhere better than from Leipzig; for I hardly think he can live there without revealing himself in some way, no matter how cautious he is, and we indeed are seeking out whatever we can. If you also come across anything from there, please share it with us. In the place of Aretio, two others have finally been appointed. For Johannes Hortinus of Lausanne has come from Heidelberg (whose brother Michael also teaches the Hebrew language in Lausanne); since he was supported there for almost four years at the expense of our magistrate with Dr. Tremellius, he made such progress in the knowledge of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Syriac languages that he had no equal among the younger ones in this field of knowledge. Hence, Dr. Tremellius betrothed his niece to him, the daughter of Dr. Antonius Chavalerius, who once taught Hebrew letters in Lausanne and Geneva with great praise. The senate of this city has granted him the teaching of these languages here for only a year. Meanwhile, Turingus Rustius has also been added to Christian in Portu, so that he alternates weeks with him in teaching theology and Greek reading, and although this was not done entirely according to our advice, for most of us would have preferred to have my Marquard, yet, since it pleased God and our magistrate this way, we have nothing to say against it. I have good hopes for both of them, especially since I have no doubt that they are sincere in their doctrines. Marquard was harmed by the fact that the entire school of Lausanne seems to depend almost solely on him, and the lords have no one else to oppose the proud and restless French nation there, which otherwise would seem to dominate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I bear it all the more equitably that they passed him over in this election.</p>
      <p>You might expect many new things from me; but I think you have more and far more certain information than we do. Here, everything is already resounding with the king's death, and this rumor has lasted for quite a few days and is more and more confirmed by those who come and write from France, Burgundy, and Savoy. A certain man from the king's bodyguard has come, who testifies that he saw his corpse.</p>
      <p>The Marchioness of Neuchâtel, the mother-in-law of the late Prince Condé, arrived in Neuchâtel 14 days ago and barely escaped being captured in Burgundy.</p>
      <p>She sent her court master here to announce her arrival to the lords. Among other things, he affirmed that the king was so putrefied around the genitals that he was forced to undergo surgery, and that there was great danger to his life. Letters immediately followed from the governor of the three restored prefectures of Savoy, which affirmed the same and added that he died from spasms. What will happen now, the Lord knows. Some say that a lot of blood flowed from the dead man, others that he vomited his liver along with his lungs; but I think many things are being fabricated; it is enough if he died by such a manifest judgment of God, which we all ought to worship and be confirmed in the profession of His truth. Some also say that Montgomery has been captured in Normandy. Our Merlin recently went to Prince Condé, whom he found together with the Palatine in Germersheim. He thinks he will soon lead troops from Germany into France and reports some other things, which, however, are not of great importance. Regarding our Swiss who went to the Spaniard, it is said that it is completely unworthy; they would gladly be rid of them, as they are not needed; they are supposed to be paid for three months, and yet they receive no money. So the others are also now waiting for money; otherwise, they would move on.</p>
      <p>I have heard nothing from Geneva for a long time. My lords have again forbidden the running away under pain of life and limb. Not long ago, two who were in the previous campaign were put in the stocks, and one who had behaved worse was banished from the land, while the other was sworn into the land.</p>
      <p>I think even today, I have no luck with messengers; I wrote this letter almost 8 days ago and thought I would find a messenger, but I have been anxious and inquired wherever I could, and if I had found no other way, I would have sent the letter with Mr. Wurstenberger, our messenger to Baden, who is riding there today for the annual account. In the meantime, this good Mr. R. Studer from Winterthur comes. I give it to him as I wrote it before, only so much further that the king's death is now much more certain, as the ambassador has also written here and the people of Solothurn and Fribourg confirm it.</p>
      <p>They say in such a form: as he accompanied his brother to Nancy, he became ill, so that it was thought he had been poisoned; he suffered from it until now and finally died; they had him cut open to see if they could find the poison; they could not detect any, only that his heart was swollen and dried out; that was said to be from such great sorrow caused by the Huguenots, etc. You understand the rest. May God do the same to all blessed hearts! I wanted to add these things quickly to the previous ones; if more came to mind, I would write more. May the Lord keep you always!</p>
      <p>Greet the friends, brothers, and especially those who are of your household. All of ours greet you, although many of them are absent from the city these days.</p>
      <p>In Bern, June 18, 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
