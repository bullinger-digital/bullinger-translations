      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. The daughter of Fabritius is now sending a second letter to her mother because she has not received any response to the previous ones; she truly prays to your kindness, dearest Bullinger, for Christ's sake, that you yourself will hear these present letters to her mother, to understand what she asks; you will easily persuade the maternal spirit to take the boy into her care, while she herself, with the advice of good people, will change her servile condition for the better. As for me, to briefly testify about her, I hear nothing else than that she is doing very well with our nobleman and especially the prefect, and then in the republic; she is commended to all because of her parent, whose ministry in the church is not yet erased from the memory of many.</p>
      <p>If by chance she has sinned, she will undoubtedly become wise from the blow in exile and, repenting in foreign homes, will return with greater fruit. Our status is the same as it has been for a long time; we are not enrolled in the favor of the Emperor; would that we were in the favor of Him who is full of grace and truth. Yesterday I received letters from a certain Noric, who writes that on the 8th day of this month, lodgings were designated for the Emperor, his son, and Ferdinand in Nuremberg, and now they are staying in Munich. If this is true, there will not be a diet, but a gathering. It is known that few princes are there, etc. It is also certainly reported that the city of Brunswick has engaged in some light skirmishes or conflicts with Duke Henry of Brunswick and that recently the citizens have gained victory and killed a hundred of the duke's nobles. They say again that they are regrouping and raising a great army and planning wonders.</p>
      <p>May the Lord turn this evil, which he attempts, upon the head of the robber, amen. The remaining maritime cities are still similar to themselves, proscribing the Imperial Interim in every way. Many other things; perhaps the courier was standing ready. I wish you, with your family and brothers and relatives, also Pellican, Bibliander, and Gwalther, to be in the best of health. Our people greet you. Pray for us diligently, amen. Hastily. In Riquewihr, August 30, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your old man, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, to be observed as a brother.</p>
