      <p>Greetings, I wrote to you these days from Basel; but now, happening upon this good man in Aarau, I ask you to keep what I recently wrote about the business of the people of Strasbourg confidential. For it later occurred to me that the people of Strasbourg did not want to be exposed, though I do not know what they mean by that. Regarding my business with the people of Aarau, I will wait to hear what you think and advise.</p>
      <p>I now hear that they have called Hieronymus Krantz from Diessenhofen. I pray that this may be fortunate and auspicious.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they still urge me to transfer to them, which I would do willingly, if my church were not so concerned that I might change my place.</p>
      <p>Farewell. January 21, 1558. Aarau.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
