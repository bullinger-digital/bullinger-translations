      <p>God's grace beforehand! Today I received your letter. I have hastily copied the new news and am sending yours back to you with this and thank you very much. If I had anything new, I would also send it to you; but we are sitting here in the corner, so that all things come to us last. I will send the monk's history later; it could not be copied so quickly. The Meidenburg matter is all hung up on the day of the 4 cities; some citizens have already privately contributed something; I do not know what it will bring. People are willing; yet the majority are waiting for the decision of the cities; they do not fully trust the matter yet. So no one can please everyone. We have been burned so often in a short time that it is no wonder if people do not immediately believe. If people trusted the matter, I believe it would be well received here. That you greeted Imm, the messenger, as I asked you, you have done well; I hope it will serve for good.</p>
      <p>I have not heard anything from Hieronymus since then; I do not know where he is, but I will soon find out. He left the letters here, as I have written. Our French preachers are restless also for other reasons; I have so much trouble with them that I am almost tired of it. I have never seen such storms in my life; they cannot act discreetly. Calvin would like to be here to clear himself of many rumors going around about him, which are of no importance. I am completely against it; for I fear the matter would become worse rather than better; besides, we have other things to deal with now.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday night my lord's post arrived; the council was gathered around midnight. There is something going on in Burgundy. Many messengers have been hastily sent away; it almost seems as if something is going on. We are so warlike here that I fear we will have enough of war. One can hardly wait for the time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there appears little repentance in life; however, there are many offenses, especially among the ministers of the word, so that I greatly fear the hand of the Lord. May He spare us for the sake of His elect, many of whom are still with us; praise be to the Lord!</p>
      <p>I wanted to briefly respond to yours, although I am otherwise very busy, so as not to neglect my duty towards you. Farewell and greet for me Mr. Gwalther and the other brothers, as well as your entire family. Please remind Froschauer to send the copies. Bern, February 16, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Schertli has been posted here these days, letting himself be heard by no one, not even by Musculus; he comes from France, and the secret matter is supposed to break out soon.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
