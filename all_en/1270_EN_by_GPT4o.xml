      <p>Four ships were setting sail from Antwerp at the same time, one of which was shipwrecked; only your copies arrived safely on the shore in Abel's ship. I gave one to Cox, and I arranged for another to be delivered to the Earl of Warwick through Cheke; the remaining three, namely for Peter, the Marquis, and the daughter, I have now decided to carry with me to Oxford. My prince set out with three hundred horsemen and several good preachers to Scotland, primarily for the purpose of faithfully establishing and instructing the part of that region conquered in previous years in religion. I expect to set out to him within a few weeks; from there, I might send letters to you, if I can find a trustworthy messenger. I will give a copy of the Decade to both Wullok and your Scinner in your name, which I do not think you will take badly. The Earl of Ireland had ordered me to return to him this morning; but when I approached the chamber, he was said to have been called to the king. Your greeting was indeed very pleasing to him; I will undoubtedly ensure that his letters to you are delivered to ZÃ¼rich with my next ones. Now I am setting out on a journey to the prince; but to you, most esteemed father in Christ, I give and hold eternal thanks for your immortal benefits to me, again and again. I will write to you about each matter after my return and in detail. The prince's brother and Scinner greet you with many words, with whom I dined very splendidly yesterday. In London, hastening and in haste.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted student, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, his most dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>From the Chancellor of Oxford, Dr. Cox.</p>
