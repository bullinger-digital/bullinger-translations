      <p>Oh, my dear brother, let this matter be of concern to you and let me know the truth, whether Hallerus is in Bern and how long he will stay or if your lords will let him stay there; because if he stays there, it would be all the easier for me; otherwise, you know well how things stand there and how difficult it would be for me.</p>
      <p>Let me also know who the envoys from Bern are, and advise me with all your heart, as I trust you; I will conduct myself in such a way that you shall see that your advice is very valuable and highly regarded by me.</p>
      <p>My God knows that I would gladly do right by Him. I ask Him with all faithfulness for me.</p>
      <p>My dear brother, wife, and sister send you all good wishes. Doctor Schnepf has been granted the pulpit in T체bingen; for all preachers are being dismissed, and those who complain about it are sent to Stuttgart.</p>
      <p>Bishop of Speyer, W체rzburg, etc., have summoned all pastors of their diocese, and those who do not appear shall immediately be under ban and excommunication.</p>
      <p>Write to me, my dear brother-in-law Peter Sch채r from W체rttemberg; he has also been with Schnepf. Oh God, have mercy on your dear church!</p>
