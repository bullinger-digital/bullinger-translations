    <p xml:id="regest1">Has already written extensively to Bullinger and [Johann Jakob] Ammann and trusts in their goodwill. Does not wish to stay in Marburg any longer, as the lectures bring him little benefit. War is anticipated, after Duke Heinrich of Brunswick directed a vile libel against Landgrave [Philipp]; the latter is traveling to the Imperial Diet [in Regensburg], yet there are fears for him. The English King [Henry VIII] remains in his godlessness; Gwalther has not yet been able to speak to an Englishman who has arrived at the landgrave's court. Sends his mourning poems on Eobanus [Hessus], which Melanchthon has praised; [Christian] Egenolff would also like to print Gwalther's "Monomachia," but he himself prefers Froschauer as the printer and will send the completed work to Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Recently, most esteemed father, I wrote to you and to Ammann, the schoolmaster, in detail about the state of my affairs, and I hope you have already received those letters. I had sent them to Worms to Dr. Grynaeus. From there, you surely understood certain things, the consideration of which will easily allow you to decide on my affairs, so that there is no need to trouble you again on the same matter. For I am convinced of both of you that you will not hinder what will be beneficial for me, as you, dearest father, have often demonstrated in action. Ammann has always shown such kindness to me that it would be irreligious to doubt it.</p>
      <p>If I may ask this one thing, I hope you will not take it badly, namely, that I should not be detained in Marburg by you any longer to the detriment of my studies.</p>
      <p>I have often written about the order of studies there, which has been of little benefit to someone who has made even a little progress in literary matters. To be honest, I have almost no lectures that I can attend with profit. However, I do not wish you to understand this as the fault of the professors. They are indeed men distinguished in learning, and in humanity and goodwill towards me, they are most ready; but they are compelled to teach such things for the sake of the younger students, which are of little benefit to outsiders.</p>
      <p>As for public affairs, everything is in confusion. Everyone expects war, so atrocious and notorious are the injuries that Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is inflicting on the Landgrave. Recently, he wrote a most infamous book against the Prince of Hesse, of which I only managed to see a few pages in the court; for only one copy was sent to Marburg to the prince himself. The Landgrave is preparing for the Imperial Diet with great fear among all good men, lest he suffer any harm from the Emperor. The King of England continues in his impiety. An Englishman has just arrived at the Landgrave's court, whom many say was expelled from his homeland. I have seen the man, but have not yet had the opportunity to speak with him. Everything is full of turmoil, and no better is expected.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the epitaphs of Eobanus with your name inscribed on the mourning poem, which I earnestly beg you to accept as a very small gift of my talent in place of a New Year's gift. Certainly, if greater strength of talent is granted to me, you will find me by no means forgetful of you. Melanchthon read these poems of mine before they were published; he liked the vein of the poem, and encouraged Egenolff to incite me to others. Egenolff also wanted to publish my "Monomachia," but I prefer it to be printed by Froschauer. I have now completed everything and will send it to you at the next fair. Please do not cease to embrace this poor little poet with your usual favor; for my part, I will take care that my Muse is not a detriment to my country or religion.</p>
      <p>My companions greet you. Please also greet your wife and mother with all the family in my words. Farewell, dearest father.</p>
      <p>Marburg, March 3, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
