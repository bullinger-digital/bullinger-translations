      <p>Herr Othmar Gluß, Dean of the Abbey of St. Gallen, succumbed to madness in the past February due to lack of sleep (for he was troubled by the capture of the Brunswick tyrants), and had himself taken from the Abbey to Wil, where he had previously been governor for many years. There, he remained in his melancholy, allowing few people besides the doctors to see him, and lay there until the 27th day of March. On that morning, between five and six o'clock, he ran out of his room and, in a senseless manner, threw himself out of a window, two stories high, and fell in such a way that he lost speech and understanding, yet is said to have lived until the evening. Around three o'clock, he passed away.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, the 29th of March, he was brought to us in the Abbey of St. Gallen and was buried without much bell ringing and singing. I do not believe there was any more cunning, hateful, and hostile enemy, even an opponent of our religion, in the entire Confederation. Perhaps it was by God's providence that the most violent hypocrite was now extinguished by a violent and deplorable death.</p>
      <p>On the miserable case of Othmar Gluß, a Benedictine monk, who threw himself from a window at Wil in Thurgau for the third time. J. V.</p>
      <p>If fate had given Gluß Daedalian wings, he would not have thrown himself onto the hard ground. But indeed, completely without feathers, so that he would not perish in death, the sad corpse was covered with feathers.</p>
      <p>He fell from a high window on the 27th of March in the morning of the year of our Lord 1546, whether willingly or in madness is uncertain. Then, having been carried back to his bed, he died almost nine hours after that fall.</p>
