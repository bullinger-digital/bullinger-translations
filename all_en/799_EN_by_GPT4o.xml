      <p>To Mr. Pier Paolo Vergerio.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your most friendly letter, most excellent and esteemed man, written in Basel on the 13th of the Kalends of January, and as I read it, I was utterly astonished to see you, such a great man, speak so highly of me, when I, well aware of myself, do not recognize even the slightest of these praises. Indeed, I am a servant of Christ and a minister of His church, and I hope not unfaithful. But how many things do I know I lack?</p>
      <p>I have written and published many things, but with the intention that my writings, however they may be, might provide an opportunity for more learned men to offer more polished works to the public.</p>
      <p>Thus far, I have certainly wished to serve Christ, our Lord, and His holy church, and now I would not even spare my life, if indeed by its loss I could aid the glory of Christ, our Lord, and the safety of the church, which He redeemed with His blood. As I understand that your excellence also aspires to this and strives in every way, certainly because of your piety in Christ, our common Savior, I love and embrace you, earnestly beseeching our Lord Christ to bring to a happy end what He has begun so wonderfully in you. Above all, I congratulate your piety for having attained such happiness, that, as a bishop and intimate friend of the Antichrist, you were able to forsake such a sweet, honorable, and opulent association. I have seen this granted to few thus far. However, He who has most generously bestowed this gift upon you will undoubtedly add this as well, that you may hate to the very end of your life the Babylonian, the Antichrist himself, the man of sin, along with his members and nefarious counsels, with honors and riches, however great they may be. I expect nothing else from him, except that, slain by the spirit of the mouth of Christ the Lord, he will be utterly abolished by His glorious coming, perhaps sooner than we all think, and cast into the very depths of hell by a just judgment, with the seat of his wicked kingdom, Rome, burned, and all the impious and enemies of Christ trampled throughout the whole world.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have the best hope for the Christian religion, that Christ, merciful and gracious to His otherwise most afflicted church, will never fail it, although I know it will never be entirely freed from the cross. Therefore, from the Roman pontiff, whoever may be elected, and from his members, that nefarious cupbearer, I expect nothing but old and cunning arts, execrable impostures, and the most atrocious persecution of the saints of God. Hence, I do not promise myself even the slightest bit of solid, sincere, and integral counsel from them.</p>
      <p>They wish to be and remain the lords of affairs, while the whole world is shattered and crushed in the meantime.</p>
      <p>They have made themselves known to the whole world for 900 years, so that no good person can expect anything else from them than what they daily produce. May the Lord deliver His own and lead them out of this Sodom, if He still has any there, as I hear there are many; but may He restrain those obstinate ones with His presence to the glory of His name and the redemption of His people, who constantly cry out: "Come, O Lord Jesus, come quickly and deliver those who uniquely await You. Amen."</p>
      <p>My resources are few or none, otherwise, I would offer myself entirely to you, honorable lord and brother. Certainly, if I can do anything for your favor, I wish you to trust that I am yours. Farewell in Christ, our only lover, along with the most illustrious man Mr. Coelius, my singular friend and, if I understood correctly, your most faithful host. Farewell again and continue to love me, I beseech you.</p>
      <p>Those whom you greeted in your letters send their regards to your kindness. ZÃ¼rich, January 8, in the year of our Lord 1550.</p>
      <p>From the heart, Heinrich Bullinger. To Mr. Pier Paolo Vergerio.</p>
