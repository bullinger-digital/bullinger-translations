    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius, full of worries, desires a response from Bullinger to his last letter, delivered by the sailor Johannes Wedenschwiler [hbbw XX, No. 3100, from December 28, 1547], especially regarding the Five [Places].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">News from Italy reports that Pope Paul III has prepared his army to recapture Piacenza. Additionally, he is said to have expelled all Spaniards from his territory and now also sent away two Spanish cardinals. Emperor Charles V is said to want to make his son Philip II of Spain the king over the Duchy of Milan. Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, will receive him in Genoa. The Emperor aspires to greatness, so it is easy to notice what he actually covets: more ("plus ultra")! Should Bullinger have any news on this, he may convey it at his convenience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Philipp Melanchthon writes regarding the Schmalkaldic War that neither the Hanseatic cities nor the Dukes of Pomerania [Barnim XI and Philipp I] could reach a peace with the Emperor. Many believe that the neighboring princes will wage war against them. And if that happens, then there will be expulsions [for the Protestants] once again. What Melanchthon then reports about the prevailing freedom in Transylvania has greatly pleased Myconius. He reports that the church and school system established by Johannes Honter in Kronstadt enjoys freedom. For although they are subject to King Ferdinand I, the Transylvanians now pay taxes to Sultan Suleiman I so that he does not attack them. And thus a bishop [Bartholomäus Altenberger] was unanimously appointed and provided with decent benefices so that he can conduct church visitations. When King Ferdinand I learned of this, he sent an embassy to the Transylvanians and demanded that the bishop's authority be revoked. The [Transylvanian] cities replied that the king should first reconquer the densely populated bishoprics of Gran, Pécs, Alba [Iulia], and Kalocsa, which are occupied by the Turks to the detriment of the empire and the harm of the population's souls. The [newly elected] bishop, on the other hand, whom the Transylvanians have entrusted with church oversight, harms neither the king, nor the empire, nor the souls. [So far Melanchthon.] One marvels at what God accomplishes in the midst of the Turks, quite the opposite of this Christian King Ferdinand! Unthinkable if the latter were to become pope!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">A note [intended for Bucer and] written on December 27, 1547, from Augsburg, which was enclosed with a letter [from Bucer to Enzinas], states that everything is being negotiated behind the scenes there. What the Reichstag will lead to is uncertain. They are waiting for the delivery of the "joyful" message [from Pope Paul III] by Bishop Cristoforo Madruzzo of Trento, who has not yet returned from Rome. Meanwhile, on St. Thomas's Day [December 21], the preachers from Ottheinrich's duchy [Palatinate-Neuburg] were expelled and the papacy was reintroduced. The expelled arrived in Augsburg discouraged the day before [December 26]. If only everyone could speak like the angels! [So far the news from Augsburg]. This reveals the Spanish temperament [of the Emperor]: He continues the Reichstag, allows all participants to speak freely and return home [safely], but allows [the expulsion of Protestant clergy]! May the Lord open [the Confederates'] eyes so that they may guard themselves in time against the cunning of such a man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther and the other pastors.</p>

      <p>S. You have not yet responded to my last letters, which I believe Johannes Wedenschwiler, the sailor, delivered. I am surprised, as I am anxiously desiring a response, especially regarding the Five [Places].</p>

      <p>News from Italy reports that the Roman Pope is now ready with a distinguished army to recapture Piacenza. He is said to have expelled all Spaniards from his territory, however large it may be, and two Spanish cardinals have now been ordered to prepare for his journey. The Emperor is also involved in this, intending to make his son, whom the Duke of Alba will receive in Genoa, the King of the Insubrians. The Emperor attempts great things, so we can easily see where his mind is headed with that: "more beyond" (plus ultra). If you have any news, please share it, if leisure permits.</p>

      <p>Regarding the new Saxon war, Mr. Philipp writes in these words: "The Saxon cities and the Pomeranian dukes have not yet obtained peace, and there are many conjectures that neighboring princes will wage war against them. If that happens, we will be driven into new exiles." He also writes the following, which is very pleasing to me, concerning the freedom of the Transylvanians: "In that part of Hungary, which they call Transylvania, where the church was first restored in Kronstadt and later the study of letters was established through the diligence of Honter, there is now tranquility by the grace of God. For although they are subject to King Ferdinand, they pay tribute to the Turkish tyrant to avoid war. Thus, the study of letters flourishes there, the churches are rightly taught, and a bishop has been appointed by the common consent of the churches, with a decent stipend necessary for the inspection of the churches. After King Ferdinand learned of this, he sent envoys there, who ordered that the authority attributed to this bishop be taken away again. The cities replied that the king should first recover the other richest dioceses of Esztergom, Pécs, Alba, and Kalocsa, which the Turks now hold to the great detriment of the kingdom and many souls. This bishop, whom they have entrusted with the inspection of the churches, neither opposes the king nor harms the kingdom or the salvation of souls," etc. We see what the Lord is doing in the midst of the Turks, and what King Ferdinand, supposedly a Christian, is doing. What do you think, if he were to become pope?</p>

      <p>Furthermore, a note came from Augsburg, inserted into a letter to us, which reads: "Believe me, everything here is conducted so obscurely, covertly, and uncertainly that, if life were at stake, I do not know at all what these assemblies will bring forth or what end they will establish. The Roman gospel is still awaited through Bishop Cristoforo Madruzzo, who has not yet returned from Rome. Meanwhile, on the day of St. Thomas, the ministers of the word were expelled from the duchy of Ottheinrich, and the papacy was restored. Good men came to us yesterday, dismayed and dejected. If only everyone could speak like the angels. December 27." You see, my Bullinger, what the Spanish temperament is doing: It continues the assembly, allows freedom of speech to all who will attend, indeed, to return home, and now permits this. May the Lord open our eyes, so that, understanding the cunning and deceit of the man, we may guard ourselves in time through Him.</p>
