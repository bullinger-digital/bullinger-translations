      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his always esteemed father and relative, Johannes Herter sends many greetings.</p>
      <p>The young man you recently sent seems to me to be pious and sufficiently learned. As you advised, I spoke with him, offered him a position, and the church prayed for him. However, he responded: He wants to discuss with his parents and friends until the synod and then give an answer. I can see well that he thinks, since he is a citizen's son, he should obtain a better position than others, as something might become vacant at the synod, just as Jacobus Keretz did before, when I offered him my assistance on your advice; however, he now has a much better position, even if the 40 guilders are added. Therefore, dear and kind brother-in-law, my very friendly and earnest request is that you do your best to ensure that a proposal is made as soon as possible and that I am provided with an assistant for one year or at most two years. Then some will grow up here who will be satisfied with such services. If Marcus Tobler (who was once my student and is better known to others) were given to me, it would be a great service; however, as the free choice allows, I am quite satisfied. Dutwyler has indicated to the community of Ellicken that if an improvement in salary is made, he would be more willing.</p>
      <p>If someone serves for a while and becomes dear to the community, the church of Ellicken, which has a large income, could make a good improvement, otherwise there is no hope of improvement from the parish: For if my lay lord and his officials notice that the benefice exceeds the assessed corpus of the parish and assistant and the imposed absenteeism, they would understand to claim it. They otherwise intend to incorporate the benefice, which might have already happened if they had not set up my lay letter. Therefore, they have had a register set up, and previously obtained with right and finally with a favorable decision that the assistant's corpus should be: 23 bushels of grain, 4 measures of oats, 7 loads of wine from the Winterthur fair, 15 guilders for hay and straw for a cow. This corpus is better than Wyningen and several more in our gracious lord's territory; yes, one can manage better than an assistant in Turbental and Wental, even if they have more pieces. None of those you have sent to the Rhine Valley, Thurgau, and Toggenburg so far have a better salary, even if they have more pieces in number. Mr. Alexander Schmutz has had 5 children in 7 years and yet proposed 100 guilders. All the burden falls on the pastor. If you consider all this and further that I served in Wyningen for two years and the provision for 7 years for a smaller salary, while I could have obtained better and more peaceful services from our gracious lords and other lay lords in the meantime, you will not consider it unreasonable that a young man also serves me for the mentioned salary for one or two years: for I do not desire it longer. Therefore, once again my earnest and friendly request is that you, dear brother-in-law, do something about the matter, if possible by next Monday. For I intend to travel to Baden with the mother and the whole household the following week (God willing) and to go to you next Tuesday and make a farewell, as the church will be served. May God grant grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mauritz Schneewolff is still in chains. The community is honest and diligent, as much as possible. When the bailiff promised the governor Kamlin to release him if the community brings comfort, they sent an honorable message to comfort; but the bailiff wants written and sealed comfort. Now that the bailiff is here in Einsiedeln and perhaps further away and has returned home, the Steckborn community also sent written comfort (which was not used in Thurgau before) to the bailiff; but he also rejected it and suggested to them to promise and write down 1500 guilders, which burdens them; for he trusts them to punish a whole community for tolerating such a man for so long. The land scribe has accused and charged the community to Mr. Governor Kamlin (Marg.), they are slow with comfort and bear the blame, and that the good lord must lie in chains for so long. The bailiff and his council and all the papists blame the community. He wanted to release a grin, so they do not want to follow with comfort. Thus they mock the church and our Zurich magistrate. The church holds the wolf by the ears (as it is said). They offer a large sum so that they might have him as a shepherd again. But they fear that if they provide comfort, they must ultimately be robbed of him and still pay a large sum: For if ultimately the knot is made, Mauritz Schneewolff should be sent out of the country by court or with open disgrace (such as tongue slitting, whipping, placing on the pillory) - or the community should pay a sum of money and he alone be deprived of his service, they would have to either pay the money or let him be publicly shamed - and still be robbed of him. Therefore, many think they would ultimately do better without comfort. Meanwhile, the good man must lie in chains. Yet he is gentle, comforting, and brave. If it were judged on better and more information, he would go free. We do not think that the court in Frauenfeld can give him a bad judgment based on the interrogated information and all the presented matters; but we fear the 5 places: for the bailiff has sent a runner with letters to the 7 places. The chief scribe and president of Thurgau have uttered such threats that it is easy to infer that they are trying to make Lord Mauritz and his church an example for all the churches of Thurgau and the ministers of Christ, and to instill fear in all and also to weary our Zurich senate, so that the communities and our gracious lords will no longer take care of any preachers.</p>
      <p>But the more harshly they act against him, the more the spirits of many will be exasperated against them: indeed, the spirits of many are already aroused, and in this cause, they have learned more of evangelical truth than before through many sermons. Therefore, we hope for a better outcome. May the Spirit of the Lord be with Mauritz and all the ministers of the church of Christ, we pray. To describe the beginning and the whole process of the case would be long, nor could this paper contain it. However, I believe you (most esteemed relative) have the greater part before; therefore, I do not want to burden you with more now; but I ask that you consider this favorably.</p>
      <p>My mother and uncle send their greetings to you and your family. Farewell, and always keep us recommended to you.</p>
      <p>From Winterthur, hastily, October 2, 1567. Your most observant Johannes Herter.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned, excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his much esteemed father and relative.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger at the Grossmünster in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The case of Mr. Mauritz Schneewolff, who was captured in Frauenfeld by the bailiff Martin Tägen. 1568.</p>
