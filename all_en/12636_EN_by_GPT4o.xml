    <p xml:id="regest1">It is heard that the [army of the Schmalkaldic League located on the Danube] has split into three groups and [Maximilian of Egmont, Count of] Buren, is moving forward to fight, whereupon the Emperor [Charles V] has also set out to come to Buren's aid. It would indeed be good if the badger had come out of its hole! The [Konstanz] council received a letter that might bring more clarity about this. Should this be the case, the Zurich council will certainly be informed. Unfortunately, Blarer has not seen his brother [Thomas] nor K[onrad] Z[wick] since yesterday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Due to lack of time, Blarer encloses the entire letter [of Georg Frölich] with a request for its return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] is dissatisfied that the commanders, who were supposed to take several monasteries [in Swabia], did not follow the instructions. They were therefore replaced.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Konstanz envoy [Ludwig Kürnstaller] sent to Ulm visited the Landgrave's camp near Donauwörth and has since sent a [messenger] to Konstanz, who reported similar things as [Frölich]. The messenger further told of the heavy bombardment of the imperial camp by the Landgrave. The enemy could not be lured out. However, it is claimed that he would have surrendered or fled if the attack had lasted one more day.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should pray. Blarer learned too late of the messenger's departure [...] and should still write to thank Gwalther for sending his "Endtchrist".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>A loud rumor is now spreading: Since our army has split into three groups and is advancing against [Maximilian of Egmont, Count of] Buren, so that he cannot evade (since the three groups are so arranged and renounce all detours, that this enemy cannot escape them), the Emperor [Charles V] has also set out, following ours, intending to rescue Buren, as is proper. It would indeed be good if the badger had come out of its hole! For this plan has been made. But I cannot hear clearly whether this is so, although a post has now come to my lords. I do not know what it brings. If it is so, they will inform yours immediately. My dear brother and cousin [Konrad] Zwick have been here since yesterday and have not gone out.</p>

      <p>I write this in haste. Therefore, I send you this letter in its entirety. Please send it back to me.</p>

      <p>The Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] is dissatisfied that the commanders, who were supposed to take several monasteries here, did not act according to their orders. Some others have now been appointed.</p>

      <p>My lords' envoy to Ulm has just been with the Landgrave near Donauwörth, and now my lords have sent a servant. He reports exactly what you have in this letter. Furthermore, he reports how fiercely and persistently the Landgrave has fired into the Emperor's camp, so much so that it is unbelievable. And it is certain knowledge that if he had continued for one more day, the enemy would have had to surrender or flee disgracefully. But God did not will it. Our people offered great resistance to the Emperor. They ran into the forest. They attacked most fiercely. But they (the enemies) did not want to come out. 17th of September.</p>

      <p>Pray for us to the Lord, as I know you do. I learned too late of this departure, and I should write a few words to Gwalther, who sent me his sermons, in which he proves the Pope to be the Antichrist.</p>
