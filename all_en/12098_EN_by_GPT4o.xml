    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger will likely want to learn more about the preacher dispute [in Bern]; both sides were heard [on December 4, 1544] before the [Great Council] of the Two Hundred; Erasmus [Ritter] presented the statements of the opponents that did not align with the Word of God and the [Bernese] Disputation [of 1528]; they regretted that this was not addressed with them in personal, brotherly conversations; Beat [Gering] wanted to show that in the Lord's Supper, not only faith should be emphasized; he therefore asked [Ritter] what is eaten in the Lord's Supper; when he answered "bread," he declared that he had won and provoked the laughter of the Two Hundred. [On December 5 in the Small Council] it was decided that they would continue to adhere to the resolutions of the [Bernese] Disputation, which are based on the Word of God; accordingly, and in accordance with the [“Cancell unnd Agend büchly” of 1541] and the now re-confirmed resolution [of August 1542], the sacrament of the Lord's Supper should be preached; [Ritter] wants to inquire with the opponents whether they actually intend to follow this resolution? (They have indeed admitted a spiritual enjoyment [before the council]). Should they not adhere to it, [Ritter] would immediately report them to the council. Before the [Great] Council, everything went peacefully; the Small Council appeared more agitated. The letter from the [Zurich] council was received with the utmost goodwill. [The Bernese] would like to see Luther's furious [“Short Confession”]; in the response, only uncompromising truth should be expressed; whether the Bernese should also appear as participants in this response is for the Zurichers to decide. In haste, as Rümlang is very occupied with his treasurer duties. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I believe you, most esteemed Bullinger, have been concerned about the outcome of the dispute among our preachers. It stands as follows: On the day I had indicated to you, we sat fasting, so that the matter might be expedited, until after the second hour in the afternoon. We listened to the controversies back and forth. Erasmus reported that what was brought forth by the adversaries was neither in accordance with the divine word nor with the Disputation; they, on the other hand, tried to overwhelm Erasmus with envy, excusing themselves only by saying that these matters should have been settled in private conversations, and why he had not admonished them privately in a brotherly manner as charity demands, etc. Beat wanted something beyond faith to be required in the supper, therefore it was not enough to believe or have faith; and after a long dispute, he confirmed this by asking Erasmus what we eat in the supper. He responded: Bread. Immediately Beat inferred: "Then I have won," as if he had brought forth something remarkable. This vanity provoked laughter from the two hundred.</p>
      <p>It was therefore decreed that we wish to remain with our Disputation and the conclusions that are supported by the word of God; thus the preachers must teach about the sacrament of the supper according to the sense of our Disputation and the booklet called "Agens," in the very sense that was decreed two years ago, which has now been repeated and renewed in full. Thus, the truth prevailed. But, because they know how to evade wonderfully, so that henceforth they may not be allowed to spew their saliva in the sermon and yet seem innocent, and as if they comply with the decrees, it was advised to Erasmus to now privately ask them whether they intend to comply with this decree and thus teach about the sacrament; for they concede enough to spiritual eating; here they stop and do not add to the sense of the Disputation and the proven truth that to eat spiritually is nothing other than to believe. If they bind themselves to this, well; if not, Erasmus will report this to the council and indicate their obstinacy and stubbornness. They have lost their strength.</p>
      <p>Everything was heard and examined peacefully among the two hundred. The smaller council was more disturbed.</p>
      <p>The letter from your council was also heard, which was written most amicably; it was received and heard with the utmost goodwill and gratitude. Let us pray to the Lord from the depths of our hearts, that He may deign to protect us and enlighten the hearts of our preachers, that they may strive for the truth, etc.</p>
      <p>We would very much like to see Luther's furious booklet. As soon as it reaches you, respond in such a way that only the truth is revealed, and no feeling of indignation; for it is fitting for you to be diligent in defending the truth, and not to overlook it. If it is also fitting for us to be in the same situation with you, so that we may unite, I believe it would not be unwise. But you decide, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your thoughts. In haste, as I am occupied with the duties of a treasurer. Greet all the learned.</p>
      <p>Given on the 17th of December in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>I desire to see how you handle the delirious old Cocleus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and vigilant man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his reverend patron.</p>
