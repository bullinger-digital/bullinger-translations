    <p xml:id="regest1">Since his appointment to the Hessian court, he has been with Landgrave [Philipp], who is vigorously advocating for the Reformation, at the assemblies of Schmalkalden, Zeitz, Zerbst, and Braunschweig, as well as in Thuringia, Meissen, and Saxony; Margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Küstrin supports the evangelical pastors. Melander works alongside his colleague Johannes Pistorius at the court in Kassel; their churches are doing well, and the Landgrave is a devout protector to them, as well as to the Upper German churches. The Danish King Christian III has formed an alliance with [the Schmalkaldic League]; the king's brother [Johann] is being educated at the Landgrave's court by Jodocus Winter. Philipp Melanchthon, whom Melander greeted while passing through Wittenberg, is entirely focused on the welfare and harmony of the churches. The opponents of the Reformation have been making threatening statements since the peace agreement between Emperor [Charles V] and King [Francis I]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Be safe in Christ, most learned and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you are wondering why I have not sent you any letters for such a long time, and perhaps you suspect that I have changed my mind or that you have been erased from my list of friends. But know, my dear Bullinger, that during these three years, since I was called to the court of the most illustrious Prince of Hesse, I have followed the prince to the assemblies of Schmalkalden, Zeitz, Zerbst, and Braunschweig, and through Thuringia, Meissen, and Saxony to the courts of the princes for the sake of spreading the gospel. For our most illustrious prince is wholly devoted to this and strives with all his might to propagate the glory of the gospel as widely as possible, especially among the princes, through whom the fruits of the gospel are passed on to the subjects. And such a pious endeavor has met with success. For Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg-Küstrin, the brother of the Elector Prince, supports evangelical preachers in his very extensive domain, and there is no vain hope that other princes will soon join. Distracted by these travels and occupations, I could not write. Therefore, consider this silence favorably. I will be yours most devotedly, and hereafter, if the opportunity arises, I will make up for what has been omitted with letters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know that I am residing in Kassel, where the court of our prince is and the primary city of Hesse. I have as a colleague Johannes Pistorius, a pious and learned man.</p>
      <p>By the gift of God, the churches are prospering, and harmony is happily succeeding. Our prince embraces the churches and all ministers of Upper Germany with the most ardent love, and his highness deserves that the churches pour out prayers to the Lord for such a pious patron and that the ministers dedicate their pious studies to him.</p>
      <p>The Lord must also be prayed for Christian, King of Denmark, a truly Christian man, who has entered into a confederation with the princes and cities at the recent assembly in Braunschweig. His brother is at the court of our prince and is being educated in piety and letters by Jodocus Winter, an excellent tutor. I was in transit through Wittenberg. There I greeted Philipp Melanchthon, who is indeed wholly ours and strives to promote nothing more than the harmony of the churches.</p>
      <p>The opponents of our religion, since the peace made between the Emperor and the French King, are threatening us with some unknown evils; but the goodness of God will not forsake us, therefore we are not at all afraid.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, and commend me, our prince, and our church to Christ in your prayers, which we also diligently do in return, and continue to hold me in your commendation as before. Again and again, farewell and greet in my name the most illustrious men and lords Leo, Pellican, the old friend Theodor, Megander, and the rest.</p>
      <p>In haste, Frankfurt, 17th of September 1538. Dionysius Melander, forever your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, his superior in the Lord, to his hands.</p>
