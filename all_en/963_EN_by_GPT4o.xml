      <p>What the people of Ulm and Nuremberg were like before, I do not know; this one thing I know and lament, that among them there is no appearance of a church, nor that which I rejoice to be among you, giving thanks to God for such a benefit, I also pray that He may grant greater growth day by day, until we grow into a perfect man, which I trust will happen sometime and that soon. However, here I experience many things, though not among many, and these are not only civil and human, but also Christian and most divine duties, by which they will have me bound forever, so that concerning them, however few, I will never proclaim anything other than what is fitting for those who have embraced Jesus with their whole heart, not only with their tongue, I mean the crucified one, whose members, as they recognize themselves to be by divine grace, so they are not at all afraid to imitate his example generally proposed and to bear constant testimony to the truth by shedding their blood before tyrants and others; thus, despairing of their own strength, they have all their hope fixed in the Lord alone, thus they depend entirely on Him, thus finally they do not doubt at all about His benevolence and eternal favor towards them. Would that in as many as possible, since it is in vain desired in all, there were also much more ardent zeal for illustrating divine glory. From here, however, I will depart as soon as I have found companions to whom I can safely join myself; for I hear that the journey is most infested with robbers up to Leipzig.</p>
      <p>But I am not lacking here in the best friends from both nations who are concerned for my safety; therefore, I will follow their advice, which does not follow from me. If I live, I will write from Wittenberg, where I will spend this winter, unless the Augsburg assembly excludes us all sooner. May the will of the supreme deity always be done in me and all others. Amen. Greet for me my dear Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalter, both noble ones, and with Josias, if he has already returned, all other friends by name, since I love and embrace them all equally in Christ, as many as I know or hope to be loved by Him and received into His bosom. If you have received anything that pertains to me, whatever it may be, I expect you to send it through the people of St. Gallen at least at these Frankfurt fairs, and I ask you to grant me such a benefit, indicating in return that all my effort is placed at your disposal, and what else?</p>
      <p>May Almighty God favor holy endeavors, overthrow the plans of the wicked. Amen. Nuremberg, July 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Lelius Socinus.</p>
      <p>I beg you, forgive me; I will write more conveniently hereafter and will strive to paint better.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most to be observed.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
