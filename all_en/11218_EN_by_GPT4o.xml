      <p>Greetings. My dearest Bullinger, you do well when you add your holy sanctification to the pursuits of good men, so that my marriage may be more auspicious and pleasing to our Lord God. I give thanks to you in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>I know that there is no service more pleasing to my heart than the collaboration of pious men in my endeavors. You act very kindly when you shape the memory of the doctrine in such a way that you wish its perpetual memory to remain with us. I praise the plan, I love the kindness. May the Lord Christ kindle our hearts with true flames worthy of such a spouse through His Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>You will take care of the preservation of our friendship as you are accustomed to. Certainly, this time requires neither common spirits nor small talents nor trivial plans, in order to preserve the Church that Christ has entrusted to us, and to pass it on to future generations in such a way that it can bring comfort to the captive world. The utmost and most solid consensus of all outstanding men is needed for this, my dearest brother Bullinger. I pray to the Lord Christ, the source of all counsel, consolation, and charity, that He may keep us closely bound in His clear truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers there who are dearest to me. Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to send this book of Ptolemy to Vadian in my name. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother. In Zurich.</p>
