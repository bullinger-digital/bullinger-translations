      <p>There is concern that the duke must give a very large estate to the king. The emperor said to him, what he would offer to do and give to the king, that would have some significance, to which he promised great things: he wanted to hand over the castle of Hohentwiel and release some things that belong to it and are pledged; he has also undertaken some other serious matters. The emperor smiled and said: "Oh, that is nothing; if you spoke of half the land, that might have some significance for the king." Thus, nothing came of it; but other things are to be proposed. In Aurach in WÃ¼rttemberg, two women have recently taken their own lives, one of whom was of very respectable appearance.</p>
      <p>All these things with great haste, so that I would not write nothing at all. When Augusta returns, who accompanies Lutius' son there, then more to you about the Emperor and the people of Magdeburg. Let us pray to the Lord, that he may not forever ignore and overlook the injuries and oppressions of his own, but may be present with his most immediate divine power, timely and gracious, and above all, that he may imbue our hearts with his spirit, turning them to him as soon as possible with solid repentance and granting us full confidence in him through Christ, with which we may both despise and overcome the world with its prince.</p>
      <p>I am now entirely occupied with gathering my little bundles and find myself much richer than I thought (as often happens to those who are about to move elsewhere), so that I am quite concerned about how to conveniently transport such a large amount. May the Lord happily direct all these things for the advancement of his kingdom in Christ!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, always venerable to me in the Lord, brother, father, and everything, to whom I commend myself with all yours, as you are accustomed, I know, diligently and most Christianly. In Winterthur, 6 days before the calends of July.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The people of Biel have now summoned me with a second message, greatly desiring my arrival. Our Michael does not want to linger there for a long time, although he could have stayed much longer; he has moved to an estate of a nobleman from Witenbach near the city of Bern, where he will delight himself with pleasant leisure, singing to himself and the muses for a while, until he again works in the Lord's vineyard by the Lord's calling, which I hope will happen as soon as possible! For thus it will be beneficial both for him and for the church to which he will minister; I hear that his family affairs are very distressed, and I deeply regret the situation of the good man; but the Lord, I know, will soon care for him paternally and abundantly.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
