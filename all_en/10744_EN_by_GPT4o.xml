    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter bearer from Altstätten comes to Zurich for his cousin, to have his marriage certified by the Duke's [of Württemberg] embassy, as he was unsuccessful [at the ecclesiastical court] in Radolfzell, with Wendelin [Oswald] in Einsiedeln, and in Lucerne; asks Bullinger to help so that the poor people are spared from excessive fees. Greetings.</p>

      <p>God with us etc.</p>
      <p>To you, my lord, dear brother, a good-hearted man from Altstätten in the Rhine Valley comes to me, who travels and runs on behalf of his cousin, also from Altstätten, a pious man. He has taken a wife. In short, what the dispute (matter of contention) is, for which they are being pursued. Likewise, you also know that all, who soon believe, in the Rhine Valley towards Zell, according to a decision from the eight places or the seven, must be judged. There he also was. Also in Einsiedeln with Wendelin.</p>
      <p>Also in Lucerne. Thus, because they want to seek papal authority there. God have mercy. Now, he says, it is offered to him, he finds Zurich at the "Red House" with the Duke's embassy; he may come if he wants to have the documents certified. However, if he wants to have it certified, first they demanded 30 ducats, then 27, now finally 24 ducats, oh God, with great poverty etc. I ask you to understand and advise, so that, as Paul says, they may come together with God for a small amount of money or more; for it is hard in their ability. Yet such is the love that the woman and the man lay together in bloody sweat, whether they remain with one another etc. As for my advice, he will report to you, if it seems useful to you. Also, that the messenger did not let himself be seen, but if he is in Zurich, a citizen of Altstätten, that he would do as a countryman, as if it were written to him. If he could perhaps do it with a couple of guilders or 2, he would do it. In his opinion, the poor people would not lay further on it. How or which way to advise etc. for God's sake.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your house.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Thursday before New Year's Day in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my gracious lord and friend Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
