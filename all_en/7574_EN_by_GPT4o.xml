      <p>Dearly beloved son, I can write little due to business.</p>
      <p>However, Thretius and Johannes ask you to come to their farewell and make a friendly departure with them.</p>
      <p>Come tomorrow, so that you are here for the supper. On Wednesday for supper, he has invited in the name of all the Poles the ministers, professors, etc. There will be two tables, and he invites you as well. Therefore, come. I am also sending Jos Nagel to you and calling upon you for provisions for two tables, two capons, pigeons, and you might procure birds or quails; everything must be well paid for you.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, you will hear much news and little good. But I will inform you well.</p>
      <p>We all greet you, you, Susanna, Elsie, etc. Given in haste on Monday before Bartholomew 1568.</p>
      <p>Your H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
