      <p>May the Lord Jesus, our Savior, the only salvation and life, comfort and strengthen you, dearest brother Moritz, in true faith! I have read the articles or chapters of your accusation, as well as your responses. And I am pleased with your purity and sincerity. For I am convinced that you do not pretend or conceal anything you have said and done, but act in good faith before the Lord, whose cause this is. Therefore, I urge you by the most sweet and saving name of the Lord Jesus, to persist in the true confession of faith and to confess the truth simply and openly in judgment at the president's tribunal and to clear yourself of slanders and lies. Say that you do not think so wickedly of the most blessed Virgin Mary and the saints of God. However, I advise you to speak cautiously, so that regarding witnesses and testimonies, you do not say bluntly (since they have confirmed with an oath what they have said) that they are lying. But rather say: "I leave everyone to their conscience, what they have testified, and it may be that they perhaps understood me thus; but that I have believed and taught thus, I would be ashamed before God. And my faith and teaching is as I still now confess. If I must then atone for this misunderstanding with body, honor, goods, and life, I commend it to God and would rather suffer innocently than guilty. And here I call upon God, the true witness, who also knows the hearts and thoughts. I also do not want to die as a blasphemer of the worthy mother of God and the dear saints. And I know that I have done them a service and no dishonor, that I have said one should not worship and invoke them, but God, and not them, but the only mediator Christ is our intercessor before God, the Father. And on this teaching, I am willing to die."</p>
      <p>If, due to the harsh testimonies of the witnesses, the judgment of death must be endured, pray to the Lord that you may be of invincible spirit, that you may openly confess the truth and commend yourself to the power and mercy of God. He will preserve your soul in death and will raise the dead body on that day of judgment. Do not, my brother, doubt His help and truth. If you fight bravely, you will be crowned. Praise God with the apostles, that He deems you worthy to suffer for His name's sake. To Him be praise and glory.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you from all evil, and govern you with His Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13th of October, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your entirely devoted Bullinger the Elder.</p>
