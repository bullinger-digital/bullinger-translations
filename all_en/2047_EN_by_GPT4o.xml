      <p> Greetings and Peace. A certain Frenchman, Franciscus, was with me for two days, most pious and eloquent Bullinger, who said he came from you and that you mentioned me to him, which indeed (not to lie) was not unpleasant to me; for thus some favor is returned to us by you. For it seems fair that, since I always remember you, you should sometimes remember us. I do not wish to recount here how much envy I have incurred from hooded monks and even now from mitred ones, because your homilies were found and seen in my library, nor are there lacking here new Codrus (a reference to a poor poet), by whom I am said to be a student of your works, among whom, while I defend your reputation, I myself have now become infamous. But I do not yield to evils, against which I am bolder there. For I have learned that the doctrine of truth has always suffered much from these hypocrites and masked ones, and so I care less for this infamy, which is branded upon me by hypocrites, while they place me among the Zwinglians and in the catalog of Christ's confessors, than for the benefits, which I derive daily from pious and learned writers. Finally, that gospel will not always console: Blessed are you when men hate you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my name's sake. But you, continue to do what you do, always be orthodox; for thus the mouths of even the most shamelessly impudent will be closed, who want you, whether you wish it or not, to be a heretic, although you also have some who oppose these sycophants, among whom if Cousin is not related to you, he is not, I think, a stranger. But I will frankly confess, I do not mention these things to boast of myself to you or to make you my debtor; for I know that I owe you more than I can ever repay. But I did not want you to be unaware of these things and that I, who am and always wish to be, do not seem ungrateful to you, whom I both feel and proclaim to have not undeservedly benefited me, and I will never cease to proclaim it. As for my business, I write nothing yet, because I am still counted among the accused and whether I will bring a favorable or sad letter in judgment, whether I will be acquitted or condemned, is uncertain. Whatever will finally be decided about my fate, I will report in person; for within three months or at most, unless something else happens, four, I will have to go to Germany on a friend's business. Then also in person about these things, which you recently proposed. But I will also use your advice on the condition offered to me by the Bishop of Tournai, d. Wilhelm von Popet, my patron. Meanwhile, my Bullinger, I ask you to remember me in your prayers, a man, if anyone anywhere, most devoted to you, whom I rightly revere even more than a father, from the heart and with all my heart. Please greet your Huldrych Zwingli and Wolfgang Haller for me; but I have greeted others by letter myself. Again, I pray that they may be well, and I wish you to forgive our weakness with your wisdom. If you ever wish to write to me, you may send letters to Basel to our Conrad Lycosthenes or Johannes Oporinus. I pray to God that he may deign to preserve and greatly increase your paternal affection towards us, by which I rightly consider myself exceedingly happy. Farewell, most illustrious Bullinger. </p>
      <p> Given at Nozereth very hastily on the 10th day before the calends of November in the Christian year 1553. </p>
      <p> Most devoted and loving of you, Gilbert Cousin of Nozereth, by my own hand. </p>
      <p> To the most accomplished theologian, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
