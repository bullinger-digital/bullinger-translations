      <p>Greetings. Reverend father in Christ, you would not listen as eagerly as I would diligently write, if I had discovered anything about the council and Italian affairs; but now all is silent, and for these eight days, letters from friends have completely ceased, which I do not doubt are on their way.</p>
      <p>I hear from trustworthy men that the fathers of Trent are sparing no effort to strengthen the tyranny of the papacy.</p>
      <p>There are those who affirm that Cardinal Lorraine, along with another, I know not whom, has flown to Rome; the reason for the journey is not given.</p>
      <p>We all confess that we owe you much, as you do not cease to inform us about French and German affairs; indeed, I am often ashamed of myself, as I have nothing to offer in return, yet I continually draw upon your resources.</p>
      <p>I return all your belongings in good faith and offer the greatest thanks I can; I will make an effort to write something certain shortly.</p>
      <p>I write this now to excuse my silence to you with some honest reason.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, with all your family, as happily and as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 13, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I have included these letters with yours so that they would not be lost alone, and I ask, by your singular kindness, that you ensure they are delivered to Mr. Collin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, equipped with all kinds of learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, uniquely revered.</p>
