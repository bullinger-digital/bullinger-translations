    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has certainly heard about the conversation with the Anabaptists [from January 11 to 15 in Schaffhausen]; [the Schaffhausen pastors] had urged the council to fulfill its duty and take action against the Anabaptists, to which [the Anabaptist leaders] Georg Sattler and Markus Brunner said they could easily point out the pastors' errors regarding doctrine and the administration of church property - provided fair conditions; the synod therefore unanimously called for a conversation and appointed four leaders from among them, with members of the council also to be admitted to the conversation; the Anabaptists, for their part, demanded a public conversation, counting on the support of [Mayor Hans von] Waldkirch and eventually succeeded; the conversation leaders acted clumsily, about which Erasmus [Ritter] will personally report; although a council mandate is now expected after the conversation, nothing has happened so far; Bovillus [Ludwig Oechsli], who was in charge of the conversation, did not want to report the matter to the council despite the pastors' request; if he continues to refuse, they will demand his dismissal from the council, but nothing will happen without consulting Bullinger; further details can be reported by [the letter bearer] Hans Adam Schad. Requests for Leo [Jud's] and Bullinger's notes from [Theodor] Bibliander's lectures on Jeremiah, as Bullinger has already sent them to Berchtold [Haller] on several occasions; he will return them intact. In these days, [Siamese twins] were born [in Schaffhausen], about which the letter bearer can provide more information. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, most distinguished man, that the rumor of our discussion with the Anabaptists has reached you and that we could easily be accused of a rash undertaking, especially without consulting you. But since it could not be otherwise (for they were prowling like wolves among the sheepfolds of Christ, leading away simple sheep so freely that nowhere were they more freely allowed to move and wander), we first approached the magistrate, requesting and beseeching them to ensure that the republic of Christ would not suffer any harm through them. It was decided that they should be put in chains and either corrected or sent away. One or two were presented who were so stupid that you would have called them logs rather than men. The leaders were acting negligently towards the chiefs, and none were offered; for they had withdrawn, leaving their fledglings in the nest without feathers. Georg Sattler and Markus Brunner complained that we were dealing with them under unfair conditions; they were to plead their case in chains from prison, while we were prosecuting them from the comfort of our beds; but if safe conduct were granted, they could easily convict us of error in both doctrine and church administration. Therefore, by unanimous decree of our synod, it was decided to request free access for them from the senate. Four leaders of the discussion were appointed, and if some from the senate wished to attend, they were to be admitted. When we were about to begin the matter, the Anabaptists demanded that it be conducted publicly before the people. They have as their advocate for their cause Hans von Waldkirch, whom the Anabaptist Furies have so miserably afflicted with their whips that he is still not in his right mind, and you know he has long harbored deceit in his heart. The people were admitted, and the meeting took place.</p>
      <p>We have rather unfair leaders, which I do not doubt Erasmus (for we entrusted this matter to him) has reported to you. The truth was on our side, but grandiloquent words, the favor of the Papists and Anabaptists were on theirs. To discerning and somewhat more perceptive men, it was apparent that the Anabaptists were acting with hypocrisy and contention, while we were skillfully handling the scriptures against them. Finally, when the discussion was over and we were expecting a decree from the senate, nothing has yet been done. Bovillus did not want to refer the matter to the senate; we reminded the man of his duty (for he was the leader of the discussion). If he refuses, we will approach the senate and, unless they expel the Anabaptists from the city and countryside, we will request a release from them (unless perhaps you, our dearest brothers, see it differently). For we have turned every stone first, so that we would not be forced to seek the aid of cutting and burning. However, we will not rashly make any changes without consulting you.</p>
      <p>The rest, which either Erasmus did not report or I did not write, can be reported in detail by your fellow countryman, Hans Adam Schad, for he was present at the discussion. He is pious and discerning. You can also confer with him if you have anything that pertains to this matter. But enough about this.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since I have experienced your indescribable kindness more than once, and it has made me somewhat bold, I beg and beseech you to provide me with those things which Leo, a man of pious memory, took from the mouth of Bibliander on Jeremiah, and to lend me your own notes which you dictated on the same prophet; nothing will be altered, nothing changed, nothing interpolated, everything will be returned sincerely and in good faith. In this way, you will benefit not only the church of Zurich but also that of Schaffhausen. I know that you have lent many of your works to Berchtold of Bern; I demand the same from you by the right of charity, if not to repay equally, certainly not to be ungrateful.</p>
      <p>A monster was born among us these days. What it is like, the notary will report if you desire.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long for Christ and His church. Greet in my name Theodor, Pellican, Megander, Fabricius. Lingkius and Gr√ºbellius, my fellow ministers, greet you.</p>
      <p>In haste, Schaffhausen, February 6, 1543. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt, minister of the church of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the man adorned with incomparable learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
