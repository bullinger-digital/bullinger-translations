    <p xml:id="regest1">Is ready to accommodate the [Z端rich students] sent to Basel for 24 guilders per year. Rudolf [Gwalther], who is still with him, should be sent to a more suitable place of study instead of T端bingen. Bullinger should announce Theodor [Bibliander]'s disputation theses [by Karlstadt?], which are even more ridiculous [than those sent on February 26].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Those whom you sent to us, I have detained with me until now and will continue to detain for your sake, unless you think otherwise. I cannot demonstrate my favor towards the people of Z端rich in any other way; for I do not teach publicly except sacred matters, and privately I am not allowed to teach due to private obligations and those I am compelled to satisfy for the church. I can provide food and keep them in a discipline certainly different than if they were with some cobbler or inept colleague. The rest will be taken care of by Mr. Grynaeus, as he has freely promised. The cost of the table will be 24 guilders; for they cannot be sustained here with less money without great loss to the supporter. We write this in time, so that nothing is neglected. For if either the host or the price is not pleasing, you should write back, so that we may see if better arrangements can be made for them.</p>
      <p>And Rudolf is with me, until there is an opportunity for him to leave; for I do not know what he is waiting for. It is truly strange that you do not send such a talented mind somewhere where it would be better provided for. I tell you, my dear Bullinger, that in T端bingen neither studies flourish nor discipline; so affirm those who are most knowledgeable about these matters. I do not say this as if to hinder your decision, as I know it cannot be done, but so that you do not allow the young man to remain there any longer, unless perhaps it happens that it will turn out for his and your good.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else to write now. Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Theodor diligently and tell him to expect the disputation, for which he will laugh much more.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 25, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his venerable Mr. Bullinger.</p>
