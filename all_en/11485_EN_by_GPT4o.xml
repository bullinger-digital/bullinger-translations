      <p>Greetings from Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, I am sending you the sow here - God willing, it would be large, but it is the best - and I kindly ask you (I leave the task of asking with you) to come out this Sunday, as I also intend to slaughter on Saturday; the sows are too costly for me.</p>
      <p>Or, if it is not possible, then come on Monday evening to Hedingen; on the way, you will find yourself at Otthmar's house, and then on Tuesday with me. But I would prefer to have you on Sunday. Then Vogt, Frau Winckelman, Heini Joß will be with me and otherwise no one but you and your people; tell them that.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Michel Widmer will fetch the wine this week or on Monday, as you see fit. Handle Rümbeli as you wish. Farewell, love the one who loves you.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to come on either day, and tell the mother, Beat as well; I will then be more willing to do you a favor.</p>
      <p>Io. yours.</p>
      <p>Tell the mother to buy 1 lot of cinnamon and cloves.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother.</p>
