      <p>Greetings. Your most recent letter, like all your others, has delighted me greatly; for they possess a unique energy of piety. The story about the baker from Wiesen, as I "received" it in writings from someone who witnessed the event firsthand, is included in the enclosed note; you will therefore share the true account with whomever you intend to share it. Merchants confidently assert that the Turkish Emperor Suleiman has passed away, and that his sons are disputing over the kingdom; they further add that the King of Persia is making incursions into Turkey and causing enormous damage, which is why the Turks are seeking auxiliary forces from King Ferdinand with the promise that, once the matter with Persia is settled, they will return all of Hungary along with some other kingdoms to him. Moreover, they claim that a monk, namely Brother Georg, is offering himself entirely to King Ferdinand and will cede to him that part of Hungary which he has occupied until now, at least to make good terms with the son of the late King John. Emperor Charles the Invincible is expected in Speyer and will later visit Strasbourg, unless fate prevents it; thus, everything is proceeding favorably. Almost all the bishops are striving to reform and purify the churches according to the Interim. The Cardinal of Augsburg has vehemently appealed to the council to compel the preachers of the word to submit to him, to receive orders, to repudiate wives if they are bigamists, and to abstain from administering the sacraments in any way other than the Roman rite, with the concession that those who absolutely refuse to repent may communicate under both kinds (after prior confession), with the condition that they believe that under one kind there is as much presence as under two, and vice versa, etc.</p>
      <p>I hear that the council would have easily complied with the bishop, if not for a single Scipio who caused a delay, whose words are said to have had such an effect that envoys have been sent to the Emperor to bring back an oracle on what should be done. Indeed, the people and the priests are breathing hatred and seditions among themselves, providing no small matter. May the Lord of mercies have mercy on us. You will greet him who dwells in the branches or reeds, and all good people.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote both to you and to Froschauer, seeking advice on printing Stobaeus translated into German; if you have replied to this, you will have done me a favor. Farewell. December 5, 1549.</p>
      <p>G. L.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, church servant in Zurich, my particularly dear sir, to be delivered.</p>
