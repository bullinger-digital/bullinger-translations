    <p xml:id="regest1">In his letter delivered by Peter Cyro in December [No. 1701], Curione asked Bullinger to write to Camillo Renato and the Duchess of Ferrara, Renata; Renato should be informed about the host chosen for a young man from Tirano and the costs involved, while Renata should be encouraged towards evangelical purity and given some admonitions regarding her advisors. The plague raged for a while [in Lausanne] but has subsided again thanks to God's grace; if only we were as untouched by diseases of the soul as we are by physical ones! Our churches are besieged by false prophets; may God assist His church. Due to our iniquities, the downfall of the church is threatened; the people are indifferent to the evangelical message, hate good discipline, and still dream of the fleshpots of Egypt; our prophets seek their own interests and not the advancement of the church; Bullinger is asked not only for his prayers but also for wise counsel in these dire times. Laments the lack of correspondence with the people of Zurich and asks Bullinger to write to them, to encourage, admonish, and comfort them; they also wish to strive for contact. Recommends the letter bearer [...], who has only recently found the true faith. Greetings. Requests the [Latin] Bible, [Johannes] Stobaeus’ [“Anthology”] as well as the works of Gessner against payment.</p>

      <p>Coelius Secundus Curio sends many greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I wrote a letter to you, most learned and holy Bullinger, in the month of December (if I am not mistaken) and sent it to Bern to Peter Cyro, the chief secretary of the Bernese council, asking him to ensure it was delivered to you as soon as possible, which I believe he did in good faith. In that letter, I asked you to write to Camillo Renato, who resides in Tirano in the Valtellina, a man of great learning and goodness, and not only to him but also to Renata, the Duchess of Ferrara, a patron of good men and a refuge for the wretched. I wished you to write to Camillo, besides whatever you might wish to say of your own accord, about what you had decided regarding the companionship of that young man from Tirano, about whom I spoke with you in person, and how much that companionship would cost and with whom it would be. To the queen, I wished you to send letters encouraging her towards the purity of the gospel, mixing in some admonitions about the best constitution of a Christian family, especially about not easily believing informers and constantly consulting with learned men and those well-disposed towards evangelical piety. I believe you have either already done all this or (if your occupations have not allowed it) will soon do so diligently, I hope.</p>
      <p>Now, as this brother of ours was making his journey and announced that he would reach you, we did not want to send him off without our letters. My wife, children, and I are well, which we trust and pray is the same for you, your wife, and all your children. This city suffered from the plague for a while, but by the greatest gift of God, it has finally been completely freed from such contagion. If only we were as free from diseases of the soul as we are from those of the body! For our churches are greatly afflicted (which I write with groans and tears) by the movements of false prophets; on one side we are torn by various winds of opinion, on the other we are almost overwhelmed by waves of denunciations and slanders. May the Lord assist His church, command the winds and the sea, and turn this dark storm into serene tranquility, soften hearts, and temper anger. "Unless He does, the seas and lands and the deep sky will indeed carry them away swiftly and sweep them through the air," as the poet says. For I see destruction threatening our churches, and all this because of our sins, yet we do not repent. The people despise the evangelical message and hate good discipline, still dreaming of the pots and meats of Egypt. The prophets themselves, except for one or two, all neglect the work of the Lord, not to say with malicious intent, and all wish to increase their own wealth, not that of the church. Never could such thoughts have come to my mind about the great name of the churches, which I now see and feel. O wretched us, o blind ones, who do not recognize so many and such great benefits of the heavenly Father! And do you think we can be joyful in these circumstances? Not if the Pactolus were to pour out golden sands for us and the ants of India were to swarm in our homes. Therefore, my brother, I wish that you would help us not only with your prayers but also with your most wise counsel.</p>
      <p>For we never hear anything from you, no one comes from you to us, nor do any or very few come from us to you, as if there were a great chasm between us, although we are most closely united in spirit. We have so far imitated little those ancients, whose letters show how many and great were the mutual consultations among them, how they conspired amicably for the concord of the church, for the glory of God, and for the expansion of the kingdom of Christ. Therefore, I, brother Bullinger, especially beg and beseech you to write to us sometime, to encourage us, to admonish us, to comfort us, and that the other brothers, outstanding in doctrine and prayer, do the same. We indeed will diligently strive in this matter, so that we may not be justly condemned for negligence or sloth.</p>
      <p>I commend this brother to you and the other brothers there; he was recently cut off from the wild olive and grafted into the holy olive. You will hear the man and, as you are accustomed to do with such, receive him with love.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Pellican, Megander, Bibliander, Gwalther, and the excellent Gessner and others in my name. All the brothers here greet you, and especially my Viret. Greet, I pray, your wife, a most holy woman, and all your children in my and my wife's name. I expect your letters at the earliest opportunity, which will inform me of everything.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, 4th of the Nones of March 1543.</p>
      <p>Regarding your Bibles, if they have been printed, I would like you to send them to me as soon as possible, along with Stobaeus and the works of Gessner, for all of which money will be sent immediately.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most holy and learned Antistes of the Church of Zurich, most revered brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
