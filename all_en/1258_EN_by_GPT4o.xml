      <p>S. D. Regarding the Italian, things are well, after Reutlinger returned to us from there, he hopes to find someone in Basel who will make use of his services; if this hope also fails, he has solemnly decided to take the young man back to himself. I have no doubt that yesterday Johannes Utenhovius, a young man from Ghent, came to you, whose both parents perished due to the cruelty of the Emperor; the narration of his tragedy moved me to great compassion.</p>
      <p>What you write about the poverty of your people, no one will easily be led to believe that such splendor and luxury are supported by poverty, which usually befits frugality. But I, due to the authority you have with me, easily believe you, especially since elsewhere there is also great luxury among the poor.</p>
      <p>For the writings and letters sent to me, I thank you very much and now return everything to you except those poems about Besolamanes; for I sent them to my brother, who is wonderfully delighted by this kind of writing, as there was someone at hand at that time to deliver them to him, and yet I will soon return them to you; for he himself will be here in the coming days.</p>
      <p>I greatly congratulate Musculus on the generosity of the Bernese and that not regrettable salary, which he obtained through your and Haller's favor and recommendation, a man truly worthy to be helped and loved by all, to whom even the people of Augsburg still owe much and should treat him with greater kindness; but they act according to the nature of the world.</p>
      <p>Regarding the transferred council, I thought you had received some certain information. Nothing certain is written to me about this from anywhere, and led by many conjectures, I judge this to be a vain invention, whoever's it is.</p>
      <p>Here you receive a letter sent to me yesterday from St. Gallen by Erasmus Schlumpf the Younger, who is commonly called Rasimus Schlumpf by everyone, whose note I also thought to send to you, in case you might want to reply, so that you can do so through this man from St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>May the Lord perpetually preserve you and your household safe and flourishing in spirit amidst the pressures and storms of the world, and rejoicing in His peace, with which I earnestly ask you to commend me to the heavenly Father with faithful intercession. Farewell, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, April 29, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Nothing special is written to me from Augsburg, except how the notices are posted everywhere regarding the council, just as you sent me two of them. But many estates will not attend this council, as it was not convened as desired.</p>
      <p>I asked Johannes Utenhovius to come back here before he moves further away from there; for I very much wish to converse with him more familiarly. When you understand that he will do so, please write to me through him, I beg you, about how he conducted himself there, or at least, when it is convenient, let me know, etc.</p>
      <p>To his dear friend, D. Bullinger.</p>
