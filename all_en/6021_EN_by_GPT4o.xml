      <p>S. D. I hope you are well; it is very concerning to me that I receive no letters from you, for I am not accustomed to this. But perhaps you lack a topic; however, the council and Italy, which is abundant, would provide you with one.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I await another opportunity.</p>
      <p>At the Baden assembly, the delegates have been present for many days; what they have done, I cannot easily say; I know that the people of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden have rejected the terms of peace and are imposing new ones, which the people of Glarus reject. There are various rumors; some affirm that they are preparing some kind of disturbance against the people of Glarus.</p>
      <p>If neither justice nor kindness helps, then God have mercy; may He come to the aid of all who are oppressed and humble the intolerable arrogance.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing, except that it is confirmed that the preaching of the gospel is being interrupted. May God grant grace.</p>
      <p>I have a letter today from Augsburg, stating that Wilhelm von Grumbach has been outlawed along with his supporters, that he is beginning to strengthen himself, and so are his opponents. O miserable Germany and even more miserable Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Have mercy on us, Lord, and save us, and do not hand over those who confess your name into the hands of the enemies of the word of God, do not hand us over to foreigners; you discipline us.</p>
      <p>Castellio died in Basel on December 29 of the past year. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that He may keep us from evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 21, 1564.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my most esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
