    <p xml:id="regest1">Follows in his response the order of Bullinger's letter [No. 1825]. Praises the intercession for the beleaguered bishops of Cologne and Münster [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck]. Promises the confidential transmission of the Cologne Reformation draft ["Einfaltigs bedencken"], which Bullinger should show to Theodor [Bibliander] and forward to Vadian and [Ambrosius] Blarer; after the [Cathedral] Chapter has published a counter-statement ["Gegenberichtung"], which is being refuted, the "Bedencken" should, according to the Archbishop's will, only be made public after the Diet [at Speyer]; part of the Cathedral Chapter is resisting the advancing Reformation. Bucer is glad that [the Zurichers] want to let the harmful conflict with Luther rest. No one can dissuade Luther from writing in the spiteful manner lamented by Bullinger, yet despite human weaknesses, he is an outstanding instrument of God; it is regrettable that many imitate his polemics, but it cannot be prevented without harm to the Church. The lack of community among the members of Christ stands in the way of brotherly admonition; even Oecolampadius unsuccessfully strove for a synod encompassing local churches, for which there is no hope today, yet deeper community should be worked towards, as otherwise decay threatens. As long as [the Zurichers] reject the [Augsburg] Confession, Luther will not accept criticism of his harsh statements; only trusted people like Philipp [Melanchthon] can counteract this; Bucer's attempt at mediation in the dispute over the sacraments was based on the desire to counter the condemnation of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, but after his failure, he refrains out of concern for greater harm. Regrets with Bullinger the harsh words of Luther against the authority of the Hebrew Bible, yet Erasmus has hardly spoken more mildly about the Old Testament, and Zwingli also questioned the authority of the rabbis and valued the Greek [Septuagint]; due to the discord of the churches, there is no choice but to entrust such conflicts to Christ. Whether the Diet [at Speyer] will take place is uncertain, after the victorious advance of Emperor [Charles V.] [before Landrecies] has stalled; the Emperor's piety is Spanish-influenced and entirely external, as shown, among other things, by his behavior after the conquest of Düren; Granvelle and a Spanish secretary are his only close confidants. In Regensburg [1541], he would have been willing to make concessions to the German [Protestants] due to the various wars, but this time he acted imperiously until the failure at Landrecies; it is said that he is no longer influenced by his brother Ferdinand's desire for German help against the Turks; the new troop recruitments could give him the pretext to cancel the Diet, or the relocation to Cologne gives [the Protestants] reason to stay away. If the Diet does take place, it would likely be well attended by both sides; characterization of the most important princes and lamentation of their shortcomings. Given the difficult situation of the French, English, and Danish kings [Francis I, Henry VIII, and Christian III], Germany cannot hope for help; it remains only to jointly call for repentance. A joint action against the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is not to be expected. It is all the more important to work together for the kingdom of Christ; Bullinger should keep confidential what Bucer has entrusted to him. Could only find out about [Hans] Wilpert [Zoller] that he left again after a short stay. Asks to admonish the theology student Joachim Forrer, as he refuses communion citing his conscience. It is reported that the Imperial forces have now also abandoned the siege of Luxembourg. Bullinger will receive the Cologne Reformation draft through Blarer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your most welcome letters. I will follow your method by responding. That you continuously commend the pious efforts of the bishops of Cologne and Münster to the Lord in prayer is both most worthy of you and very necessary for the churches. For you easily understand how significant it is for bishops to defect from the Antichrist to Christ and how many obstacles they face in leading their followers to Christ.</p>
      <p>The Cologne Reformation draft is at hand. I will make sure it reaches you, but it should be read only by you and Theodor, and if you have any fellow ministers of equal faith, and then sent to our Vadian and Blaurer. A few, but very fierce enemies of Christ from the highest chapter of Cologne, obtained at the latest provincial assembly of Cologne some more time to examine the reformation book. In the name of the chapter, they presented a virulent writing against that book a month ago, in which they attempt to refute almost everything, and they implored the most holy and good old man not to publish his book, even adding threats. That refutation is now being refuted. Therefore, while a response is being prepared for the chapter and the emperor is imminent, and the imperial assembly is pressing, and the entire Latin Reformation is not yet published, the old man decided to delay the publication of the German Reformation until the end of the imperial assembly, and for this reason, he has solemnly commanded me not to make the book public. Therefore, do not endanger my trust, for this old man is as faithful as he is a religious enforcer from others, I implore you by the Lord, not to entrust the book to anyone except the most faithful brothers who will not boast about this reading. In all the towns and villages, of which there are many, where the reformation has begun, it is proceeding vigorously. But the chapter, aided by the emperor and the city of Cologne, or rather a few small doctors from the chapter, have so far prevented it from progressing. Therefore, the best old man truly needs to be helped by the prayers of all and his entire province.</p>
      <p>That you do not wish to renew the public fight with Luther unless provoked by a public writing, I thank the Lord for our peace. For no one can say how much harm it would cause the churches if war between you were to break out again. I accept your complaint about Luther's bitter and scurrilous writings with equanimity, and I wish I could moderate this manner of writing as much as I desire! I know that this cause of complaint would not have been given to you. But the fact that neither we here nor others oppose this attack, if you know how things stand, you will not attribute it to a misguided affection for the man nor to an unjust judgment about the manner of writing that befits our ministry, but you will forgive this necessity of the church. This man is carried by his own impulse and does not allow himself to be restrained by force or opposition from anyone. Thus the Lord uses him in the preaching of His gospel, in explaining the power of faith and good works, in overthrowing the Antichrist, and has granted him so much faith and authority in so many churches that no one who has heard him in person, certainly a devotee of Christ, has yet emerged corrupted by bad doctrine, who thought he should be opposed, let alone overthrown and removed from his ministry. Many extol him, whom he does not even recognize among his own, and many admire and follow his vices rather than his virtues; but there is also a great multitude of truly holy men who revere him as an apostle of Christ. And indeed, when I remove what is contentious and consider what is interpretative of the scriptures, the doctrine of the first principles of our religion, and the exhortation to duties, I confess, whether by sound or flawed judgment, what is true, I am compelled to agree with those who assign him the first place in these sacred functions. Some human elements are interspersed in these as well; but who presents purely divine things? So, to say it in one word, everything in this man, both private and public, is so arranged that he is regarded as a marvelous instrument of God for the salvation of God's people by all pious and learned men who know him more certainly. These indeed see that he cannot be moved from the manner of disputing he has begun to use, and they do not doubt that they would disturb the church with more serious scandals if they opposed him. Therefore, they bear and minimize what they cannot amend as much as they can. Meanwhile, indeed, the church suffers the harm you write about, that very many ministers strive to imitate this man in nothing more than in the ferocity of condemning and the petulance of reviling. But what can you do, my brother? Who would strive to apply remedies that would double the evil? But I see no other.</p>
      <p>Satan has prevailed over us in one matter, which daily pours out countless scandals. We who minister to the churches are disjointed and scattered in spirit before we have sufficiently known both religion and the true ministry. But the salutary correction of brothers, let alone coercion, cannot be obtained unless the communication of Christ is sacredly established and flourishes among all the members of Christ, especially those who minister to others. But what shadow of this is left to us? Each church is its own, each minister his own; not a few shun every assembly of brothers, any conversation and common treatment about the matters of Christ. We have, therefore, as a body whose members are dislocated, in which none can be moved or helped by another. The Spirit of Christ is the spirit of communication, He wants to use all His members and those joined to each other and rightly coherent. Christ wants His own to be one, as He and the Father are one, and to love each other as He loved us. Hence it is that the apostles themselves so greatly endeavored to act in all things by common counsel in the churches, and made such great gatherings of brothers and communication of gifts. But the Spirit of Christ remains the same and like Himself, no matter how much we vary. Therefore, as long as the Lord grants that we more fully understand the association of His members and more eagerly seek to restore it among us, I fear worse offenses daily. For as you piously write, if we do not correct and restore each other to the duties of piety, divine retribution is certainly to be expected for us, and very severe. But unless we are truly united in the Lord and conspire, whatever correction and restoration we attempt in the brothers will be ineffective. We see that the apostle Paul, however much he was strong in the Spirit of Christ, nevertheless judged the consensus of the brothers necessary in judging 1 Cor. 5 [4f] and 2 Cor. 2 [10]. Would that we all had known the power of this communication as well as it was known to Oecolampadius of holy memory, who at the beginning of the Christian city in Basel also sought to establish the communication of churches through synods. He would have preferred to restore that communication among all churches; but since there was then no hope for more, he strove to restore it among ours, although it did not succeed even among these. I do not write this to suggest that any way remains for us today to restore this communication among churches, but to show why there is such a delay in correcting the vices of brothers, and why even what is attempted in this matter falls so unhappily. But would that I could also arouse as many fellow ministers as possible to explain and urge the right of Christian society more in writings and sacred sermons, if perhaps the Lord grants that even our descendants strive to recover it. For certainly even this knowledge of Christ and discipline that we have received will slip away unless we who are of Christ are more fully joined and compacted like members.</p>
      <p>You write that Luther would not have impunity for such insults to innocent brothers. Let it be so. But who would not prefer that one brother bear his error with impunity than, while exacting punishment from him, to subject many churches to the scourges of the gravest offenses? Believe me, I hold no one so dear nor am I of such a timid mind that if I could, with the benefit of the churches, indeed if without certain harm, there is nothing I would consider less to be left unavenged than to afflict innocent brothers with insults and slanders and to reproach the holy ministry of Christ in any fellow minister. Luther is persuaded to believe that you recognize nothing but bread and wine as symbols of the absent Christ in the sacred supper and that you oppose the true communication of Christ in the supper, which he asserts; as long as this opinion cannot be removed from him, as it certainly cannot while you write what you write and the confession of other churches is not accepted, if we attempt to oppose him in what he judges against you, and to openly reprehend and condemn his judgment, we will achieve nothing other than to provoke him much more against you and to be agitated by him as traitors to the truth and defenders of manifest blasphemy. For he will not doubt that we are in the opinion he condemns in you.</p>
      <p>When moderately and in place admonished by those to whom he gives certain trust, he usually allows himself to be swayed. This is diligently done by Philip and many other good men, and they would obtain much from him if others did not inflame him against them, to whom he gives no less trust than to these. Therefore, what we see as the only thing left to us, we pray to the heavenly Father through Christ that He Himself may gently moderate these storms, and through whom it is possible, we strive to persuade the man to think better of you. Indeed, nothing has hitherto drawn us into the contention over the sacraments than the desire to avert or at least mitigate the dire execration of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. But what have we achieved with our effort? We have doubled the evil. Such is the fate of this man, such is the fate of the church, such is our fate, truly miserable and pitiable, and one that I would wish to be removed at any cost, loss, or labor. Therefore, do not attribute to the neglect of your ministry among us or to the misguided zeal of any man the fact that we do not expose ourselves to such storms, but only to the fear and certain expectation of more serious offenses. What pains you, excellent brother, the writings on the authority of the Hebrew Bible, although I do not remember reading all that you mention in such harsh words in those books, also truly pains me. Although, while he commands everything of the Old Testament to be measured by the faith of the New Testament, he still keeps the reader within certain bounds of truth. The things you recite are very harsh; but how much milder did Erasmus write about the faith of the Old Testament, who almost entirely calls Christians away from its reading as from Jewish darkness? About the points and the authority of the rabbis, what Zwingli, a man always of pious memory to me, wrote and how he exalted the confused version of the Greeks, you know. These things, if solid communication of Christ flourished among the churches and their ministers, could be corrected; now, as we pray to the Lord to avert and remove such offenses, we are left to pray. May He Himself animate our head and unite us both to Himself and among ourselves by His Spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>About the Diet, I do not know whether we should fear anything, because it is very uncertain whether it will take place. The Emperor seems to have promised himself, with such an army approaching, with much greater victory, such consternation in Germany that in this Diet, which he announced before he came to Germany, he would simply command what he wanted. And he would undoubtedly have commanded against which he had experienced the power of Christ. Now, since the Lord suddenly stopped the precipitous course of victory at the beginning and at a town not a town, he seems to hesitate about the Diet. For he has completely changed the mind, whether true or feigned, which he displayed in the matter of religion at Regensburg. With great and truly imperial effort, he tried to deter the Archbishop of Cologne, the Bishop of Münster, and the Duke of Cleves from the gospel. He is entirely of the Spanish religion, which is consumed entirely in hearing three masses daily, saying several rosaries on bended knees before a small image of the Virgin Mary hanging from the curtains of his bed, and reciting canonical hours not understood. When he moved against the Duke of Cleves, he took the Eucharist at Confluentibus. After so few days, with Marcodurum captured and the Italian and Spanish soldiers sufficiently rampant, he soon, however, proclaimed through a public crier that he would pay with the captured one who had taken someone alive from the town. The Bishop of Compostela, an old delirious man and prodigiously hypocritical, the Emperor's almoner, with great pomp returned the bones of saints, which the soldiers had relieved of gold and silver, collected with other bishops and priests to the temple of Marcodurum, while meanwhile a great multitude of women and children perished from hunger and rape at the tent of the Emperor, almost in his sight. The Emperor is of a very sharp mind, a most persistent pursuer of his purpose, of secret and doubtful counsel. He has only two confidants, Granvelle and a certain Spanish secretary, to whom he reveals his plans, but not all.</p>
      <p>At the Diet of Regensburg, he seemed to have adopted the plan to impose the entire burden of the Turkish war on Germany, reconciled by any indulgence of religion, so that he might satisfy the African and French more; for he certainly expected this after the legates of the French were slaughtered, he was already waging the other. In this plan, he persisted, however much the Pope objected, that if the princes of Germany had been willing to assent for the most part, he would have already granted the article of justification, full communion, and the marriage of priests. Therefore, since that way did not succeed, he returned to hope that he would make Germany obedient to him by arms. For he is believed to have had marvelous betrayals from the Gelders. Therefore, to terrify everyone, he initially strove with the greatest efforts, repeatedly declaring that he would declare himself Emperor, and see who would acknowledge him as Emperor. Everything was done with incredible alacrity, he responded in German, reviewed the army himself, arranged the battle line. His words, deeds, countenance, gestures, even largesses, everything was imperial. No one, even those who had been around him for a long time, did not greatly marvel at such alacrity, promptness, sharpness, severity, majesty. Our people and even Catto himself, whom they observe more diligently, were given dubious and imperial responses. But when the course of victory stopped at Landerschi, all responses were more lenient. Then they dared to say to our people that we were greatly mistaken if we thought we could extort anything from the Emperor for the sake of helping his brother Ferdinand with our aid. The Emperor had given up on his brother and had other kingdoms to hand over to him; therefore, he would grant nothing to anyone for this reason. But if the princes of Germany lead the Turkish war, it is not his brother's, but their own, and they should contribute what they have contributed to that war. The Emperor, as the head of Germany, will assist us for his portion. But if the brother is thus abandoned, in what position do you think we are stuck? Therefore, as he is thus disposed and things go so badly with the French, and he does not think it is again necessary to attempt anything about reforming and reconciling the churches, and he sees that fear is lacking, so that any commands would prevail among us, he perhaps thinks the Diet should be postponed until either the fortune of commanding returns or a greater cause urges supplication. Some of his leaders are preparing their soldiers in such a way that they seem to be ready for recruitment by February. If these things are done seriously, not for the sake of showing an empty effort to the enemy, even if the Diet is convened, everything will be in vain. The cause will be alleged: the Emperor has armies to attend to; for he is either preparing or pretending to prepare four. Moreover, it is said that he wants to transfer the Diet to Cologne. Our princes will not easily go there; thus, there will be another cause to dissolve the Diet.</p>
      <p>But wherever it is held, I fear it will be well attended. Some good men have worked hard for our princes to come in large numbers, and for those who cannot come, each to send their serious envoys, not two or three one, and finally to work together and with all their might to have the Augsburg decree, by which Christ has been judged an enemy of the empire for so many years, rescinded.</p>
      <p>For all the secular princes, as they are called, have received the gospel at least in part, except for only two Bavarian brothers, Albert of Mecklenburg, thrice lost, and Henry of Brunswick, an exile. The adversaries diligently gather whatever abbots and abbesses they have to win by votes. But private and earthly causes seem to outweigh this public and heavenly one. We have such pastors that the greatest dissipation seems to threaten us. Our Elector of Saxony is a man of sharp mind and well-wishing to religion, but he often has impeded plans; now also because of the Duke of Cleves, whom he had helped, he is hindered, and he is burdened by the excessive weight of his body. The Elector of Brandenburg, besides good wishes, can easily accomplish nothing, being too easy by nature and utterly oppressed by debt. The Palatine, now old and deprived of the master of the court from Fleckenstein, who long sustained the authority of the palace, will also accomplish little besides good wishes. The Archbishop of Mainz is vain in himself, ruined by debt and pleasures, and serves the Pope. The Archbishop of Trier, the less he is of princely mind, the more he thinks he must rage against Christ. The Archbishop of Cologne, while they can do nothing else, they blame his age and daily throw new obstacles in his way. These are our pillars, which, even if they were more robust, are miserably broken by the treachery of the Archbishop of Mainz alone, the first among them, because he has Trier as an ally and the Palatine and Brandenburg are so weak. The other princes have very few who are powerful in authority or even laboring to be powerful; each cares for his own except for one Catto, who alone can neither by authority nor by strength accomplish what the restoration of our so dejected and afflicted republic requires. The Bavarian William is strong in mind and speech, but he is entirely opposed to Christ and has long exhausted himself with pleasures and pomp. Now he is gathering money among us, which is accepted at a tolerable interest, four percent, while merchants are forced to pay 12 and 8. There is no need to mention King Ferdinand. The cities are not considered, and Mercury ruins most of them. You know how the pursuit of Mammon exhausts all nobility with piety. The Emperor could do much if he wanted to be the Emperor of Germany and the servant of Christ. Such are our affairs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the miserable Frenchman has thrown himself into such necessity that he is forced to use Turkish aid. What kind of aid this is, he now experiences. That Punic fleet acts with Punic faith; it indeed hinders the Emperor, but at the same time, it wears down the strength of the French. Moreover, they capture many boys, which causes horrendous envy for the king among his people. When they could have occupied Nice, they did not want to. The Englishman is ensnared by a marvelous artifice with fear of the Gelders, whose sister he repudiated. He made himself an ally of the Emperor in war. Now he regrets the deed. The Dane, drawn into the alliance of war by the French, is now deserted. You see the ruins of Europe. Therefore, I do not see any counsel left for men by which Germany can be saved from destruction. May the Lord Jesus grant that we consecrate ourselves to Him with all our heart; by this one way, we will escape the wrath of God already burning against us. The times of the prophets are upon us. May the Lord grant that we call to repentance with the same spirit those who are not utterly lost. Let us join our parts, let us join our minds, mouths, pens, as far as possible, so that we may snatch even some brands from the fire of our homeland. As for common aid against the Turk, I do not see an easy way to find it unless a truce is made between the Emperor and the French, and the Emperor himself wants to lead the army against the Turks. I wonder why he so abhors this, when he has done many things bravely otherwise. He certainly performed the deed of a very brave leader at Algiers. Perhaps we are also warned that we cannot resist this scourge of the Lord. To make peace with this enemy will indeed harm less in the present than to wage war, as we are so scattered; but what will happen afterward, Hungary itself being sufficiently confirmed?</p>
      <p>You have what we have learned about the Diet and the entire state of Germany, sad and miserable. Therefore, all the more, whoever we are of the Lord, let us unite and help each other to restore His kingdom among us. In this, may you be well and take everything in good part and keep it to yourself alone.</p>
      <p>You see how freely I have poured everything into your bosom as a most faithful brother. I diligently inquired about your Wilprecht, but I could not find out anything about him other than that there was such a person here and, not finding anyone with whom he could stay, he left again.</p>
      <p>There is still something else I ask of you: We have here in our theological college a young man otherwise good and obedient from Winterthur; his name is Joachim Furer. He, although admonished, did not want to communicate with our church. We explained to him that we do not place any presence or eating of Christ other than that by which we live in Him and He in us. We do not detract anything from the truth of the human body or the heavenly glory of Christ the Lord, etc. We asked him to show what he desired in either the doctrine or administration of our Eucharist. I, if I were to come to Zurich or Winterthur when the sacred communion was held, could not abstain from it unless I wanted to make myself guilty of rejecting Christ in these churches. Meanwhile, the good young man boasts of his conscience and says he wants to communicate gladly with you and where this matter is administered according to Scripture; but when asked what is said or done among us concerning this mystery that is contrary to the Scriptures and alien to a good conscience, he is silent or says he is not able to dispute with us. But you know how much of a scandal this is. I ask, if you can, to admonish him here of his duty, that he either reveals his scruples to us or stops excommunicating our entire church.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 6th day before the Kalends of January 1543.</p>
      <p>Now it is also reported that the siege of Luxembourg has been lifted, provisions have been brought into the town by the French, and the imperial forces are withdrawing.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>You will receive the Cologne Reformation draft from Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Greet all the fellow ministers courteously in the name of all of us here.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his esteemed and dearest fellow minister and brother in the Lord.</p>
