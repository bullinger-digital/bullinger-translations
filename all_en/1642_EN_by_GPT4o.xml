      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Your letter dated May 5th was finally delivered on May 15th, most esteemed brother. You rightly reproach me for writing rarely; for I have always been sluggish and inept at writing letters. A month ago, I sent you a letter through a certain student from our region; but I fear it has been lost, as I could not gather from your letter.</p>
      <p>I had written about our bishop, about Celso Martinengo and Vergerio; but I suspect they were not received by you. The Council of Trent has ended. The hail has struck there.</p>
      <p>Traversus wrote to his son as follows: "Our bishop has returned, he remains quietly within his little skin." No session was held in May. The high cost of grain renders us impoverished. We must buy everything, there are no returns from the grain; in the Insubres region, they are bought more cheaply, but the tolls are excessively burdensome, so they cannot be transported to us. We have little from Italy. The Pope lifted the siege of Mirandola; the governor of Milan restored it. There are great disturbances everywhere; God knows the outcome of them. If you have anything, you would kindly share it with us as usual. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, May 17, 1552. Philippus, Heimius, and Pontasella greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and esteemed brother.</p>
