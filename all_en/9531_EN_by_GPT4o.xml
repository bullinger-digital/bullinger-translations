      <p>From the Palatinate, April 2, 1574.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland has complained to the Archbishop of Mainz about how he was treated in Heidelberg, saying he would give a ton of gold to have never gone there. He has indeed sworn an oath (he had it done quickly) that he would allow Lutheran heretics in Poland to remain peacefully in their religion; but if he comes in and is crowned and confirmed as king, he will deal with them just as in Paris; the Pope can absolve him. And he has written all this from Poland to the Archbishop of Mainz.</p>
      <p>When the Elector Palatine learned of this, he urgently informed the estates in Poland before the coronation day, which was set for March 4, to act accordingly. This was reported by Doctor Hieronymus Zanchus.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph's Palatine troops are said to still be stationed between Liège and Maastricht; what they are waiting for and what their intentions are is a great secret.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I read a letter written by an Albanian.</p>
      <p>The letter states that the Prince of Orange has taken all of Zeeland and all the ships on the sea from the Duke of Alba; if the King of Spain does not soon send an armada, the Prince of Orange will remain victorious at sea. On land, they are still strong enough against the Prince; but he does not want to be found on land. 500 citizens are said to have taken the castle in Antwerp and wanted to hand it over to the Prince, but they were captured; some think this is blamed on the citizens so that there is a reason to plunder and pay themselves.</p>
      <p>My colleague appeared during Lent at Master Eusebius Kleber's, formerly a preacher in Memmingen, now a pastor in Hentschusheim, one mile from Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>He informed me that our gracious lord had sent a serious letter to the people of Memmingen, reminding them of their confession, which they submitted to the Emperor in 1530, and since Eusebius taught nothing different, why was he given leave? Finally, he urged them to recall and accept him. They replied that a dispute had arisen among their church servants, so they sent Doctor Schmidlin, who advised them to give Kleber leave, which then happened. However, the Elector wrote to them even more seriously, asking if they wanted to disgrace their elders, who believed wrongly; it was a bad situation for them; why did they bind more faith to the unknown, displaced Schmidlin than to their learned and pious countryman; they should therefore accept him again. The people of Memmingen have not yet given him an answer, but they are said to say that the devil has sullied them with Schmidlin; they wish they had never called or seen this liar.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Elector wrote to the Prince of Württemberg regarding Schmidlin: first, he was astonished that his princely grace allowed Schmidlin to let such defamatory books, as the other sermon on the Lord's Supper held in Memmingen, go to print. It was against the concord agreed upon by all the princes at the wedding of Casimir in Heidelberg. Also, his electoral grace had made their confession known in Augsburg before all the estates of the empire; they had been left to it and could not remain untouched by this liar along with many other Christians. If he did not shut his shameless mouth, he would be forced to take other measures, etc.</p>
      <p>In response, the Prince of Württemberg summoned Schmidlin, seriously presented the matter to him; how Schmidlin excused himself or how he will conduct himself thereafter, time will tell, etc.</p>
      <p>Someone from Vienna writes to a prominent citizen in Bretten that the Muscovite has renounced the Polish king, is marching back in; the Polish king only has the papists supporting him, there is great concern that the Poles themselves will kill him.</p>
      <p>The young Rabus has released a sharp defamatory writing against Doctor Marbach on 35 large sheets; if I had sent it to you, I have lent it to Durlach.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Swiss guards of the Polish king have been quartered in the executioner's house in Frankfurt, etc.</p>
