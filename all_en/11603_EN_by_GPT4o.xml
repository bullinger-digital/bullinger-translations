    <p xml:id="regest1">Can now - after the return of his brother [Konrad] - report more precisely than [after mid-July, No. 1546] [about the Diet of Regensburg]; requests the return of the summary [of the farewell], which may, however, be copied and shown to the brethren; reliable reports will surely appear in time for the [Frankfurt Autumn] Fair. The reason for his inquiry about the number of pastors in Zurich was efforts to reduce the number of pastorates in Konstanz, citing the example of Zurich; certain people wish to benefit from the church properties themselves. The death of [Simon] Grynaeus has caused consternation; with [Juan] Luis Vives and Grynaeus, two men have died in quick succession who even surpass emperors in significance. Greetings; Pellikan and Leo [Jud] should also read the report. Ambrosius [Blarer] was ill but has recovered and sends his regards. Recommendation for Wilhelm [...], who seems to have come to insight through the hardship he suffered.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I could not recently provide clearer information to you, dearest brother; now, after my brother's return, I send a summary, which in my judgment is clear and true enough. I earnestly ask you, by charity, to return the copy; however, you may transcribe whatever you please and present it to the other brothers to read, although I am quite convinced that the upcoming fair will provide something from which we will have the most certain and clearest information.</p>
      <p>The reason I recently wanted the ministers of the word to be confirmed by you was that some among us have openly declared that there are only two or at most three fellow ministers in your city, and from this, these jesters have tried to argue that either the number of ministers among us should be reduced or at least, after one or two have passed away, no one should be substituted in their place. Therefore, you have done me a most pleasing service by diligently describing each one; for there are many everywhere who would prefer to feed themselves with the church's goods gathered from everywhere rather than provide for posterity.</p>
      <p>We are exceedingly dismayed by the death of Grynaeus. The eclipse has taken away two men to whom no emperors can be compared, that is, Ludwig Vives and now our Grynaeus. May God have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers and the whole household. Give the document about the diet to Pellikan and Leo to read. I wish your entire household well.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, August 29, 1541. Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius was seized by a fever, but the Lord has restored him, and he sends you his most respectful greetings.</p>
      <p>I wholeheartedly commend to you that brother Wilhelm. He seems to me to be a different person than he once was; hardship has given him understanding.</p>
