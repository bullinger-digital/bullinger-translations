      <p>Greetings through Christ our only Savior, etc. It may be, most beloved lord and father, that your reverence is surprised by my humble, unknown writing; your reverence's dear brother-in-law Johannes Jakob von Nollingen has encouraged me to do so, because he has shown me your reverence's willing, inclined, friendly, and familial heart towards many, which has now caused me, humble as I am, to write to your reverence. The foremost thing I wish to inform your reverence about is that my strength is failing due to the daily cries of several highly esteemed preachers against the true clear understanding of the Lord's Supper. I would gladly, God knows, increase the prayers of the pious, that God would enlighten these people, so that one might freely teach about the Supper without fear in all places. Although, God is my witness, I have never been afraid in this matter, but have openly taught the truth, as all the pious know (such as the honorable Georg Leto, who, as I have heard from him, is well known to your reverence; for I am an assistant in the place where he resides). However, I must bear much enmity, as people want to consider me dead, since I was in Switzerland 13 years ago. But if we persist with patience and diligent perseverance in our teaching, I do not doubt that God will... according to His help, especially when the Book of Concord becomes known and revealed to many, etc. May Almighty God extend your reverence's life long with blessed prosperity, amen. I beg your reverence, for God's sake, to take this my writing in the best understanding.</p>
      <p>Given on the 21st of May in the year of our Lord 1555 in haste. Johannes Bechlin: collaborator of the church in Gundelfingen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most dear lord and father.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
