      <p>Greetings. The reason, dearest lord and godfather, that I have not sent you any letters until now is partly because nothing seemed worthy of writing, and partly because I was hindered by the illness of Lord Jakob Frank, my esteemed colleague and brother, who has been gravely ill with pleurisy in Schwanden for almost 14 days. I have faithfully attended to him and administered to him as a brother, as much as I could. God has indeed heard our prayers and those of His church, so that he is now beginning to feel somewhat better. Otherwise, both the doctor and all of us had given up hope for his life.</p>
      <p>Recently, as you know, I asked Lord Consul and Lord Chief Scribe and other good men to kindly provide me with some grain at a lower price in my necessity, before the frost sets in and the lake freezes over. They promised all their efforts; but so far I have received no response.</p>
      <p>The Lord President of the offices also said he would tell another of my brothers what I had obtained from them; but I wait in vain and am greatly disappointed by those holy promises, which I received from the beginning of my departure and also in the meantime. If the other Lord Consul has given you any response, you can let me know and you will do me a favor.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, this document, which I have enclosed, was sent from the leaders of our region from France, which I wanted to add to my letter so that you may understand where the Swiss soldiers are stationed, as various rumors about them are being spread here and there. Please consider this favorably and continue to hold me in your highest regard.</p>
      <p>My wife and all my children send their greetings to you and all yours. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, in Glarus, November 18, 1573. Johannes Hug, your godfather.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
