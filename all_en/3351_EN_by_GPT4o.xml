      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Reverend man and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Since our colleagues did not succeed in having us approve the condemnation of your churches, they separated from us and presented it privately to the judge Julius, from whom they requested that it be publicly recited in the assembly.</p>
      <p>However, the judge showed such moderation that he did not want it to be recited in the assembly. Afterwards, they departed from here.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, we doubt whether the initiated discussion will proceed. However, whatever the outcome will be, I hope wise men will not disapprove of our stance, because we did not want to immediately confirm the idols and murders of the pontiffs without the matter being debated and explained. But I pray to the Son of God to guide us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and happily.</p>
      <p>On the 5th of October.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all of you and especially to Peter Martyr and Lelio. Philipp.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man distinguished in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
