    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has full confidence in Ambrosius Blarer, that he adheres to the true doctrine; this is also confirmed by Bucer and several pastors from Württemberg. One of them, who was previously a pastor in the Zurich area, brought good news about the virtues of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg and the Zurich-friendly attitude of almost the entire nobility; when this pastor professed the Zurich doctrine of the Lord's Supper, Erhard Schnepf took it with equanimity. Bucer received a friendly and reassuring letter from Melanchthon. Blarer is against Andreas Osiander's appointment to Württemberg. Bullinger intends to write to Myconius soon about Bucer's booklet "Report...". Now he sends Myconius his "Assertio" on the two natures of Christ with explanations on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Best wishes for the completion of the spa treatment.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most excellent, venerable brother, I have a good opinion of Ambrosius Blarer, both because the brothers returning from him promise the best things and he himself, in letters written to us, bids us to hope well. He solemnly asserts that he has changed nothing in our opinion, indeed in the common confession of truth. Bucer also testifies the same, as do the ministers of other churches throughout Swabia in letters written to me. Recently, a man both pious and excellently learned came to us, who has hitherto been a minister of the word in the Zurich area, but is now appointed over a not insignificant church in the Cheruscan region. He extolled certain marvelous virtues in the prince, asserting that almost the entire order of nobility stands on our side, having openly confessed our confession of the Eucharist in the presence of Erhard Schnepf, which he received with equanimity. Bucer writes that Philipp Melanchthon wrote to him in a most friendly manner. Blarer would prefer someone other than Andreas Osiander to be appointed, but he says there is no danger to us from Philipp, etc. We must pray to the Lord that he may bring all things to the glory of his name.</p>
      <p>We will shortly respond to Bucer's booklet. I now send our Assertion on the two natures in Christ, at the end of which we have noted a few things about the Eucharist. I beseech you to commend us in your prayers and counsels, and we wish that you, healthy and living to Nestor's years, have returned from the spa.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, venerable brother in the Lord. I could not write more now.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 4th of October, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, most vigilant overseer of the Basel church, brother in the Lord, to be greatly respected.</p>
