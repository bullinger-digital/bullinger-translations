    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. [Johannes] Haller has, for unknown reasons, not yet received the letter [No. 2494] to be delivered by the young [Hans Rych].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Frölich is pleased with the friendly attitude of Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen towards Augsburg and expects good things from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The people of Augsburg have enough troops and are now waiting for the arrival of Joshua, i.e., the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] with his cavalry. All possessions of the Bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] and the Cathedral Chapter of Augsburg are in [Schmalkaldic] control.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- So if the Catholic [Nine] places [of the Confederation] recall their [mercenaries], it does not matter as long as the pious remain! The ten [Confederate] banners are highly praised!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller and [Hans Wilpert] Zoller, who is now in [military service], are well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- May the Lord punish the godless! They have always wished for the downfall [of the Protestants], although the latter would do them no harm as long as they do not attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, and [Theodor] Bibliander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich will keep Bullinger informed.</p>

      <p>Dearest lord and brother, your letter has reached me well. However, what you wrote to Mr. Haller through a young man, he has not received. This is a concern for us. We both do not know what the reason might be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I feel your friendly Christian will from Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen towards our part, and I rejoice in it from the heart, for much good will come from it in time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have, praise God, enough troops, waiting only for our Joshua, the Landgrave with the cavalry. He is on the way. After that, the matter might become serious. The possessions of the Bishop of Augsburg and the Cathedral Chapter have all submitted to these estates. It matters little to us, even if the papal places recall their own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If only the pious Christians remain! People say wonders about how disciplined and capable the people are. They have ten banners.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Everyone here is still upright (well), Haller and Zoller; only Zoller is now out in the field, and indeed he will see something brave.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now no more, except that I call upon God, our kind Father, and heartily ask Him to punish the godless. Yet may He also have mercy on our shortcomings! They have always sought our soul and body. We do not desire their misfortune, as long as they do not attack in the present.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Greet for me the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, Gessner, Bibliander, etc. 24th July 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>What happens, you shall know in due time, etc. Yours sincerely, G. Laetus.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the Christian church leader of Zurich (Antistes), my beloved lord and brother, to be delivered.</p>
