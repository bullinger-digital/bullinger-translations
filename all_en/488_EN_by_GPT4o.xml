      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. If you are well, most esteemed lord and godfather, with your dear wife and your entire most fortunate family of children, it is well, and by divine mercy, we are all in good health. I hope you have received all our letters, which have informed you of the success of our journey in all respects up to Mainz. We arrived in Cologne on the eleventh day of April, having encountered nothing of adverse fortune while sailing, except contrary winds and storms; nevertheless, we arrived safely. On April 8, two other ships suffered more severe misfortunes, namely shipwreck, and all the people they carried were overwhelmed by the waters. During the recent carnival here in Cologne, two other ships suffered the same misfortune: one had 28 people, the other 12. No one escaped alive from the waters except two sailors. I have nothing to write about the affairs of England, except that the gospel of our Lord Christ is taking deeper root there every day. The Admiral has passed away. He was beheaded and then divided into four parts: with what difficulty he endured death, Mr. Johannes Utenhovius, who brings you this letter, will explain the whole matter to you in person. When he comes to you, receive him with your usual humanity, which the land of Switzerland customarily shows to all foreigners. He is a man of noble birth and virtues, very sincere in true religion, and completely free from the perniciousness of sects, very dear to me and my wife and bound by long acquaintance and friendship, furthermore very familiar with Mr. Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to commend him to you further. His excellent virtues and remarkable learning will commend him sufficiently to all pious and learned people: he comes to you at our suggestion, to hear sacred sermons and theological lectures, and to see the use of the holy supper, which among you is as simple as it is pure. He will stay with Mr. Butler, an Englishman, his old friend. How much he has suffered for the gospel of Christ from the Emperor, there is no need to write anything at present. May the Lord keep you all, your church, and your republic. My wife, little daughter, Stomphius, Martin, and Joanna send their respectful greetings to your excellency, your entire family, and all other pious men of your church.</p>
      <p>Cologne, April 14, (1549).</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellency, JOHN HOOPER.</p>
      <p>I send you a summary of the doctrine of the Eucharist, which I know will please you. See that he meets and befriends Mr. Gualter, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gnasner, and others. I would write a common letter to the entire assembly of learned men in Zurich, if I had the time, for the sake of this good brother.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant president of the most pious church of Zurich.</p>
