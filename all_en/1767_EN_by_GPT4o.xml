      <p>These letters, which I send, pertain to a good brother exiled for the sake of the gospel. Therefore, I beg you, Heinrich Bullinger, ensure that they are delivered to him. Farewell and be well. I wrote to you about Camillo; if you neglect it, I see everything in such a state that he will triumph with his poisons. I solemnly affirm that this will happen to the great ruin of the pious and of piety. I do not cry out in vain; he has powerful supporters who can use golden shields; indeed, the situation has come to this.</p>
      <p>I am here in greater dangers than ever before; indeed, even some of the brothers have conspired against me with the papists. The devil cannot bear that the Valtellina Valley has been opened to the gospel. But the Lord is more powerful, in whom I trust.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, the day before the calends of December 1552. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, honorable lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
