      <p>Greetings. I learned from our mutual acquaintance that you, most esteemed and dearest Calvin, are in good health, for which I congratulate you and wish it to be long-lasting. We are all also in good health here, thanks to God. In Chur, within 9 weeks, the plague has claimed 1100 lives.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing that in such a small town and in such a short time so many have been taken. Among them was Mr. Johannes Blasius. Mr. Johannes Comander also fell ill, but recovered through Christ. In the vicinity of Chur, many are dying. We are still free from that plague. The Emperor in Augsburg desires by all means to extract from the princes and estates of the empire consent for the continuation of the Council of Trent: also assistance against the rebels. He presses on some other points, and I hear there is no one who opposes him. On August 14th, Spanish soldiers plundered the so-called house of sacred assemblies behind the church of St. Ulrich. Some of them were captured, but many believe they will be released from prison without punishment. The Papists are becoming fierce and threaten extreme measures. They say the Emperor is entirely focused on making Magdeburg an example for all rebels.</p>
      <p>However, he does not know that He who keeps Israel lives and is strong. It will be our duty in these troubles to offer fervent prayers to the Lord, both for those in danger and for ourselves: and then to steadfastly perform our duty by speaking and writing. I send to your piety the fourth Decade which I composed this summer, not because I think you need it, but to testify my goodwill towards you. The brothers greet you. May Mr. Nicolas Gallasius be safe with all good people.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your household. ZÃ¼rich, August 30, 1550.</p>
