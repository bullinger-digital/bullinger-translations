    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends Nicholas [Partridge], John [Butler], and William [Woodroffe]. Concord is achieved if [the Swiss] accept what does not contradict the [First Helvetic] Confession; the publication of letters [by Oecolampadius and Zwingli] along with an apology written by Bibliander only caused displeasure because it was untimely. Warns against taking sides against the French King [Francis I]. Hopes for a renewed meeting and asks for trust in [the people of Strasbourg].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, most learned Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I commend to you these three Englishmen, who seek Christ. Especially Nicholas seems to be a young man of uncommon promise. John also burns for Christ, but he has been away from letters for too long. William, in his own way, will also strive to benefit the kingdom of Christ. They have been with me for a month.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I commend to you the concord of the churches, which is perfected if you sustain yourselves to accommodate your own confession in all things and not reject what truly holds the same with it. I think your prudence has long understood why so many were so greatly offended by the work of the letters and how untimely many things in Bibliander's apology are, even if, as far as the controversial doctrines are concerned, we desire nothing.</p>
      <p>Some report that the cause of the Emperor is highly approved there and that of the French is disapproved even from the pulpit; indeed, I do not know whether I should believe it. In causes that pertain neither to the religion nor to the public affairs of Germany or the Christian world, I would not think it our duty to pray for monarchs to have a mind averse to those tumults and devoted to their vocation. Certainly, I consider that any war to which a Christian prince is not driven by his vocation should be deprecated by us. I also think it pious and humane to favor every highness, so that they may maintain their place given by the Lord without the inconvenience of others. We who are of Christ must honor the Emperor with necessary piety as our prince. Meanwhile, however, to a prince of such a great kingdom as the kingdom of France, so close to us and endowed with such religion and humanity, that it would be more pleasing to serve him than any other nation, if service is necessary, from whom Germany receives not a few benefits, we seem to owe prayers that he may think rightly and not destroy his Sparta. I also think the causes among such great monarchs are very complex and cannot be easily judged by us, especially while the public affairs of Germany or the empire are not at stake. Here, by the grace of the Lord, as we are strangers to those private affairs of kings, so we wish peace for the wretched French and Italians, safety for our blood endangered on both sides, and we pray for glorious peace for Christ, beneficial to the Emperor and harmful to no one.</p>
      <p>So that I may not write to you now without any reflection, I was pleased to add this: The cause of concord requires a meeting. Would that it were as delightful for you to meet with us as it is for us to meet with you! In Basel, you boasted of the fruit of the meeting. Bear to believe that we seek Christ and that He, acting for His cause, will always be in the midst of us. If Pellicanus testified there what he did here, of which I do not doubt, I hope you will not be averse to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well with all the saints there.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 8th August 1536.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, M. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
