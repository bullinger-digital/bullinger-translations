      <p>Most revered lords and teachers, I consider nothing more honorable and more useful for preserving the holy unity in the church of God than if the younger ministers in the church allow themselves to be guided by the counsel and assistance of the elders and seniors in serious matters of religion. Therefore, since a grave matter now falls upon me, I wished to implore your assistance in the common necessity of the church, not doubting your piety, that you will willingly assist me. Last year, I published in our lower language a disputation which I held three years ago in Wismar with Menno (Simons) about the holy incarnation of the Lord Christ. This little book, since it recalled many from the error of Menno or at least made them doubt his doctrine, he wrote another book against mine, filled with many insults (of about ten pages) in which he extensively treated the matter of the Lord's incarnation and frequently denounced our doctrine, which is that of the whole church, as antichristian.</p>
      <p>Unless a solid response from the scriptures is given to this book, there is a fear that many simple people may be seduced by his book. Therefore, all the brothers urge that I respond as soon as possible, which I do not dare to refuse because of the present necessity of the church in these parts of ours. However, I did not want to undertake such a great matter, which concerns all the churches of Christ in common, at least at my age, without consulting you. I have therefore collected the sum of all his arguments and reduced them to these headings and sent them to your lordships. Through Christ, I ask that you do not find it burdensome to go through them and to write to me your opinion on the more difficult arguments as soon as possible through your letters. For I do not dare to delay my response for a long time because of the glory of the enemies and the insults they cause to the pious. There is hope, if the Lord grants, that if a solid response is given to him now, Menno's kingdom, which extends widely throughout all of Belgium and the eastern cities, will be considerably diminished, to the greatest increase of the church of God, to the promotion of which it uniquely befits us to be wholly devoted, so that we may comfort the faint-hearted and shut the mouths of the adversaries. You will forgive my pious boldness in this so useful and necessary matter for the common church. I do not wish to plead much for the fault of this boldness of mine with you, not doubting that such my zeal will be most pleasing to you for your piety. Our churches are now, by divine benefit, in a peaceful and good place. A consenting colleague has been added to me, and I expect a third daily. Also, every day some defect from Anabaptism to our churches. May the Lord keep you all safe for a long time, most closely united in holy concord for the edification of his church.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, my most venerable and most revered lords and teachers. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Norden, Friesland, April 12, 1557.</p>
      <p>Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most holy men and most faithful ministers of the church of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, and Doctor Peter Martyr, my teachers to be revered in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
