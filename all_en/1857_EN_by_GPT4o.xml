      <p>Greetings. My colleagues, most honorable man, have understood your letters, and first, regarding Keller, it is not hoped that our most esteemed magistrate will accept him: for he has already informed the Bishop of Constance by letter that he does not want this Jacob for certain reasons, but will elect another and offer him to the same as a candidate. Now, what the bishop will respond is awaited. However, regarding Vinsler, we suspect that he will defend his case in such a way and nullify his error in such a manner that he will try to convince everyone that he has been treated unworthily and unjustly by both the magistrate and the ministers of the word, directing everything to make it seem that only the ministers of our church are to blame, who, moved by envy and some unknown passions, have managed to remove him from office. But what then, all those who generally sin always try to diminish or nullify the committed sin, so that it fits everyone (which I also included in my previous letters): if you did it, deny it. But what you, most learned man, strongly desire, that his case and the whole matter be described in German, for what purpose you do this, is unknown to us.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we believe that in the letters sent to you not long ago, everything has been sufficiently explained to your humanity in such a way that the whole case is now very well known to you, and that you can also conveniently present it to others, so that it becomes clear that Vinsler is bearing penalties worthy of his sin and perhaps even more severe than he deserves. But if he is not content with these (which you can indicate to good men and about which trustworthy people have informed you) and wishes to stir up hornets and poke the fire with a sword (as they say), he will do so at his own risk and peril.</p>
      <p>For we will demonstrate that for several years he has been admonished and discouraged in the synod for some rather dishonorable deeds; amendment was always hoped for but never followed, indeed he continued to increase his personal wealth through bad practices, and therefore, if our synod had as much authority and power as yours, he would have been rejected long ago. However, because our senate has spared him until now, we were almost compelled to bear and admit him, until finally he transgressed our magistrate's decree on selling grains and was therefore fined and removed from office.</p>
      <p>And this is the very cause of his rejection, for our senate knew nothing else about him, except that he was sometimes casually admonished by some ministers, asking how long they would tolerate someone who constantly claims to have only lent to our people and who secretly seeks other positions, which if he obtains, he will abandon this church, whether it is cared for or not.</p>
      <p>However, after he was rejected by the magistrate, without the knowledge of the ministers of the word, and there was a danger that the magistrate, perhaps persuaded by the prayers and intercession of others, might receive him back, the preachers urged the magistrate to persist in the decision once made; for there are also some other things unknown to the magistrate, for which he rightly deserves to be deprived of his position. For they were avoiding another scandal, which he caused in the forum of Tiberius, and also the inconvenience he added to some good man, by selling him a disreputable drop of wine, for which he was taken into custody, because of the surety for a house or barn, which he had to leave behind, namely the surety, although it was returned to him, but with great damage. And when this was reproached to him in our synod and many brothers doubted whether he acted in this way, he defended his case in such a way that he was suspect to everyone, indeed it was clear to everyone that he was guilty. Unknown frauds, which he used in the leasing of grains, from which a great rumor arose, bad dealings, receiving goods back. Also deceit in the sale of wine, as he sold his wine as if it were grown in the Zurich dominion; for it gives no toll, so that he might get rid of it more easily. It is almost a capital offense, but you can conveniently propose it, so that he does not fall into some more serious evil. But why am I bothering your humanity with many things, when I have already informed you of all these in my other letters; if you have not understood them well because of the unpolished style and poor coherence, we ask you to return them and everything will be explained more fully either in Latin or German, if you inform us what you desire in them. For otherwise, I do not strive to give you polished and Ciceronian letters, and because familiar letters should not be written with great labor, and because your humanity and benevolence are so well known to me, that I hope you will take my writings, however they may be, in the best way, furthermore because you have often encouraged more frequent writing, in whatever language it may be. Or if my writing were doubted, so that it might be judged to be of little firmness and validity, nevertheless let it be returned, and my colleagues and collaborators in the ministry of the gospel will subscribe.</p>
      <p>However, I believe that from this and the preceding writing you will sufficiently know the whole case. And so that I may cease to be bothersome to you, as your people dismissed Vinsler, so our people received him, and so they also send him back, which will be clear from the neighbors and all those with whom he had dealings. Nor is there much confidence or reliance on the testimonial letters to be received from our most esteemed senate; for they are ignorant of what is very well known to us, moreover they think this fine is sufficient, so that they do not wish to harm him further and elsewhere with their writing. And we would not have exposed to anyone what has been brought to our ears about him, if your humanity had not requested that we inform you of it by letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell then, most learned man, with all the learned and the ministers of your church, whom you should greet very much in our name and always have us and our church commended to you even in prayers to God.</p>
      <p>In Schaffhausen, on the second day before the calends of May in the year 1553. Most devoted to your humanity,</p>
      <p>Sebastian Gr√ºbel, ministers of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, his kind dear lord and brother, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
