      <p>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>What you have often urged us, most esteemed brothers and fellow ministers, to have the sons of your church recommended to us, we have indeed provided as diligently as possible for our mutual relationship in Christ, yet this labor of ours has not succeeded as we had hoped. Therefore, we thought it necessary to explain to you briefly what we cannot conceal without disgrace, namely the conduct of two of your alumni, Johannes von Halle and Jakob Pintscheler; who, if only they were such as to respond to the generosity of the most magnificent council, to our/your expectations, and to our labors. These, then, are his virtues: utmost treachery towards his host, a most excellent and learned man, drunkenness, hypocrisy, debauchery, so much so that he was not ashamed recently (as he was convicted by his own testimony) to lead a prostitute into the home of a certain friend of his, from which a public scandal arose, to which he seemed to remedy shortly after by being seen carrying a gun at night, which he later excused to us in such a way that it was easy for everyone to see him as a liar. These things are so well known to us that he himself cannot deny them unless he wishes to contradict himself.</p>
      <p>Jakob Pintscheler, when summoned by us and asked about this crime, confessed that he had been a companion to him in leading that prostitute, whom he had shortly after left alone with Johannes in a room. These are their notable deeds, of which we cannot even mention to you without the utmost shame, certainly with great sorrow, but we necessarily write to you about them, both to clear our conscience and to ensure that the church of Christ, his most pure bride, is guarded against these plagues. If ever, now indeed, we ought to be most concerned about this matter, given the corrupt morals of the youth everywhere, so that, unless the Lord provides, we can hardly hope for any fruit from such a corrupted seed. As far as we are concerned, although our school is now greatly afflicted due to the severity of the plague, we have nevertheless decided, as long as it is possible, to administer this duty of ours in such a way that we prove our faithfulness to all churches. But we ask of you, brothers, that, as we are in no small danger of life, you intercede with the Lord for us, so that, although provoked by our sins, he may so moderate his wrath that he preserves his faithful servants and, whether we must die now or remain here longer, both our life and death may be referred to his eternal glory. May the Lord Jesus, in these public calamities of the church, be present with us all with his invincible spirit and protect and strengthen us all. Farewell. Lausanne, 25th of April.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, in the name of the ministers and professors of Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and esteemed ministers, doctors, and professors of the church of Zürich, dearest brothers and lords in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
