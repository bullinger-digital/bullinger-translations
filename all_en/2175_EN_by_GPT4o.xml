      <p>I received your letter, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, on January 15th, for which I thank you all the more, as it was not outside the duty of friendship that you wrote; from this, I certainly gather easily how much you love me and remember me fondly. May our Savior Jesus continually love and care for you and yours.</p>
      <p>Such are the horrible storms and pressures of our Germany, and such are the occasions of the gravest evils that arise daily one after another, that I see no way or end can be hoped for until this wrath of divine vengeance, growing heavier day by day, completely destroys and annihilates everything, especially since you find not even the slightest effort of repentance anywhere in anyone, but all flesh has corrupted its way, and in such a great and clear light of the gospel, people love darkness more than light.</p>
      <p>I do not think we need to fear the continuation of the council. There will be another sword that will finish off the most ungrateful Germans. Let us, however, as many as still stand in the Lord, implore His most present help, that we may be gathered in peace to the fathers with these few remnants, whom He still has among us, trusting in Himself and His Christ, whose names are in the book of life. We urge serious repentance even on those unwilling, who claim the title of the gospels, while being nothing less, so that they may know they have had the prophets of the Lord, and there is nothing they can use to cover their deplorable ingratitude, and we may free our souls, approving our ministry to the Lord, who called us, as much as it can be done. Farewell with the Lord and your most learned and pious ministers, with the remaining brothers and friends, by whose holy prayers I very much desire to be helped before Christ again and again.</p>
      <p>Given on February 2, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable brother and friend.</p>
