    <p xml:id="regest1">Recognizes in Vadian's efforts his great appreciation. Has read his detailed and learned letter regarding the [planned] Nuremberg meeting; although he remains of his opinion, he will rejoice with Vadian if the matter turns out better than he himself predicted. Sends [the final part of] Vadian's letter [No. 894], which he wishes to publish together with the [five] books of Vigilius [“Contra Eutychen”]; he has altered it, but will do nothing against Vadian's will, and requests its return through [Hans Rudolf] Lavater.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I see, my dear Vadian, and continually experience with increasing evidence, how much you value and love me; for you spare no effort, even though you are very busy. I have read that extensive and learned letter, sent to me a few days ago, about the Nuremberg meeting, and I thank you greatly. However, regarding my previous opinion (to not dissemble anything), I have changed nothing. But if the matter turns out better than I have predicted, I will give thanks to the Lord with you. More on this another time. - Now, so as not to cease being a bother to you, I am sending you your letter, or rather our letter, which I intend to add to the books of Vigilius and publish. I am sending it so that you can see how we believe it should be published conveniently. If it displeases you, I will attempt nothing without your consent. Therefore, return the letter to our Lavater. Nothing has been changed on the first page, but it has been rewritten for the coherence of the latter, in which many things, as you see, have been omitted. I beg you, by the Lord and your excellent humanity, not to take offense at my impudence. Farewell. June 14, 1539. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Joachim Vadian, Mayor of St. Gallen. - To the honorable Mayor von Watt.</p>
