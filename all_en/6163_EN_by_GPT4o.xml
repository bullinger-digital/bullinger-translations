      <p>My friendly greetings with the assurance that whatever I can do to show you and yours love and service according to my ability, you should trust me. Reverend, noble sir, regarding your letter from Zurich on December 29 concerning my godfather Mr. Hans, I thank you most sincerely, hoping to God that it will turn out well. Whatever I can do to serve him, I will not hesitate, and if you hear from me that I have done anything against him or mine that is unjust, inform and correct me, I will accept it with gratitude and obedience, as much as God gives me understanding. If the lord bailiff should intervene in any way, he should be assured that if justice is done, one is well satisfied. I would have liked you to know that you had advised him; when the holy time is, that one should begin the holy communion, that he should have admonished the people 1 or 2 days beforehand; since he also does not have a sermon on the holy evening beforehand; because I am not at home.</p>
      <p>I would like to ask you, as stated above, to always let him and me be entrusted to you, if I cannot earn it, I ask God to earn it for you.</p>
      <p>Dated at Oberneunforn on the 6th of January 1564. Your willing servant always, Benedikt Stokar.</p>
      <p>To the reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord and good friend. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Stokar</p>
