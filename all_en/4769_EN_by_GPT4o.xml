      <p> Greetings. I received from the WÃ¼rttemberg envoys, who were recently in Baden, that it has been decreed by the princely guardians that no trouble should be caused to Erbe and his colleague, and that both should continue to enjoy the stipend that has been provided to them so far. However, they must refrain from public teaching functions and not criticize the recently accepted practices and forms in those churches. If they accept these conditions, they may live in peace. </p>
      <p> But it is not yet clear how Erbe will receive this. I recently wrote to Basel and reminded the man of his situation; without the advice of friends, he should not rashly reject any offer nor move from his place until he knows for certain what the princely guardians decide about him. Farewell and always keep me in your thoughts. </p>
      <p> Given on April 25, 1561. </p>

      <p> To the esteemed and learned man, Lord Bullinger, my most respected lord and friend. </p>
