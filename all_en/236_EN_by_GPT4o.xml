      <p>S. I received your letters, the first indeed from Rasdorpher and the second from your courier, and I understood what you fear and suspect.</p>
      <p>I have felt the same for a long time and have faithfully informed your Humanity of everything with evidence gathered from all sides over several years: namely, that some are clinging to the Emperor's syncretism instituted against our religion, and that Antronium is not unaware of this, nor do I have any greater reason today why I would want the cantons sworn to us by the tenor of the treaties than that we might be able to rescue them from that force, more insane than tyrannical, and meanwhile present ourselves for the determination of doctrines in a free council, with some prudent proposals, to gain some favor from them. For they offer themselves, as I hear, to swear an oath; but we are not giving anything with which we might more quickly and fully bind them to us by oath. I have learned from a man of great faith in Switzerland that they would certainly do anything in the name of the fatherland and the treaties, provided we do not continue to be so morose towards them. In this hinge of such slippery matters, I would prefer to win them over by every kind of duty, provided religion remains intact, rather than to commit to appearing to have rejected what is fair and just to those who demand it. Believe me, they are not so foolish that, if they allow us to be attacked and endangered in the name of religion, it would immediately follow that they too would have to plead their case about liberty, vindicated by force and arms, and about rebellion before that tyrant, whose ancestors suffered great disasters from there. However, in the matter of religion, not everything is yet complete for the Emperor, and I am led by great hope that, if we adhere to the sacraments duly performed, it might easily be obtained from them by the tenor of treaties and pacifications that they would agree without delay to ward off all force from us, provided we abstain from envious disputes and join them in the agreements of those matters by which we could join and present ourselves as allies without any injury to either their religion or civil governance.</p>
      <p>We must direct ourselves towards unity and strive with all arts for the same, or else the matters of the common Confederation will go to ruin.</p>
      <p>As for religion, we are well satisfied; let it be placed in one place and let us look around to see what we owe each other for the sake of the common fatherland, so that we may withstand the swift attacks of our hereditary enemies with the rescue of our wives and children with honor, as in ancient times. For the appearance of religion, which our enemies carry, not only brings the beginning of their faith but also the suppression of all liberty, as one can see and grasp with one's own eyes.</p>
      <p>The wife of the most learned man Wolfgang Musculus is gravely ill, first indeed with a choleric vomiting, due, I believe, to the difficulty of the journeys, by which she was excessively fatigued, and now burdened with a dysenteric flux, nor is it certain what end the disease will have. May the Lord heal her, so that the distress of exile is not exacerbated by this cross.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we must strive to help our brothers pressed by so many hardships to the best of our ability, especially those so holy and worthy of the public favor of all. I heard him preach once, and would that I could always hear him! But our expenses are too limited to respond worthily enough to that man, blessed with so many good children by the Lord, not to mention that we scarcely suffice for the expenses of our ministers. Therefore, a plan must be devised so that, if they cannot immediately be appointed to churches, they may be sustained with some suitable and not ungenerous sustenance until an opportunity arises for churches to choose such pastors. Nonsense has been spread about Frecht's death and imprisonment. He lives, but you will understand from his recent letters, which I send, how his affairs and those of his fellow ministers stand.</p>
      <p>He too will be exiled for the name of Christ and perhaps soon will take refuge with us in Switzerland. This persecution is dreadful, by which the Lord tests us, and I do not know whether it should be placed after the furies of Julian and Constantius, whose most treacherous attempts did not advance so much that Christ does not still openly reign among them today. Hold on, whether one might yet obtain a tolerable peace for the pious people in Constance, and that they would not be obliged to receive foreign people into their city.</p>
      <p>If they intend to settle foreign people there, it will certainly concern the Confederation. Otherwise, they need nothing in Constance. Yesterday, their consul, Dr. Sebastian Gaysberg, died among us from a disease which the doctors call congelation, and he was buried with a large gathering of people. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, August 20, 1548. I return Gastius's letters.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, lord and as if... brother.</p>
      <p>Amann Mauritz of Appenzell has written to ours recently, that it is to be announced by the Confederates, namely all the allies, and he has the command to inform the abbot of this, but on our part, he has nothing.</p>
      <p>Now my lords are waiting to see if they will write to anyone, and how it will be useful to us, they have wanted to assure themselves of some delay. Therefore, my lords are caused to write to Zurich and Baden. But there is nothing in it. The matter will be better understood another time. With a request, please also inform Lord Mayor Lavater of this and greet him faithfully on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
