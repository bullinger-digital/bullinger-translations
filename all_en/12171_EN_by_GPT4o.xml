    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has nothing to add to his last letter [No. 2123], but did not want to miss the opportunity to send greetings with the messenger [John Butler]. - The Zurich printer Augustin [Mellis, known as] Fries is indeed printing the work [“The Suffering of Our Lord Jesus Christ, which is called the] Passion” by [Jakob Ruf], but not [Johannes] Zwick's [“Christian, Entirely Comforting Instruction... with a Very Beautiful Exposition... of the Seven] Last Words of Christ”, of which he knows nothing. Blarer should inform Konrad Zwick, who had inquired about it. Greetings to him. - Bullinger recommends John Butler, who conducted himself excellently in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote yesterday, my honored and dearest Blarer, so I have nothing new; however, since a reliable messenger was at hand, I could not refrain from sending you my greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Augustin Fries, the printer in Zurich, is printing an entire Passion, set in rhyme by our stonecutter, and has not printed Zwick's blessed book on the Last Words of Christ. He does not want to print it; he says he has never seen it and knows nothing about it. Please convey this to your cousin, my dear Mr. Konrad Zwick, who had asked me to inquire about it. Greet him warmly for me.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Mr. John Butler; while he was with us, he conducted himself excellently and honorably.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 29, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his honored and very dear brother. Constance.</p>
