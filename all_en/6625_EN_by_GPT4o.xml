      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, since I have no one to send to you except an Italian man, unknown to me, I will be very brief. I have received all your letters in the past weeks, but none this week.</p>
      <p>After I last wrote, I fell again into a very serious illness, so much so that even the doctors were concerned for my life. It is indeed a stone; but such stubborn obstructions have occurred that they would not yield to either enemas or medicines.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I was in extreme agony for three whole days. But by the grace of God, I am better and am preaching.</p>
      <p>Here, the snow is as deep as has never been remembered in living memory. No one is traveling abroad, nor can they.</p>
      <p>Now the matter of renewing the alliance is being discussed.</p>
      <p>The envoys are here.</p>
      <p>They wish to return home; for they cannot visit the communities; but they can indeed return home. So it will be postponed until another time.</p>
      <p>The Alps are closed. - The Pope is most certainly dead; there is no doubt about it; it is said he was taken by poison.</p>
      <p>Now it is also reported for certain that immediately after the Pope's death, the Cardinal of Ems, the Bishop of Constance, was stabbed with his entire household. Gabriel and Hannibal are staying in a certain fortified castle; but they are also thought to be killed now; for they were said to be besieged.</p>
      <p>The deaths of the Duke of Paliano and Carafa are mentioned.</p>
      <p>As for the money, there is no one in Ragaz who owes you anything, nor do you owe anything to anyone.</p>
      <p>Why do you send money to my wife? Do I not owe you my soul? You make me anxious, as you so precisely account for my matters, when I owe you everything. I give you eternal thanks.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this.</p>
      <p>I will return the chapters of the Heidelberg document with the next sure messenger.</p>
      <p>Those who come from Innsbruck affirm that there will be small or no assemblies; the princes do not agree with Maximilian. But more on this soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Como on the 7th of this month around the 4th hour of the day, as the Italians count, three suns were seen. You also know about the triumvirate made in Rome; they will call each other about the papacy.</p>
      <p>The Pope is said to have died on December 9th.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal of Vercelli, a Savoyard, is said to be in the election.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of January 1565. Suddenly. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Zurich, to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
