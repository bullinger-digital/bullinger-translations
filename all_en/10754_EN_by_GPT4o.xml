He has expressed to the people of Strasbourg his support for a convention even without the backing of princes and cities, but this would harm the evangelical cause. The people of Strasbourg are urging the participation [of the people of Zurich]. Sends news about a brother imprisoned in Meersburg and requests assistance for him.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The plan to send delegates from you to Luther pleases us more and more, and now we want nothing else than for you to expedite this matter; for others are vigilant and are urging the convention.</p>
      <p>Luther seemed to the people of Strasbourg to leave the convention to the discretion of the princes and magistrates, but he has been persuaded to come and be present, even if the cities and princes are unwilling to lend a helping hand. We truly do not doubt that we will incur the greatest disfavor to the evangelical cause if we attempt to convene either against the will or without the knowledge of the authorities. Oh, how earnestly we must pray to the Lord, that He may not leave us to ourselves! Again and again, the people of Strasbourg urge you not to avoid the meeting.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on January 7, 1536.</p>
      <p>Here I send the matter of that good brother, who has been almost two years in prison in Meersburg, and do not doubt that this is indeed the case. If you can think of anything to console the captive, make sure he experiences your diligence.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the whole household.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
