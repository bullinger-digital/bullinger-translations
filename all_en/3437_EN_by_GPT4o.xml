      <p>Greetings. I have written to you extensively about our affairs.</p>
      <p>Since that time, nothing new has been brought to us that you have not already abundantly learned from the legates themselves; but we hope that we will receive something soon. However, we fear that a mistake has been made twice, namely that they have used the services of the cardinal, whom we had not rashly advised to do nothing at all, but rather to clearly indicate that they would have no dealings with him, and then, after receiving a response, they did not go back to the king himself, having been deceived by the response and promises of a very cunning man.</p>
      <p>We would indeed have preferred them to return with the matter unresolved and without greeting the king himself; yet we do not doubt that everything was done with the best zeal by the most honorable legates, to whom all the French churches also profess to owe much for this reason. Nor do we doubt that the Lord will turn all these things to His glory and the consolation of His people. As for the expenses of the legates, you remember what was answered to us when you proposed this to the senate. This matter has made it so that we could not suddenly contribute as much money as perhaps was needed; but nevertheless, if you think it should be done, we will ensure that they are fully satisfied. We believe the German legates are now with the king, but we have not yet received anything certain about them. They say the betrothal of the Dauphin and the Queen of Scotland will be celebrated at the Lord's nativity.</p>
      <p>The three estates of the kingdom will also meet in Paris. Here we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that liberty regains some strength or at least that the cardinal's impudence cannot progress further. A meeting of the electors has been announced in Ulm for the day after the royal inauguration of the emperor, that is, the inauguration of Ferdinand. May the Lord turn the plans of the wicked upon their own heads and clothe His people with a steadfast spirit. Farewell, my father, with all the brothers, whom I indeed ask you to greet individually from me as diligently as possible. I also wish to remind Mr. Zwingli that Robert Estienne is pressing me greatly about the price of those four Bibles, which he received a long time ago. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, December 17, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
