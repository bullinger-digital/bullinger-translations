      <p>Greetings. I gave Zehender the ring you sent, and I believe he has already settled with the goldsmith. I am also sending back to you the acts of the Naumburg Synod, which are indeed remarkable and worthy of such a gathering of great men. Among all things, this seems best to us: that there is no mention of the Zwinglians and Sacramentarians among the heretics. May the Lord grant them that, having recognized the truth, they may come closer to us and think and speak more modestly about us than Westphal and many others of his ilk.</p>
      <p>As for the defeat at Siena, nothing certain is reported here yet; however, our people fear that all of it might be too true. The French indeed admit to some defeat, but not as great, especially that the Rhaetians lost only a few. In Piedmont, too, the French were defeated in a certain battle and lost quite a few, which Captain Laetus is said to have written from Solothurn. Thus the Lord avenges the innocent blood of His people, which is still being shed daily throughout France for the confession of Christ. These are also the fruits of our confederation with the French. Would that Switzerland finally recognize and repent. There is nothing else new with us now. They say that Margrave Albert passed through here, but unknown. By the grace of the Lord, my fevers are leaving me, and I only had paroxysms for three consecutive days; however, I still feel the remnants in my very weary limbs. All of ours are well and send their greetings to you and yours in return. Farewell. Bern, August 18, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After the expulsion of the Mass from Orbe, another village is still seeking reformation, which greatly infuriates the people of Fribourg.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his venerable and dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
