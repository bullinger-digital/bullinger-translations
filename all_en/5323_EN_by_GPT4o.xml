      <p>Greetings. I have just returned home from the countryside from my brother, who has begun to fall ill.</p>
      <p>I found your letters but had nothing to respond with. From France, nothing new, except that the allied princes have again written to the magistrate with Condé and sent a treaty or the form of a treaty. They also sent a copy of the letters sent to Emperor Ferdinand; but they contain nothing that we have not heard before. There is a rumor, to which I give little credit, that the Elector of Saxony has sent a delegate to the council and that Maximilian has dismissed all his ministers and is going to the council to preside over it.</p>
      <p>If this is true, the Pope's practices are indeed very powerful; if you have any certain information on this matter, please share it, I beg you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>These things have indeed been brought from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 15th of May, 1562. Very quickly.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
