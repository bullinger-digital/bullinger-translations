      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, dear brother, and I commend your diligence in writing, indeed, I thank you. I pray that you commend me to the honorable councilors and to Mr. Charles, our Pontisella and Ganthner, whom you will greet most dutifully in my name. You will forgive me for being brief; for now is the time when I prepare my letters to be sent to Frankfurt, from there to my friends (who have written to me and to whom I must respond) in the Palatinate, Hesse, Saxony, Cologne, England, Prussia, Poland, and many other places. I have taken care to have what has been brought copied for you; which I have enclosed here. Our Aernius will dine with me now; I have handed him yours. In his name, I greet you most diligently and amicably, as well as in the name of mine. May the Lord bless you and keep you! I am vigorously contending with a cough and catarrh. May the Lord deign to free me from this annoyance soon and completely!</p>
      <p>Farewell always. March 19, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I suspect well that Hans Bader brought up, they are nothing but the Spanish unrest; for it is indeed a bitter cross to all papists, and not unjustly so.</p>
      <p>See to it that you use prudently what I write; do not share it with everyone and let it not be spread in my name. For sometimes things that are uncertain are written as if they were certain; but I do not wish to be considered the author of these. I share with you in good faith what I receive from others, and as I receive it, I share it with you. Let there be trust with the reader. Farewell again, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
