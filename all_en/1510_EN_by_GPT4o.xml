      <p>I cannot act otherwise, unless I wish to appear too ungrateful, forgetful of duty, and unworthy of your kindness, most distinguished man, without giving you immense thanks for each of your deeds and merits, which have been many. Although, by Hercules, I do this with shame: for neither the close relationship, which you wished to have with me, nor the many benefits you have bestowed upon me, who is entirely unworthy, seem to require only a mere expression of thanks, nor do I willingly discharge such great benefits of yours with such a cheap gift of speech. This also somewhat troubles my mind, as I consider how little suitable I am to compose a letter to such a great man. Nor indeed would I wish or dare to disturb your gravity with my childish trifles and nonsense, or to offend your eloquence with such barbarity; unless I knew that I could not gratify you in any other way, and I did not doubt your usual and well-known kindness to me.</p>
      <p>As for the letter, which I recently received from you, know this. After I had read it once and again (for once did not seem enough), I seemed to have gained as much benefit from your excellent and truly theological teachings as I could scarcely have achieved from a long reading of the best authors. You advise that I embrace true and sincere faith in Christ my Savior.</p>
      <p>In this part, I will strive to satisfy you, as much as God will grant; but I recognize that it is a gift of God, and therefore I ought to promise only as much as the Lord will bestow. Yet I will not cease to pray with the apostles, that He may be willing to increase it in me daily by His kindness. To this also, with God's help, as you command, I will add purity of life, as much as my, alas! too weak, strength will be able to provide.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I ask that you, in your piety, make mention of me daily in your prayer. I will enter upon the study of the Hebrew language in the way you most faithfully show. Farewell, and may God protect and promote you eternally in this province you have undertaken. 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, ready for all duties of piety, Jane Grey, daughter of the Duke of Suffolk.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, her most esteemed lord.</p>
