      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Since I had the opportunity to send a message, I did not want you to remain unaware, dearest father, that today my mother has passed from this life to that eternal one, and (what consoles me the most) in true faith and fervent invocation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, we all give thanks to the best and greatest God, who has deemed it worthy to finally free her from this severe illness. I will return home the day after tomorrow or at the latest on the third day; for I will stay for two days with my father to arrange domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>I have attached to this letter of mine a letter to my relative Liberianus, which I ask you to give to my maid to deliver to his brother, so that he may send it to Liberianus as soon as possible. Farewell. My father, wife, and sister all greet you. Greet the whole family in my name. Farewell again. March 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly, Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
