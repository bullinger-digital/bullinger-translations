      <p>Be well, dearest brother. Today I received your letter dated October 30th along with your demonstration; for which I give my greatest thanks. I will correct my version according to this very example. That French doctor did not translate anything at all; he said he did not have the leisure. Therefore, it will be necessary to send it to Geneva, although they indeed (to speak freely with you) are often too scrupulous in matters of less necessity. I know what I am saying: they will hardly be able to endure that you wished to address the king with that little book of yours. Let them see that they do not hate too much. "But he rages, and he lights the pyres and stakes of the faithful." I hear this and think all the more that we must strive to appease and win him over, which we will not achieve through hatred or any invectives. I truly approve of your action, and I would not have labored in translating if I had thought otherwise.</p>
      <p>I will dedicate my work to Moreletto; for he agrees. I have nothing yet about the council; but I hope to have something soon to write to you. I thank you for taking care of my nephews; certainly, you can hardly be (so to speak) more pleasing and dearer to me in any matter. If there are minor errors, as are usually found in the young (as you write), let us indeed bear them, that is, let us not be too severe, and urge them to be corrected; if they begin to be greater, I beg you, Bullinger, to inform me of everything, and in the meantime, I ask Mr. Sebastian not to neglect his discipline; for whom I will undoubtedly arrange money shortly.</p>
      <p>I gave Martinengo your little book, for which I thank you greatly; it is now with me in my pastoral little hut. I wrote in previous letters that he is called to England. I wish to have some copies of that demonstration, which I would spread throughout Italy. Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, November 5, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
