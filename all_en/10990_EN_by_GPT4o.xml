    <p xml:id="regest1">The Swiss churches are indeed interested in an agreement with [the Schmalkaldic League], but Bern, unlike Z端rich, has previously opposed the acceptance of the Four Cities Confession, which makes approval of the [Augsburg] Confession even more unlikely; personally, he has no objections to the former, while the latter does not entirely please him.</p>

      <p>Bullinger from Z端rich writes to me his opinion:</p>
      <p>Firstly, he does not doubt that the churches in Aargau would be pleased if they could come to a common understanding with other Christian princes and cities. For this reason, they have previously held assemblies in Aarau and Basel. However, regarding the means by which they might be accepted, he does not know what to write or say. I have written to him that perhaps the best means would be for them to accept the confession of the four cities along with the Saxon one, as far as the doctrine is concerned. This has already been discussed in Basel through the envoys from Strasbourg and Constance. However, at that time, the Saxon confession was not considered. The people of Z端rich would not have objected to this, as they had also given some instructions to their envoy regarding this. But the people of Bern are not willing to agree to this, as they do not want to separate from them. The people of Bern believe it is sufficient that their confession and articles presented in Basel were not only answered to Luther but also to the princes and cities that are on the side of the Gospel. If the Saxon confession were now added, he fears the matter would not have a successful outcome. Therefore, he does not know of any means to promise anything, especially since the two cities of Z端rich and Bern cannot be properly tolerated by their confessions. And as far as he understands, they will remain with the same. They will not reject ours. Regarding the Saxon one, he cannot promise anything. They do not want to prescribe anything to the other churches; they also do not want to be prescribed to, but rather that each party retains its freedom. For his part, he has no concerns regarding our confession. The Saxon one has not always and entirely pleased him.</p>
      <p>This is Bullinger's response to me, given on February 13, 1537.</p>
