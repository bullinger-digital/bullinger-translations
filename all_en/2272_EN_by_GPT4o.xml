      <p>S. You have probably already learned from my brother what has been proclaimed by our people against those who go into military service; for I sent him a copy of the edict and instructed him to share it with you. From this, you can infer the state of our republic in this regard. We have freed our souls; for we did not make ourselves hated by merely shouting in public sermons, but by approaching the senate itself and explaining at length the enormity of this sin and the consequent evils. We have indeed achieved what you see, and although I do not know what great severity this prohibition, issued under the penalty of body and goods, as they call it, may appear to have, it afflicts me much more that I see this very thing, whatever it may be, not coming from a sincere heart among most and especially the more powerful. For I see (unless my conjectures deceive me) that everything is directed towards slowly bringing back the old corruption, that which, alas, has already prevailed among the people of Basel and Schaffhausen. It would be disgraceful to fall once; therefore, we will have to descend step by step into this hell again. However, I hope that the Lord, in His goodness and wisdom, will render the plans conceived against His will ineffective.</p>
      <p>For I do not doubt that if those departing now were to suffer something adverse, which is greatly to be feared, the old severity would return, although in the meantime there is no one who wants to appear to derogate anything from the old constitutions. Therefore, the old laws concerning pensions, alliances, and mercenary military service were read, confirmed, and sworn (as they say) again at the time of the last Easter, when magistrates are usually elected; for they contain nothing certain about the penalty for those going into military service; it is left to the discretion of the magistrates. Therefore, they think they are allowed to establish whatever seems appropriate according to the circumstances of the times, and thus they did not want to decree any specific penalty now except this general one. So not everything is as deplorable as perhaps some report. What I fear is clandestine and done in secret, and there are few who notice. I wish my fear here would be unfounded! I therefore ask that nothing be spread about these matters as if from me.</p>
      <p>You know how familiarly I speak and write to you as to my own heart and pour my fears and feelings into the innermost parts of your heart, and this also for the sake of our common ministry, so that I may thus relieve myself of some part of my anxiety. I know, therefore, that you sympathize with me in this matter if anything is done less rightly, and at the same time you also want to stop the mouths of those who proclaim more about this matter than the truth of the matter holds. But I will discuss these and other things with you in person soon; for I have decided to come down to you shortly after the feast of Pentecost, not because there are any other matters, but because I owe this to my aging mother, to visit her more frequently as long as the Lord allows me to enjoy her presence in this world. Farewell. May all yours be safe, whom you greet in my name and that of mine. Bern.</p>
      <p>Given on April 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>I will report to Zehender what you command. For yesterday evening I received your letters. There is nothing new. Thomas Lever, the Englishman, sends these letters to you. I will take care of all yours. Tell Master Gwalther that those boys will soon come, about whom he wrote to me and for whom he has arranged accommodation with Josias, your son-in-law; only his letter was awaited from the prothonotary of Murten, which he has now received.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
