    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to a conversation [from November] about a friend of Curione, who wants to send his brother to Zurich to learn the German language; asks Bullinger to select a suitable house father and to send a message regarding this to the lawyer Martin a Pergula in Tirano; if no messengers are available, the letter should be sent for forwarding to Johannes Comander or [Johannes] Blasius in Chur; there is also the possibility to handle this matter through Camillo [Renato]. Greetings, also to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Kaspar] Megander, [Theodor] Bibliander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther; together with his wife [Margarita Bianca Isacchi], Curione also sends greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna] and the children; the pastors of Lausanne, especially [Pierre] Viret and [BÃ©at] Comte, also send their regards. Requests to enclose this letter with the writing to Tirano.</p>

      <p>Coelius Secundus Curio sends many greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Although your kindness or rather piety towards me has been so great that a rather long letter would be needed to express my gratitude, in this letter I will write nothing more than what needs to be taken care of for the sake of our friends.</p>
      <p>Perhaps at another time, there will be an opportunity to express my gratitude, let alone to give thanks.</p>
      <p>I believe you remember, when we were with you, that I told you about a certain friend who wanted to send his brother to Zurich to learn the German language and for the sake of other good things. But I do not know what business distracted us from that concern, so that nothing certain was established between us about that matter. Now, I intend to make up for what was omitted. Therefore, I ask you to select a good and learned man, and then also a merchant or a man full of business, with whom this young man may stay, and to agree with both on the price and conditions.</p>
      <p>When you have done this in my name, if you please, send a letter to Mr. Martin a Pergula, the lawyer in Tirano, to inform him about the whole matter. Surely, there will be those who will carry the letters; if not, you can send them to Chur to Mr. Johannes Comander or Blasius, the ministers, with a few words added to one of them, to ensure they are delivered in Tirano in the Valtellina. It is absolutely necessary for you to diligently take care of this matter, lest you wish to bring my trust into jeopardy and myself into disrepute, as I have promised to accomplish these very things, which, however, overwhelmed by business, cares, and countless troubles, I have not accomplished. Therefore, I ask you again and again to assist my negligence with your work, zeal, and diligence.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you can also write something to Camillo, to whom I have returned your letters, in the same effort. For he is in Tirano, and Mr. Martin will easily deliver your letters to him. You will comfort a man who is outstanding in letters and religion and especially loving towards you. The sooner what I have written is done, the more pleasing it will be. I would have written myself if I could write something certain; but since I cannot, you will accomplish it and excuse us to Mr. Martin.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus, and in our name, you will bid the distinguished scholars Pellikan, Megander, Bibliander, Gwalther, and the others farewell. You will greet your wife, full of duty and affection, in my name and my wife's name, diligently and lovingly, and you will love your sweetest children for their kindness, grace, and duties towards ours. I dedicate myself to you and yours, to whom I owe whatever I am. Farewell and be well. The brothers and ministers who are with us, especially Viret and Comte, send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, on the fourth day before the Ides of December 1542.</p>
      <p>Together with yours, you will also carefully attach these enclosed to Mr. Camillo or to Mr. Martin with yours and forgive me for imposing so many and such great burdens on you.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, venerable brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
