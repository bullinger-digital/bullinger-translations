    <p xml:id="regest1">Alexander Rischacher's son [Martin?] has arrived and will receive support from the alms; however, his host was not willing to accommodate him for less than 10 guilders per year. Bullinger has no news from the Imperial Diet at Speyer and hopes to learn about it from Myconius; they will try to suppress the truth, but we have nothing to fear as long as we adhere to the Holy Scripture as our only guide. Has no news to report. Greetings. Has received the letter from Gebhard [Kuster?] and has written to his father.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The son of Rischacher has finally arrived and has been accepted into the number of those receiving alms. He came the day after I wrote to you about him.</p>
      <p>I indeed moved every stone with the host to see if I could secure that he would accept only 8 guilders per year, as I had tried before he arrived; but he was unwilling to take him for a lower price than 10 guilders. He cited the high cost of everything. He also promised splendidly. Therefore, trusting the man, I accepted the condition, which you will inform Mr. Alexander about, and greet him along with Mr. Marco most warmly.</p>
      <p>There is great and persistent silence with us regarding the Imperial Diet at Speyer. We are waiting to hear what you will tell us. When they gather, I am quite sure they will discuss nothing else but the suppression of the truth. I know, therefore, that the Lord is thinking about suppressing His enemies. If, in the meantime, something must be endured in the otherwise perishable body, I consider it fair and good; for I firmly hope for the resurrection of the righteous. You think the certainty of doctrine is necessary, and rightly so. But there is no certainty more stable than the canonical scriptures; since they act for us and support our cause, I am so secure here that I only pray to the Lord not to let us stray from this most certain rule and to listen to those who, with cold and poorly coherent reconciliations, give hope to the adversaries that we will eventually accept what cannot be shown with solid scriptures. Indeed, kings gather, and princes set themselves against God and His Christ; but He who is in heaven laughs at them. Let us pray that the Lord does not punish us through the wicked because of our disobedience.</p>
      <p>I have no news.</p>
      <p>I commend Leodigarius along with the people of Zurich to you earnestly.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 27, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have received Gebhard's letters and have written faithfully to his father, as he requested.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
