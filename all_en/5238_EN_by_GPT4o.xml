      <p>Greetings. Today I wrote, reverend father in Christ, what I wanted you to know.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a citizen, a merchant from Chur, was in Schwyz these days; he says that there were prominent people in the inn with him; they behaved with such indecency and arrogance that it is almost unbelievable to say, and they often repeated: "The most holy father, the Pope, will help us to eradicate the Lutheran heretical faith. God will give him victory," etc.</p>
      <p>Likewise, they openly incited each other against the Lutheran heretics, one against five, the other against six to slaughter. He speaks of a certain immense and incredible rage.</p>
      <p>He also says that they openly boasted at the table about how much money they have from various lords, and some said: "I have from the most holy father, the Pope, from the King of France, from King Philip, from the Emperor, from the Duke of Savoy, from the Venetians, and it should break the heart of the Lutheran heretics." Our citizen here heard all this.</p>
      <p>Thus it stands now in a Confederation; may God improve it. If one had used seriousness from the beginning, one would have been spared this and other things; but these are the beginnings of many, and it had to happen this way so that in the meantime the hearts of many would be revealed. Vergerius had proceeded as far as Lindau; there, having received my letters, he stopped and secretly hid with the minister of that church. I wonder what the man is planning; I do not think he will come, after he heard that he must do it with danger. I wanted to add this to the previous matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and if you wish to write back, Janius JÃ¶rgius Metzger has set out, a faithful man, to whom everything can be safely entrusted. Chur, March 23, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>These letters were to be reserved; for on the same evening I received letters from Tobias Egli, the minister of Davos (who has conducted himself excellently so far); although he wrote many other things, he wrote this less discreetly, yet I understood that you especially wanted to know this, so I decided to send it to you. You will return the other letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man of singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
