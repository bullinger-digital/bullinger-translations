    <p xml:id="regest1">Following the example of Bede [the Venerable], he has extracted the commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew from the works of Augustine and has been asked by [Christoph] Froschauer to have this work printed by him; he sends the first 14 chapters, asks for their judgment, and leaves it to them to improve his work. He has included theologically objectionable passages to avoid being accused of falsification, but has not added anything of his own, only enriched the text with quotes from Pliny, Gellius, Ambrose, Valerius [Maximus], Boccaccio, [Flavius] Josephus, and the Church History [by Eusebius?], and, where possible, has targeted the sectarians of the present. He would gladly follow a possible call to the old homeland, provided that his situation does not worsen. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I have collected, most excellent men, with Herculean labors, which I am certainly persuaded you will verify with the truth itself, the commentaries of Saint Augustine, which he wrote here and there scattered in the infinite sea of his works on the Gospel of the blessed Apostle Matthew, although in a tumultuous heap and borrowed order, yet wishing to consult with my learned and unlearned labors alike, following and imitating as far as possible the most learned Bede, that Englishman most devoted to Augustine, whom his writings testify to have attempted this very thing on Paul with the greatest skill and ingenuity, not without the highest praise. Therefore, we owe much to him even for our age. About these very things, I informed Froschauer in recent days, who in turn wrote back to me, earnestly requesting and urging me to allow them to be printed by him. To which, both because of his vigilance and diligence in this matter, and because of the excellent beauty of his letters and characters, he will have me willingly and by no means opposing, on this condition, however, that he responds to our merits and efforts and repays the favor, although he cannot restore it entirely. But why do I delay with many words? In short, most distinguished fathers, understand what I wish: Through the bearer of this letter, which Froschauer also desired with all his wishes and demanded from me, I send to your excellencies 14 chapters contained in the first two books, indeed the better part of the work, to be either accepted or rejected by you. From which the rest can also be easily gathered and measured. As for the remainder of the work, I myself will bring and carry it with me when I find out that he is preparing to complete that work. Therefore, I beg and beseech your integrities by God to lend your eyes to them, I say, to turn them over in your hands, lest it be burdensome and onerous to you. But if thereafter, by the judgment of all of you, you consider and judge that it contributes something to the glory of the name of Christ and the promotion of the praise of God the best and greatest, if, I say, you consider it to be useful for the edification and benefit of his church (for which, if necessity demanded, I know you would risk even to the altars and attempt the utmost), let it be published, come to light, and undergo the judgments of the world, I do not oppose. But if you think it less necessary to be done, let it be suppressed, become void, wither, and perish in dusty neglect. Meanwhile, let the whole matter be left to your humanities, on which it will depend, whatever it is. You can therefore add to this, take away, supply what seems to be lacking, change what is wrongly placed, transpose and invert with Augustine preserved, and, to sum up, arrange and do everything at your discretion. And although I have not left any stone unturned in writing these, nor was my mind at first to have them published, I did not want it to be done even now without your judgment, advice, and approval, whom the world does not have more discerning, vigilant, and sharp-sighted in this matter.</p>
      <p>Then, which I do not want to hide from your pieties, I have inserted, added, and transcribed certain things, which it is openly acknowledged Augustine was mistaken about due to the injury and malice of his time, such as the place about auricular confession, the observance of the Lenten fast, and the care to be taken for the dead, to which he does not in any way twist or turn the scriptures, nor does he contend or act contentiously with anyone about these, but refers them as accepted by the fathers, allows them to be the custom of the church, and permits them to be the tradition and institutions of synodal councils. Finally, I see that all these things do not inconvenience men of discerning nose and learned men. But most of all, I did this so that I would not be accused and charged with falsehood, imposture, and corruption by the Momuses, papists, and critics. Lastly, as far as I am concerned, believe me speaking the truth that I have not added a single word of my own, meanwhile selecting and compiling a very few from others, such as the nature of the serpent and the condition of mustard from Pliny, the story of Arion, that noble lyre player, compared and stolen from Gellius to crush the error of the Gentiles, then the genealogy and origin of that elder and more wicked Herod from Ambrose somewhat pertaining to the matter, furthermore the severe censure of Portius Cato on Lucius Flaminius added from Valerius, an exclamation from Giovanni Boccaccio against impudent women on the occasion of Herodias, and finally some from Josephus and the ecclesiastical history. All these things the diligence of a pious reader will diligently encounter and discover to the prejudice of nothing, but so that the text may become more illustrious and clearer, they have been added. Sometimes directing the style and sharpness deliberately, especially when the opportunity was given to me and necessity demanded, more often against the sectarians of our time, for infamous polygamists, seditious Anabaptists, new Schwenckfeldian Manicheans, detestable schismatics, and impious papists do not cease to cause trouble for all of us even now. To refute and eliminate whose pestiferous errors, it will be necessary for us to act with united pens.</p>
      <p>Moreover, most illustrious men, how gladly I would act as a comrade in your camps is difficult to express; for until now no opportunity has offered itself for a migration to you to be undertaken. Although my lord and benefactor is the best and propitious in all things, the common people quite good, the condition not regrettable, yet "I do not know by what sweetness the native soil leads all and does not allow them to be forgetful of itself."</p>
      <p>Therefore, if there were a vacant and suitable place with you and it were made by your instigations that I be called by a just magistrate's vocation, you would have me in readiness and in all things most obedient to you and most devoted to peace and unity.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it will be your duty to ensure that I undertake the office and province of the word with joy, and to be extremely careful that I do not fall into Scylla while desiring to avoid Charybdis. For I am so harassed and oppressed by the exactions of tithes that it is necessary for me to steal time even for studies. Furthermore, it must be seen that there is no Glaucine exchange and that what happened to Aesop's little dog does not happen to me. All these things I have judged not to be out of place to entrust and commit to your charities. Nor is there any reason for me to have a bad omen about you, venerable men and my dearest brothers, indeed the good things I have long promised myself about you. May God grant that all things be referred and yield to his glory and omnipotence. Therefore, about all those matters, if it will be possible for you through your occupations, I pray you insinuate your minds to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to keep me defended and preserved, enrolled at some time among your number. Greet each other lovingly.</p>
      <p>Hastily, from our house in Balzheim of the Ehingers, January 3, in the year of salvation, etc. 43.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely,</p>
      <p>Johannes Fischer (Piscatorius) of Litopolis, minister of the word in Balzheim.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men and lords of exceptional piety and learning, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, Erasmus Fabricius, most upright ministers of the distinguished church of Zurich, their most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
