      <p>Greetings. You can attribute the interruption of my letters to those affairs that have almost overwhelmed me this entire month, and to nothing else. Certainly, there is not enough free time now for me to do as much as you. Therefore, the only thing left is to thank you as courteously as I can and to ask you in a friendly manner to accept this excuse of mine in good part. You are aware that the island of Corsica is under our control except for one port, Calvi, which is not very fortified. Soldiers are being gathered from all over the Genoese territory; the Florentine fleet is being prepared; money is being collected from everywhere to expel our enemies. Reinforcements have been sent by the king, and weapons of all kinds are being transported there from both the city of Rome and from France to repel the enemies. I foresee a war in the Sienese territory, and nothing less than peace will be negotiated, even though Cardinal Pole has been given a mandate by the Pope to the Emperor and the King regarding it. The Turk is entirely focused on the Persian expedition.</p>
      <p>The Germans have not yet taken anything seriously; they are so afraid of that Spanish specter. Farewell. Chur, 14th day before the calends of October.</p>
      <p>Rizzius is here; the papal legate is pressing.</p>
      <p>Your John Du Fraisse, Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
