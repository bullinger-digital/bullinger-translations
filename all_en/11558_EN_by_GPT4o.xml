    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the letter from Biel [No. 1507] and listened to the request presented by Peter [Schnyder]. Subsequently, the two boys [Abraham and Beat Steinegger] from [the monastic school] Kappel were examined and also personally assessed. Good progress is to be reported, and the boys should, if possible, receive further education. The further course of action was discussed with Peter [Schnyder], who will inform the people of Biel.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, along with the offering of all honor, service, love, and goods beforehand.</p>
      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, especially favorable, dear gentlemen, we have understood your letter, also listened to the presentation of your preacher, our beloved brother, Mr. Peter, according to your request, and since we are entirely willing to serve you, we have sent your two boys from Kappel and had them partly examined before us, partly examined them ourselves. And we have found in them that they have learned well and diligently in such a short time and at their age, and have come so far (so far) that we hope their diligence will bring forth good fruit in time, provided that your help is not withheld from them in the future as it has been so far. Therefore, we ask your love to let the poor children be entrusted to Godâ€™s will, so that they may remain in the teaching. We have also further discussed this with your preacher, Mr. Peter, our beloved brother, and have shown him our advice, as he can well inform you.</p>
      <p>May God always keep you in His holy word and will, to the honor of His name and the salvation of His church.</p>
