    <p xml:id="regest1">In [Imola] it is said that the council will not take place for another two years. The Antichrist wants to rule the world, but will be defeated by the Lord. - Recently, a boy of about 17 years old [...] interrupted the sermon of a Franciscan [...] about the Kingdom of Heaven and accused him of lying, whereupon the Franciscan broke off his sermon. The present vicar [Dominicus a Vaccis] of the [Catholic] bishop [Nicolò Ridolfi] ordered the boy to be arrested; they wanted to persuade him to recant, but he refused. After his parents and relatives interceded for him (he was noble), he was released. The monk accused the boy of his youth and lack of knowledge of the scriptures, to which he responded with [Ps 8, 3 and Eph 3, 17]. He was released with the condition not to incite a popular uprising, otherwise he would face the galley. - Among some newly converted [Protestant] Christians is also Paulus Hubertus [Paolo Umberto?], a lawyer for civil and now also canon law; he sends greetings and asks for the intercession of the [Zurichers] for the Italians. - About Coletto himself: As he wrote in the previous letter [not received], his father [...] [after his return from Basel] received him well; he himself is in a difficult situation and asks for public prayer [from the Zurichers]. He lives in Imola with the aforementioned lawyer.</p>

      <p>Receive briefly what is new. Here it is said that the council has been postponed for two years. The Antichrist tries, as much as he can, to hold power in the world; but once the Lord will kill him with the spirit of his mouth. In recent days, a certain boy, perhaps 17 years old, publicly rebuked a certain Franciscan preacher in the main temple, who had preached that God gives paradise to men through their works, and unless they have works, they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
      <p>But the young man, standing in the middle, said: "You lie, you say the greatest falsehood, Franciscan," and thus said to the people: "Do not believe, because he deceives you." Immediately the Franciscan, angry, hurriedly descended from the pulpit and did not want to finish the sermon. And in the sermon was the vicar of the antichristian bishop and ordered him to be captured and put in prison. And they wanted him to recant, but the young man refused, and for several days he stood thus. Finally, because he is noble, his parents, all relatives, came and wanted to have him and they had him.</p>
      <p>And the monk said: "You cannot understand the scriptures. You are a boy. You have not yet seen the Bible. But I am already old; I have spent my whole life in sacred letters, and do you want to understand better than me? What I said is true!" The boy then said: "I admit I am a boy; but the scripture says: 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise' [Ps 8, 3]. Furthermore, understanding of the scriptures is not placed in age or clothing, but in spirit. The Lord dwells in the hearts of men according to the sentence of Paul and not in clothes or sects." And so they released him on the condition that he would believe as he wished, but not incite tumult among the people. And if he wants to incite, they will send him to the galley. There are also some others who have become new Christians and good, among whom one is prominent, who is called Paulus Hubertus, a tutor of civil causes, and has now become a tutor of spiritual causes, who greets you all in the Lord and prays you to pray to the Lord for us Italians.</p>
      <p>As for me, know this: My father, as I wrote in previous letters, received me with a willing mind and feels something good about religion.</p>
      <p>I hope in the Lord that my affairs will turn out well. Pray to the Lord in public prayers for me, because I am now in some tribulation, which vexes me much.</p>
      <p>Pray to the eternal Father, that he may prosper, and yet always his will be done in all things. I am now in Imola, a city subject to the Pope, which is 20 Italian miles from Bologna, which are 4 German miles, and I stay with this lawyer, of whom I spoke above, and I write for his clients, and with him I live in the Lord and hope better every day.</p>
      <p>Farewell all in Christ. Imola, 11th day of February 1545.</p>
      <p>Your least brother of all, Andreas Colettus Italus, who was</p>
      <p>in Zürich around the beginning of May in the year 1544, together with Thomas Lüberio the German.</p>
