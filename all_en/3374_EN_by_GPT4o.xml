      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The French and the Swiss are returning from Italy. The French King has made peace with Philip. I hear that he swore by his crown that he wishes to eradicate heresy and to begin with his own blood. Schnepf, Sarcerius, Victorinus, and two others have left Worms, abandoning Melanchthon, Brenz, Pistorius, and the theologians of the Palatinate and Pomerania, who refused to agree to the anathema and condemnation of our churches. Farewell.</p>
