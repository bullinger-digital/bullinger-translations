    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has taken pleasure in reading Myconius' letter [18070 from April 9, 1548] and was also able to read his writing to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Myconius rightly complains about the perilous times and the depravity of people. However, God will not abandon His own, but will severely punish those who despise Him and the Holy Scriptures! At least [the Evangelicals] should remain steadfast, proclaim the Gospel correctly, and call everyone to repentance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger cannot write in more detail at the moment, but did not want to let the reliable messenger [John Burcher?] depart without a letter. Myconius will receive news about the situation in England and Scotland and further news from Johannes Gast from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Greetings. [The people of Basel and Zurich] should pray that God has mercy on them and protects them from an alliance with the bloodthirsty King Henry II of France, so that it does not go with them as it did with the [pious] Jehoshaphat, who was harassed by the Syrians because he helped [the godless] Ahab! May God protect them. His little flock should not be afraid [Luke 12:32]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings to Celio Secondo Curione, Martin Borrhaus, and the other good people of Basel.</p>

      <p>S.D. I received your letters, my brother and esteemed lord, filled with piety and learning. I read them gladly. Gwalther also received yours, which he shared with me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We find ourselves, as you rightly complain, in the most perilous times and among a depraved kind of people. Yet, the Lord has His church in the meantime. The Lord will not abandon His own, even as He is about to exact punishment on those who despise Him and His word. At the very least, let us remain steadfast and walk rightly in the way of God, rightly dividing the word of truth and exhorting all to repentance.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wrote this to you, my brother, so that I would not send this reliable messenger without a letter. He will be able to explain to you the matters concerning England and Scotland. Master Gast will also come and bring you more. For now, I could not do otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, and let us pray to the Lord, that He may have mercy on us, look upon us, and protect us, so that we do not form an alliance with the bloodthirsty Frenchman. And may Jehoshaphat, who brought aid to Ahab, not feel the Syrians rushing upon him! May the Lord keep us. Do not be afraid, little flock. Zurich, April 16, 1548.</p>
