      <p>Greetings. I truly have nothing to write, reverend father, unless you wish to know what was done at the assembly. The envoy of Philipp presented the case in general terms; he did not specify anything in particular.</p>
      <p>The response was friendly; our people do not refuse friendship, provided it is established on terms that do not oppose religion and freedom. We await what will happen further.</p>
      <p>The case of the Pellizarians has not yet been settled. Again, three envoys have been decreed to the governor, the Duke of Säss, with the leader of the delegation being Mr. de Rozins.</p>
      <p>There is good hope that they can obtain what they seek and protect our interests in the future.</p>
      <p>The people of München in Morben have been released from the arrest imposed on them concerning the Pellizarians, but not completely freed; for they shall not have the power to change, buy, or sell this property without the knowledge and will of my lords; add to this that they should be allowed to die out and no more be taken in.</p>
      <p>If not as we wish, then certainly as we can.</p>
      <p>You would believe that the papists are especially hostile to me and others who have pursued the cause.</p>
      <p>Not at all: they have never been more flattering; they are content as long as they retain their monks. Many attended the sermon, and Mr. de Rozins himself discussed many things quite humanely with me.</p>
      <p>Thus now are things with our people. - The decrees of the council do not please them, because the fathers have not relaxed any of the rigor, nor have they removed manifest abuses; indeed, they do not even please the priests themselves. I have not yet obtained the 9th session.</p>
      <p>Inform us about Grundtbach and the French affairs and whether the future fair in Frankfurt will take place. Farewell, reverend father, most happily with all your people.</p>
      <p>Chur, 8th of February, in the year 1564. Yours, Fabricius. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
