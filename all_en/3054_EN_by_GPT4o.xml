      <p>Greetings. I had asked Lord Valerand Polanus, upon my departure from Frankfurt, most esteemed brothers in the Lord, to inform you about all my affairs; for he was aware of everything, and I was then entirely prevented from writing, nor do I doubt that he has done so, and therefore I believe that you are already aware of all the reasons for our undertaken journey. Now I also wanted to inform you of the success of our journey so far, so that you may give thanks to our Lord God for His divine kindness with us and further commend this journey of ours to Him in your church with your prayers. I have with me a most faithful companion, Lord Johann Utenhove; I have joined him as a partner and advisor in all my plans, wherever I might need something, whose piety, integrity, and judgment I believe are known to you. In our journey, we first turned to the most illustrious Prince of Hesse, then to Wittenberg, and were most lovingly received, most liberally treated, and most honorably dismissed by the Prince of Hesse. He conversed with me most familiarly three times with all others excluded, invited me most kindly to his table, and when he could not be with me, he always wanted me to be with his eldest son, Prince Wilhelm, so that I cannot sufficiently praise his inclination towards me. He testified that he disagreed with us on the sacramental issue, lamented the iniquity of the times, and gave advice to promote the pacification of the churches. He also gave me letters to Philipp Melanchthon and the Elector of Saxony. He wrote to Philipp that he should come with me to the Elector of Saxony, if I requested it, and commend our cause. He also added his own horsemen to escort us to Erfurt at his expense for the security of the journey, and thus he dismissed us. When we arrived in Wittenberg, I immediately informed Philipp of my presence through Utenhove and that I did not want to be recognized by everyone; but since I had come especially for his sake, I desired to speak with him privately, wherever and whenever he wished. There, our Philipp was so overjoyed that, having informed everyone at his home, he immediately rushed to me and wanted to bring me with all my companions to his house: there was no need to conceal my presence there from anyone at all, indeed he desired it to be well known to everyone: "All who are here," he said, "are ours and think with us. I, however, replied that I had to remain at the inn both because of the horses and the companions of the journey; nevertheless, I would come once to his house to visit his family, if only we first communicated our plans on necessary matters. Then I handed him the letters from the Prince of Hesse. After reading them, he said, "You had no need for such letters. If I understood that we could be helped by the authority of the prince," he said, "I would voluntarily join you as a companion to him. But if you listen to me, you will neither join me as a companion on this journey nor seek any meeting with my prince. The prince himself is not indeed so opposed to us as many proclaim, nor is there any doubt that he would lovingly admit you to a meeting; but without consulting his consort, he will give you no answer; there, however, everything is hostile to us, and without a doubt, whatever we attempt to promote will be hindered." Then, having spoken much with me about the plans of the princes, he said that it was in vain to place any hope of pacification in the favor and authority of the princes, but it seemed more advisable to him that some learned and pious men, eager for peace, should meet privately somewhere without communicating the matter to any of the princes and unanimously agree on a formula of doctrine to be handed down in all controversies; then indeed the princes should be addressed and presented with whatever the pious and learned had decided among themselves in this manner. He said that if a place and time were appointed for this matter, he would not hesitate to come and would also bring not a few others with him. And when we discussed the place, he agreed that such a meeting should be held in Frankfurt, and he thought the most convenient time would be at the autumn fair in September, not indeed the upcoming spring fair; for that time would already be too short for this matter. But if it also seemed so to us, then he would now gradually take care of this, so that he would also bring those whom he knew to be well disposed towards peace. But this should not be made known to just anyone; for if the turbulent clamorous ones learn anything of this, they will immediately leave nothing untried to somehow hinder our plan. Thus Philipp spoke with me, which I wanted to inform you of, so that I might also be informed of your will and then also remind Philipp; for I would not want to be absent from such a meeting myself and perhaps would also bring some with me. Your letters, however, can be sent to my wife in Frankfurt, who will remain there until April, if the Lord wills. However, I ask that this not be disclosed to just anyone, as Philipp himself advises.</p>
      <p>After we had thus conversed, Philipp wanted us to be his guests the next day, along with Utenhove.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the next morning we went to the college where Philipp was lecturing, to hear him teach, and there, with him leading us, we entered the very crowded auditorium, which had at least a thousand and five hundred listeners. After making a most honorable mention of us, he somewhat shortened his lecture so that we would have more leisure to converse again after the lecture. After the lecture was completed, we followed Philipp to his house, and there we conversed a little about the affairs of my homeland and again discussed the sacramental issue mutually. I presented him with our writing on the Augsburg Confession, which Lord Calvin had also read in Frankfurt and wanted some things in it to be changed, which were immediately changed in part, and Philipp read it and also approved it, and it is now being printed in Basel, I believe, by Oporinus; for I entrusted this business to Lord Valerand. We later dined with Philipp, and the most learned professors of the academy were present at the banquet, all of whom received us most lovingly, and whom I in turn received all with Philipp and Lord Georg Major at my inn for a familiar supper as a public testimony of mutual friendship and society. And when they had all gathered at my place, all my compatriots who were there at the time, more than thirty young men of truly excellent character, also came to congratulate me on my arrival there and especially on my return to my homeland. Moreover, the public minister of the academy came on behalf of the rector and the entire academy, bringing us the customary honorary wine with a public testimony of friendship and society and asked me to stay there another day and to be present at the public ordination of the ministers of the church and finally at the academic banquet, if indeed our affairs could in any way allow it, adding that Philipp had the same mandate to me from the whole academy. However, I excused myself both to Philipp and to the minister for the longer delay, both because of the necessary acceleration to my homeland for the assembly postponed to the first of December and because of the fear of my illness, lest it should force me to linger on the journey, as it is almost monthly for me. Philipp accepted my excuse and promised to report it to the rector of the academy. At the supper, there were the most delightful conversations, which Philipp always seasoned with his wit. There was also mention of Westphalia, and all the blame for the newly stirred up turmoil in the church was laid on him and another person. We then parted most lovingly from everyone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the next day we prepared for departure. I had indeed asked Philipp to write something to my king, to testify to our mutual society, which he did most kindly and wrote not only to my king but also to the royal relative, I mean the Chancellor of Lithuania, who is the first among ours after the king and has long been most loving towards us and entirely agrees with us. Therefore, when we were preparing for departure, before we left, he came to us again and brought the aforementioned letters with him, handing them to us to read before sealing them, and then immediately sealed them; for we could desire nothing in them. Nor did he leave before we got into our carriage, and thus finally, having said farewell, we left Wittenberg. We arrived here on the 21st of November, received most honorably both by many friendly citizens and by the magistrate himself. And when we had already decided to leave here again on the 24th of November, on the night preceding that day, my illness suddenly seized me and has detained me until this day; now, however, it is somewhat abating, thanks be to the Lord, so that we hope to leave here tomorrow or the day after.</p>
      <p>In my homeland, moreover, things are as follows: the legate of the Roman beast is doing everything to hinder the progress of the gospel; yet by divine favor, the number of the church is increasing everywhere daily. But with the constant growth of the church, the hatred of the Pharisees towards all the pious also increases, who are utterly enraged at the growth of our numbers.</p>
      <p>They have tried to persuade the king to hold a kingdom assembly with the principal nobles of the kingdom summoned only through private letters, without the matter being publicly announced throughout the provinces, and whatever was finally decided there with the summoned nobles privately, as I said, to be ordered to be observed entirely and a penalty for disobedience to be established, and the king had done this; but the plan did not succeed. For all the nobles, except the bishops, both ours and even the papists, unanimously resisted and were not willing to agree in any way that the right of the homeland's liberty should be violated in this part, and many grave things were said against the pope's legate, so that he was later ordered by the king to leave from there, and finally, great assemblies of the kingdom were instituted against the will of the bishops, as usual, that is, first announced throughout all the provinces of the kingdom, so that delegates or commissioners would be sent there from all the provinces, who always cast the third vote in all public constitutions of the kingdom. These assemblies will now begin on the first of December, and the first thing to be discussed will be religion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would like to hasten my journey as much as my health can possibly allow. Lismanninus is in good health, and I believe his case has already been publicly pleaded before the king against the bishops; for he has so many patrons that I do not doubt he was free to plead his case publicly and freely. But I have not yet been able to hear the outcome of the matter.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you, most esteemed brothers in the Lord, of all these things, indeed in no order, but as they presented themselves to me and as my health permitted. In the meantime, I ask you to also inform our Lord Calvin of all these things. What remains, I diligently ask you, my brothers, to commend our cause with your prayers and the supplications of your churches, so that by God's grace we may bring some fruit in promoting sound doctrine and the purity of public worship throughout my homeland, and also in pacifying, as far as possible, all dissensions, and then, having communicated with Lord Calvin, to inform me unanimously of your will regarding our meeting, which I mentioned earlier. Now indeed, my Bullinger, there is no need to greatly fear the Saxon minds in such a meeting, provided the Lord grants grace for it to proceed, since the Wittenbergers themselves advise that turbulent minds on both sides should not be admitted to such a meeting, and they give clear indications that they do not greatly disagree with us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you by Christ, make an effort that some of you may also be present, not only as listeners but as associates and peacemakers of the cause. There is no reason to doubt the Prince of Hesse and his people; for he openly testified before many witnesses that he agrees with us and will not allow anyone in his domain to stir up any tragedies in the name of this controversy, and all his chief teachers entirely agree with us, so that I do not doubt that the occasion for our meeting is offered by the Lord God, and if we neglect it, we will indeed not be without fault in the judgment of God.</p>
      <p>I can say no more now; I therefore conclude and pray to God that He may be with you and us with His Holy Spirit, so that in all our plans and actions we may seek above all the glory of God.</p>
      <p>My companion on the journey, Lord Utenhove, sends you his most dutiful greetings, and I also reverently bid you and all the brothers and fellow ministers there farewell in the Lord. Farewell in the Lord, all of you.</p>
      <p>In haste, as you see, in Wrocław, November 28, 1556. Your most loving John a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Today I received from the letters of a certain citizen here, written in his own hand, that the pope's legate, who is in my homeland, has been ordered by the king to leave the court, but I do not know on what occasion or cause. Forgive the errors; for I did not have time to reread.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and learned men and reverend brothers and lords in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor, Peter Martyr, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, to be delivered into their hands. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
