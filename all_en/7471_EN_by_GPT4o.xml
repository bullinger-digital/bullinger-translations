      <p>Greetings. It is easily persuaded to me that the faithful are greatly offended by the cunning and evil arts of the brothers, especially if you have expected nothing of this, nor can their actions be excused or approved by any reason. Furthermore, it is to be feared that such arts will turn out badly for them. But what can you do, my dear brother Tobias?</p>
      <p>Overlook it, which you do wisely, and commit the whole matter to God, I say, to Him who explores hearts and approves justice.</p>
      <p>Since you are ministers of the same Lord and the same church, help each other mutually, do not engage in any rivalry with each other, nor let such things arise either from thoughtlessness or from a more intense agitation of the mind, from which quarrels and altercations are abundantly sown and arise, from which suspicions and scandals are poured out into the church like clouds. In the meantime, try through faithful friends whether something can be counted for you; whether it can or cannot, you will always have fixed in your mind that divine saying full of consolation: "Cast your desire upon the Lord, and He will nourish you; I will not forsake you, says the Lord, nor will I abandon you."</p>
      <p>And He who has not failed you thus far will be present further and perpetually; He will give thoughts of assistance and counsel into the minds of the pious, by which both you and your family will be helped. We have no certain news from France. The most honorable envoy of the king, Belleure, writes to me these days from Solothurn, but he does not mention France even in a word. Our Beza also writes, who has somewhat recovered, and indicates that many refuse peace, but the king has once decided to establish and maintain it. Wonderful rumors are spread from Flanders; however, since everything is still uncertain, I do not wish to trouble you with doubts. It is written that the Queen of Scots has now escaped from prison and is preparing for war; if they had punished her as she deserved, she would not now be thinking of punishing those who were foolishly lenient.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve His own and overturn wicked plans, may He preserve you and yours and all our friends, whom you will greet individually by order and name.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in great haste, May 28, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and very dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
