      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you the day before yesterday about those things that had been conveyed to me from various places; now I have nothing to add.</p>
      <p>I only ask you, if you wish to do something for my sake and for your Vergerius (as you certainly do), send these letters to him as soon as possible and, if the matter cannot be expedited otherwise, send a messenger on purpose. I have ordered an inquiry here; but clearly no one has been found, as there are people here who would not even want to stick their head out of the hypocaust. Whatever you promise as a reward, Vergerius will pay; I would even redeem it at double the price, to free you from this trouble. But either the letters should not have been sent or they should be sent by you; thus, I think it should be entrusted to others as little as possible. I know you reject everything from friends except goodwill with a stricter principle than I would like. You have children, you have friends: make sure that, if we can do anything in any matter, some trace of our goodwill towards such a great man remains. Farewell. Chur, December 5th.</p>
      <p>It is of great importance that Vergerius's letters are delivered to him as quickly as possible; if by chance he is not in great financial standing, as often happens to good men, I will pay the messenger double the reward. Now, with the matter uncertain, I could not decide what to send.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
