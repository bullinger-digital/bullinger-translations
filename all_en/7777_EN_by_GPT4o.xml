      <p>S. D. I received two letters from you, venerable father in Christ, one written on January 23rd, the other on February 4th.</p>
      <p>In the first, you first express your intention regarding the calling of ministers to the churches of Switzerland and promise to declare the opinion of the school authorities to the deputies and examiners. Then you send the dialogues of Theodoret, which I had not requested from your library. I do not know by what chance it happens that I was allowed to inspect them only once several years ago, borrowed from a friend; for when I saw the name of the printer, I hoped that I could easily obtain them from Frankfurt, especially later. But neither then nor until now have I been able to find them at Nuremberg, Strasbourg, Basel, nor last year in Zurich at any bookseller, having meanwhile obtained from merchants his commentaries on all the Psalms and books on the treatment of Greek affections.</p>
      <p>The main reason for my anxious request for those dialogues was twofold: one, because I had read with great displeasure the book of Johannes Wigand on the communication of idioms, about which I knew Theodoret, our own, with other ancient writers, thought and spoke very differently than he did; the other was that Wigand himself, with his associates, in the fifth century of ecclesiastical history, in the life of Theodoret, from the first and second dialogue, unjustly blemish him with two faults, none of which is found in the said places, but the exact opposite is taught and proven by Theodoret, namely that he believes the human nature of Christ is converted into the divine and the symbols of the Eucharist into the body and blood of Christ, neither of which is read in this writer, but the exact opposite.</p>
      <p>From this, discerning readers can easily judge with what faith and diligence those Centuries are composed and that they should be read with sharp judgment. When Georg Illyricus explained his plan for writing that history to Count of Erbach, he frankly replied: "You," he said, "will gather a great heap of trifles." I give you my utmost thanks for your kindness, for making me a participant in Theodoret with great joy; I return it, unless something happens to it on the journey, without any stain or blemish.</p>
      <p>As for the latter letters, in which you explain the opinion of the examiners and the will of the student RÃ¼eger, I reported all this to our consul, who promised to convene the school authorities as soon as possible, so that you may have a certain opinion about our students. Various news is told, but perhaps more known to you than to us. These are dangerous and turbulent times, and worse is to be feared. May the Lord be present with His church in this delirious old age of the world. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your fellow ministers greet you with the utmost reverence, along with all those to whom you conveyed greetings through me. Greet all the brothers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on February 10th, 1569.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Johannes Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful leader of the Zurich church, his lord and most esteemed father in Christ.</p>
