      <p>My willing service and all the best to you. Gracious and trusted, dear sir, I have received your letter along with the enclosed letter from Jörgen Frölich, my dear and good friend, with thanks and well received, and I express to you my heartfelt, sincere gratitude, earnestly requesting that you send the enclosed letter to Frölich as soon as possible and let it reach him, and let the other letter be answered in its proper place in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I must complain to you, whom I know bears sympathy with me, that the Emperor has once again sent out a severe letter everywhere on my account, because I wrote to the people of Konstanz to comfort them in their affliction, and he is entirely determined to expel me from the Confederation and has also requested the King of France two months ago to hand me over to him. That must be a cruel tyrannical disposition, since I have never acted against him in all my days except once, and even then only as my superiors commanded and requested for grace, until I saw that none was to be obtained, and only then did I enter foreign service.</p>
      <p>It is too much for a great power to rise up against a poor fellow like this. Since the lords, especially the secret and entire council in Zürich, know what I have done and (crossed out) otherwise and why against Konstanz, my [friendly] request is that you help and advise so that they do not allow me to be expelled from the Confederation; otherwise, I must leave Germany entirely and perhaps even go to France, where I currently have no desire to go (to confide in you).</p>
      <p>This matter will be dealt with on the next coming day in Baden; there it will be decided for me. Therefore, I ask you to handle the best with the lords on my behalf.</p>
      <p>I am also writing to Lord Bernhard von Cham. Entrust yourself to the grace of the Almighty with this.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, December 21, 1548. S[ebastian] Schertlin, knight, [subs]cribed.</p>
      <p>The mayor Hab, who lies sick here, has a good report of all matters; he would also gladly do the best with me.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, etc., my gracious, dear lord to hand. Zürich.</p>
