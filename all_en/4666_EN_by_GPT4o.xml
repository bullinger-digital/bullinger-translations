      <p>For a long time, reverend father in Christ, I have not received any letters from you; the last ones were those in which you wrote that you were sending your books on the councils, which I have not yet had the chance to see. If you have written anything in the meantime, you will inform me about it; however, our merchants are now returning more slowly (you have heard the reason elsewhere) and, as I was writing this, I was expecting yours; for I believe that everything I sent to you from the proceedings of the diet has been delivered. They had a calm and happy outcome, although their beginning was quite turbulent, which you have not known until now.</p>
      <p>We have also obtained a public church for Mr. Beccaria, so that those who could not bear to hear him preaching within private walls can now hear him preaching publicly and grumble (?). And what is more: the Senate of the Three Leagues writes to the Three Cantons urging them to cease being troublesome to our cause of religion in the future. From this one act, you see that we do not fear the threats of the Five Cantons in these parts as much as you do. What would your mediator have done? Without a doubt, he would have sent Mr. Beccaria to the Garamantes or where the Indian Ocean touches Taprobane. This is how he usually advises for public peace.</p>
      <p>If the bishop's officials had sat, do you think we would have had such favorable proceedings? You have already heard how far the bishop's business has progressed; it remains that he is to be deprived of all civil jurisdiction. I have debated much with myself whether this can be done with a clear conscience by Christians, and I am sending to you what I have recently compiled in these sudden movements, with the condition that you add your judgment and note one or two places and return it to our treasurer as soon as possible; for the matter does not allow delay. If it pleases you, I will ensure that many copies are made as soon as possible and sent to the brothers here and there. We would have obtained everything now if our consuls had not been more lenient.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, they have conducted themselves excellently, but in this one cause, very poorly, so that the Senate has incurred great offense. They are men and worship their idol with Travers.</p>
      <p>I myself approached Travers and asked, since he now had a sufficiently ample opportunity to benefit the church of Christ, to urge the bishop to resign the bishopric; we, in turn, promised every effort to ensure that his possession remained intact as long as he lived. But all this was in vain.</p>
      <p>I pity the old man; in the assembly of the Three Leagues, he heard many unworthy things for his age, especially from our people, particularly from Junker Baptista von Salis, who attacked him in astonishing ways. But God honors those who honor Him, and He afflicts with disgrace those who despise Him. Mr. Lavater writes and among other things about the calling of our Hyler. The people of Davos urge me, and therefore you will be the author to Hyler, so that he may come to us at the first opportunity, equipped with your and the Senate's letters, and that he may turn to me so that he may understand from me with whom he has business and how to proceed. Our treasurer is coming to you, to whom you will explain everything in person and encourage him to be the author to his people, so that they provide Hyler with travel and transport expenses; for it seems that equity demands this, so that what happened to me does not happen to him; for you know that I bore all the expenses alone.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, reverend father in Christ, for as long and as happily as possible. Chur, February 17, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant.</p>
      <p>The bishop of Chur's commissioner appeared before the common Three Leagues with a request to confirm his lord, the bishop, in his freedoms and rights, which he has in Valtellina, all of which was granted and allowed. Meanwhile, a form of the oath, which the bishop's laypeople in Valtellina are obliged to swear to the bishop, comes to my hand. Therefore, as this oath is very strong and the people of Valtellina, among other things, swear to protect the bishop with and without arms, I bring this form to the mayor.</p>
      <p>Hercules von Salis, who has truly shown himself to be a Hercules in all things, insists that it be read in the Senate. This has happened.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Three Leagues have lifted the oath. And as the bishop of Chur has collected a large sum from the farms and colonies for several years, namely every three years, against the old custom, he has been denied to do so in the future; those who had sworn to him have also been released from their oath, which the bishop's commissioner has complained about significantly. However, he could not achieve anything further with the Three Leagues; if he had been wiser, he would have stayed at home, and we would not have known about the oath. Perhaps our treasurer did not come; for it has been reported here that our merchants, who are on the way, have all drowned because they trusted the ice too much. I wish it were not true; if it is true, the letters you gave them have perished as well. I hope, however, that it is just a false rumor.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his always honorable lord and patron.</p>
