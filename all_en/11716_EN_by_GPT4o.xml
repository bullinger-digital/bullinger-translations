    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Basel priests are upset with the Freiburg authorities (who have supported them for several years) because they no longer want to tolerate their prostitutes! Their patron Heinrich Glarean tried to convince the Freiburg council with his long rosary not to abolish this ancient custom, so that it could not be thought that he now favored the Lutherans! However, this slanderous and foolish soothsayer was received and dismissed with laughter, having achieved nothing. Now the Basel priests have to look for another place to stay. Isn't that funny!</p>

      <p>Our priests from Freiburg, who have supported them intimately for several years, are now indignant because they no longer want to tolerate their prostitutes. Glarean acted as their patron. He tried to persuade the council with his long rosary not to abolish the ancient custom of prostitution, so that they would not appear to favor the Lutherans. But this biting and insane soothsayer was met with laughter and dismissed without achieving anything. Now our priests are said to be looking for other places to settle. Isn't that a funny thing!</p>
