      <p>Greetings. Today, by the common votes and suffrages of the most honorable senate, Christian Hochholtzer was elected as deacon of our church, and thus his election has preceded the advice I had expected from you. He is called here for a few days so that the church may see and hear him and thus be confirmed. He is called to the diaconate on the condition that, should one of our triad be lacking, he will certainly succeed, and in the meantime, he will gradually learn the customs of the church. It did not seem appropriate to the senate to request him from the illustrious lords of Zürich, partly so as not to be more troublesome than necessary in seeking ministers, and partly because it did not seem worthwhile, since he already lives under their dominion, nor do they think that you, who granted him to the people of Aarau, would deny him to the people of Bern. I have also written to him. Without a doubt, he will have your advice above all. Therefore, I ask you not to fail us in this matter or to impede his most necessary calling. I beseech you to work with the senate if you understand that any difficulty is about to arise; this will be an ornament and benefit to us, to him, and to the church. All the brothers request the same with common votes.</p>
      <p>You have already been informed about the death of our Leopold, as well as D. Bartholomäus Meister. Among us, the plague is also gradually advancing. Now Judith, the elder daughter of our D. Musculus, having been struck by the plague the day before yesterday, is now almost at the point of death, so that little hope of her life remains. Thus, the excellent man is afflicted in various ways.</p>
      <p>May the Lord console the pious and guide us in His will to the very end, so that we may be found watchful and prepared whenever it pleases Him to call us!</p>
      <p>D. Treasurer Haller asks to be excused to you for not having responded to your last letters; for gout has tormented him for a whole month and kept him at home; he is now beginning to recover somewhat. He also greets you; so does my wife and all of mine, and Musculus also sends many greetings to you and all of yours. Convey my greetings to all the brothers as well. No more comes to mind to write now with the messenger hurrying; if anything has been omitted, I will write next time.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep and guard you, amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, 20th of November, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, a venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
