    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer received the long-awaited letter from Bullinger [not received]. However, from it, he does not see whether Bullinger has received his [penultimate] letter [No. 2514] with his and [Konrad Zwick's] proposals for a circular to the [Swiss] mercenaries in the [Schmalkaldic] service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He will endeavor to forward Bullinger's letter to [Georg] Frölich [not received]. He still has to lie down [due to his hernia] and has therefore not seen any councilors for two days, not even his brother [Thomas] or Zwick. Therefore, he has nothing new to report, except for what Bullinger will have already learned through Frölich's letter [No. 2510]. [On July 30], he entrusted this letter to the messenger hastily departing [for Zurich] before he could finish [the first] letter [of his letter package No. 2518].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- With the arrival of the esteemed Landgrave [Philip of Hesse in Southern Germany], everything is well. The more enemies there are, the more God's honor will be expressed in a victory.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer cannot imagine that God will abandon His Gospel to the enemies, but [the Protestants] will probably have to atone for their recklessness and unbelief first.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should pray [for Blarer's recovery]. Blarer is surprised that Bullinger does not even mention the meeting of the [Protestant city cantons in Zurich]. Due to the frequent and long council meetings in Konstanz, he often learns nothing for days except what he can gather from his correspondence.</p>

      <p>I received your long-awaited letter with great desire. It seemed like an eternity since I had received nothing from you, and from your letter, I do not fully understand whether you have received my most recent letter sent to you, in which my cousin and I suggested what should be written to your soldiers in our camp. Please let me know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will diligently ensure that your letter is delivered to our Laetus as soon as possible. I am still bedridden and have not seen any councilors yesterday or today, not even my brother or Zwick. Therefore, I have nothing new to report except what I believe Laetus has already written to you. I sent those letters to you three days ago, if I am not mistaken, without my own, as I did not want to delay the departing messenger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>All is well since the arrival of the Landgrave, who, next to God, has been a great support to us. The more adversaries there are, the more glorious will be the Lord's victory through the few and weak, who is blessed in all things forever; whom we pray never to forsake those who truly call upon Him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I do not expect, my dear Bullinger, that the Lord will betray His Gospel to the enemies; but I am concerned, as is reasonable given our actions, that we must still bite a hard nut. However, God will eventually be on our side. In the meantime, we will pay the deserved penalties for our imprudence and distrust.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Pray to God earnestly for me. I am surprised that you do not mention even a word about the assembly held there. Our council is in perpetual session, so that often for two or even three whole days, I receive no definite news from our side, but only what is written to me by friends from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
