    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends a Spanish Minorite [Martin de Villafa√±a?]; the Basel church can only support a limited number of those in need, and he finds hardly an open ear for such concerns with the authorities, as Markus [Bertschi] and he are increasingly being opposed due to their allegedly too great frankness; however, this accusation is unfounded. Would like to know something about the letter that a messenger of the Hessian [Landgrave Philipp] delivered to Bullinger, provided it does not concern secret matters.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending you the Spanish Minorite you see here, a young man who, in my opinion, is not uneducated, but desires to advance further in his studies. I ask that you assist him in any way you can. Here in Basel, the number of poor people supported by the church is fixed and currently full. Therefore, we have given him travel money and sent him on his way. I am indeed very troubled by the foreign poor: I cannot help them as they need from my own resources; and from those who have the power over everything, I either ask with difficulty or obtain little. The animosity of certain leaders, who have some influence, against Markus and me is growing more and more, so much so that I do not know what will eventually happen. I entrust myself and all my affairs to the Lord. The frankness of speech or language (let me not be silent about this) is the cause of this animosity, in which we seem to ourselves to be quite moderate. However, they have positioned themselves in such a way that our mildest words seem to them most savage, which must be due to the harshness of their spirits against us, not to our own merit. This, therefore, is our consolation in these matters, the testimony of a good conscience. As for the rest, the Lord will take care of us.</p>
      <p>It is indeed strange what the notary, sent by the Prince of Hesse, wants with you. He passed through here, and I happened to learn that he has letters for you. I do not wish to pry into secrets; if it concerns common matters and you wish to share, I ask you to do so.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, February 17, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
