    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses his joy over Myconius' letter No. 304 and will spare no effort in mediating between Zurich and Bern himself. Satisfaction with Basel's willingness to help. An agreement solely to strengthen the evangelical faith would be easy to achieve. More difficult is the associated reconciliation of Zurich with Bern for various reasons: 1. The secret opponents of the Reformation in Zurich will resist an understanding with Bern by emphasizing Bern's repeated treachery. 2. The undecided will join this argument due to a lack of a better one. 3. The supporters of the Reformation cannot be counted on either, as the defeat and the personal losses they suffered hurt them too much. Bullinger describes the attitude of individual personalities and the reasons for their aversion to Bern. The Basel messenger should first negotiate with Mayor Röist, then with the entire council. Negotiations with individuals are fruitless and detrimental to confidentiality. Bullinger will prepare the decisive councilors and Röist. The suspicion of renewed warmongering should be clearly countered by stating that the hoped-for agreement aims to prevent a new war. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Your letter, dear sir and brother, has greatly and exceedingly delighted me. May God bring it to a good end. What I can do in this matter, I will certainly not spare. For I clearly perceive what good can come from it, as I firmly believe that it is a clear sign from heaven of our downfall and destruction if nothing should come from such honorable, faithful, and friendly efforts. What you cannot achieve, no one can. Basel is agreeable to Zurich, not only because they suffered with them on the mountain, but also otherwise. But I trust God, He will not forsake us forever. Until now, I have pursued this matter very much, but in vain, so that I despaired for a long time. Now, as I see other and better means, I begin to hope again.</p>
      <p>Since you desire that I give you an indication of whom among us the matter can be entrusted to, and with whom your envoy can safely converse, knowing thus, also understanding exactly what I write. If the matter concerned only the gospel, and that one stood firmly by it against human incitement, it would be easy to handle; much could also be indicated to you. But since this intended negotiation primarily concerns this and also involves the Bernese, it will be somewhat harder to proceed and requires discernment, what to trust to whom. For firstly, we have people who are not favorable to the gospel and would rather endure the old errors, but they must not let it be noticed. But if they find an opportunity to err, they do not spare it. As in this: They see that it harms our faith that we, who should be one body, are divided. This cannot displease them. So they must always fear if some unity were made among us. Therefore, when they notice this matter, they will resist and hinder. Not that they (as they say) want to be against God's word, but that they want to protect themselves from the Bernese. Behold, they transfer the state of the cause in such a way that they may win more easily. Then they bring their proofs to this: Bern has not only once, but always pleased us, especially in the Zurich war and now. And indeed it is so. What should we undertake to maintain the gospel with those who, in the last war, nearly brought us and other honest people to ruin for the gospel, and for life and property! All this is still in fresh memory and partly now too true. There is now another kind of people among us, who are neutral; they fall to this opinion rather than to a better one. Then there are third, indeed pious and sons of light, but more imprudent; who do not understand thoroughly what is at stake. For the new wounds hurt them too much; one has lost a son, another a father, another a brother. When I have tried to reason with them until now, the more vehement emotion always overcame them.</p>
      <p>So we want to proceed now and speak of the persons. From the above, you can now well understand how you will find some of ours at the beginning. But do not be alarmed, I must report to you thoroughly. Those not sincerely favorable to the gospel, hypocrites, will be adverse: Truly, lest the truth be safe, but they pretend the treachery of the Bernese. Those favorable to the gospel, good and pious men, will also notice the harm in their hearts and the unfaithfulness shown to them. Herr Walder does not burden himself with too many matters. Herr Röist wishes well for the gospel, but is bitter towards Bern, because, as they found on Horgen and began to rob the lake against the promise of the arbitrators, the banners of Zurich lay at Bremgarten, he was sent to the Bernese at Bremgarten, as they still lay there with their banners unscathed with force. There he begged and admonished them for God's sake, for Christ's sake, for the faith, for the alliance, for their wives and children, it lay now in their hearts and in the city, that they should help to remember what Zurich had done for Bern at Murten and other places and now help, to draw to Zurich in the city, to lie at their beds, to eat their bread and drink their wine, so they, the Zurichers, would lie under the sky at the figs. For if they did not do this, the lake would fall from them, then they would have to accept a peace that is ungodly. Otherwise, if the countryside saw that the back of Bern was still in the city of Zurich, they hoped to come to an honorable peace. Herr Röist spoke with such earnestness that he finally began to weep before them, and others with him. All this did not help much, for Bern neither advised nor helped them, indeed said, they were wise and clever enough, they had started it; they thought well, they could well manage it etc. Of this, Herr Röist said, he would not forget for his whole life. This is the ulcer of all of us: They care little that they are not on the mountain, or do nothing elsewhere etc., but that immediately afterwards the countryside fell away and they had to accept a peace that was worthless and first brought about for life and property and daily brings, for which they could have been well prepared.</p>
      <p>We continue. M[eister] Ochsner is the chief master, wishes very well, but is now old and childish, as is m[eister] Binder. But they can be much trusted. M[eister] Hab is honest, but has lost his brother and was mocked by Bernese messengers in Baden: Yes, God let us not live to see the day that Bern has peace like Zurich. But he is worse, that he is also somewhat embittered. The Werdmüllers have lost a son, and m[eister] Dumysen the father, 2 brothers, so they are also somewhat more impatient. In summary: Since the matter is thus with us, it seems to me nothing more appropriate and useful than that your messenger should go straight to Herr Röist, whose office now approaches that of John, that he is mayor, and take him first in hand, ask and admonish him to do the best and then gather the council and citizens well, and there he should then present his opinion with earnestness. I have also written so diligently what our people err, where they mean yours, to deny all this when it comes to it. It does not seem fruitful to me at all that he should now deal with individual persons. With the common council, the matter is brought much further. Also, where individual persons are involved, it does not remain so secret. The matter would be harmed, unless it were something else. Do not be anxious about silence. You see to it, lest it leak out. Indeed, I recently heard some things about this matter by vague rumor, perhaps originating from Bern, indeed nothing certain etc. Meanwhile, I will prepare the minds of those who will lend their shoulders in the senate. I will also go to Herr Röist and prepare his mind. But meanwhile, let neither he nor any of your envoys learn that I am aware of this agreement! More with your envoy.</p>
      <p>And especially: A suspicion will arise that one might undertake such a thing to start a war. That this should be denied and shown that one undertakes such a thing to be before wars etc. When the enemies see us divided, they will attack more fiercely on one side, when they see us united, they will attack more slowly. I entrust all this to you with the utmost faith. You know what needs to be done. Having read this, burn it.</p>
      <p>Greet my particularly dear Herr Mayor Jac. Meyer and young Bernhard Meyer, Fryg etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 22 December 1533.</p>
      <p>Do not mind that I have written such a long letter. I have meant it with sincerity.</p>
      <p>Hein. yours.</p>
      <p>To Herr Oswald Myconius, preacher in Basel, his especially dear lord and good friend.</p>
