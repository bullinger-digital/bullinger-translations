    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hofherr feels compelled to write to Bullinger, although he is reluctant to bother him, who is so very busy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Recently, Bullinger wrote a long letter on behalf of the widow Regula Mayer to Ambrosius Blarer [not received], in which Hofherr was urged to promptly repay the amount owed to this widow. Consequently, Hofherr made every effort to be able to pay the money by the agreed date. Bullinger should now demand the promissory note from the widow and send it to Hofherr. He should also read the enclosed letter to her. From this, it becomes clear how much she has slandered him to Bullinger. If she assigns Bullinger with anything further, he should write to him alone and to no one else.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Konstanz, there are quite reliable rumors that Emperor Charles V is dead. But Bullinger will already be aware of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, also from Hofherr's wife [...], to Bullinger's wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger can assume that Hofherr holds him in fond memory and is still willing to show him his friendship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Hofherr's preceptor Theodor Bibliander. Hofherr already thanks him here for his wonderful gift. He will also write to him personally. The friendly Johannes Fries is also warmly greeted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Bullinger should share any news.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest compatriot, Konrad Curio sends greetings and best wishes. Although I had resolved not to trouble you, a very busy man, with my unlearned letters, a great necessity compels me to break my silence at present. What this is, you will understand in a few words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In recent days, you wrote a rather lengthy letter to the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, my chief patron, on behalf of the widow Regula Mayer, in which you diligently admonish me to fulfill my obligation to her without any delay or exception of time. For the delay is very troublesome and inconvenient for her. Therefore, having read your letter, I took care to ensure that the debt would be settled as soon as possible on the appointed day. It remains, therefore, for you to request my promissory note from her and send it to me. Therefore, my most humane compatriot, I ask and beseech you, by your singular kindness, not to be burdened (since you have shown yourself diligent in handling her affairs) to read the enclosed letter to the aforementioned widow (for from it you will easily perceive how she has greatly wronged me in your eyes), and if she gives you any instructions, to write to me alone, I earnestly and greatly request this of you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now, I must be brief, lest I cause you annoyance with the length of my letters. New rumors, and indeed very certain ones, are spreading here and there about the death of Emperor Charles V. However, since I am certain that you will be informed of these matters from your own sources, I do not think it necessary to write to you at length.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will greet your wife, both honorable and pious, most dutifully in my name and in the name of my wife.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As for Curio, I would like you to be persuaded that the memory of you, though absent, is cherished by him, not only so that nothing of his love for you has diminished, but that it has been so increased and kindled by the long desire for your company, that nothing at this time is more important or dearer to him than to see you and converse with you in person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You will bid the most distinguished man, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, my most esteemed preceptor, to be very well. Furthermore, I greatly desire that you express my immortal thanks for his splendid and honorable gift. When I have more leisure, I will write to him myself. You will also diligently greet Mr. Johannes Fries, a most pleasant man, on my behalf. You will announce my greetings to your wife as well. Farewell, my most humane compatriot. Given in Konstanz, in the year of our Lord 1547, on the 24th day of February. Yours sincerely devoted, Konrad Curio, formerly of Ulm, but now most steadfastly of Konstanz.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>If you have any news, my compatriot, I would like you to write to me.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, both in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my compatriot. In Zurich.</p>
