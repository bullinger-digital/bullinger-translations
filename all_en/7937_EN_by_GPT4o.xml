      <p>Greetings. I wrote recently, as much as was necessary, most excellent and illustrious man. Now it seemed to me to write this one thing to you: That Milusian minister, whom the Lutherans placed there, has suddenly died of apoplexy, which I indeed write so that, if it is possible, you may ensure that such a one is not appointed, since previously, as I hear, they used to receive ministers from you. I wanted you to know this immediately.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 27, 1569.</p>
      <p>I ask that you destroy this letter and others, so that they cannot be used against me.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Celio Secondo signed. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most respected lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
