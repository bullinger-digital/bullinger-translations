      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The Reichstag is proceeding in Regensburg. It is about raising money, so that the poor community is skinned to the bone and then ultimately thrown to the enemy to be torn apart, with the pretense of being protectors, oppressors, etc. My son Christoph, who is at the court of the Landgrave of Hesse, has sent his servant to me these days, who brings me a letter from the old Landgrave. In it, His Princely Grace, out of special love for me and because of the loyal services of my son, has granted him a fiefdom for him and his male descendants, a rightful man- and castle-fief in the lower County of Katzenelnbogen, located in the lordship of Rheinfels near RÃ¼desheim, with a castle, tithes, courts, vineyards, money, rents, etc., and if he continues in his loyal services, His Princely Grace will also provide him with a good office. He also receives 2 horses from the prince, and he has so far been kept at court among the nobility. I would have much preferred to have my son here in poverty and in the ministry, which I had prepared for him; he had taken leave from the prince years ago; but he could not. For the prince did not want to let him go and always said, His Princely Grace wanted to be a father, etc. Since it has now turned out this way, I thank God and pray to Him that He grants my son grace, that he may serve God above all and his prince faithfully, etc. And I am now glad that I have written to the prince Isaiah. It happened before I knew about this enfeoffment. I did it mostly to keep the prince in good will towards us and our religion, also as a favor, because I suspect it will be my last work. My son writes to me that he has great trouble and work with traveling back and forth, as the prince sends him, that he is seldom at home at court.</p>
