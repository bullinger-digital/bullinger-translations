    <p xml:id="regest1">For the deceased pastor of Rüti, Nikolaus Steiner, the deacon [Dietrich Thöny] from Wald is assisting; however, since the urgent pastoral duties in the large community require a pastor, Stumpf requests to arrange for a new appointment with the council. Thanks for the hospitality. Has not been able to find the work of Beatus Rhenanus [Rerum Germanicarum libri tres] in Zurich; therefore, will wait with the drafting of the first book [the printed version of his chronicle] until the Frankfurt Fair. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, Brother Nikolaus Steiner, preacher at Rüti, was called away from this life by the Lord eight days before the date of this letter, which is why the preaching there is currently vacant and is being taken care of by the deacon from Wald. Now, I believe that the people of Rüti would be content with the deacon's service so that they would not have to have their own pastor. However, since we are expecting a sudden (severe) outbreak of death (which has already begun to spread, as Brother Nikolaus alone has been laid to rest in the monastery at Rüti with 12 or 14 others, two of whom have already passed away) and also the pastor of Dürnten is lying ill with a severe, poisonous, and dizzying fever, we will otherwise need the aforementioned deacon, and since Rüti is situated at a crossroads, with many visitors, much traffic, and in the past, much idolatry in the papacy, and at this time some honest country people have been assigned to the church there, and from ancient times there have been burials and Sunday sermons and other pastoral duties held there, it is up to you, dear sir and brother, for the sake of God's honor and because of the duties of my office, my friendly request and exhortation, to arrange with our gracious lords to provide Rüti with a suitable, respectable fellow again. For if this does not happen, it will become a pit of all vices, as little good is otherwise opened there. Therefore, let this matter be of concern to you, etc.</p>
      <p>God thanks and rewards you for your friendly and willing hospitality.</p>
      <p>Regarding Beatus Rhenanus: I have not found the same book in Zurich anymore; therefore, I will keep quiet with the first book until after the fair in Frankfurt, but I will proceed with the others. Herewith, I commend you to the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, on Laetare Sunday, in haste between the two sermons, in the year of our Lord 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Stumpf has signed.</p>
      <p>My friendly, dear spouse greets you and all your household.</p>
      <p>To Lord H. Bullinger, Bishop of the city of Zurich, his brother in the Lord.</p>
