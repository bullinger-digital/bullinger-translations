    <p xml:id="regest1">Ammann Hans Vogler has been sentenced to a fine. Bullinger complains that in matters concerning the Rhine Valley, the reformed places are outvoted. He sends his commentary on the two letters of Peter and requests a quick publication of Vadian's Epitome. Rudolf Stoll has been sent to Bern, for reasons unknown.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Our Vogler, whom you recommended to me, has been fined beyond right and reason, and our messenger was forced to agree to that fine, unless he wanted to admit something more disastrous by his evasion. Thus, we are overruled by the majority of votes and are dragged into disgraceful matters by those most shameful ones, so that these poor provincials must either be completely abandoned by us and left to their desires or punished beyond their deserts, lest they be utterly crushed by their tyranny. Oh, what an unworthy crime, and what we are forced to witness in this free nation. But I lament these things to myself daily in vain, since this evil has taken root so deeply that it cannot be cut out except by the sword. May the Lord, that almighty avenger and redeemer of evil, redeem Israel.</p>
      <p>I am sending you our commentaries on both letters of Peter, poured out rather than written amidst these business troubles. How I wish your Epitome were published today! But even now I also pray, hasten the publication.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing certain about our affairs. Today Stoll is sent to Bern, but for what reason, I have not yet been able to find out.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>March 17, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
