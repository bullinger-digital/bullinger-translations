      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>We rejoice that the most illustrious man, Mr. Maximilian Martinengo, has departed from this most turbulent age, because we believe that he, freed from many evils, is now finally enjoying those joys with our Lord and Savior which we hope for. However, we sincerely grieve that you are meanwhile deprived of a faithful pastor, and we earnestly pray to the Lord that He may substitute another and give you one who is according to the heart of God, and finally, who can be given to you without significant detriment to other churches. Indeed, we have just received the most esteemed man, Mr. Peter Martyr, our most revered and beloved lord and brother, who has scarcely arrived from Strasbourg: how could we suddenly send him away from us again, especially when the faithful church among us can in no way do without his service? Your charity knows that it has always been easier to find a pastor for a church than a prophet for many churches, I mean an interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, and not of the youth, but a trainer of those destined for the sacred ministry.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Mr. Martyr has a learned, faithful, pious, and experienced colleague, the most illustrious man, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, but he is already broken by heavy, long-lasting, and excessive labors, and thus almost useless to himself and to us (alas). Therefore, unless we wanted our ecclesiastical school to be dissolved and our church to be affected by other irrecoverable damages, we were forced to retain Mr. Martyr.</p>
      <p>There are indeed many other serious reasons why we could not consent to your calling.</p>
      <p>I indeed, as you requested, privately conferred with certain men worthy of respect and virtue, but I found none who would not bear the departure of Mr. Martyr with indignation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I called all the brothers and fellow ministers into a meeting, to whom Mr. Martyr's calling was proposed along with its reasons.</p>
      <p>However, among all, there was not even one who did not wish you all well, but meanwhile could release Mr. Martyr with a clear conscience. Therefore, attribute it to necessity, not to any other cause, that we could not gratify you in this matter. If the situation of our church were as clear to you as it is to us, we have no doubt you would grant us Mr. Martyr if we asked, so far is it from you to persist in withdrawing him from those who resist.</p>
      <p>And since these things are indeed so, we nevertheless beseech your charity to take it well that we did not acquiesce to your request. Finally, we command you to promise yourselves perpetually from us what you would from faithful brothers who love you.</p>
      <p>God is the one who gives pastors to His church: therefore, full of good hope, supplicate the merciful and almighty God and Lord of spirits, that He may not forsake you, but give a pastor to the glory of His name and the salvation of your souls, nor will we here fail in our duty. Farewell in Christ, most esteemed and beloved lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>All the fellow ministers and brothers greet you in Christ the Savior, praying for the Lord's blessing upon you. Zurich, September 10, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich. To the most esteemed and beloved church of the Italians gathered in Christ in Geneva.</p>
