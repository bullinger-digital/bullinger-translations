    <p xml:id="regest1">Wiga is full of gratitude for the [Commentary on Mark], which Bullinger sent to him of his own accord as a useful aid for the exercise of his pastoral office, even though Wiga had not previously rendered him any service. In doing so, Bullinger acted as if (as that famous "Greek" [Erasmus of Rotterdam] said) a favor was being done to him, when in fact he was the one bestowing it. Wiga will express his gratitude more clearly soon, as soon as he has received the [promised] Commentaries on Matthew and Luke.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ our Lord be with you, most vigilant shepherd of the Catholic flock.</p>
      <p>That you did not need to be asked much in my matter, but of your own accord offered and provided your support, effort, and diligence, I gladly accept your new kindness towards me, previously unknown to you. Indeed, you have acted (not because of my merits, which have not yet been shown to you, but because of your skill and diligence) in a manner worthy of someone who, unprovoked by any benefits from me, has been so obliging towards me that you seem to have received a favor (as that Greek [Erasmus of Rotterdam] says) when you have bestowed it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since you have brought much assistance to my ministry, which I judge myself unworthy of, I both give and hold, as you deserve, due thanks, and you will consider that you will receive greater thanks from me when you ensure that your remaining works on Matthew and Luke, soon bound together, are sent to me here. You will have achieved, I say, by this alone, that in all respects I will be most obliged to you.</p>
      <p>May you be well with a mind healthy in Christ. Given at Rottweil, January 24, in the year 46.</p>
      <p>Your dearest Wernher Wega, parish priest of the church of Rottweil.</p>
      <p>To the right reverend governor of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his foremost and always esteemed friend.</p>
