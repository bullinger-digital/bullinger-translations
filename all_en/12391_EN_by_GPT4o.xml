    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger will have received Blarer's last letter [No. 2335], to which nothing needs to be added, except that [Peter] Buffler recently wrote that [Johann von] Naves, [Reichstag] commissioner [of Charles V], was captured by the Count of Fürstenberg near Frankfurt; however, he does not write whether it is Friedrich or Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, nor for what reason, and whether this happened in the name of the Emperor [Charles V]. Additionally, the Prince [Charles III] of Savoy is said to have been killed by [Francis I] with 10,000 Spaniards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- What [Matthias] Erb wrote to Bullinger [No. 2333], Blarer learned one and a half months ago from [Hans] Kaspar von Anwyl, the chief bailiff of Balingen. Pierre Toussain was appointed by [Simon] Grynaeus and Blarer about ten years ago as a lecturer in the monastery of Blaubeuren in Württemberg and then sent by the Prince [Ulrich of Württemberg] as a pastor to Mömpelgard. He is a pious and learned man who had to suffer greatly under the Papists. [Ulrich] deserves praise for his disdain for superstition. Despite some shortcomings, Blarer is very pleased with his attitude.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger's testimony for Konrad [Hofherr] pleases Blarer. Hofherr, who gave a good sermon [in Konstanz], praises Bullinger's fatherly benevolence. Blarer recently wrote about [Jakob] Metzler [No. 2335]; if he does not change, he will hardly fulfill the expectations placed in him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings, also to [Rudolf] Gwalther, Theodor [Bibliander], [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Erasmus] Schmid. [Thomas Blarer] has not yet returned [from the Frankfurt Bundestag].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I truly do not doubt that you have already received my letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger; to which there is nothing to add at present, except that Buffler wrote to me yesterday that Mr. Naves, the Emperor's commissioner, was captured by the Count of Fürstenberg not far from Frankfurt. However, he does not write which of the counts, Friedrich or Wilhelm, did this or for what reasons, nor in whose name, whether his own or the Emperor's. He then asserts that the Prince of Savoy was killed by the French with 10,000 Spanish soldiers; which does not yet seem credible to me. Time will teach us more certain things.</p>

      <p>What Erb wrote to you, I learned one and a half months ago from the noble Kaspar von Anwyl, who is the chief bailiff of the Balingen province. Pierre Toussain was called by Grynaeus and me about ten years ago to lecture to the monks of the Blaubeuren monastery in the Württemberg region; whom the prince then sent to Montbéliard to serve the church there. He is a man burning with the most ardent zeal for God, solidly learned, who has suffered very unworthy things from the Papists for the name of Christ. The senior prince is to be praised entirely for his abhorrence of all superstition; for which reason his spirit has always pleased me greatly, although there are many things that are desired in him.</p>

      <p>That you bear such full testimony to our Conrad Curioni greatly delighted me. He, in turn, marvelously praises your uncommon benevolence and plainly fatherly spirit towards him, so that I owe you the greatest thanks for this reason, beseeching you through Christ to continue to do what you have done so far. For thus I would not doubt anything about his progress.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Great grace has blessed our church here with the word of the Lord, so that I do not regret promising myself about him, if he obeys your counsel (which he has solemnly promised to do), since heavenly increase cannot be lacking to your sowing. I wrote to you recently about Metzler. However, I fear that he will not meet the first expectation unless he changes into another man very soon. Farewell well, my soul, venerable and more than dearest brother, with your whole household, whom you will uniquely bid to be well in my place, with all the brothers and friends, Gwalther, Theodor, Pellican, Fabricius, etc. Our people, especially our Zviccius, greet you and commend themselves to you. My brother has not yet returned. Pray diligently for us.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, February 3, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, friend of incomparable candor and constancy.</p>
