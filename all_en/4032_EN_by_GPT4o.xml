      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>At this very moment, I have received your letters addressed to me here in Chur, where I have hastily come due to certain pressing matters. I have also received those letters which you wish to be sent to your son, and I will diligently ensure their delivery. Furthermore, I have nothing new to write about.</p>
      <p>The news you shared in your previous letters, regarding the growth of religion, was most welcome. May the same God, who has begun to spread His glory among His faithful most happily, bless and continually advance this good work. We must also pray that He moves the heart of the new King of France to embrace piety and true religion. Here, everything is going quite well, except for the widespread and severe shortage of necessities for sustenance. May the Lord God assist all those in need.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I ask that you love me mutually and always keep me in your thoughts. Farewell, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur at the house of Mr. Johannes Fabricius, very hastily. 1559, on the first of August. Always your most devoted, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>Postscript.</p>
      <p>After hastily writing this, I read other letters sent to me through your son, Mr. Heinrich, which also include others addressed to your son Christoph. I will ensure their safe delivery to our Christoph along with yours, God willing, and you will inform your son Heinrich of this on my behalf, to whom you will also commend me greatly. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my ever-esteemed lord and patron.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
