      <p>Greetings. I believe, dearest lord and esteemed teacher in Christ, that these letters, which I wrote to your lordship from France, have reached your hands. However, it has been a long time since I sent anything written to your lordship, which indeed happened not so much due to my fault, but because of the delay of a long journey, about which I will briefly inform your lordship due to the constraints of time: On the 25th of October, I set out from Paris to Lyon with good omens on my journey to Italy; first, I went to Milan, then through Ferrara, Bologna, Florence, I came to Rome, which they call holy, but I consider it impure. From Rome, I went to Naples, then Ancona, and then to Venice, having had good fortune, but also many adversities. From Venice, I went to Trento; there I found everything full of cardinals, bishops, monks, and priests, who indeed plot many things, but nothing proceeds; for they are in discord among themselves. From Trento, I came through Ulm to Strasbourg, then to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>When I arrived there, I immediately inquired about the health of all of yours from Froscofero, who reported that everything was well, which brought me not a small joy and greater than I can write. May your lordship be content with this small letter, I pray; I will write more copiously at another time when more time is given. Please, your lordship, greet your wife and children, whom Almighty God may preserve for His glory, I pray. Farewell, esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Yours, Rando Schatter. March 24, 1562.</p>
      <p>To the man outstanding in piety and religion, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, overseer of the Christian religion and minister of the Zürich church, his most esteemed teacher, these letters. In Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
