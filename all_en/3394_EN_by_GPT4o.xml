      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letter, dearest compater, yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>In your recent letters, you excuse the sudden haste of your earlier ones; indeed, if there was any fault in that matter, I would rightly forgive it, as I write all my letters both very hastily and poorly, so I can truly say that I am a bad writer. However, those who are in a hurry and entangled in many affairs deserve pardon.</p>
      <p>Now, my ink is so thick that it greatly hinders my desire to write quickly; if I dilute it with water, it seems I would be writing more with water than with ink.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to respond to your letters in order and at length; therefore, receive this in brief. I called my sons-in-law and explained what you wrote to me about the nephew of Mr. Augustin von Salis.</p>
      <p>Ludwig has someone learning both French and German; however, they make no progress in the language when such are joined together. Zwingli has more fellow boarders than he would like; in such a crowd, boys of this kind are not well advised. Josias also has his not unjust excuses.</p>
      <p>I sent him to Mr. Johann Koler to inquire whether he would accept such a boy.</p>
      <p>He replied that he would accept him, but not for less than 30 florins, which seems to me to be quite ample. I could do nothing else now.</p>
      <p>Your letters were returned to me yesterday evening. You know that today I preach, and then I am more than usually visited and disturbed by many. But now the letters had to be returned.</p>
      <p>I will inquire further about this later.</p>
      <p>Such young boys need trustworthy people who do good to them and do not become quickly annoyed. It concerns and troubles me whenever students come here, for whom I am asked to find hosts.</p>
      <p>I would prefer others to do this, who have more leisure and fewer cares. I send what news we have here, written on paper.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Consul, Mr. Philipp, Pontasella, and friends, especially Mr. Friedrich von Salis, to whom you will communicate the news. Also, inform that most distinguished man, Mr. Conrad Gessner, that if he has any description of the Worms or Bromia baths, the Wormserbad, he should kindly share it with him. He wishes him all happiness and promises to be grateful.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 5, 1557. All of mine greet you and yours. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my compater and dearest brother. To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
