      <p>Greetings. On the 22nd of this month, our most honorable friend and mutual acquaintance, Mr. Richard Hillis, left Straßburg with his pious wife and dear children, heading towards England. Yesterday, your letters, most esteemed sir, arrived for the first time, which, as he had instructed upon his departure, I opened and read. We received and safely sent the book and letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury through the impure Jew Michael Adam some time ago. However, the Jew greatly disappointed my expectations; he borrowed three florins from me and, without my knowledge, eight thalers from Mr. Richard in my absence. He left here shortly after the fair, but, as I hear, only after having lost a great sum of money through gambling; thus, our funds, unless I am mistaken, are lost, unless perhaps something remains with you, with which both your people and we could be reimbursed. If there is anything, I beg you to assist us. He boasted that Froschauer would give him a hundred florins for a book translated from Hebrew; but perhaps this is not true. Do whatever you can in our name, if there is any hope left.</p>
      <p>We deeply mourn the disaster of the people of Konstanz, but much more so because, although they are victors, they are contemplating defection. May the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us all!</p>
      <p>We have not yet received any news about the state of England nor anything about Mr. John a Lasco; if I learn anything, you will hear of it. The rumors about the Scots and the English are uncertain; therefore, I pass over them until something more certain is heard.</p>
      <p>Mr. Richard and his wife, before departing, instructed me to greet you and your family and children most dutifully, as well as all the learned men of your church. The booklet, which I have now received, I will send to him at the next convenient opportunity, and I will also inscribe the summary of your letters in mine; for so he instructed concerning yours and all others. You have been most diligently greeted by my wife, children, and household.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you steadfast for as long as possible in the confession of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and grant us the same grace. Amen. The Emperor, as I hear, is expected in Speyer any day now. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Bullinger, esteemed and dear friend. Zürich.</p>
