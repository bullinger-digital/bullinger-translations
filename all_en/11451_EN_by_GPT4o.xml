    <p xml:id="regest1">From Hagenau, it is reported that [King] Ferdinand is being urged to go to war against the Protestants; the priests had rejoiced over their supposed discord when envoys from Basel did not join the delegates of the [evangelical] cities, but this false impression was immediately corrected. Statements from [Johannes] Fabri also indicate that the bishops are intent on war and that it is the disunity in the evangelical camp that makes them strong; anyone who now closes themselves off to efforts for unity and resistance can hardly be called a Christian. More detailed news is still awaited; the Turks are also waging war again. The bickering of the theologians is not only foolish but also godless.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A certain good man returned from the assembly in Hagenau. He first said that Ferdinand is being urged to destroy us, so much so that he feared for some time that war would begin before he could return home. Then, because our envoys (whom the lords sent for their own reasons) did not join the envoys of the cities for several days, a conversation arose among the priests that there was discord among them, which made them rejoice and become more stubborn in their purpose.</p>
      <p>This rumor reached our people; they immediately, during dinner, overwhelmed the people of Constance and those who were with them, and dined with them with such joy that it is pleasant to hear. The next day, our people invited the people of Constance and the others, so that nineteen envoys gathered. Then indeed the joy of the priests was not a little diminished. Meanwhile, envoys from Saxony and Hesse arrived, and among all our people, joy arose, but with little hope; the bishops are so strong and so many.</p>
      <p>The day before I wrote this, some learned men were here, one of whom whispered to me that Camerarius of TÃ¼bingen had told him, while Faber came to the assembly, he came into conversation with a certain good man. Among other things, this man said: "The debate will be remarkable; for there are certainly men standing by the gospel, learned and well-armed with scriptures, so that they will not easily yield." Then Faber replied: "There is no need for much debate; it must be settled with a cold blade." These things were later confirmed to me, so there can be no doubt that the bishops are planning nothing but war. Therefore, when I look at the above, I cannot help but recall what I wrote to you last, that merely the rumor of your, that is, the Swiss, arrival could have terrified the adversaries; for they have nothing that makes them more stubborn than our discord. And while at this time something was said about the concord of all of us, so that they might have some hope left in appearance, Faber said: "Oh, concord; it is feigned, therefore we fear nothing." From which it is certain, as I said, that our discord makes them strong. I wish that consultation would be made both about concord and about countering the impending evils. Indeed, I can hardly consider those who are not most diligent and provident in consulting here as Christians.</p>
      <p>I could add much more if I were not expecting more certain information. The Turk has certainly inflicted serious damage and has renewed the war.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours. Indeed, I am mad when I think of the foolishness, not to say madness, but the very impiety of the learned in dissenting. May the Lord grant hope of concord.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, July 4, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
