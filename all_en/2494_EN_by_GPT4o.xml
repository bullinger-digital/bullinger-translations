      <p>S. P. Most distinguished doctor of the church, because I have not written to you since the end of September, I feared to sin against the public good having nothing serious to report. Now I am calling from France Mr. François Baudouin, a doctor teaching in Bourges, who was my scribe twelve years ago, learned and most diligent, to be appointed in my place at Tübingen, as I promised the most illustrious duke, to whom I write to give him a letter of appointment or command. At the same time, I also advise the excellent Count Georg, that if anything should arise to prevent his admission to Tübingen (for perhaps the haughty, fearing for their own opinion, which I have begun to elevate, will suspect him to be of the same opinion as me), he should nevertheless ensure that he is retained and sent here to the law school to be started with me, as the aforementioned princes intend to do here, as they told me in Swabia. There is no more suitable place for establishing an academy for Germans and French and for both common languages. It was less laborious for me and of greater and present profit to teach in Strasbourg, as I saw when I stayed there for six days at the beginning of October; but I was attracted here by the hope of spreading the church and willingly agreed. It will be a great increase if it succeeds; for many learned and pious men from France, Flanders, and Burgundy will come, and then certain members of this church, too morbid in some surrounding villages, will be easily opposed. The matter is easy if the prince lends a hand, and not costly; for it will support itself much better than his war, as Cato the Elder was heard to say in the senate; for there is no need for foundations and papal rites suitable for ruining youth. Already inquiring, I knew that even in winter there would be an abundance of provisions. At first, I was only concerned about accommodations; but now I see that the leading citizens of the town alone can comfortably and profitably accommodate more than fifty auditors. This is enough at the beginning, for if there are fifty here comfortably, there could be two hundred before the year is out, with the remaining citizens adapting themselves to similar things, who now, because they do not know and distrust, grumble. My students have no privilege, no immunity except the number of civil and tax obligations, which they will study without fraud, I want them to handle nothing but the pen and books or be expelled. I will give such articles of this new policy that parents who send their children here can trust they will be fruitful.</p>
      <p>If Baudouin is here, there will be three legal lectures a day, which will prevail over six or twelve of those in Tübingen or elsewhere, besides the fact that there will not be so many interruptions and vacations. However, I do not want to snatch him away from the duke and Tübingen; but since many things can happen, I also ask you, for the favor of the church, to write to the most pious Count Georg, not to neglect Baudouin or let him go elsewhere, but to send him here for the sake of the school soon to be started and to carry out what he proposed in his mind and told me, in reality. That prince is much and deservedly attached to you and your church and holds you in high regard.</p>
      <p>I wish you well, that you may say you have been asked and petitioned by me. If you think this occasion of writing should also be added to the cause of the church, many pious ministers in this church will thank you by name. I came here on the tenth of October not without inconvenience, with two of my chariots broken in the Martian forest due to the storm. Since I came, the building of the school has been completed and roofed, which is nevertheless intended for languages and the humanities. But in the house granted to me, I will be able to accommodate more than fifty auditors very comfortably. Nothing can make an academy more frequent than a legal lecture, especially the analytical and practical one, which I am going to give. If Augsburg had not been too miserably ensnared by the hooks of the Emperor, I would have had, where I have powerful friends, lectures on forensic matters and consultations, not students, but experienced men of affairs as auditors, with a large printing press, which suffered an abortion by the Emperor. Would that Germany be soon freed from such things. Farewell. May the Lord always be with you.</p>
      <p>I wish to greet the venerable father Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander the πολθιστορα (polymath), your son-in-law Lavater, and others in my name. Montbéliard, the fourth day before the Ides of December 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast, doctor, and most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
