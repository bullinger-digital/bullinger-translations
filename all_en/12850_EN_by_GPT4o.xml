    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Jörg Regelin departed in the morning, Zwick received the news that Emperor Charles V had written to the Thirteen Cantons, stating that he wanted to punish Augsburg, Strasbourg, Konstanz, and Lindau, and therefore expected them not to come to the aid of these cities. Since this letter arrived only after the last diet, an attempt should be made to persuade King Francis I to urge the Confederates to address the Emperor with the following request: He should not take any action against Konstanz, as this city has so far proven peaceful towards all its neighbors and will likely continue to do so in the future, so he has nothing to fear from their side, and the Confederates will show their gratitude towards him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] If such a letter could not be obtained, the Emperor's letter should be kept secret, and the four Protestant cantons should neither accept nor reject any potentially adverse decision of the Thirteen Cantons against Konstanz, but take it to their councils for discussion, while simultaneously making the other cantons aware that the matter must be considered particularly well, as Konstanz is a strategically important city for the Confederation and the Four Cantons are [friendly] towards it. The other cantons would not be offended by this, and if the [imperial] opponent learned of it, it would deter him from taking any action against Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The councils of the Four Cantons should entrust the matter to their respective secret councils for consultation, so that it can be discussed again [at a diet]. If no joint statement [from the Confederates] is reached, the enemy would remain unclear [about their intentions].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Zwick seeks by all means to delay the submission of Konstanz and to provide the Konstanz council with some human hopes, for otherwise, they would likely surrender like the other cities. God have mercy!</p>

      <p>Dear lord and friend, after Jörg Regelin departed this morning, I received news that the Emperor has written to the Thirteen Cantons, expressing his intention to punish Augsburg, Strasbourg, Konstanz, and Lindau, with the request that they should not burden themselves with these cities, etc. If such a letter had not been at the last diet in Baden and only arrived afterwards, I thought it would be good if we could arrange for the French to persuade the Confederates to petition the Emperor, since they know nothing else than that the people of Konstanz have so far behaved peacefully towards all their neighbors and will undoubtedly continue to do so, and that His Majesty has nothing to fear from them, so that the Emperor would still refrain from taking any action against the city of Konstanz and would not undertake anything burdensome against them; they would repay this, etc. Such a proposal might well succeed.</p>

      <p>However, if such a letter cannot be obtained, it would still be good for it to remain secret and for the Protestant cantons not to approve or reject any decision of the other Confederates that would be against us, but to bring it to their councils for better deliberation, with the indication that, since they know what is at stake for the Confederation in this city and how their communities are inclined towards the city, their lords will need to consider the matter well. The Confederates would not be offended by this, and if it came out, the opponent would certainly undertake less against us.</p>

      <p>In the councils, the matter could be arranged so that the deliberation is entrusted to some as a secret command for further discussion. If no good means are found, the matter remains secret, and the enemies do not know what is being considered.</p>

      <p>Oh God, I would gladly seek a way to delay the matter and that my lords are not deprived of all human comfort, for otherwise, I fear we will do as others. God have mercy on us for Christ Jesus' sake. Dated February 7, 1547. Konrad Zwick.</p>
