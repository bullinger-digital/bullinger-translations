      <p>Praise be to God through Jesus Christ, on the 28th of November 1550 in Bergamo.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings, entirely humble, willing service and everything that I can offer with body and goods, always to the honorable dear sir. On the 3rd of November was my last letter to you and with it a letter to Mr. Laelio, asking you to deliver it to him if possible.</p>
      <p>This letter of mine is solely to ask you not to spare me in anything that I can and may do. The Cardinal of Trento is on the move with 20 horses towards Genoa; every day they await the arrival of the Duke of Austria from Spain to Genoa.</p>
      <p>On the 21st, in the night, there was a storm in Venice with lightning, great thunderclaps, and the river swelled beyond all measure, so that several ships, called Marsiliani, came to St. Mark's Square. Many people drowned; it caused unspeakably great damage. May God the Lord be merciful to us.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write to you. All the sons of Christ greet you, etc. Greet all those who love the Lord. Grace, mercy, and peace of our Lord be always with you.</p>
      <p>Your humble, willing servant always, Franz Bonett.</p>
      <p>To the honorable... Heinrich Bullinger... for his own hands.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
