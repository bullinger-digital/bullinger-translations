      <p>Greetings in Christ. Most illustrious man, reverend father in Christ, your letters, written by another hand, were sent to me from the Baths by my noble ladies. They do not require much of a response; for I hope that my previous letters (in which I indicated to your reverence that yours had been delivered to me) have certainly reached you. We hear nothing more about Schmidlin; there was a rumor that he would soon come to Memmingen, but it has subsided. Indeed, the people of Memmingen are reported to be much more modest in their pulpits than before; I cannot know the reason for this. Dr. Johannes Rivulus sent me two letters, asking me to ensure they are delivered to your reverence, in which I believe he accounts for the neglect of his duty to your reverence. I hope he will visit us soon.</p>
      <p>My noble lord, with his wife and sister, has safely, praise be to God, returned home. I cannot express how greatly they praise your and your people's piety, kindness, courtesy, hospitality, and the countless services rendered to them; you have so bound their hearts with acts of kindness that they greatly desire and strive to serve you in return, should the opportunity arise. Your pious and serious admonition will also not be without fruit among them. I learned with sorrow from them that your reverence is still gravely ill; may the Lord graciously restore and sustain you.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the reverend man Dr. Josias Simler, your beloved son-in-law, and the most courteous and dutiful old man Dr. Johannes Haller, as well as your son Heinrich, my old friend, and your other colleagues, my reverend lords and brothers to be honored. May your reverence fare well and happily.</p>
      <p>Given at Grönenbach, July 3, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most devoted Georg Kugelmann, minister of the church of Grönenbach.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and reverend man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, chief pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and father in Christ, to be reverently honored. Zürich.</p>
