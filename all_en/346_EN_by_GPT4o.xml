      <p>S. D. I received your letter the day before yesterday in the evening along with the letter from the Bernese senate and our Haller, and I was immediately seized by an unknown terror, because I saw that through Haller's efforts, the senate wrote to me, and at the same time, that you and he attribute much more to me than is appropriate, and more than I can acknowledge. I write this sincerely (as Christ loves me) and entirely from the heart. For I would be exceedingly afraid if I were to take on this task, that I could meet the expectations that I am under; I feel so deprived now of those things which are considered especially necessary for the proper administration of such a distinguished church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, may the Lord make your prayers for me, made in your recent letters, effective, so that He may inspire in me a mind that, enlightened and strengthened by His spirit, sees and does those things which are truly conducive to the glory of His name, the edification of His church, and my salvation. I wrote to you at the last Wil fair with letters addressed to our Walter from Ulm, to the nephew from the sister; let me know as soon as possible whether you have received them. I do not doubt that our Haller has written to you about what the Bernese are asking of me; I am now sending you a copy of what I replied, which I kept with me due to an admitted error, otherwise I would hardly have been so diligent. Haller asks that I come to Zurich on the fourth or third day before the Kalends of December, and then proceed with him and the legate to Bern, which can hardly be done for certain reasons.</p>
      <p>I ask you, however, that as soon as he arrives there, you inform me through this messenger, if you cannot do otherwise, about his arrival, so that I can further consider what needs to be done. You will discuss with Curio yourself; he believes your letters were left at the house of our Theodor; but if nothing else, he certainly erred greatly in this, as he affirmed upon returning here that he had received none from anyone except Hopper. He is hurrying to Bern to find Haller there, and could not do so sooner, since Haller's letters were brought the day before yesterday in the evening and I sent those addressed to Curio to Episcopicella yesterday, so you too will see that what arrives later is not to his detriment.</p>
      <p>Nothing new, except that the royal commissioners are in constant negotiation, claiming that they are bringing Constance into an agreement; they have full authority to handle everything, and now the ban has been lifted again on all sides.</p>
      <p>Our expelled, my dear brother, also cousin, city scribe, guild master Labhart, guild master Bär, Ludwig Heuruß, Mattheus Flaur, also another councilor named Hubentobel, and Heinrich Hack from Frauenfeld, who was a church warden, are now deliberating on how they can petition for themselves and their own, also for the preachers, so that everyone can pursue their own cause, etc. It will be hard to maintain, etc. keeping it once more with you. God be with you! Asking earnestly, earnestly for us.</p>
      <p>Given on the 20th of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, A[mbrosius] Bl[aurer].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed friend and brother, and in every way most dear. In Zurich.</p>
