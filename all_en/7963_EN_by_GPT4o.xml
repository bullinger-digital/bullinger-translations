      <p>God be with us. Yesterday, things did not go as we thought; for my gracious lord, the Count, did not want to go to Schaffhausen, but rather to St. Gallen, Lindau, and then to Augsburg. I have already prepared the letters for St. Gallen and Augsburg. However, yesterday a letter arrived stating that he changed his plan and intends to go to Schaffhausen today and then down the Rhine to Strasbourg, etc. He has thus agreed with me that he will stay here today, hear the sermon tomorrow, have a meal, then at 12 go to the mountain, have dinner with you, and early Monday morning to Schaffhausen. Be aware, our Heinrich Bercker and Doctor KÃ¤ller are to provide him with the escort to you. However, since he has to write to the cities and change his plans, I do not know if something will come up that will make him change it again. Therefore, I would not incur any special costs, but rather prepare generally.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna, Elisabeth, and your household for me, etc. All our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, August 13, 1569.</p>
      <p>God protect you.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
