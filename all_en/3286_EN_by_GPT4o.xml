      <p>Greetings. Since I have sent not only the remaining part of my booklet but also another copy, I eagerly await your judgment. However much they continue to rage against me, I will always face all their attacks fearlessly.</p>
      <p>For nothing will happen that I have not considered from the beginning, and not even the ingratitude of some will make me ever regret the work I have undertaken. I agree with you about the pride or obstinacy of the opposing party.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, nothing will prevent me from embracing the offered colloquium. If you do not agree, see to what rashness I have erupted, having pledged on behalf of all of you to Philipp.</p>
      <p>As for your despair about the outcome, our opinions do not differ much. But, believe me, the adversaries will hear things that will blunt their ferocity in the future: and unless all my conjectures deceive me, even if they do not repent, they will still depart more subdued. Nor should the private conversation between Mr. a Lasco and Brentius deter you.</p>
      <p>He alone, and not sufficiently well-prepared, engaged with a headstrong man more boldly than prudently. The situation will be very different where Philipp, whose timidity does not allow him to freely express what he feels, will most gladly join us. Recently, a letter of his written in July to the Frankfurt Senate was shown to me, where, although not yet openly, he professes his faith, yet does not explicitly complain that his neighbors disturb the church with foreign voices, nor does he conceal that the immensity of Christ's body and adoration should be decided among learned men. Therefore, let us be prepared for the colloquium, provided we bring a calm gentleness worthy of Christ's ministers.</p>
      <p>I do not see anything in Beza's confession that is less consistent with our doctrine. For whatever you bring up about the term substance is easily resolved without any trouble.</p>
      <p>And he himself, do not doubt, will skillfully extricate himself from all the objections you fear. I admit, he did not explain the whole controversy clearly enough.</p>
      <p>Neither was there time, nor was it expedient, since a brief excuse was to be given, not a confession. Indeed, I am completely secure about the danger: since I do not distrust the man's integrity in the least, nor has he entangled himself so that there is the slightest opportunity for the enemies to boast.</p>
      <p>I come to other matters.</p>
      <p>Although our people have achieved nothing fair with the neighbors so far, indeed with outright rejections all hopes have been cut off, I was nevertheless the author of sending another delegation, which, if it proves fruitless, certain help is expected here from the Swiss cities. However, I greatly fear where this prodigious hardness will lead.</p>
      <p>It is hardly credible to say how miserably they have been trembling in the kingdom of France. Now they are gradually gathering their spirits from the consternation.</p>
      <p>As if the king had leisure, the neighbors think we are negotiating secret agreements with him: or at least they pretend, to burden us with false suspicions as is their custom. For you would not believe how childishly they act in all things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man and brother to be respected by me. May the Lord always be with you and continue to bless you with your family.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before the calends of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, brother and fellow minister to be respected.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
