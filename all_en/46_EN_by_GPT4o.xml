    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer responds in haste to Bullinger's letter [not received]. The people of Konstanz share the suspicion of the people of Zurich that behind the delay [in responding to Konstanz's request for reconciliation with Emperor Charles V] lie dishonest intentions. But by God's providence, this deceit will strike the [Emperor] himself! The people of Konstanz must endure it steadfastly. The blockade of Konstanz is becoming increasingly oppressive. It is intended to prevent the people of Konstanz from receiving news and learning of the [imperial] intentions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">A few days ago, a man from Urach [N.N.], who was carrying letters for the Konstanz council, for Konrad Zwick, and one of his relatives in Konstanz [N.N.], was instructed in Überlingen under threat of punishment to send the letters back. Nevertheless, the man from Urach delivered them by using a different route. [Due to this restriction] no letters are reaching Konstanz from Swabia [via the usual route]. And when letters do arrive, they contain no news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Recently, a [Konstanz] messenger [N.N.] traveled to Augsburg. Blarer had sent a letter to Georg Frölich with him but received no reply. He would have liked to know the status of the religious discussions and whether Philipp Melanchthon is really participating. As Bullinger wrote, it will be a peculiar event where the irreconcilable is combined. May God assist the people of Konstanz to remain in His truth throughout their lives, without regard for the welfare of their descendants!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Blarer is very grateful for the fever remedy. But does Bullinger seriously mean that the patient should know nothing [of its use] and that exactly three pieces of the medicine must be used [in its application]? Blarer considers that to be great superstition! He intends to try the remedy and apply it to the patient [N.N.], but with his knowledge. If it helps, it is good.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger need not concern himself further with the writing "Onus ecclesiae," as Blarer has managed to obtain a copy. He was very pleased when skimming through the writing, as it entirely corresponds to the present times and the biblical prophecies. If someone with sound judgment reads it, they will recognize that the book is by no means useless.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Blarer has not yet heard from the [Thurgau] bailiff [Leonhard Holzhalb from Zurich] regarding his stance on the marriage of [Hans Rutishauser and his cousin Dorothea Diethelm known as Münchin]. When Blarer learns of it, he will inform Bullinger. It would be appropriate if Holzhalb left the good people in peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Blarer is pleased that Joachim Rheticus is doing better. May the Savior completely free him from the workings of the devil [a mental illness?]! It is quite clear that one need not be ashamed of such a pious member of the church. He serves as an outstanding example of God's chastisement, sparing the carefree people from an even harsher punishment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Blarer has just learned of the letter that the Konstanz council sent to the Zurich council regarding the passage of [imperial mercenaries] through the territories of the Grey League. The messenger may return [with the Zurich's response] before Blarer finishes writing this letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">The legal proceedings against Joachim Mötteli will likely drag on longer because he has bought the silence of many people [in court] with large bribes. These are truly Strasbourg conditions! May God improve him and all others in His grace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">May God strengthen the Swiss representatives [at the Baden Diet] in their intention to free themselves from alliances with [foreign] powers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Blarer is very grateful for the coin minted with the rooster, the heraldic animal of the Blarer family. And not because he now has a memento of Bullinger (he always thinks of him especially), but because of Bullinger himself: He gave him the gift out of friendship, and that is worth more to Blarer than the precious gift itself. Blarer suspects that the coin was once minted by the Bishop of Konstanz Albrecht Blarer or rather by the Abbot of St. Gallen [Eglolf Blarer]. He is very fond of such mementos.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">He will inquire who might have the songs in Konstanz. What he finds out, he will convey through the [intended] messenger [a carter, N.N.] of the letter. He would like to repay his debt and also render a great service to Bullinger if only he knew how! May God reward Bullinger in this life and the next!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">The preacher of Ermatingen [Gregor Seemann] has not yet visited Blarer. Whether he will still come is uncertain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">Blarer wants to hope for the best regarding Bullinger's assumptions about the [willingness to help] of the Swiss [in the event of an imperial attack on Konstanz]. However, he relies solely on God and is ready to take up the cross and make a sacrifice. May God be gracious to Konstanz and let the people of Konstanz endure [the coming events] either bravely suffering or in another way. Eventually, one must die. Blessed is he who, with God's help, overcomes the world in patience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick has something entirely different in mind with his war machine than to use it [in an attack]. The people of Zurich should earnestly intercede for Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">The [imperial] restrictions are being enforced more strictly. The people of Konstanz receive nothing from Lindau anymore, and letters are also not allowed to be sent from there to Konstanz. It is known that some [citizens of Lindau] have sent their daughters to Arbon, probably out of fear of the foreign mercenaries [of the Emperor]. All of this is strange. But God is truly wonderful, for He sees through the past and present as well as the machinations of Charles V and King Henry II of France! They cannot deceive Him! Praise be to Him forever. One must surrender to Him, in life or in death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">Blarer had written his letter on Tuesday, [February 14, 1548], thinking that the carters would set off [to the Confederation] the next day. However, they intend to depart on Wednesday in eight days [on February 22, 1548]. Blarer now does not know if he will find a messenger [who can leave earlier] by then, but he will try.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">A woman [N.N.], considered very trustworthy, has claimed that within four weeks, imperial troops will gather near [the fortress] Hohentwiel in the Hegau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">On Candlemas [February 2, 1548], the Emperor rode to mass with the [six] electors [Sebastian von Heusenstamm, Archbishop of Mainz, Adolf III of Schaumburg, Archbishop of Cologne, Johann V of Isenburg, Archbishop of Trier, Frederick II the Wise of the Palatinate, Maurice of Saxony, and Joachim II of Brandenburg]. However, Frederick the Wise turned back and listened to the sermon in his quarters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">Blarer can now hand this letter over to Jakob Ruf for delivery. He has indeed given up drinking! May God strengthen him and all other believers, wherever they are, in goodness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">Contrary to expectations and to his great annoyance, Blarer could not find the songs in Konstanz, neither with the Konstanz bookseller [Gregor Mangolt] nor with others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">The pious servant of the Lindau church, Thomas Gaßner, passed away [on February 13, 1548]. How poorly the Lindau church is faring! May God have mercy on it and all other churches! Gaßner fared very well: Happy are those who die in the Lord, and completely blessed are those who die now!</p>

      <p>All good things from God along with my heartfelt brotherly wishes to you! Your letters have reached me, and I respond to them in haste as follows: The suspicion regarding the delay on your part is not without reason. For we also have this belief here, that there is deceit behind it. But God, the true one, can and will (I hope) arrange it so that deceit will strike its own master. May He grant us patience to endure! We are being blocked and pressured more and more severely, so that no letters can reach us, and we cannot learn what is intended.</p>

      <p>Recently, a man from Urach carried letters to my lords and cousin Konrad Zwick, and also to one of his relatives here. But when he reached Überlingen, he was instructed to send the letters back if he did not want to face distress and suffering. He did so, although he managed to deliver them through another route. Thus, no letters are reaching us from Swabia anymore. And even when something is written, we receive no news.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Recently, a messenger went to Augsburg. I wrote to Leto, etc., but received not a word in return. I would have liked to know how the colloquium stands, whether Philippus has arrived there, as is said, etc. It will indeed be, as you write, a strange brotherly meal and a mixture of wool and linen. May God help us to remain in the truth all our lives. It cannot be otherwise. The descendants may perhaps experience better or worse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I thank you very much for the roots. However, I wonder if you are writing to me in jest, saying that nothing should be told to the feverish person and that exactly three roots must be used. It would be a great superstition if it were true. I will try it and let it be applied to the sick person with his knowledge. If it helps, it is right.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Do not be concerned further about "Onus ecclesiae." I have obtained a very suitable copy. I am very pleased with the hasty reading of this book, as everything corresponds so well to our times and the prophecies of the scriptures. Indeed, if someone reads it with sound judgment, they will clearly understand that the book is not entirely useless.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have not heard anything from the bailiff about how he handles the marriage issue. I will find out and then report to you. It would be good if he left the good people in peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am exceedingly glad that our Joachim is doing somewhat better. May our Savior completely dissolve the works of the devil in him and make him entirely His own as soon as possible! As it is evident from clear arguments, he belongs to the Lord and is a commendable example of divine chastisement, so that we do not feel the Lord's judgment more severely in our great negligence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding the Grey League and the pass, you have received a letter, of which I knew nothing until later. Perhaps the messenger will arrive before I finish writing this letter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I believe Mötteli's case will drag on for a long time because he is bribing many Argentinians with large sums of money, causing them to have a sore throat and be unable to speak. He is incurring unbelievably high costs and expenses on the matter. May God improve him and all of us soon with much grace!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>May God strengthen your lords, the princes, and the alliances in their intention to go idle and free themselves from alliances with foreign powers!</p>

      <p>I thank you very much for the coin with the image of our rooster, and for your sake: not so that I may remember you, whose memory is always present with me, but because you gave it as a gift, and that gift is very dear to me, even more so because of your affection. I think it was once minted by the Bishop of Konstanz or certainly by the Abbot of St. Gallen. I am very fond of such mementos.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I will inquire everywhere about the songs, who might have them here. As much as I can find out, I will send to you with this messenger. Oh God, I would like to do you a great service, even if it would be difficult for me. I am very much at your service. May the Lord Himself be your eternal rewarder here and there!</p>

      <p>The preacher from Ermatingen has not been with me. I do not know if he will still come or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Regarding what you assure yourself of on our behalf to your confederates, I also want to hope for the best, while placing my trust solely in God, sending my back under the cross, and offering myself to my God as a sacrifice. May He take the fatherland into His grace and maintain the honor of His name among us, so that we may overcome either with brave, patient suffering (if He wills it so) or in another way, of which He knows many. One must die eventually. Blessed is he to whom God grants the honor of overcoming the world with patience.</p>

      <p>Cousin Konrad Zwick has a very different plan with his art than to use it now in this case. Praying to God earnestly, with faith and all loyalty, for our city and churches along with all the pious.</p>

      <p>The mandates are being enforced more strictly. We receive nothing from Lindau anymore. No one is allowed to write to us from there. However, we know that some have sent their daughters to Arbon, from which we suspect they are securing themselves against a foreign people. The practices are wonderful. But much more wonderful is the Lord God of Hosts. He understands all old and new, German and French practices. They will not deceive Him. Praise be to Him forever. We will be His, whether living or dying.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I wrote this on Tuesday, thinking our carters would leave tomorrow. But they intend to leave in eight days from tomorrow. I do not know if I can find a messenger in the meantime, but I will try diligently.</p>

      <p>On the Feast of the Purification of Mary, the Emperor rode to church with the princes. The electors went with him to the service and remained there. Only the Count Palatine Frederick, once he reached the church, rode back to his quarters and listened to a sermon.</p>

      <p>Now I send you this letter with our master Jacob. He has indeed fallen into another habit because of drinking! May God strengthen him in all good and us all. Those here and there are entrusted to Him.</p>

      <p>To my great regret, I could not find or learn of the songs, neither with our bookseller nor with others. I had thought they would have been composed with them. I am truly very sorry!</p>

    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Mr. Thomas Gaßner of Lindau, the pious, zealous, faithful servant of God and His church, has also passed away in the Lord. Oh, how badly things have gone for the church in Lindau! May God have mercy on them and all churches! For him, it has gone best: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. How completely blessed is he who dies now! Given on the 18th of February, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
