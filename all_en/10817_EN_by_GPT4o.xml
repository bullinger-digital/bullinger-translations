    <p xml:id="regest1">The Catholics set up two altars and images in the jointly used church, although they had only been granted the erection of one altar; with Bullinger's support, [the Reformers] would bring their case before the Diet once more, even though they were let down by the Bernese last time. Requests support so that they may have a baptismal font, a cloth to separate the Catholic area during the service, and their own schoolmaster in the church.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir, know that our opponents have set up an altar in the church, which belongs to the common citizens, according to the request of the peace treaty; this was allowed by those who led our community, as there was no unity. They are not satisfied with this, but without any consent from us, they have set up 2 altars, an oil mountain, a grave, etc., and everything that is against the foundation of our faith, in the common church, not in the proper parish; thereby the simple are greatly troubled, as we must endure idolatry before our eyes with all the adornment and decoration of the Antichrist. And we have nothing in the church, neither a baptismal font nor a place where we could properly begin the praiseworthy thanksgiving of the Lord (the Eucharist), thereby our religion is despised and the holy sacraments are scorned, which grieves us greatly. For you know well that the holy Paul fought against the customs of the heathens with God's word and gradually eradicated them. So we must remain silent and let them plant among us without any contradiction, God be it lamented. For those who were formerly from our community before the Confederates in Baden could not come to a peace agreement with the old church lords and church properties. The envoys from Bern, when they presented their case in Baden, left the council chamber, which had previously promised them much.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they are not willing to come before the Confederates again, fearing that all is lost. Yet they would like to try once more with your advice.</p>
      <p>For this reason, our friendly request is that you would advise and help us so that we may remain in the peace treaty and also have a baptismal font in the common church, a cloth that runs through the middle of the church and covers their idols and altars when we hear God's word, and that we may obtain a learned fellow from the church property as a schoolmaster, for they intend, according to their plan, to appoint a mass priest on Mr. Hans Suneman's benefice, who would be the schoolmaster, sing in the choir, and in the other churches set up all altars again and do everything according to their belief.</p>
      <p>We cannot prevent this without unrest. May God be with you. Dated Frauenfeld, March 30.</p>
      <p>Peter RÃ¼meli, always your willing [servant].</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord.</p>
