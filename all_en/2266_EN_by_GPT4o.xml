      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Revered pastor and teacher, yesterday I received great joy from your letters, but it was brief; I expected a full and detailed response regarding the cause of the schism, about which I found nothing in your brief letters. But only about the inserted letters of ti. i. C., which falsely began to be called laws, when they were never letters, and ancient books testify that they were not in ancient books. And I publicly refuted the falsehood in a lecture with 7 reasons. My speech is only a new preface to my analytical interpretation of C., which I would now have printed if I had a printer. What you noted in the margin about images, you rightly believe; I learned this from you 12 years ago from your learned and pious book On the Origin of Error.</p>
      <p>Regarding the letters of the royal envoy, he indicates that he cannot do what I had asked of him; if he could do or indicate anything by which I might rescue my family from Egypt. Therefore, I had nothing left but the pain of my lengthy (but serious) letters, which I understand were lost two months ago, sent through a Rhaetian (who had served Mr. Vergerio); I had them written not without danger by one of my students, so that they could be communicated to learned men with you and the church to aid the common cause of the church, into which I have incurred the utmost hatred of many since the end of January... At first, they mocked my voice to exclude me or to force me to a lower rank, which was easily refuted in the first public lecture (even with little preparation) with the whole academy gathered, and if I began by lashing out at the papacy, although I knew almost all the professors were papists. At the end of January, desiring to communicate (as I had done in other... churches), and wanting to first give an account of my faith to Iseman, he came of his own accord and we conversed alone for over three hours, with him pressing the ubiquity, and me openly disapproving and refuting everything so that he had nothing to add except to display obstinacy. I said further that opinions about the mode of presence should not be divided, as long as there is agreement in the word of God and the doctrine of the word, and nothing else should be sought from the churches. He, on the other hand. I asked how he could condemn your, Lausanne, Geneva, Neuch창tel, and similar churches; he smiled: not only those, but all, if all felt as you do. I told him to his face that he was a supporter of schism and that I would never commit to condemning your churches (with which I said I had communed sacredly) or agree with their condemners. Thus we parted. The next day (although the conversation had been secret) the whole school and church were buzzing that I was a Zwinglian. I called some of my students and warned them that I was neither a Zwinglian nor a Lutheran, but a Christian and an enemy of schism, and that I only pursued schism and ubiquity. Soon the papists raised their crests and the Lutherans applauded. But they achieved nothing. In my lectures on the first titles of the Corpus, I sharply attacked the papistic doctrine, even giving... enda. I postponed delivering that speech, lest it be allowed to... from a distance and lest I give an impediment to the exit of the family, as now... having been rejected by so many and 5 powerful princes, I delivered it and, before sending it to the court, had it printed, otherwise it would not have been published.</p>
      <p>For as soon as I delivered it, even some of the Lutherans complained to the court that dangers from the Emperor or the Pope were imminent, but they achieved nothing. Finally, I see that I cannot defend myself here against so many enemies and the envious except by the excellence of jurisprudence (which the Lord now uses as a means). For I prove that the law professors of this school and all the advocates of Burgundy and others have deceived the prince... and his father with their ignorance for 20 years. Whenever a decision is sought, they cease elsewhere. I indeed read twice a day and... and complete analytically, they must yield to me. I responded very sharply and freely to the prince's complaining letter, expecting that I might be dismissed. But he sent the great master of the court, who excused the letters sent by the prince through inadvertence and advised holding Isemann as a good man. (Certainly, your letters to the prince will declare him a schismatic); he added that if I wished to communicate, I would not be excommunicated. I did not respond to this last point, because it was ambiguous... and he spoke secretly. I would have liked to respond in the presence of arbitrators. It is certain that I will never communicate with schismatics unless they profess to desist from schism, that is, to accept other churches as well, nor will I care about their excommunication; therefore, I have always abstained here. Fearing that I might leave, the prince not only appointed me as a counselor with a new stipend but also ordered a private house to be given to me... the professors to yield to me. For I had said (as it is) that otherwise I would leave. The papists and Lutherans fear that, having a house, in which... I will have all the boarders, whom I will also teach privately, much will be lost to their faction, as will certainly happen, or I will leave; thus I have decided. Farewell. The grace and peace of God be with you. Commend me to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Zwingli, Lavater, and others. T체bingen, April 20, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Charles du Moulin, more uncertain of residence than before. To the most illustrious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the church of Z체rich.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
