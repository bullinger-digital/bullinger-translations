    <p xml:id="regest1">Values their letter [No. 1488], which his assembled colleagues had already read before him, all the more because they wrote it together. Hopes for their continued support, especially for the church in Geneva. After being relieved from his burdensome task [in Geneva], he was persuaded by their urging to take on the unbearable burden of the pastoral office once again; he takes their warning against the introduction of bad practices very seriously. Due to the persecutions [in France], he traveled [to the religious discussion] in Worms, where Philipp [Melanchthon] gave him a letter to the pastors [in Neuenburg] [MBW 2599]; what is stated therein about admission to the Lord's Supper seems neither offensive to him nor to his fellow ministers, for just as prior questioning is necessary for baptism if the sacrament is not to be profaned, so even more so for the Lord's Supper. Its proper administration is his greatest concern; some pastors handle the sacraments quite carelessly, resulting in serious harm, especially when the unworthy participants are the highest representatives of the authorities. If faith were inquired about beforehand, the Lord's Supper could bear more fruit; as this unresolved issue weighs heavily on him, he is grateful for advice. Such questioning would allow pastors to better address individuals in their pastoral office; many pastors are content to teach correctly according to the letter, but he fights for a worthy handling of the Lord's Supper. Hopes for understanding and good advice in his distress. May Christ grant peace and unity!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. When I returned from the field, your letters were delivered to me, which I received with great joy of heart, and I congratulated the brothers that they had read them together when they first gathered. Indeed, most esteemed brothers, whose piety and doctrine no pious person does not admire, and even enemies are forced to acknowledge and confess, if even one of you writes to me, I am greatly moved, just as I was ignited by your collective letters, as a strong fire is easily increased by adding more burning logs. You ask me to respond to your holy goodwill towards me, and to love you whom I honor with all my heart in the Lord; and I earnestly strive with much entreaty that you may be persuaded of me in this way, that nothing is dearer to me in Christ than a holy union with the pious, peace and concord, and the most ardent love entrusted, which I always wish to remain incorrupt with you: nor do I doubt that it will be so through Christ, by whose grace I am grateful to you, that you will take account of the church of Geneva along with other churches, so that all may be provided for. May Christ grant that those who wish to follow the pure gospel may not lack those who bring help, with all past things forgotten, and not according to the dignity of those who have sinned, but as Christ is worthy and as the edification of all demands, they may strive to assist. If I did not have the clearest understanding that you are striving with all your might to ensure the well-being of all churches, as far as you understand you can do anything, I would again and again commend that church to you. You continue, O truly Christian hearts, to exhort us to always act rightly, piously, and sincerely in all things, rejecting all inventions. When the Lord had freed us from such an honorable burden of the most sacred ministry, in which we have always been engaged with great fear, which requires greater strength than human, indeed angelic, as we considered it a crime to abandon what we had once undertaken, so having been relieved, we had decided not to undertake such a ministry any longer, conscious of our own weakness, and perceiving what Satan was stirring up at home: here you all made us take up again a task graver than death itself, submitting our shoulders again to an unbearable yoke, to which you so dutifully urged us. Now, after being compelled by Christ, who accomplished that we should minister here (although we were very reluctant), you strive with the greatest zeal that we may persevere purely, lest we substitute evil for good. Who, unless devoid of Christ, would not accept such a holy admonition from such great servants of Christ? May that heavenly Father grant that I may complete the course of the word as purely, and with me all, as you desire. Oh, if these most holy exhortations were frequent among all who are considered to be of Christ, especially those who minister in the word, and if all would strive to help the brothers, not hinder them, dealing with them openly to invite them to better things, and not attacking them hostilely in secret to utterly destroy them, with no regard for Christ or the church, how much better the churches would fare! And I ask you for Christ's sake, dearest and most esteemed brothers, to continue to act with all, as you have already begun with me: nor will you regret your effort. For no one ever does in vain what Christ has commanded. The fruit always follows in its own time. You have heard how cruelly the pious are treated: this is still happening today.</p>
      <p>For tyrants take many from life with iron and flames.</p>
      <p>The brothers, moved, ordered me to go to Worms, to ask the pious who were gathered there to see if they could, through the Lord, mitigate such rage.</p>
      <p>And willingly I could not express what I found in that assembly. For even the enemies were compelled to admire the piety, learning, kindness, and affability. I truly praised the Lord that such lights were given to the world for the restoration of the churches. It seemed good to them to greet the brothers with letters. That Philip took on the task and wrote in the name of all. I gave it to the brothers. And although I read after others, yet they seemed to me only pious and worthy to be heard by the pious. The same touches on other matters concerning that institution before the supper, especially regarding faith, which does not seem absurd to the brothers, not that they wish to recall anything papal, since they shudder even at the mere name of the pope as antichrist, preferring to admit anything rather than such an enemy of piety or anything derived from him. But since we all experience that the most holy supper and the communion of the church, which should not be profaned in any way, is offered to the most profane and utterly impious people, who hold or know nothing of Christ, whom if they had not been previously dipped, no one would admit unless questioned about faith, to the sacred washing: otherwise, it would rightly be said to profane the most sacred institution of Christ, who would care for such to be dipped without any examination, not with less, not to say greater, religion, the most holy supper should be given, from which we rightly exclude those whom we do not keep from dipping. And, to confess frankly, nothing more distresses my mind, nor do I do anything in the church that so burns me, as the administration of the supper. Those who seem to be something to many, but to themselves very great, whom I was striving to elevate to serve Christ, have almost destroyed me.</p>
      <p>But for them, there is no other Christ than gain, glory with leisure full of pleasure. They perform everything as perfunctorily as those who once murmured their prayers: thus they expedite the supper and dipping, scarcely denying them to dogs, provided it pleases the people what play they perform: I do not think they believe anything of the sort. I attribute this confusion of the church and the dissipation of all and the chain of evils, as new ones emerge daily with the previous ones increased, to the profanation of the mysteries of God, while everything is thrust upon swine and dogs without selection.</p>
      <p>How the magistrate conducts himself everywhere, others see: here what we desire is taught by constant complaints.</p>
      <p>He who holds the first place, first and foremost offends the church through his family, nor do I doubt there are those who take away only the bread from the supper, neither follow nor hear the word. These blemishes of the church, not to say plagues, if it were permitted to inquire about faith first, we would have a more composed supper and more fruit from it: and the more frequent it was, and the greater account was taken of the bread of the Lord by the participants, the more we would experience the Lord effective, through his spirit, in his most holy mysteries. Now, when called here, I found everything so disordered, and I complain to the Lord and the pious, I sincerely desire a solution, or to be completely hidden free from such a burden, which I do not dare to lay down since it was imposed by the Lord, nor can I bear: I welcome pious exhorters in the Lord and am grateful to those striving to invite me to better things to which I aspire. For the mind does not rest in such disordered matters. Therefore, I think this is the way, since I see no other, that those whom we do not know beforehand, and about whose faith we rightly doubt, we should ask what they believe and think about those things on which the hinge of our salvation turns, and thus more diligently learn what is expedient for such and take care of it. For if anyone breaks himself by preaching and does not meet and hear these, he will accomplish nothing. Paul not only taught all together, but also from house to house. I think it is the pastor's duty to have a more exact care of the flock, so that he may contemplate each sheep as much as possible, and rightly provide for each one, in a just and orderly manner, so that he may recall the erring, gather the scattered, and thus act that the sheep may be well and healthy: which I see neglected more carelessly.</p>
      <p>Not a few think they have done more than enough if they have only coldly explained the letter to the Jews: they do not care what the people do, how they live, what fruit they reap from what they hear. Of the sick, the poor, the ignorant, the youth, not to mention all, they take no account: I am ashamed to approach such, and I am burned that I cannot provide. For those who have heard these in name only as pastors, attribute more to them than to all the scriptures. How troublesome it is for me to contend with these? But Christ, who was with me against the papists, will not fail me as I strive that in the church such holy things may be received and distributed more purely and diligently. For I shudder to see such pastors appointed today, through whom everything is profaned. I am silent about the people everywhere, since in the pastors, however, with the brothers here, it has been provided for.</p>
      <p>The people do not seem to be neglected, but rather should be better formed and more holily convene and use such holy mysteries. Here I willingly open my heart to you.</p>
      <p>I wish that more, if the Lord would grant, we might discuss these things together, invoking the Lord. Meanwhile, you will consider everything well, weighing the matter itself and the affection more than what escapes me in these anxieties. For I am burdened beyond measure, and the less I can, the more I am overwhelmed, so that I scarcely think there lives today a man whose lot is more calamitous. So it has seemed to the Lord, whose name be blessed. All of us who teach here beseech you to deign to admonish us of those things you wish us to follow in the Lord. You will surely understand how grateful we strive to obey such lights of the church to be observed by us in Christ.</p>
      <p>We wish those variously afflicted for the gospel to be commended to you, that you may help them as much as you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell, remembering us in your prayers. May the Lord Jesus make all things prosperous for you, and for his church to which you have been called by him, and with you all, both pastors and the church, whose peace and holy concord in the Lord Christ himself may grant, that all may most eagerly procure and most holily preserve. Neuchâtel, the last of April 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely in the Lord, Farellus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious ministers of Christ, pastors, doctors, and ministers of the distinguished church of Zurich, to be most highly esteemed in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
