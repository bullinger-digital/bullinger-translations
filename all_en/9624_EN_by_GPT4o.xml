      <p>Greetings. I would have gladly written to you long ago and responded to your letters, honorable lord and compater; but I could not, both because no messengers have come to me for many days, and because due to the swelling of my right hand, I have scarcely and with difficulty been able to form letters for some time now. Hence it has also happened that these letters of our Steiger have reached you later; I have, however, excused myself to him as well, for not being able to send them sooner, which he easily accepted and said it did not matter; for he writes nothing except to excuse himself to you for not sending wine this year. Meanwhile, I received your booklets and offered them to him and to Lord Diesbach, who accepted them gladly and admire your perpetual and tireless labor in writing, and they give you the greatest thanks. Meanwhile, they wish that the odious altercation would come to an end and cannot wonder that in such light of this matter, there are still those who seek darkness; many others feel the same way. I also give you the greatest thanks for my copies. I would have written more gladly to you about the restoration of our Aretio, as you requested, if it had seemed so to the Lord, than now I am compelled to write to you about his death, which I suppose you have meanwhile learned from others. He began to suffer along with his wife around the beginning... in... or around the past equinox; they both lay down under the doubtful hope of life until the twentieth of the past month, when she began to weaken so much that she expired within a few hours. He, lying in a separate place, did not feel or know of his wife's death, but restless otherwise due to the force of the disease, he also finally passed away on the twenty-second day of that month between eight and nine in the evening. Meanwhile, several of his children also fell ill, of whom he left five; but they recovered; only he and his wife did the Lord wish to call away.</p>
      <p>The loss and wound that our school and church have received from this cannot be expressed; for we will no longer have or do we have anyone like him to replace him, nor do we think such a one can easily be found elsewhere. For he was most skilled and solidly learned in all arts, languages, and faculties, and what adorned all these most was his brotherly love, modesty, piety, and love of peace and quiet. He received the library of Mr. Simler along with another attached booklet and his letters with difficulty; he nevertheless went through many and inscribed some things with a pen, which, however, cannot all be read, and he gave thanks to him. We are now considering how to assist our school; but no certain plan has yet been taken. Some speak of substituting my Blasius for him; but let the will of the Lord be done. Would that we could have Erastus! But his ability and fame are greater than that he could lower himself to here. I truly wish to hear some advice from you as well. I can write nothing new now that is of any importance.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell. All of ours greet you. Bern, April 2, 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my lord and compater, to be honored with the greatest reverence always.</p>
      <p>The death of Mr. Benedict Aretius of Bern, March 22, 1574.</p>
