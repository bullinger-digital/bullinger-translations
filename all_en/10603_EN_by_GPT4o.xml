    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the comforting letters; would like to come to Zurich after Easter. The Castellan of Musso [Gian Giacomo de' Medici] is staying with [Wolf Dietrich von Ems]. The city meeting in Ulm ended quickly but is to be reconvened. The [Imperial League] will meet in Lauingen. During the meeting [of the Upper Rhine and Swabian cities] in Esslingen, Duke Ulrich hosted the envoy from Constance. A letter from King [Ferdinand] to the Duke, in which he was accused of disloyalty, turned out to be a forgery. The Emperor has promised the [Protestant] cities and princes in a letter to uphold their agreements until a possible council. Nuremberg is said to have joined the [Imperial] League as the only city in Donauwörth. Vadian will convey news from Thomas [Gaßner] to Zurich. Vogt [Hässi] has forbidden the Reformed [in the Rhine Valley] from ringing the church bells. Would like Bullinger's advice and help, as he might need a business partner in Zurich. Duke Ulrich has obliged the prelates to deliver half of their income to him for two years. When the Catholics [on March 27] consecrated [the Easter fire] in a cemetery, they were insulted by a farmer from Appenzell; asks to pass on this and other news to Jakob Rordorf as well. Vadian will write to Bullinger about the troop assembly in the Adige Valley. Greetings. Hopes not to cause Bullinger too much trouble.</p>

      <p>May God's grace preserve us all. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>My especially beloved lord and brother, first I thank my God, who, God knows, has given me comfort through your many letters and efforts, as I have found, although I needed it, that I have troubled you with my misery for so long. But I know your godly spirit, which God has given you by His grace, so that you can comfort, endure, and bear with me, especially as a weak and insignificant person, and others as well. I beg you for God's sake, as I know, to forgive my anxieties and troubles, yet to keep me in your memory, considering my dear wife and children. In short, if God allows, I intend to quietly ride to you in Zurich after Easter, unless other events occur in the meantime, and to consult with you, perhaps to make a final decision in trust. May God guide me, etc.</p>
      <p>Further, you will have something from my lord mayor of Wädenswil, which is important. I will not write to you about it. But consider it well; for I believe that the Castellan of Musso is staying in vain at the office, with the son of the one from Ems, etc. Moreover, he was in Tuttlingen overnight; I do not know if the one from Hewen knew about it; now he surely knows.</p>
      <p>Also, a quick meeting took place in Ulm; it was dissolved, they say, and another is scheduled in Ulm ten days after the holy day (after Easter).</p>
      <p>Also, the nobility and others have set a meeting in the city of Lauingen, a noble city, four miles below Ulm.</p>
      <p>Also, the meeting in Esslingen has ended. The Duke of Württemberg, I hear, invited the envoy from Constance as a guest before Easter. Also, you may already know for sure that a letter was sent to Duke Ulrich, as if it had been sent by the king in the empire, in which the duke was accused of not keeping or handling, etc. In response, the duke is said to have sent an envoy to the king to answer whether he had let the letter go out. If the king knows nothing of the letter, he presents himself to him as a gracious king, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the emperor is said to have written to the cities and princes, especially, offering them as a gracious emperor, with the condition to remain by the diet, the agreement of faith, until a council is held.</p>
      <p>Also, in Donauwörth, some have made a league, in which I hear no city has joined except Nuremberg, which I hear is taken badly by others. In Esslingen, I hear, the Nurembergers also brought a decision home with them, but not everything was revealed and not shown to them as the others had intended. For I think, each otherwise has two decisions with him, Nuremberg now one.</p>
      <p>Also, from Lindau, Thomas, the faithful preacher, has sent us; now consider, Herr Doctor will also write to you about it, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the Vogt of Glarus has recently forbidden those of our faith, prohibiting them from ringing the bells for the sermon. A good woman, she and he all went to the mass table. Lucifer would run off the chains; he has escaped, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, my request, to consult with yourself for the future, when I come to you, whether you and I might think it good to take on a partner, to deal with me, whether you might think of one or two persons. For I would trade wine, grain, cloth, which I have long dealt with. Yet I would need a guarantor; thus I run for the goal, etc.</p>
      <p>I think you have heard that the Duke of Württemberg has hosted his prelates, giving them half fish, half meat, one course and the other, and said at the collation that they should take half of their income for two years, with the other to relieve the burden of the land. These two years were, etc. etc.</p>
      <p>Also, on Saturday with us, the Catholics have consecrated on the churchyard, with the paddle holy water sprinkled into the fire. Thus an Appenzeller farmer went there. When he saw it sprinkled into the fire, the farmer said: "Hey, hey, it is right that you are rid of this shame with the magic and heretic work." Then Peter Weber, who heard this, said to the farmer: "Is it not right?" The farmer replied: "No, why do they do it, then, because they deceive people and fill the book," etc. If you think it good, I ask you to also tell my faithful Jakob Rordorfer some news from the farmer or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Also, about the troops in the Adige Valley, my lord doctor will write to you; for our citizen has come from Bolzano, etc.</p>
      <p>My wife thanks you very much, also asks, as do I, to greet yours, also the mother.</p>
      <p>If there is anything too much for you on my behalf, which would be necessary, if I ever came, I ask you to work with me and let me know. But I think it is not necessary, etc.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Tuesday after Easter day in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your poor, willing Hans Vogler, now in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his own hands.</p>
