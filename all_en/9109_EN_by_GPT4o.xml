      <p> S. What my colleague has sufficiently and more than sufficiently described to your eminence, most reverend lord, is the great audacity with which our heretics, under the guise of sheep's clothing, are becoming more daring by the day, especially through the work of those who claim or seem to possess some knowledge. It is not for me, entangled in a hundred other cares, to trouble you with verbose details. We do not criticize that Gantner seems to embrace the Zurich confession, against which he wanted to be considered as having committed nothing before the disputing synod. However, we are deeply troubled that, contrary to the opinion, letters, seals, and agreements, he is absolved by our senate, which has created fewer watchmen for the senate than for the synod, disregarding the scandal he has introduced, which, like a deadly dart, still clings to the minds of persuaded men and is not washed away by visible repentance and reconciliation. This most arrogant man has persuaded almost everyone that he was recently in Zurich, where, having implored your advice, he received the answer that it is enough if he subscribes to the Zurich confession. Hence, what I have long suspected follows: we are hated and grumbled at, and it is not desired to satisfy us, and you are all more bitter, etc. If, therefore, this is enough and it is to be considered trivial what has preceded, and it is not to be acted upon in such a way that, to remove scandals and dispel suspicions cast upon the innocent, a clear retraction and repentance should establish the distinction between truth and falsehood, I do not see, I say, I do not see, how I can be useful in these parts; I would rather hide ingloriously in some corner, etc. We ask your eminence to inform us as soon as possible what you have done with the insane Gantner. You have already explained this to me sufficiently; meanwhile, as he most disgracefully abuses your patronage, we wish to be more clearly informed about this matter. For either this impious decree of the senate will be nullified, or we will be forbidden from the office of preaching. </p>
      <p> However, I think that God is so directing these things that certain hidden supporters of the heretics are being revealed, whose efforts we previously thought were beneficial to us; among these, I not unjustly count P[ontisella], who values the unique Gantner more than all the other brothers, none of whom fails to surpass or equal Gantner in learning. But what urges or moves P[ontisella], who should have been a school for the more stupid ones, is not difficult to divine. But it is certain, as the proverb says: with the lame, you will learn to limp. If MÃ¼ller has narrated something about Gantner's business based on the judgment and report of P[ontisella], he certainly did so imprudently, since he plainly ignores how the whole matter stands. Now I refrain from writing more about this matter, intending to compensate for this brevity with more verbosity later. A certain betrayal of the Rh[etians] is being uncovered, about which more another time. Now I cease to trouble you. </p>
      <p> Consul Willius and Ambrosius greet you, who are pained by the audacity of certain obscurantists, etc. </p>
      <p> Most swiftly under the waves of business, 24th November 1572, Chur. Your eminence's most devoted Th[obias] Ic[onius]. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, adorned with learning, virtue, piety, and dignity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
