      <p>Grace and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the offering of our friendly greetings and willing services, prepared beforehand. Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, especially gracious, dear lords, your wisdom's letter, concerning the death of our beloved brother Rhellicanus and the request for another capable and faithful preacher, we have received and read with great sorrow. We would have gladly sent you a definitive answer promptly with this messenger, and have also been together and deliberated. However, since the matter is difficult for us, and we cannot carry it out alone without the counsel and help of our lords, and therefore will further consult with them, we have dispatched your messenger this time with the present writing, etc., hereby announcing that we will exercise all our possible and faithful service and diligence in this matter and will let you know an answer shortly. For if we could serve you faithfully, we would be very willing and inclined. May God Almighty faithfully keep you in His grace.</p>
