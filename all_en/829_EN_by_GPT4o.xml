      <p>Greetings. In recent days, a meeting was held by the brothers of our college, in which I proposed my advice in writing to amend the inconvenience that I feel is burdening our churches too much. For our young men are often ordained as ministers of the church when they scarcely know what the Gospel is, which you are not unaware of how dangerous it is or what evils it will eventually bring with it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would wish that young men be sent to other regions, and to initiate this matter, I suggested that Blatner, whom I understood also desires this, should be sent somewhere before he is appointed to any church.</p>
      <p>To my written proposal, which I composed hastily due to the lack of time, others also added their arguments. Finally, it was concluded that two of us should present this matter to our senate. The dean and I went and reported the same matter in the senate. The senate not only approved but also deemed it necessary that what we requested should be done, and having deliberated, they ordered that I should disclose the whole matter to you and ask you, since they have good hope regarding the young man's talent, studies, life, and morals, to write to the school authorities and preachers in Bern and advise them of the same and also show that Blatner is worthy. For no one can give better testimony to them than you, because he has listened to you for a long time, and even if you did not know his studies and life, you could learn from others. Since, as I learned from his father, he is coming to us during these holidays, I, on behalf of my college and senate, whom you love, and also ordered, beg and beseech you, my dear Bullinger, to write to the brothers in Bern and diligently recommend Blatner to them and advise that he be sent elsewhere. And to make you understand that our senate is seriously pursuing this, you should know that they have promised and are willing to provide money to the young man if the Bernese complain about expenses.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you, Bullinger, to assist us in this matter and give a letter to Blatner himself, which he will bring here and deliver to the magistrate, who will add his own and send it to Bern. And if you also write a few words to our prefect about Blatner's life and morals, you will gain great goodwill for him in the entire senate; you will certainly bind me to you with a great favor. We truly leave it to your prudence to suggest to which place he should be sent. England has the most learned men, among whom are Peter Martyr and Dr. Bernhardinus, who share our views. Even if they fear Bucer because of that odious dissension about the sacrament, I do not believe that Martyr and Bernhardinus are in the same place where Bucer is. Even if they are, they can be seriously instructed not to allow anyone to teach differently about this sacrament than you have taught. The young man will also not unwillingly promise this, and as I have understood his integrity so far, he will fulfill the promise. But I leave everything to you, as I wrote before. You will give these letters to Blatner to read, so he knows the matter; for I could not write to him at length about this, since our Schertel is present. Farewell in Christ with yours, and expect something from me soon, from which you will understand me as a Christian poet. On the first of February 1550. Greet the family and friends. Brugg, hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Toxites, poet laureate.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and most humane man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and friend.</p>
      <p>"Michael Toxites, poet."</p>
