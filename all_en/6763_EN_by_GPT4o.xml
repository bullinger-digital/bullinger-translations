      <p>Greetings. Honorable lord and father, I cannot write to you how our affairs stand so poorly and confused, as they truly are. It is no wonder; others, who are much wiser than I, can achieve just as little from it. However, this is the summary: the envoys of the seven cantons have been here again, and have pursued the matter with the two alliances quite vigorously; in contrast, our side has pleaded and urged the two alliances to remain with their long-established freedoms. And since their pleas have achieved nothing, they have proposed to the two alliances the divine and fair law, according to the sworn alliances. Despite all this, disregarding this legal proposal, the two alliances have proceeded, recognizing the gentlemen of the Abbey in possession, etc. Now, our side has not proposed the law to the others because they wanted to prevent any action, but solely to reach better means. However, the two alliances (that is, a few more powerful conspirators) have outright rejected all law from our side. So now you hear how far the matter has progressed. This all comes from the fact that those in the God's House in several communities, especially here in Chur, are not loyal to each other. Nevertheless, the city has made an addition to the castle; note well, the remaining God's House people will also send their own. When everything is consumed, as there is nothing more there, it is then as it was now; for they do not take the right path. If then the lord of the Abbey comes, with or without force, this city pleases me so much that for some, the mass and the priests are so dear, it would be a simple matter of religion. And although I now recognize my ineptitude well and can do less and less, yet according to the grace that God has granted me, I have faithfully done my best in every way; but in such great license, corruption, and treachery, add immense greed, it cannot succeed. Where the priests have so many benefices and enjoy them so well, all effort is in vain and lost, moreover, a good man in some places loses his property and ultimately, for the sake of some companions, also his honor. For the old lord Commander said shortly before his death: in the alliances, no preacher retains either property or honor or thanks. I have experienced this abundantly. I have warned so faithfully that, if an uprising occurs, I am the first who must suffer, whose possessions and little wealth are taken. In all this, I rely on God and no man; for men have now deceived me too much. However it may go, God is my witness, and I will die on this, that I could not have spoken otherwise and less according to the situation and form of all things. Now, since all is lost, I remain silent and thus wait for what God will do with us; I pray to Him very faithfully that He will not repay us according to our deserts, but will have mercy on His church. For there are many honest people in this city and the three alliances, to whom this ruined, miserable state is a heartfelt sorrow. I write this to you as my trusted lord and father in great haste with a very troubled, concerned heart; I do not know how long I will write to you more. For if this game begins, I am the first; but it will not remain with that, where you should pray to God faithfully for us. Regarding all this, I write nothing to my father-in-law, because he has not learned to bear these things. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
