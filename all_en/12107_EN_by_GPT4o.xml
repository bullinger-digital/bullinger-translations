    <p xml:id="regest1">Konstanz received a letter from Ulm, in which the relocation of the city assembly from Ulm to Worms is communicated and the prompt arrival of the envoys is requested. If [ZÃ¼rich] wants to address the cities, it must now write to Worms, although the people of Ulm would certainly forward such a letter.</p>

      <p>Friendly, truly dear lord and brother, know that yesterday a letter arrived for my lords from those in Ulm, in which they reschedule the previously announced city assembly from Ulm to Worms on the day of the Three Kings, with the addition that they now wish to hold the meeting together in Worms, with a request to my lords to promptly send their envoys, who are appointed for the Reichstag, to Worms to help carry out the mentioned day concerning the Reichstag. I wanted to faithfully inform you of this good intention in my next letter, so that further arrangements can be made, in case the honorable cities might have wanted to write to the city assembly in Ulm, to change the location, although, if the letter had come to Ulm, those from Ulm would have taken it with them to Worms to answer the cities.</p>
      <p>Given in Yl, on the 1st day of January in the year 1545. To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
