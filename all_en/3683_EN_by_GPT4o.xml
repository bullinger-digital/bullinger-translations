      <p>Greetings. Many letters have to be written to Frankfurt these days, dearest brother. Therefore, I ask you to be content with these brief ones.</p>
      <p>I have received yours and I judge you to act wisely, who do not make yourself too familiar with the royal envoy; yet, because he is a humane and learned man, he does not seem to be entirely contemptible. Meanwhile, the church and the safety of the church must be preferred above all things.</p>
      <p>I grieve for the situation of Ambrosius (Martini?); but because he is such, it is beneficial that the ulcer has burst.</p>
      <p>A similar thing happened to us in Zürich, as you know, when Fuliginosi's daughter married Frölich, the captain of the soldiers; you know how severe enmities they exercised against us because we condemned the actions of the parent for the sacred sermons and encouraged that no one should be offended by it. However, we acted prudently and moderately, as much as possible, so that we might not wish to heal and give more harm to the church. You too will consider the reason of the church and edification and will act for its benefit opportunely and inopportunely. The Lord must be prayed to above all, that He may be in our mouth and direct our words to the glory of His name and the safety of souls. I wish the Turkish fleet had departed; if you have anything more certain about it, you will share it. For those things you have given, I give the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>You will also greet the most honorable Mr. von Cambray and commend me to him.</p>
      <p>We hear here also that both armies have settled in the vicinity and that Philipp is struggling with a lack of supplies and therefore is more fervently seeking an opportunity to fight. It is rumored, I do not report it as certain, that twelve French cargo ships wanted to bring provisions and gunpowder into Calais; of these, two were sunk by the English fleet, 10 captured. In Bern, in recent days, there was a great dispute because the ministers of Lausanne wanted to be given excommunication and many things of this kind. The Senate resisted them; finally, the Bernese ministers intervened as mediators, so that the Lausanne ministers returned home with good grace. There is always some disturbance, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, August 26, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have not re-read.</p>
      <p>In 8 days, that is, next Friday, if you can, order someone from your merchants to come to me. I will give him two books, one for you, the other for Philipp.</p>
      <p>It is now published; however, I do not yet have copies; otherwise, I would send them now. To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, his lord and brother and most beloved compatriot. Chur.</p>
