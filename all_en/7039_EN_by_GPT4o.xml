      <p>Worthy, highly learned, especially beloved and trusted friend, I send you my most willing greetings and service beforehand. And hereby inform you that Hans Liner from St. Gallen wrote to me the other day, saying that if I want to write to my son in Geneva, I should send it to you or to Mr. Walther; for he intends to be in Zurich on the 2nd day of April and wants to take the letters there. Therefore, I am sending the enclosed letter with this messenger, and I ask you to kindly pass it on to him. I also ask you to write to my son in a fatherly manner. Furthermore, my son Hans Christoph von Vorsteg wrote to me that Mr. Hans Huser has moved to Sax and he cannot hear otherwise than that the peasants are quite satisfied. I intend to stay here for another day or eight. Whatever comes to me further, I will let you know as well.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new, for Mr. Liner from St. Gallen writes to me, as you have been well informed before or will be well informed by him now. May the Lord God protect you from all things everywhere. Amen.</p>
      <p>In haste from Uster on Easter Monday, etc. Your faithful friend Philipp von Sax, Freiherr, 1567 Sax.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich, my dear lord and trusted friend, to be delivered.</p>
