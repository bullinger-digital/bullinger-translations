      <p>To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, head of the church of Basel, a revered and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your brothers, dearest Myconius, are not very well. Leo [Jud] is almost at death's door. It is uncertain whether Bibliander, an incomparable man, suffers from joint disease or gout; he is certainly gravely ill, yet he walks around sick and lectures as usual. If only he would abstain entirely from all lectures, which he refuses as steadfastly as we insist. Megander is also ill, yet he continues to preach. As for me, a most severe fever has troubled me for several days. Today marks the 14th day since I last left the house. I am hiding at home and struggling with tertian fever. However, I feel the strength of the disease is somewhat diminishing. May the Lord be with us and restore us, if we are pleasing to Him.</p>
      <p>Please ensure this cheese is delivered with utmost faithfulness to Richard Hilles in Strasbourg. You will have done a most welcome service. I will pay the price myself, once you inform me.</p>
      <p>Take this in good spirit; for I could not write more. Farewell with all your family. All the brothers greet you. April 19, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
