      <p>S. D. On August 7, I began to fall ill and have been bedridden since, occasionally walking around as I can. I endure great pain on my right side, especially in the area where I am girded.</p>
      <p>The doctors think it is a stone; but what they apply does not help. It is almost a year since I was laid low by the same illness, at the time when the plague seized me; then too they applied various medicines, but all in vain.</p>
      <p>The pain then subsided on its own, indeed by the grace of God; to Him I now also commend myself. You will pray for me.</p>
      <p>I have no rest, nor any less diversion than etc.</p>
      <p>All your letters, each one, have been delivered to me, the earlier ones by Walder the courier, the later ones today. The episcopal matter also greatly troubles me.</p>
      <p>The canons in their lengthy letters have reverted to the old ways; I rejoice that the House of God has brought them to recant. What is written about the Turks being defeated, I think is fabricated; for since the Turks are besieging the fortress of St. Michael, they control all the sea, so that no one can come to or from the city of Malta to report this. I suspect everything is captured and these stories are invented to lessen the terror in Italy. On September 3, a meeting is scheduled in Lucerne with the 7 Catholic Cantons and the Pope; God knows what will happen. There is a mint day here; I do not know what has been done, for I have my pain to resolve.</p>
      <p>For your abundant and diligent writing, I thank you; when I have recovered, I will press your matter, about which I have good hope; I have forbidden [by name] everyone from writing anything to your people.</p>
      <p>While I am about to seal this, letters are brought from Geneva by Mr. Roset, the syndic.</p>
      <p>Cardinal of Lorraine is accused before the king, who is gravely displeased with him; the friends of Lorraine have become enemies; it is said he has insinuated himself into the guardianship of another prince. The Spanish envoys in Bayonne have demanded from King Francis, 1. to renounce the Turkish alliance, 2. to abolish the edict on religious peace, 3. to accept the Council of Trent and subscribe to it, 4. to claim no rights in Florida, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I can no longer. August 17.</p>
      <p>May the envoy be safe, may the consuls and our friends be safe. 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
