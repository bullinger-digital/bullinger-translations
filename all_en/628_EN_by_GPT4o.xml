      <p>Immanuel. Dearly beloved lord and brother, I have received your two letters, one dated July 31 and the other August 5, from Stein and also Winterthur, along with the third, dated August 7, with this enclosed letter from your cousin Conrad Zwick, which I am sending back to you; thank you for the news. It seems to me that something unexpected is about to arise; may God protect His own. What if the emperor also has something to deal with? But may God also grant that we do not have to say, because of sins, that the cunning fox carries the skin here. We will look to God.</p>
      <p>Regarding the reconciliation, I wish that your people would be free from the burdens of the people; it would happen along with their mischief. May God grant them grace and understanding!</p>
      <p>Uri has also signed the French alliance, as have the Three Leagues, and when a mayor rode on the matter, he fell off a horse; the land judge, who was in Solothurn, along with other messengers from the Leagues, drowned on Tuesday night by Rapperswil in the lake on the way home; the matter seems so fortunate.</p>
      <p>My lords have bought WÃ¤denswil and Richterswil from the Knights of St. John, along with the castle and all its belongings, income, etc., for 24,588 guilders; it lies on the border against Schwyz on the lake, and has always caused us much disorder. The people of Schwyz have indeed some objection; but the matter will be advised.</p>
      <p>As for Thurgau, it is such that certainly all 10, even 13 places are of the mind to save it with loyalty, as Eggli knows; if he knows the reason, he knows that it does not please him. The governor wrote a serious letter last Sunday here and to Lucerne, partly about Liers, also as a matter of addition, and that the bishop should intend to keep the Ow with the people of God in Thurgau; for the king is understood to take them in; whether he should make an addition to the lake, etc. He should not let the Thurgauers cross the lake. It is beautiful if the bishop tries to obtain his unjust rights through our people; nothing will come of it. So he should not make any addition at this time, etc., but be careful; this is also done in other ways with knowledge, etc. If God is with us, we consider the matter to be thus directed; if they come, they shall enjoy little of their wickedness. One wants to maintain peace and justice; if it can be, well; if not, then may God rule.</p>
      <p>If they act, as your writing or your cousin Conrad Zwick's letter suggests, then they are murderers, and our cause will be all the better. Praying to God for us at all times.</p>
      <p>Bucer is in England and clearly retains the old ways; what Germany received from him, England will also receive. But may the Lord protect this from evil and give it a better mind or a better goal! But there must be instruments of wrath and corruption in such an ungrateful and unjust age. May the Lord Jesus have mercy on His own! This to you. I cannot say more now. Considering much, it will not be long; a fresh move will happen.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, August 11, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet your family and the entire household of your sister and brother, to whom this poem belongs.</p>
