      <p>S. P. How pleasing to me were your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, a most certain token of your great love towards us, cannot be expressed: I earnestly pray that you continue to do the same; nothing could happen to us more joyful than to hear frequently about your well-being and the safety of your church and republic: you, in turn, will always be informed by me about our state and that of our church. The harvest is great, very great, I say, dearest lord and godfather, but the laborers are few: may the most indulgent Father send laborers into the harvest. Such is the malice and impiety of the bishops, that pious and learned men, who would willingly devote their efforts to the Lord's harvest, are hindered by them; neither do they preach themselves, nor do they allow others the duty of preaching: for this reason, there are some here who read and profess the sacred scriptures for public reading; two in the temple of St. Paul, who read four times a week. I also, in my weakness, moved by the ignorance of my brothers, read publicly twice a day to such a large audience that the temple cannot contain the listeners.</p>
      <p>Anabaptists flock there, who cause me much trouble concerning the incarnation of the Lord; they utterly deny that Christ according to the flesh derived origin from the Virgin Mary. They want man to be reconciled to God without sin, and free from every stain of concupiscence, and that nothing adheres in nature that is of the old Adam; and they say such a regenerated man cannot sin. They add that those who sin after receiving the Holy Spirit have all hope of forgiveness taken away. They insist on fatal necessity, and want God to have another will besides and beyond the one He has revealed to us in the scriptures, by which He acts with a certain necessity. Although I cannot satisfy their obstinacy, the Lord nevertheless shuts their mouths through His word; and the people more and more detest their heresies. How dangerously our England is afflicted by such heresies, God alone knows; I truly cannot express to your piety because of the sadness of my heart: there are those who deny that man is endowed with any soul other than a bovine and mortal one. Alas! not only do old and buried heresies revive among us, but new ones are born daily: there are such libertines and scoundrels, who in their conventicles dare not only to deny that Christ is the Messiah and Savior of the world, but also call that blessed Seed a scoundrel and deceiver of the world. On the other hand, a great part of the kingdom clings so to the papist faction, that they utterly despise God and the legitimate magistrate; so that we have much to fear from sedition and internal commotion. May the Lord restrain restless hearts and destroy the counsels of Ahithophel: you, my venerable father, ensure that you commend our kingdom and the counselors of the kingdom together with our church to God in your prayers.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen my parents; I am about to see them shortly, if the Lord wills: until now it was not allowed because I am expecting my goods with books and other necessities, which are stuck in Antwerp due to unfavorable winds; and because recently in my country there arose, by the instigation of the devil and the malice of men, a rather dangerous commotion of the people against the magistrate, not yet entirely settled. Such tumults occur not only in my country but almost throughout the kingdom; the people lie oppressed by the nobles with astonishing tyranny: let us all pray that the occasions of tumult may be piously removed, and the people restrained to the glory of God's name. The condition of our republic is more than miserable; yet we expect a second outcome, so that it will someday be pleasant to remember these things. When I come to my own, I will buy for you and the lord consul another cloth which I promised, I could not buy it here at your price; moreover, another for Mr. John Butler.</p>
      <p>Bucer is with the Archbishop of Canterbury like another Scipio and inseparable companion; also Paul Fagius, and Peter Alexander, formerly preacher to Queen Mary, sister of the Emperor: within 14 days you will know more, God willing. In the name of us all, you will greet Mr. your wife with your whole family, Mr. Gualter with his, Mr. Pellican with his, and all others of your church very much. If only you had our language, even Mr. Gualter had it for six months! I would not doubt that God would convert many hearts to the knowledge of Himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>London, June 25.</p>
      <p>I send here a sample of cloth which is made near you or in Swabia: you will know this through the wife of Mr. Musculus. You will ask Mr. Butler to send to me for 4 or 5 florins, and how much an ell is sold for. I have often regretted my departure from you; for the Lord has opened my eyes, to see how grave and dangerous the condition of the church is: yet I will patiently bear it, God willing, as long as it is allowed with a pious conscience.</p>
      <p>Yours forever most devoted, John Hooper. Our excellent young Martin sends many greetings to your excellence. You will not disdain to greet in our name the most prudent consul, our lord most esteemed in every way. I hope you have received one piece of cloth; you will also receive the second shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord always most esteemed. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
