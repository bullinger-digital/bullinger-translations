    <p xml:id="regest1">More will soon be known about the day in Schmalkalden after the return of the Strasbourg envoys; it is said that Emperor [Charles V] is trying to stall [the Protestants], has concluded a truce with Denmark, and may also come to terms with the Netherlands, but France has turned away from him. The Emperor particularly accuses the Protestants of appropriating church property and allying with his enemies; the latter he has brought upon himself. Strasbourg has mostly expelled the [Anabaptists arrested at Illkirch]; discussions held with them were unsuccessful. What [a traveler] reported from Italy is alarming; it is strange that the famine primarily affects [Catholic] regions. Meanwhile, [in Basel] there are ongoing disputes over academic titles and church discipline, and [Karlstadt] lives shamelessly in abundance.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not cease to write as long as and whenever there is a subject. The Schmalkalden assembly has ended. We await what has been done. I believe the Strasbourg delegation is already home. Meanwhile, we have learned this: the Emperor neither grants a certain peace nor seems to be about to wage war. He delays everything by negotiating.</p>
      <p>The good people fear that he will make the church worse. He has made a truce with the Danes; how long it is, I do not know. What he will do about the Netherlands is uncertain. They think there will be peace with them and some sort of marriage alliance. The French have become estranged from the Emperor because of the refusal of Milan. The Spaniards prevented it from being given.</p>
      <p>The Emperor mainly complains about the Protestants for two reasons: that they claim church property for themselves and that they have allied with his enemies. It seems to me very foolish of the Emperor, especially to object to the latter, after he has shown himself so hostile until now. The orders should not have consulted for themselves because of that Emperor. However, I think he calls the English, the Danes, and the WÃ¼rttembergers his enemies. This about the Emperor.</p>
      <p>The Strasbourg people dealt with the Anabaptists as follows: They outlawed all except about ten, who are either leaders or were previously outlawed. There was a two-day debate with them, but in vain.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what horrendous things, good God, does he report from Italy! If they are true, who will bear it? It is indeed strange that famine rages especially where the heads of religion rule, namely in Italy and Spain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while evils surround us, we quarrel about doctrines, and here we inquire whether the title of Doctor of Theology is pious or not and whether the university's scandals should be rebuked from the pulpit. And while these things are being discussed, our Arcesilas bought two vineyards, from which he harvested (for he bought the vineyards along with the grapes) more than I will gather from my benefice in three years.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a month ago he bought a meadow for the price the seller estimated, not even deducting a penny. It pains the peasant more than anything that he did not indicate a higher price. What God will say or do about these crimes, we will feel someday.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, April 29, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
