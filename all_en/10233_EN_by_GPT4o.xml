      <p>My willing service beforehand, friendly, dear sir.</p>
      <p>We know how things stood with you and the opposition 14 days ago, whatever the concern may be, what help and hope there is with the opposition, all of which should not be underestimated. Therefore, our request is that you remain vigilant and take the advice previously written about in a timely manner: Assistance on horseback and on foot should come as promptly and bravely as possible, so that, God willing, there will be no need, indeed the number and bravery (courage) will surpass that of the others. However, this is not to be assumed, unless one wants to show bravery and make a stand (truce) or carry out a settlement. You will not be abandoned. Have no doubt about that, just seek it in a timely manner. The Landgrave has also been warned by our lords, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours whom you know.</p>
      <p>Through trusted secret oral messages, which do not have the name as if they were messages, it is to be handled quietly. Do not let yourselves be moved by the fact that the five places show themselves somewhat frightened. They handle everything with advantage. As your mind stands, you are informed, unfortunately only too much. Otherwise, it is to be feared that the accepted peace will bring ruinous damage. I dare not write what troubles me now; but the sum is that I fear your leaders will be too soft and take heart (hardness), where it would be necessary to give. May the Almighty be gracious to us and preserve His kingdom with us. Amen. 26th day of March.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
