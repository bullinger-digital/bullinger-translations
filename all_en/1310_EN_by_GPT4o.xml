      <p>Greetings. For those prayers of yours, which you make to our most blessed physician Christ for my stronger health, I owe you great thanks, my dearest and best Bullinger, especially since I understand that they are by no means in vain, as I have already begun to feel somewhat better. This tertian fever has treated me very harshly, yet I am grateful to it for this reason: the more violently it attacked, the more briefly it tormented me; for the fifth was also the last conflict I had with it, or, as doctors say, the paroxysm, although I am still so weak that I can hardly stand without support.</p>
      <p>However, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ, who has chastised me but not delivered me to death, and who has rescued me from those infernal fevers, where unquenchable fires and perpetual gnashing of teeth will eternally torment the impious, through this very son of his with such great mercy, from which indeed we can easily make some conjecture about what they will be like, from those which some of us endure here. Together with me, implore our heavenly Father with faithful prayers, that for the remainder of my life, which is indeed short and fleeting, I may live in obedience to his most holy will and at the same time happily depart from this tabernacle to the heavenly mansions.</p>
      <p>I will diligently write to our Welser about what you have entrusted. I have always considered him a God-fearing and truly pious man, although to our Leto and some others he has seemed a chameleon and quite different from what he outwardly appears to be.</p>
      <p>However, clear evidence of his sincerity has shone forth so far, that I can neither judge nor should judge him otherwise than by his fruits.</p>
      <p>For those things you sent, I give you the greatest thanks. As for what I might send in return, I have nothing at all worthy to send, until I receive something certain. Pray diligently for us with all your household and brothers, ministers in the work of the Lord, to whom convey my many greetings in our solid salvation in Christ. Farewell, my venerable Bullinger. Winterthur, 7th of June, 1551.</p>
      <p>I am returning the letter of our Haller along with that other writing. But hey, when will you return to me that opinion of mine about the other marriages of those whose wives were abducted by the Turks, which was written to you? I know this has been or is of no use to you, which is why you might more easily return it, at the same time indicating if anywhere I seem to have deviated from fairness.</p>
      <p>After you have very lovingly greeted Gwalther, our excellent friend, in my words, you will diligently remind him to send back to me my brother's Galatea.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Returned on the 16th of June.</p>
