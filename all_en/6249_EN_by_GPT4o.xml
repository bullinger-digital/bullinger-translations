      <p>Your Reverence, revered father in Christ, I have received all your good faith and I give you immense thanks. I have read and reread your opinion on the French alliance; I intend to note down certain things; if I can and have someone to whom I can certainly give it, I will immediately send it back, so that you do not make the power over it longer for me. I have often thought of noting down the main points of my sermons, which I have given on this matter in general, which are in notes, and sending them to you; but I have felt the strength of my intellect somewhat broken. For recently, after completing my response, which I give to the Spaniards, in which I perhaps hurried too much, because I had someone who would carry it to Geneva, and I hoped it could be published before the fair, I finally noticed in myself how weakened I was.</p>
      <p>Now, as often as I take the pen in hand, I almost always attempt in vain what I want. I congratulate you greatly, who at this age are sufficient for such labors; I pray to God to strengthen and fortify you in these most afflicted and troubled times of the church; for it is necessary to foresee a great storm, as many as excel even in moderate knowledge of affairs.</p>
      <p>I also begin to fear everything safe.</p>
      <p>This internal war of the church, which we wage with the Ubiquitarians, troubles me more than all other things, and the stubbornness and malice, or rather the stupidity of those men, are for me a sign that a great evil threatens Germany. But what shall we do?</p>
      <p>A good cause must not be abandoned, the outcome must be entrusted to God. I have not yet been able to read your booklet, except that I have inspected the method, and it pleases me greatly; I have also read some pages; this week, if I live, I will read everything.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza writes to me that he is preparing a response to the omnipresence and also something else, which he hopes will be published at this fair.</p>
      <p>If something like that is published and Froschauer brings it to Frankfurt, please ensure that a copy is brought to us and inscribed by the bookseller according to my arrangements. We are here in a solitude of books; I have not yet read anything of Mr. Beza and I hear he has written not a few things, nor do I doubt that they are learned. My book could not be published in Geneva at the fair; so friends write.</p>
      <p>As for the matter of the alliance, I always conclude my own with a single syllogism: that one may well counter the plagues and punishments of God, namely sin, pestilence, hunger, etc., with ordinary means, among which I also count the present along with all kinds of ammunition, artillery, and military equipment; but where one cannot have the ordinary means, a person should rather let themselves be killed a hundred times, etc. You know how broadly this major proposition extends.</p>
      <p>But whether now this military exercise, which might follow the French union, is an ordinary means, the whole question is about that, and your arguments revolve around that; for me, access to this discussion is somewhat closed.</p>
      <p>For ours want to perpetuate what they have done so far, and what you fear will happen if yours follow the military, we see this happening before our eyes: the utmost corruption of all orders.</p>
      <p>They want to follow wars; they criticize those who sit at home. This seems to them idleness and laziness, and what is surprising: those who want to appear to shudder at the sword fear the times of plague so anxiously for themselves that they tremble even at the name. This is the perverse courage of those men.</p>
      <p>Now, what is said of the dog, who once tasted intestines, can also be said of ours, who once were infected with pensions and continually crave greater ones.</p>
      <p>The Rhaetians also do not have a heller (a small coin) in the common treasury (Chur is richer in supplies and cash than the common Three Leagues), than what they have from the lords: they say openly, they cannot do without the lords.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, many private individuals are very wealthy, but most are so greedy that it is incredible to say and to believe for you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since two princes are seeking the friendship of ours, with one to be preferred over the other, it must be worked on to expel the one who is more pernicious to the republic; then, if anything is negotiated with the French, it should be done on terms that are not contrary to religion, and if possible, which we will try entirely - with what success I do not know -, that ours negotiate separately from the Five Cantons with the king. I write this to you in secret, but still such a secret that it is notorious among us: we would never have repelled the Spaniard nor would we repel him in the future, if the French had not conquered him with their money and promises through their pensioners. Now you can think, if the French did not give them, where would they receive from.</p>
      <p>This war has been a good war for the pensioners; for the French have had to increase the pensions of several great captains, and most of them, if he wanted to keep them for sure, have said openly to the legate, if he did not give that, they would willingly give themselves to Philip's envoy; but for the sake of old services, they prefer to favor the French. What do you want me to say? Even if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, I could not go through all this; I get tired when I think about it. Your incomparable prudence is well known to me; but believe me, father, if you had to stay here for even two years in your old age, you would hardly endure the manners that I, a young man, have barely learned to swallow and overcome with the greatest sorrow of mind, which has also greatly afflicted my health. Therefore, it should not seem strange to you if I do not proceed entirely by the method you do.</p>
      <p>You know how often I have wished to change my place, but in vain; for it was not allowed to me through you. Therefore, since it seems that not some chance, but God has attached me to this place, I indeed obey, but I do not groan once.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I choose the more tolerable from many evils. May God be with us, so that what is most useful for the fatherland may have that effect.</p>
      <p>I remit all other things; I know nothing new. We have already heard about the death of Augustus, but from uncertain sources; however, these things are commonly reported in the streets. The things written about the plague from everywhere are horrendous.</p>
      <p>God may perhaps separate.</p>
      <p>Farewell, revered father in Christ, with all yours as happily and for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Destroy these letters, if it seems right.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 28, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius. Please, give these letters to Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and revered father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
