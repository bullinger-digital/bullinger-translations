      <p>Greetings. Your exposition on the Apocalypse is awaited with great expectation, and I would not doubt that a man who performs such a great and holy ministry well and piously is indeed endowed with a prophetic spirit, especially in that matter where it is most needed. For I do not think it should be believed that the best Father God would abandon His churches, so as to neglect granting what is honorable and beneficial to those who ask. I hear, however, what more should I write: I recently heard a man of great renown saying in passing that none of the expositors had yet understood that chapter 20 of the Apocalypse about the thousand years, and he seemed to understand it not obscurely in the manner of the worldly kingdom of the pious, almost like the chiliasts. I did not respond to him, as I neither knew enough nor was it a matter of my profession; but later, thinking about it in my leisure and considering the place according to my limited capacity, I came to this opinion, which I leave to you, a man entirely suitable for judging, and yet I do not seek or wish for you to write to me about this matter; but I will stand by your opinion once it is printed. Therefore, when either the Anabaptists or the chiliasts or those composed of them understand Christ to reign for a thousand years in some worldly and temporal kingdom, I would respond thus: it is characteristic of fanatical spirits to abandon clear scriptures and to fall into and seize upon figurative and enigmatic sayings; from these, they extract some fanatical opinion. However, there are clear statements in the scriptures (as you know far better than I), which are to be followed and from which the obscure ones are to be explained. For now, I understand that place in the Apocalypse to mean that in the early time of the church, the binding of the devil signified that the doctrine was purer then and that there had not yet been a universal devastation of the gospel, which later occurred throughout Asia in the Mohammedan kingdom after a thousand years, and thus it almost happened under the Roman Antichrist. If God is going to do something new, He will give a new word. Those who have the persuasion of a worldly kingdom of Christ, and that the pious should have the wealth and empires of the world, think almost nothing of spiritual consolations and the true kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual. Their argument is also this, namely, Christ's promises do not deceive; but Christ promised a hundredfold, etc., in this life; therefore, it is necessary for them to obtain wealth and power. To which I would respond that this statement was true from the beginning of the gospel, and yet there has not been a corporeal kingdom, and that hundredfold should be understood as God distributes to each, not as we occupy or desire. This opinion agrees with that of Peter: Godliness has the promise of the present life.</p>
      <p>The Father, who is in heaven, knows what we need, He protects His own, etc. This is to render a hundredfold. But it is added, "with tribulation," because the true church is oppressed by persecutions; yet it endures in the world and finds some little nest, wherever it may be. Therefore, to receive a hundredfold is a promise of divine will and does not command us (as the Anabaptists think) to invade and seize what belongs to others. Therefore, the pious will receive a hundredfold, namely from God and according to God's judgment, not by themselves. Thus also the poor, if they have food and clothing with equanimity of mind, then they have received a hundredfold. These few things I wanted to share with you, although not yet known to you by face and not so much by name. But I have written these things to you, relying on your Christian gentleness, because I love, revere, and honor you, if anyone else, whom the heavenly Father may protect for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and if I can do anything, command me.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Guglielmo Grataroli.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent pastor of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother and superior. To Zurich.</p>
