    <p xml:id="regest1">They were pleased to find their old bond confirmed in his letter. At his request, they want to help ensure that Geneva regains its former pastor by writing, along with the people of Basel, to the scholars and councils of Strasbourg as well as to Calvin; in the meantime, Farel should pray for God's help. They have heard that he was asked in a letter [from Melanchthon] to introduce a faith examination as a prerequisite for participation in the Lord's Supper; undoubtedly, he will not engage in such an innovation, which would pave the way again for the confession, which he himself opposed. They also gladly accept brotherly admonition on their part.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord. The letters you sent, dearest Farel, greatly delighted us: we also read them with great pleasure of the soul.</p>
      <p>For we understand from these that we are still to you, as we once were, very close. We ask that, just as we sincerely wish you well and are most loving towards you, you also always wish to love us in the Lord. What you ask and demand with many requests, because we judge them to be just and pious and part of our duty, we will carry out with the greatest zeal, diligence, and faith. Nor will we accomplish this alone, but together with the people of Basel, the learned of the church of Strasbourg, the leaders of the republic, and we will write to Calvin himself, directing all our strength and efforts so that the church of Geneva may have its pastor restored. In the meantime, it will be your and all the brothers' duty to pray to God, that He may wish to establish and care for what He sees fit to promote His glory and the salvation of the churches.</p>
      <p>We ask you very much, dearest of all, Farel, that just as you have acted well, piously, and sincerely until now, you may always wish to do everything, rejecting the doctrines of the Pope and the new inventions, not even lending an ear, let alone a mind. There is a rumor going around, but a strong one, that letters have brought to a certain region of Neuchâtel, demanding and insisting that henceforth no one be admitted to the holy communion unless first thoroughly examined in faith. We do not write this doubting you: for you are of greater authority, learning, and sincerity to us than to suspect, let alone believe such things about you. But what else, we beseech you, my Farel, if we were all to come to such madness, that no one would be admitted to the holy action of the supper unless examined by us in faith, than to pave the way for auricular confession and lay the foundation for papistry? Which you, along with all the pious, not only burned with hatred for, but fought against with all your might as a pernicious evil to the Christian cause, and rejected and repelled from the church of Christ. We must be careful, venerable Farel, not to begin to act papistically, we who have hitherto conducted everything piously, holily, and apostolically. We write this, as said above, not assuming or suspecting about you, but because we judged it to be our duty to warn the brothers of that whisper and rumor: asking that you consider everything in good faith, and keep us in your commendation, and if you desire anything in us, always freely admonish us.</p>
      <p>We will not only gladly obey, but we will also thank you, the faithful admonisher. Farewell, with all the brothers of Neuchâtel safe. Zürich, April 4, Anno 41.</p>
      <p>The pastors and teachers, ministers of the church of Zürich, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed man of faith, Mr. Guillaume Farel, ecclesiastic of Neuchâtel, brother in the Lord, venerable and beloved.</p>
