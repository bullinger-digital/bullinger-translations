    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger will not let the messenger [Heinrich Thomann] leave without a letter, even if he cannot write much due to lack of time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He has received both of Serin's letters. The first from August 5 [No. 2527] with the welcome news required no response. In the meantime, Serin was recommended in writing [not received] to [Johannes] Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [“True and Well-Founded Report” by Johannes Schradin] sent by Serin pleased Bullinger very much. As thanks, he includes in the present letter the description of the [“Antichrist”] made by his colleague and [foster] son [Rudolf Gwalther].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Serin should warmly greet [Martin] Frecht and [Johannes] Piscatorius. May the Lord grant victory to the [Schmalkaldic League], or otherwise steadfastness and patience in faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In his second letter from August 25 [No. 2550], Serin wondered about Bullinger's silence. The latter was very occupied during the summer with his commentary on Luke. The work was completed on August 26 [correct: 28] and is dedicated to the Augsburg councilor [Hans] Welser.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The Zurichers [Meinrat Oggenfuß and Hans Hug] have returned well from Bavaria. One is said to have already departed again as a mercenary. The other will hardly return to Moravia immediately due to the war events.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The Zurich church has established [public] prayer [hours] for the [Schmalkaldic League], and indeed for its own land as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Englishman [...], who delivered Serin's last letter, has gone to Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- About 1000 Swiss mercenaries, who wanted to join the [Schmalkaldic League], have returned home in recent days, as apparently they are not needed. Many are upset about this, as they would have gladly helped the [Schmalkaldic League] in their fight against Emperor [Charles V]. It is certain that the [Protestant city cantons] devoted to the Gospel stand fully behind the [Schmalkaldic League]! May the Lord grant success and protection!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Having found a convenient messenger, dearest Leonhard, I could not let him leave without responding to your letters, even if only briefly. I could not write more at present.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I received two letters from you, the first dated August 5th. There is nothing in them that requires a significant response. I have recommended you to Haller, and I hope you will soon receive a letter from him, unless mine did not reach him. I received the fictional dream from you and it pleases me greatly. In return, I am sending you the description of the Antichrist, written by my colleague, indeed my foster son, whom I have raised. Please give my warm regards to Frecht and Piscatorius. I read with pleasure the news you wrote in your letter. I pray to the Lord to grant us victory, or if He wills otherwise, to grant us all patience and steadfastness in faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The second letter was dated August 25th. You wonder why I did not respond to the first. I was unable due to my duties. This summer, I completed nine books of commentaries on the Gospel according to Luke. They were published on August 26th. I dedicated them to Mr. Welser, the councilor of Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Two of our citizens returned home safely from Bavaria. I believe one has gone back to military service. I do not think the other will go to Moravia amidst these disturbances.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A supplication has been instituted for you, indeed for us as well, and for the common cause of our church. There is more hope and protection in prayers than in arms.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Englishman who brought me your last letter has gone to Strasbourg. In the past three days, nearly 1000 Swiss, who had left to support our cause, have returned, having heard on their journey that no more were being accepted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>They returned, although quite impatiently. They would have preferred to offer their service to you against the Emperor. It is certain that the Swiss, who value the Gospel, sincerely support and favor you and your cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord that He may favor and protect you. Unless He watches over and guards the city, the watchman watches in vain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell with all good things. September 4th, Zurich, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Mr. Leonhard Soerin, residing in Ulm, my dearest brother. Ulm.</p>
