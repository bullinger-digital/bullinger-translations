    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter, Johannes Landolt, an honorable man who has conducted himself well so far and stands faithfully by the evangelical doctrine - for which reason he also had to leave the Solothurn area - should find accommodation and a position with his family in Zurich. He has not earned sufficiently as a teacher at the German school in Aarau, dependent on private school fees, because there is also a Latin school equipped with good teachers, which is financed by the authorities.</p>

      <p>Revered, well-learned gentlemen and beloved collaborators in the word of Christ, grace be with you and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Beloved brothers, Johannes Landolt, the bearer of this letter, earnestly requests us, with a recommendation to your reverence, to contribute so that you may assist him before an honorable council and also particular individuals of the esteemed city of Zurich, so that he may be received there by his lords and superiors in a fatherly manner and provided with something, through which he may also have his sustenance and be able to support himself, his wife, and children, etc. We are now entirely willing, and also consider it our duty, as he is a pious, honorable man who has conducted himself well and honorably so far and has faithfully adhered to and promoted evangelical doctrine, for which reason he was expelled from the Solothurn area where he had settled. Therefore, beloved gentlemen, our humble request and desire is that you kindly recommend the aforementioned brother and thus commend him to an honorable council, so that in some way a means of advancement may be achieved and found for him, that he may be offered some position or employment, or if that is not feasible, an opportunity to continue his studies, so that he may not perish unfruitfully, but rather be of service and benefit to himself and others. For he has now taught the German school in Aarau for several years and has conducted himself faithfully; however, this brings no income at all, as there is otherwise a Latin school equipped with very capable and learned preceptors, where the boys do not pay, but rather the provision for the schoolmasters is drawn from the city treasury, and those who attend the German school must pay for themselves, which is very detrimental and disadvantageous to him, although the people of Aarau are favorable to him; nevertheless, it is too difficult for them to maintain two schools.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he cannot sustain himself with us. And so, revered gentlemen and beloved brothers, may you act in such a manner towards him that he may feel he has enjoyed our recommendation, and that we have not acted ineffectively, desiring to serve willingly and humbly.</p>
      <p>Dated May 4, in the year of our Lord 1538.</p>
      <p>Your reverent willing servants, the dean and the common chapter of Aarau.</p>
      <p>To the revered, well and much-learned gentlemen, the common leaders and proclaimers of the divine word of the esteemed city and territory of Zurich, now assembled there in a synod, our beloved lords and brothers.</p>
