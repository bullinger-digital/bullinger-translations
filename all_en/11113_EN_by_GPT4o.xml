    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the problems addressed by Bullinger concerning the Bernese church, he considers it best to acquaint the people with the jointly decided confession, as the Basel preachers successfully do; the fact that the confession has been reaffirmed in Bern is therefore no cause for concern, even if different words are used. As for Sebastian [Meyer], it would bring honor to the younger to subordinate himself; difficulties are more likely to be feared from Erasmus [Ritter], who has already caused unrest in Schaffhausen, than from Megander. Since Bullinger considers a transfer of Meyer necessary, he is willing to approach a member of the Strasbourg council in this matter, but wishes for the simultaneous removal of Ritter, who is regarded by many as the instigator of the unrest; Megander should meanwhile be admonished from Zurich to familiarize the people with the content of the confession. Requests a response and sends greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in Christ Jesus and my friendly, willing service beforehand, highly learned, friendly, esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letter about the grievances (misconduct) of the church in Bern, I have also otherwise understood that this church has some unrest to worry about, and as you have, I have also considered that nothing would be better than for the church in Bern and elsewhere to learn simply according to our common confession, as you know, that this was unanimously decided with us at the last meeting, but that the mentioned confession should not only be written on paper, but also preached to the people and thus taught. Therefore, thank God, we have peace in our city and country, as our preachers faithfully teach according to this content, and we have no fear that the same content has been refreshed in Bern, since some discord has occurred among the brothers there. Where there is tension, binding measures must indeed be provided, to which one must adhere, and since we have not only used the confession against outsiders, but have also introduced it into our church and put it into practice, we have no concern about refreshing the same content, even if it is spoken with different words.</p>
      <p>However, as you see fit, that Doctor Sebastian should be transferred, who is said to be old and quarrelsome, dear sir, age brings much trouble, as I well find in myself, and if the young, who do not yet know everything (as they think), would submit and not soon despise their words, it would be to their honor before God and all decency, especially to such an old, learned man. But, so that you understand my simplicity, I am concerned that Erasmus may not get along with Doctor Sebastian, nor that Megander will get involved; for Megander is more sensible. Erasmus was truly stirred up among our dear confederates of Schaffhausen and left a heavy offense to the glorious church there behind him. And since you finally think that it serves peace well for Doctor Sebastian to be removed, I have no doubt that you, with your high understanding and skill, can consider the matter better than I, a simple layman, who would like to see things go well, but do not understand everything that would be necessary for me, especially in the change of such people. Every change is difficult for me; but since you indicate such necessity, I will not forget it and will have some consideration of how the matter stands, and I think that I will write to a trusted friend of the council in Strasbourg about the content of your writings, on which this matter will depend, but without mentioning you. However, I would like Erasmus to be removed as well, who is considered by many pious people to be an instigator of unrest. For truly many think that the church in Bern (even if Doctor Sebastian were removed) would not be helped unless Erasmus were removed first. Meanwhile, you might (since Megander looks to you reasonably) admonish the dear man to look more diligently at the common Basel confession and to instruct the church well in all the scriptural words (used in the sacraments), so that the confession does not stand only in words. It occurs to me how the people of Strasbourg have diligently said that our churches must be taught according to the content of the confession, otherwise there will be no concord, and that we have experienced how such content can be well understood by the people when it is taught faithfully, as is done with us, etc.</p>
      <p>So much I have now wanted to answer you briefly to your letter, to further understand your mind; for where I can serve the common church for benefit and welfare, you would find me willing (as far as the Lord grants grace). I hereby commend you faithfully to the Lord. Greet Master LÃ¶wen, Pellican, and the brothers commonly, also the Lord Lavater and the old Lord of Wettingen. If it is convenient for you, you may write to me again with this messenger. I hereby wish to commend you faithfully to the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 26th of November, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of the Christian community in Zurich, my esteemed lord and friend.</p>
