      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, when I was with you a few days ago, I sufficiently told and informed you about the matter and accusation before the Landvogt at Frauenfeld, brought about by the messengers at Weinfelden and especially by Jakob Locher, the Vogt there, and Captain Eberli. Namely, how they so shamefully twisted my words, and that I truthfully announced the peace of God and the peace of the world with clear, plain words from the divine scripture, they interpreted and explained it with falsehoods concerning their land's peace. In response to such accusations, I myself went before the Landvogt, and afterwards two appointed messengers from the community did the same, and earnestly and diligently requested that he kindly honor me and let me remain by right and not go against me or overpower me violently; for I wanted to be of the right and expect the right. Which he promised the messengers, but how it was kept, is now known throughout the whole Thurgau. For on the eve of the Purification of Mary, when the lights were lit, he sent his bailiffs and servants, and with great unrest, malice, and wickedness, they apprehended me at supper to take me as a murderer by night. But the faithful God, who can well save His own, had me warned by a good friend. Yet it happened so quickly that I barely reached one door as they fell upon the other. And when they searched my house a second time, they also forcibly took some money from my wife with the purse and seized everything I had. Thus, I fled to Doctor Hans Zwick as to my father, who comforted and supported me in my poverty. If I do not want to leave my possessions, which are truly very small, behind and lose them and leave completely bare with my little children, I must give the Landvogt 5 guilders and 20 batzen, which they spent on me that night, and also pay the stolen money that they forcibly took from my wife. Thus, my wife must sell almost everything we have if we want to settle the sum. Thus, God deals with us in Thurgau, and we can come to less justice than under the Turks. I could not keep this from you as my dear and faithful father, so that perhaps a better vigilance may occur elsewhere. I have mainly suffered such misfortune from Jakob Locher. What kind of man he is, you will find in my other letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and keep us, now relegated to exile and expelled by impious tyrants, commended to your church's prayers.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, on the 11th day of February in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Johannes Ritter, formerly minister of the church in Weinfelden.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Antistes of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
