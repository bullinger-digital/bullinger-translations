    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not want to appear at the court hearing set by [the community of] Rohrdorf. Ulrich [Bullinger] is still in Milan with the Duke, but will hardly have success. Must pay two guilders to the [Zug] city clerk Jakob Kolin. Sends cheese from the Ursern Valley, which he received at New Year from Heini Machar from Silenen. Asks for news due to the war rumors; has little to lose. Would be pleased with a visit.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, know that those from Rohrdorf have set a court date for a week from Monday, and I am supposed to come myself. But I do not want to; for a snake lies hidden in the grass. You, consider what good you think, and advise.</p>
      <p>Ulrich is still in Milan, and whatever the Duke does with him today, tomorrow it is a lie, and I fear there is nothing to be gained.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I must pay the city clerk Jakob Kolin 2 guilders by this Tuesday, and he has treated me very kindly, as is usual for the useless crowd of scribes.</p>
      <p>I also send you and your old women a piece of cheese from the Ursern Valley. It came to me as a New Year's gift from Heini Machar from Silenen, and see if it makes their teeth chatter.</p>
      <p>There is much talk of war among us. If there is any news, write. I am now always well greeted, as there is not much to find in the granary; for the traveler sang empty before the robber.</p>
      <p>I would gladly suffer that you and your household were with me. I have killed such a good calf, although I do not send it to you. It happens that it is not strange to you. Do you wish to be appeased in this furious time, in which everything is done recklessly?</p>
      <p>Farewell; love the one who loves you, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my brother, in Zurich.</p>
