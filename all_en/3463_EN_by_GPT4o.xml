      <p>Greetings and blessings to you and your entire household from the Lord, and may this new year be most prosperous. Yesterday, just before evening, I received your letter dated December 18th.</p>
      <p>Today, at dawn, our son Johannes announced his presence, who can best take care of our letters; but he is already about to leave. Therefore, I could not respond to yours in order nor write down what I had intended.</p>
      <p>I had some matters regarding our delegation to France and the colloquy at Worms. The delegation did not proceed very successfully or according to our wishes, with the cardinals and bishops opposing Christ and misleading the king.</p>
      <p>The colloquy ended at the beginning of December. Nothing was accomplished; the papists refused a legitimate meeting.</p>
      <p>Since you will be coming to us in a few days, God willing, you will hear everything; then we will converse to our heart's content. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the excellent old man Mr. Travers be safe, and may all our friends and especially our pastors be safe.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, January 8, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man by virtues and lineage, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, in Samaden, Rhaetia, my singular friend and as a brother.</p>
