    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There is nothing new to report that Myconius has not already informed Bullinger about. However, Gast thanks for the greetings and news that Bullinger conveys through Myconius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A Venetian [correctly: the Lucchese Teodosio Trebellio] reported that the young, innocent [Diego], the brother of Francisco de Enzinas (whom Bullinger knows), was arrested, tortured, and burned in Rome because of his evangelical faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Papists [in the neighboring territories] are spreading various versions about Emperor [Charles V's] plans for the winter: Firstly, that he will attempt to move through Saxony, along the Elbe to Friesland, to winter there. Secondly, that he will march through Württemberg and take a route similar to the one the Dutch army took southward, to provision in the bishoprics of Würzburg or Bamberg. Thirdly, that he will set out through the land [Palatinate-Neuburg] of [Elector] Frederick [II of the Palatinate] towards Freiburg [im Breisgau] and Breisach, to then cross the Rhine and move down the Rhine to Mainz before Strasbourg. The latter seems the most plausible. These Papists already imagine victory on their side. However, one hears completely different, probably better substantiated reports about the course of the war!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The [Basel resident Reinhard Rettalet] had his son-in-law, the councilor [Franz Konrad Schmid, known as Glüner], who suddenly died in Habsheim, buried according to Catholic rites, although some good people protested against it. Three other Papists [from Basel] were also present. The Basel authorities imprisoned the father-in-law for three days and fined him 100 guilders, the other three 10 pounds. They deserved a harsher punishment! May the Lord give the council the strength to continue to destroy such people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to Bullinger and to [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] The Basel residents have sent [Hieronymus] Gunz and [Sebastian] Lepusculus as pastors to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, Otto [Werdmüller], [Theodor] Bibliander, and [Konrad] Pellikan. The [enclosed] letter should be forwarded by [Johannes] Fries as agreed.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have nothing new to report that Myconius has not already informed you about in great detail. Furthermore, I thank you for always sending your regards in your letters and for reminding Myconius to share new developments with me.</p>

      <p>I heard from a Venetian [correctly: the Lucchese Teodosio Trebellio] that the brother of Francisco de Enzinas, Diego, was burned in Rome for the Gospel. He was detained in prison for a long time and tortured. He was an excellent young man and truly innocent. You know Francisco.</p>

      <p>It is also said among us (the rumor comes from the Papists) that the Emperor intends (attempts) either to move through Saxony or to have a winter camp there on the Elbe in Friesland. 2. Or he has another plan: He intends to move through Württemberg or take the route that the Dutch took, to find provisions in the bishoprics of Würzburg or Bamberg. 3. A plan that seems plausible: He intends to move through the land of Count Frederick towards Freiburg and Breisach, then, once they cross the Rhine, to move down towards Mainz before Strasbourg. See how various plans of the Emperor are spread by the Papists! They rejoice in the Emperor's success, while we hear quite different, and I believe more truthful and certain, reports.</p>

      <p>A respectable citizen, a council friend, died suddenly during the grape harvest in Habsheim. His father-in-law had him buried (against the protest of some good men) with candles, holy water, and bells, quite splendidly. Three Papists were with him. The father-in-law was imprisoned by our lords for three days and fined 100 guilders, the other three were fined 10 pounds. They are old Papists. They deserved a greater punishment. Thus, they reveal their thoughts in these disturbances and what they think of our religion. Our senate is to be praised, and may the Lord give them the spirit of fortitude to continue eradicating these people.</p>
