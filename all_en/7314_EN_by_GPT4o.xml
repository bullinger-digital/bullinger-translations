      <p>From Bern, 21st October 1567</p>
      <p>Just arrived from Bern. Sent by our lords here from the council.</p>
      <p>The city of Bern is calling for a Swiss confederate meeting in Baden on 16th November, to deliberate on what should be done in these dangerous times, etc. The Count is near Paris with 10,000 horsemen, over 12,000 archers and foot soldiers, having burned all the windmills, and intends to starve Paris into submission. The Swiss are with the king there. The Count has offered them friendly terms, suggesting they should not oppose the French nobility; if they join him, he will treat them honorably. But there is no response yet. The king is awaiting Italian reinforcements; Strozza is bringing them to him. Strong forces have been sent against him by the Lord of Muy and Chartres with cavalry and infantry, intending to attack them before they reach the king.</p>
      <p>It is to be feared that the Swiss, who are now on their way, will also be met halfway, where I wish they would stay at home; for, as I have always feared, this alliance will bring us suffering and distress. May Almighty God have mercy on us. On the king's side are the dukes, the old constable, Lord Anjou, Lord of Guise, and Lord Damala. Lord of Tavannes is supposed to wait with artillery and cavalry in Champagne for the current 4,000 Swiss, to escort them to the others. The king has captured Lord of Muy's baggage, that is, his valuables, and allowed his camp followers and guards to divide it. Lord of Muy has seized the baggage of the Cardinal of Lorraine, which is three times more valuable than his own, and has kept it, estimated at thirty thousand francs. So much for this time.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, the last day of November 1567.</p>
      <p>Your servant, etc.</p>
