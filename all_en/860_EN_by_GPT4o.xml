      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most vigilant leader of the church in Geneva, his venerable and dearest lord and brother, in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I send to you, Calvin, my brother in the Lord, venerable and dearest, in exchange for your truly golden gifts, a gift barely of bronze, namely, for your most learned books, the third Decade of my sermons. I am quite certain of the truth of the doctrines, but I doubt how clearly and conveniently I have conveyed everything. However, I have done what I could, often aided by your writings. Certainly, I have tried to convey each thing simply and clearly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that those who study and minister the word, for whose benefit I have done this, may reap the most abundant fruit from my labors.</p>
      <p>We have heard nothing about your affairs for a long time: we therefore anxiously wish to know how you are, what you are doing, and whether everything is well in the church.</p>
      <p>The plague had begun to rage somewhat among us, but soon ceased. Many think it will soon rage more cruelly.</p>
      <p>For now, again, in a few days, one or two have perished from the plague. But this is the hand of the Lord: it is well. May the will of the Lord be done: whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.</p>
      <p>The affairs of our church and school, and also of the republic, are quite well, thanks to Christ. For much peace has been granted to us because we did not join the French alliance. This causes much disturbance for others. Mr. Haller, at the request of the Bernese church, has been granted or given to the Bernese.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he will remain in Bern. In Haller's place, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, a very pious and learned young man, has been appointed, from whom I expect great things. He studied for some time in Strasbourg and in Paris: he returned home from France through Italy.</p>
      <p>The moroseness and inhumanity of some have never pleased me. I well remember what you wrote to me in your last letters. And I will gladly strive to mitigate that severity.</p>
      <p>I think it should sometimes be overlooked lest worse things happen, especially when it is not about the purity of doctrine, I mean about the doctrines.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hope that with Zebedee's transfer, there will be more tranquility in the church of Lausanne. Otherwise, they are excellent men who are so rigid. This long and dangerous dissension has thus exasperated them. I hope everything will be much better in time.</p>
      <p>I am sorry that that brother from Paris has been rejected. If he is whole, things will succeed better at another time.</p>
      <p>I have diligently carried out what you requested to write to our Mr. Hooper: and I hope he will consider the matter more rightly. But I say this freely to you, that Bucer indeed endured many labors in the church: but if he had not labored so strenuously in some matters, and had spoken less ambiguously about the Lord's Supper, he would have done better. I say this to you. I write nothing of this to our Hooper.</p>
      <p>For I think that those things which are of peace should be sought and promoted among brothers otherwise torn apart, exposed to persecution, and scattered. May the Lord Jesus gather his church and preserve his own.</p>
      <p>From the German cities, little favorable news is reported. You know what happened in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord. Farewell eternally with all your fellow ministers. May the dearest brothers Mr. Farel and Viret be safe above all. All my fellow ministers greet you and wish all happiness to the church of Geneva. Zurich, March 15, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
