      <p>Greetings. It cannot be expressed how gratefully I received your letter written at the beginning of this month, which I received late yesterday and embraced from the heart as if it were from my father Bullinger, whom I revere and will love as long as I live. I also ask you to act as a parent and make use of my services if they can be of use to you or your friends. Many noble and very brave soldiers have left France for the Netherlands without the king's permission to aid the oppressed and tyrannized, but they were intercepted and either killed or captured by Alba.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard will become more insolent, but the Lord will eventually curb such arrogance and provide material for the celebration of His name. Count von Eberstein did not dare to advance; many believe that Prince of Orange has crossed the Rhine with 6,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. I pray that the Lord will be with him and have mercy on us. In the matter of Mr. Johann Philipp of Saxony, I will leave nothing undone, and now he has sent a boy to me to indicate that he has a reliable messenger. Therefore, I have written this hastily. My wife sends her greetings to you. I had written to my son to be careful not to be pricked by thorns while walking among them and not to be touched by the venom of the scorpions among whom he walks.</p>
      <p>He replied that he had received an antidote from you and gloves that would prevent him from feeling the thorns while gathering roses. He has a pious and learned teacher and honest comrades. He will soon depart for Valence in Dauphiné, where there are pious and learned professors. I hope the Lord will protect him; I commend myself and him to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the most honorable council, the fellow ministers, and our mutual friends. Farewell and love us, as you do.</p>
      <p>Paris, late on July 23, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>"From Coignet about the defeat of the French in the Netherlands, dated July 23, 1572."</p>
