      <p>Greetings. The assembly has concluded and another has been scheduled for November 22, if I remember correctly. Meanwhile, I would very much like, indeed our people sincerely wish, for the Christian cities to meet and consult on all matters before that assembly; for many issues are coming into question again: the consultation on whether to attend or refuse the council, the new alliance to be confirmed by oath; the Frenchman has provided the Swiss with a copy of his protest against the Council of Trent, and it has greatly extinguished the fervor of some who are burning with love and desire for the council not for Christ's sake, but for Lazarus's. The Emperor accuses the Frenchman gravely; the Frenchman defends himself strongly. What do you think will happen? Friends from Italy write nothing about the Council of Trent. If you can, suggest to good men that private councils be held and that they discuss all matters amicably, etc.</p>
      <p>Recently, in the heavy wind, Grüningen unfortunately burned down up to the castle and one or two houses; it is said to have started in the bailiff's stable due to carelessness. May God protect us from greater misfortune. It was such a great fire that it was seen far and wide, it started before midnight and lasted until daybreak.</p>
      <p>I have given a booklet for printing, "On the Perfection of Christians," to King Henry of France in Latin and German; Mr. Vergerius translated it into Italian and French; it is a small book, perhaps 4 or 5 pages. Farewell and greet Gastius, with whom you will share this about Grüningen and my book; I did not have time to write to him, but do tell him to reply to the previous letters if it is convenient. October 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the Basel church, my venerable lord and dearest brother. Basel.</p>
