      <p>Greetings. I recently received your letters, to which I have nothing to respond, nor do I have much time to write now, as I am very busy. What I had, I wrote to our Gwalther; he will share it with you.</p>
      <p>I can hardly persuade myself that a council in Konstanz will take place; it did not proceed in Trient, how would it proceed or succeed here? They are driven by a spirit of confusion, so that they do not know where they should turn; they wish to suppress the cause of truth, but they cannot and will not be able to, by the grace of the Lord, who powerfully resists their efforts.</p>
      <p>We have nothing yet from France.</p>
      <p>I am now sending Musculus's "Loci" through this person; the printer thought he would send it to you in his name. Since they did not do this, he is sending you a copy himself.</p>
      <p>More next time.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 2, 1560. May all of yours be well.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
