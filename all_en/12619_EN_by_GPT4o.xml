    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Bullinger has received all of Blarer's letters, everything is fine. Enclosed is a letter from [Georg] Frölich to Blarer that arrived two days ago. A similar letter was also sent to the Konstanz council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The people of Konstanz have sent 150 men to Lindau, where they will join another 150 to 200 [from Lindau] and, along with others, ensure the guarding of the Ehrenberg Pass.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Many consider the devastating lightning strikes in Mechelen and previously in [the Kingdom of] Naples as a very bad omen for Emperor [Charles V] and Pope [Paul III]. Who would not consider a soon liberation of the Church likely in light of this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Dutch army was disbanded or prevented from joining the Emperor's army.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [King] Ferdinand has already revealed himself more than once as an enemy [of the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Before Blarer composed his last letter [No. 2558], he was able to look at some sections of Bullinger's commentary on [Luke] and was very pleased with Bullinger's appreciation of Luther. Recently, he wrote to [Hans] Welser about the dedication addressed to him [in Bullinger's commentary on Luke]. Welser will surely be pleased about it, even if he does not understand Latin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Blarer recommends [Hans] Schöner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Since [the war] obviously keeps Bullinger very busy, Blarer would like to provide him with news more often; only sometimes he has no messenger available, then he lacks the time, or there is nothing worth reporting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- More and more Italian [troops are supposed to gather in front of the Ehrenberg Pass]. However, the [Schmalkaldic League] will prevent them from joining the Emperor's troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The effects of the day in Aarau must be left to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Blarer is pleased [however] with the goodwill that the Confederates show towards the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- He will continue to inform Bullinger about the developments of the war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- The [Council of] Augsburg has asked Konstanz and probably also Zurich to send preachers. The day before, [Johannes] Schnell was assigned to Sonthofen in the Allgäu and Johannes Jung to Leutkirch, where [Johannes] Fabri had long spread heresies. The third preacher [Martin Wetzler] now accompanies the soldiers sent [to Lindau].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The council has just learned that the [Schmalkaldic League] has abandoned the Ehrenberg Pass! No further details are known. How distressing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Also, [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren, was able to cross the Main with 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers unhindered and can now reach the Emperor! He is entrenched and waiting for Buren. Blarer knew it: [The Schmalkaldic League] must endure a bit more before God will punish their enemies!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- King [Ferdinand] wanted to impose a four-year tax on property and goods on the Bohemians to finance the war. They refused, arguing that the war did not concern them. When Ferdinand had the envoys arrested, there was an uprising in Prague, which prompted the king to release the detainees.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Bullinger will probably have already learned all this from the letters of the [Konstanz council] to the [Zurich council]. It is certain that God will grant us eternal life!</p>

      <p>S. Everything is indeed well, my esteemed Bullinger, since you have received all my letters. Now I am sending what Lętus sent to me three days ago, which was also written to our council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Today, 150 selected soldiers from our side have been sent to Lindau, where another 150 or perhaps 200 will be added, who, along with some others, will keep watch at the Ehrenberg Castle to prevent any danger from arising from those passes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The terrifying force of the lightning is taken by many as a bad omen for the Emperor and the Pope, especially since it is affirmed with certainty that no less severe events occurred in Naples shortly before those in Mechelen, so that no one doubts that these portend the end for our enemies. Who, I ask, would not wholeheartedly agree with this, even praying that the Church of Christ may soon be avenged of such more than grievous evils?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Dutch army will either be defeated by our forces or certainly prevented from assisting the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Ferdinand has declared himself our enemy by more than one indication. For no one can maintain a false persona for long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I had carefully examined your commentaries in one or two places before I wrote my last letter, where I also greatly admired your candor, with which you gave Martin Luther a truly worthy testimony. I recently wrote to Welser about your dedication, and I have no doubt that you have pleased him, even though he does not understand Latin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I commend Schöner to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I would very gladly gratify you with much and diligent writing, especially since I see that you are so greatly interested in this matter; but sometimes I lack messengers, sometimes time, and sometimes even a subject. Therefore, kindly accept whatever it is that you receive.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>We hear that more and more Italians are gathering, but our forces will strongly oppose them joining the Emperor's troops.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What you wrote to me about the day in Aarau must be entrusted to God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>That there is so much goodwill from your side towards ours, I praise God from the heart. I hope it will turn out well for both parties if we mean and work together with trust.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>As soon as I receive either good or bad news about the success of the war, I will ensure that you learn of it immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The people of Augsburg write to us, and I think also to you, that if there are preachers of the gospel who can be spared for a while, they should be sent there. Today, we have sent the third with our soldiers; yesterday, the senior Velocianus was sent to the Allgäu, where he will serve in the notable village of Sonthofen; furthermore, Johannes Jung will minister the gospel of Christ for one or two months in the town of Leutkirch, which Faber had long deluded with his impious arts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Now my lords have received news that our forces have abandoned the Ehrenberg Pass. How it happened, whether due to the enemy's compulsion or otherwise, we are waiting to learn. Oh God, the matter has been handled carelessly! The pass was not occupied as needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Thus, the Count of Buren has crossed the Main and can now reach the Emperor unhindered. He is 7,000 strong on horseback and probably 20,000 on foot. The Emperor has entrenched himself so that our forces cannot reach him. Buren will wait, as he well can. But so it shall be; I have always truly thought and said: we must suffer for this matter! But yet God will finally demonstrate His great power against the enemy and bring honor. We will entrust it to Him. The glory of the victory must be His, as is right. To Him be praise and glory forever! If many of us must perish for it, oh, He will give brave hearts and spirits, so that we may overcome it valiantly, flying to heaven and letting our enemies see us closer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>The king wanted to impose a four-year tax on all their property and goods on the Bohemians to support this war. But they refused and sent an envoy to him, arguing that the war did not concern them, so they could not agree to such a burden. In response, he mistreated the envoys and imprisoned them. Therefore, the people of Prague rose up. They wanted to free them by force. When the king noticed this, he released them himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>But there is no need to write about all this, since my lords have already informed yours through their own messengers. Pray earnestly and truly to God for us and His church. We certainly need it! But it is right; we must stand the test. He is strong who stands by us. Therefore, be fresh and ready! It is about eternal life.</p>
      <p>Given on September 7.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
