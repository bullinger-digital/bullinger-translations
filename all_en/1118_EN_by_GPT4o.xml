      <p>Greetings. The letters you sent to me on the 12th, most excellent man, I received yesterday for the first time from the Wil cobbler; such is the faith of merchants, indeed, who boast of their piety more than other mortals. I congratulate not only those excellent men Musculus and Haller, whose homes have ceased to be mournful, but also the entire church there, which the Lord, having corrected somewhat, I hope will soon cleanse entirely from this destructive plague, so that it may not be condemned with this world. Although among these scourges and the drawn swords of the Lord, with which He continues to afflict the world, it seems much more tolerable to good and pious men, who in the tranquility of peace and among the consoling voices of brothers and the protection of sacred prayers, give up their spirit. For what else, I ask, awaits those whom the plague spares, but either the enemy or famine, or certainly both, so that this saving hand of the Lord seems to us to be desired, if we are to be extinguished by any of them. But may the will of the Lord be done; to whom be glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Would that the spirits of the Magdeburgers, who have shown themselves truly brave and noble until now, never be broken! But I greatly fear (as we are human), lest the thousand arts of the enemy, their fierce threats and frequent attacks, then the desertions of some allies and the now much relaxed nerve of war, finally weaken the spirits of those not all depending on the helping hand of the one Lord Zebaoth. Ah, how necessary it is for us now to be concerned for their constancy and safety in private and public supplications before the Lord.</p>
      <p>But you will scarcely find a few whom the care of these matters even lightly touches; so much are we stupefied and more than stony towards these most present dangers and impending destructions of the members of Christ and our own.</p>
      <p>What do you think this portends for us, but that soon, we who now are devoid of all sense of pain in the great afflictions of our brothers, will feel our own evils too grievously, with no one at all pitying us?" Because they" (says the prophet) suffered nothing beyond the breaking of Joseph, therefore they will be among the first to be led away captive. Ah, Savior Christ, soften our hard iron and as if frozen hearts, so that they truly grieve for us and that we believe that the evils now happening to our brothers also pertain to us, indeed are even now returning to us, so that we may assist them with faithful prayers, when otherwise it is not allowed, and at the same time with serious and mature repentance avert the impending wrath from our heads.</p>
      <p>What you write that the English offer to the French, etc., are efforts truly worthy of a Christian king, even if there is no success. May He who gave this spirit of zeal for propagating the kingdom of Christ preserve it, so that there may be at least one monarch of the Christian kingdoms, who seeks the supreme King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus Christ, with all his heart and who gathers and defends the exiles and proscribed confessors of Christ under his wings, imitating this same Christ!</p>
      <p>You, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, with your wife, children, and your whole household, whom I bid much health, commend me and my household, a good part of which is in poor health, to the healing hand of Christ, as you can dutifully, which I earnestly beseech and implore all your other ministers in the work of the Lord to do through the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer. December 22, 1550. (before 331:) To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
