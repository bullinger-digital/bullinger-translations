      <p>If you are well, it is good; I am indeed well. Although a few days ago I had sent you a letter written with more words, in which I had explained with what intention everything was being done by me, and what I also thought you should do; nevertheless, since Peter Martyr, a man who loves you dearly, was writing there, I did not want his letter to come to you without my letter. Therefore, concerning the same matters, my teacher, I urge you again and again, as I did in the previous letters, to diligently continue in the duty you have kindly undertaken. I have told the prince that you will not keep our expectation suspended longer than until the next Frankfurt fair. Therefore, most excellent man, see to it again and again that you do not delay the matter further, especially in fulfilling the obligation, of which the best part has already been completed by you, and the remaining part is very easy for you to accomplish. What more?</p>
      <p>Will you be able to endure their just complaints? I mean those who do not call you, but plainly demand, and that by their right, since you pledged your faith to them in the previous edition to the king, and also confirmed most kindly in your letters to me that you would fulfill to the last penny whatever you had ever promised us. Will you then allow this hope, or rather this glory which you hold in your hands, to be shamefully snatched from you, or even more shamefully to perish? I do not think you will, if I have well understood all your feelings. For I know both that you do not wish to fail in your duty and constancy, and with what virtues and ornaments you have already commended your name to immortality and wish to commend it further; I know the gravity of your mind, I know its loftiness, which can in no way be led to inflict injury, nor easily be driven to retaliate.</p>
      <p>If you write to the prince, do so, by the immortal God; remember Robert Scinner and Andrew Wullock, most excellent men, with honor. I am not speaking of the preface to the book (although that would be most pleasing to us), but of a private letter to the prince: in this I would like everyone to understand that I have given you the greatest thanks for your kindness to me. I neither ask nor wish at all that you request anything else than that they hold us in their commendation.</p>
      <p>Above all, I would like the just and legitimate praise of his father, a most excellent and holy man, to be added to Alexander's commendation by the testimony of your voice; which will indeed be most beneficial to his affairs and studies. You can do this with a clear conscience, and also with great praise for the young man. If you send the book to us (as I hope you will), we will deliver it to Trehern, our greatest patron; he is constantly at the king's court with this prince, and he takes care of your affairs, and indeed also ours, with no less concern than his own. But I leave all this to your judgment and prudence. You have, I hope, sufficient material to praise the prince. He is a most ample counselor of the king, and born of royal lineage: he is especially learned and a devotee of the gospel, a hammer of the papists, and a man who loves your church dearly. I send the title to you again, in this exact form: Heinrich Gray, Marquess of Dorset; Lord Ferrers of Groby, Harington, Bonville, and Astley, royal counselor, etc. This is now the title of the named lord; thus he gave it to me himself in London. Change nothing, add nothing to it.</p>
      <p>Unless you wish to add the prince's name; this will be entirely free and up to you.</p>
      <p>Concerning Heinrich Ludlaeus of Warwick, I have nothing more certain than that he is very dangerously ill. I am still expecting his chaplain daily. Believe this for certain, that you will do him a most pleasing service if you write to both of them together. However, I do not have his full title known: nor do I think it matters much; for you can always write something of your studies to him later, which perhaps will be more pleasing to both. So much for this.</p>
      <p>Among the French, Scots, and English, there is complete agreement. The people of Devon have been pacified to their great harm. The Irish make themselves conform in all things to the English. Boulogne, a maritime city, has been returned; an annual tribute is paid by the French: it is said that the envoys and hostages of the English have brought here sixteen hundred thousand crowns, from which now everyone hopes the English currency will be renewed and purified.</p>
      <p>A good part of the bishops now rightly understand all religion. Our Huperus, who was in Zurich, was made a bishop on the day of the Lord's Ascension. The king's uncle, the Duke of Somerset, gave his opinion in the council, with almost all the bishops opposing. I hear much controversy on both sides about the ceremonies and the attire of the priests, - I would have said of actors and fools. Finally, Hopperus won the case; I have not seen nor heard a man from Switzerland, and especially from your church, speak more piously and humanely. Our schools here flourish with the most useful lectures and disputations. I have dedicated the morning time to Galen and Aristotle, yet in such a way that I refer everything I learn to theology alone. Know that I am most closely connected to Peter Martyr, not as a disciple, but as a son; for I both listen to him willingly and also greatly embrace his own sweetness. I am with him for whole hours, so that there is no need for any recommendation ever again. If you wish to read any of Peter's lectures or disputations, I will send them to you; for I have all of them written down and corrected by Martyr. Farewell, most excellent man. In Oxford, hastening on the 5th day before the calends of June 1550.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johannes von Ulm. To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and patron, to be especially respected.</p>
