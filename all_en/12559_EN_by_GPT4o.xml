    <p xml:id="regest1">The news about [Sebastian] Schertlin and the gold of the Pope [Paul III] proved to be false.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The nobleman [Hans Ludwig] von Mülinen set out for Kempten with horses and a servant [...] (provided to him by his relative [Ludwig] von Reischach). However, he was not admitted there. When he came to the Salem Monastery, he encountered about 200 carousing soldiers and young monks, and also met nobles he knew. The latter remarked that they would rather march with Emperor [Charles V] to Hungary than against the [Schmalkaldic League], whom they feared. Consider the significance of these words!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The behavior of the Five Places is annoying. They are said to be gathered in Beckenried. If only what Myconius previously wished for them would happen! Bullinger should continue to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- From Strasbourg, it is reported that an army of 25,000 men is advancing from Belgium against the [Schmalkaldic League]. Hopefully, [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse has fortified his territory well for an attack before he left!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In [Basel], there is a Mömpelgarder [...], who is mustering in the surrounding area (but not in Basel itself). The mercenaries are being sent to Strasbourg, probably to Count [George of Württemberg], the brother of Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg suffers from melancholy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should recommend the bearer [...] of the present letter to Konrad Gessner. He should keep his promise. Myconius sends his regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The hesitation of the [Protestant Confederates] could have dire consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Myconius writes [letters], but should be working!</p>

      <p>S. What I said about Schertlin and the Pope's gold, I understand to be false; which grieves me.</p>

      <p>This is certain: The nobleman von Mülinen was on his way to Kempten, to whom his relative von Reischach had given both horses and a servant. However, he could not gain entry there. He then came to the Salem Monastery. He found about two hundred soldiers there, drinking heavily, and young monks drinking and pouring bravely. He approached the nobles he knew there, who all unanimously confessed in this way: "When the Emperor leads us to Hungary, we are all lively and cheerful. But when we think about where he wants to lead us back, our hearts and courage fail." Consider what these words mean! Let us pray that we have a sound mind in a sound and strong body.</p>

      <p>I am indeed very annoyed by the behavior of the Five Places. I wish, as I once wanted, if there were an opportunity. They say they are gathered in Beckenried. If you learn anything, please explain.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Yesterday I learned from Strasbourg that an army of 25,000 is coming against us from Belgium. If this is true, I wonder why Hesse leaves his homeland so far, unless perhaps he has everything fortified behind him so that he need not fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is a man from Mömpelgard here, who is recruiting soldiers, not from Basel, but from outside. He sends them to Strasbourg, I believe to Count, the brother of Duke of Württemberg. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg suffers from melancholy, evidently because nothing has proceeded from his mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The bearer of this letter is going to visit Mr. Konrad Gessner. Please recommend the man to him. And tell him to keep his promise; for he knows what he has promised me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Greet him as well.</p>

      <p>Good people fear that the delays our people are using will turn out badly for us. However, I hope, because they have the Lord in their sights, they will not stray in their plans.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord. I should study, but my temptation drives me to write. Basel, July 24, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myco.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
