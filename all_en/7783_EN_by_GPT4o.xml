      <p>Greetings. The scarcity of new matters and the uncertainty, if there are any, make us more brief, most esteemed man. Would that everything were as well as everything is persistently silent!</p>
      <p>I think it is most false what is reported about the conscription of the Italian army; for recently Mr. Lentulus of Naples wrote to me and plainly affirmed that he has nothing, whom, however, if there were anything, it would perhaps not escape his notice. But the Italians report that the Alban has recently removed about 58 noble men under the pretext of treason and high treason, and also attempted to send over 2000 horsemen to the King of France for assistance, but was restrained and terrified by the arrival of a certain more equipped Danish army. Who that Dane is or the lord neighboring Denmark, who might join either Condé or others from the Condéian party, is unknown to me. However, it is reported as if for certain, as I learned from our Mr. Bonetto. We will gladly hear what the Baden assembly will bring us. Would that everything be peacefully settled among those who prefer war to peace.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consuls and all the brothers send their greetings to your lordship. Farewell, most illustrious man, forever.</p>
      <p>Quickly, Chur, 1569, February 14.</p>
      <p>Your lordship's most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
