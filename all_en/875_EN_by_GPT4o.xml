      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I would have sent the book on weights and measures by Agricola long ago, which I have at home; but the rainy weather has hindered my plan. However, if I come across a courier in clear weather, I will send it, and I thank you for the book you sent. Continue to write such books for the Lord, which make the church, more troubled than it should be, better than any apologies. The Saxon church is disturbed and afflicted both by the papists and by false brothers. Flacius wrote a letter against Philipp Melanchthon, which I think you have seen and read, in which he disputes about adiaphora. Philipp has completely changed and begins to accuse Luther and criticize his vehemence. Duke Maurice is fortifying Wittenberg, bringing the best cannons there and wants to place soldiers; he will send the school to Rochlitz.</p>
      <p>But what this means, the Lord knows. The poor man fears where there is no fear, or he is tormented by a guilty conscience day and night. Gumpenberger, who seeks the provostship of the main church, threatens our senate with something unknown; he has allied himself with certain nobles in Franconia, who wish to bring all evils upon us unless they expel the other provost.</p>
      <p>Believe me, everything tends towards a cruel war. Dr. Beatus Gerardus has been ordered again by the Strasbourg senate to preach at St. Thomas, and the other brothers fear some evil will be stirred up by this man; otherwise, they are still very steadfast. It is said that the Emperor wants to go to Augsburg after the Ascension Day festival.</p>
      <p>If only he would ascend to the heavens; for he has afflicted the church of Christ enough and still oppresses it with wondrous arts through his followers, who want to impose the kingdom of the Antichrist on everyone. Isengrinius the printer is in danger because of Gwalther's pamphlet on the Antichrist, which someone translated into Italian, and our senate has forbidden him to sell any. Farewell. More soon. Basel, 1550, April 2. Greet Dr. Theodor with Pellican and the other brothers with their wives and children.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>If you can conveniently, I would like you to buy me the best Glarean cherries, or instruct Dr. Johann Frisius to do so.</p>
      <p>To the honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
