      <p>S. P. Regarding the controversy raised at our last chapter between us and the one from Ulm, my lord Bullinger, I am compelled to write to you again and defend our side against those who slander us, as if we were neglecters of discipline, procrastinators of examination, and avoiders of the general synod. Thus, some think of us, whether it be the one from Ulm, Lutmerctius, or others.</p>
      <p>However, we clearly testify that they are liars and corrupters and deserters of our fraternal concord and charity. For the rashness, pride, and audacity of our man from Ulm have troubled us, as he went to you in Zürich without our consent, order, or advice, and poured out many things before you concerning synodal matters, as if the doctrine of the Lord's word were being coldly managed. He is a despiser of the simple and a man of great arrogance, boasting somewhat of his expertise, not considering the apostle's opinion, who said... to be puffed up, but to be edified by charity. He has not been with us for two years, and yet he dared so much in a common cause, raising his crests, while I and the other brothers have been in concord for twenty years, and no one ever presumed to do anything without the consent of all the brothers, as he did in such an ecclesiastical matter. If... he were to acquiesce, as he now hopes through you, as if he has his patrons, defenders, commanders, and instigators, he will proceed with his plans, you will soon see where this man is heading, namely to the corruption and disintegration of our chapter. Therefore, my lord Bullinger, do not give him faith in everything, and if there is any sin in my writings against you, as I understood from the mouth of the one from Ulm, where I do not think you to be such a man who would want to think otherwise of me than what a learned man should think of a humble brother, but if you were incited against me and for what reasons of writings, you would like to communicate with the present brothers, messengers, or mouth to mouth, if writing to me would be tedious, as if I were unworthy, that a man of such authority and dignity would write to one worthy of all contempt. But because you understood from my letters the rashness of this man, certainly... that... he alone grieved the province, not only imposing on us pastors but also on other churches, which even the peasants and laypeople do not bear with an even mind, namely to set our adversaries of religion over us like a wolf over sheep, to be censors of life and doctrine, of which they themselves are the most experienced enemies, and to impose great expenses and costs on us, who do not have such ample benefits as he boasts of having, as some brothers have spoken of him. And to suppress suspicion, so as not to burden you with many things, those brothers of ours will amplify the rest to you and make you much more certain, so that from this you can gather what should be thought of that man, and that no spur be added to him by you, who perhaps announces to you something other than the truth of things. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>He is a haughty, eager spirit, who clings to the nobles and landvogts (bailiffs), wants to fly with them, observes the faults of others, does not see his own, as if there were no one to govern his church but him, and yet he has the greatest enmity from his subjects, and as learned as he thinks he is, his learning and preaching are not agreeable to everyone. Therefore, we also want you to believe us and not allow him to undertake his unjust plans.</p>
      <p>It is buzzing around him.</p>
      <p>Given on October 18, 1557.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus Sartorius, minister of the church in Dießenhofen. To the most honorable man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zürich, to his own hands.</p>
