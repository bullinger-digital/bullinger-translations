    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's obvious affection towards him makes him revere Bullinger all the more; he understands Bullinger's opinion on double censorship and asks for divine assistance in decision-making; it is not possible to find the same solution for all states and churches - Bullinger should pray with them for good judgment and the spirit of divine wisdom. Now supports Bibliander's endeavor, as Luther's name is not to be mentioned; prays that Bullinger's actions against [Johannes] Cochläus may be successful. Welcomes Bullinger's intention to dedicate his commentary on Luke to Hans Welser, even though he does not understand Latin; the former mayor Wolfgang Rehlinger understands some Latin, but his evangelical disposition is doubtful, and he is considering moving, so a dedication is not worthwhile; Welser, on the other hand, is a faithful and popular man. New Year's wishes and greetings, especially to [Diethelm] and [Jakob] Röist. [Enclosure:] [Konrad Zwick] was very surprised that Bullinger learned about his matter [a "military art"], but he has allowed him to confirm that this art is present in Konstanz, however, his name should remain undisclosed. Agrees that the matter should be kept secret. He wants to ensure and avoid that Zwick, out of his goodness, reveals the matter, especially now that King [Ferdinand] and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] have contacted him. Zwick should therefore be obliged not to reveal his art to them for the time being, which would probably be best done through the French [King Francis I] or a Swiss location. Since the Emperor [Charles V] is preparing another major attack against [Francis I] - the consequences for the Confederation in the event of a victory would be unimaginable - it would be more important for the French that the Emperor does not come into possession of the military art than to poach his captains. Thus, Zwick would be at an advantage and his art would remain secret; Bullinger should help quietly in the negotiations. If negotiations were to take place with [Francis I], this must be kept secret from the Imperialists, as they would otherwise also negotiate with Zwick. Blarer's and Zwick's names should not be mentioned in negotiations. A prominent man at the royal court wants to personally benefit from this matter; Bullinger should ask God to protect Zwick from a misstep, he is too good-natured. [Simon] Grynaeus also made a similar invention, which hopefully died with him; he said he did not trust the princes, but would pass the art on to an imperial city. The messenger is already paid. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Your utmost faith and charity towards us, venerable and most esteemed Bullinger, as I gather more and more from the clearest evidence, I embrace and kiss with all my heart.</p>
      <p>I now understand your opinion on what should be decided, held, endured, and followed in both censures, and I will pray to the Lord, as faithfully as I can, that He may not allow us to stray even a hair's breadth from His will. Here, even in our age, the judgments of the greatest men vary, and different things are suitable for different cities and churches, and what is excessive for some is barely enough for others, so I see the need for the most exact judgment and the spirit of divine wisdom, which you will never cease to implore with us.</p>
      <p>I do not disapprove of our Theodore's efforts, but rather wish to support them in every way, now that I hear Luther's name is suppressed; for this alone I feared, that it might cause inconvenience in many ways. As for what you are planning against Cochläus, I pray to Christ that you may succeed most happily.</p>
      <p>The plan to dedicate your most splendid commentaries on Luke to Johann Welser pleases me greatly, and I have no doubt that you will gain great favor with this truly pious man, even though he does not understand Latin. There are many Rehlingers in Augsburg, but Wolfgang Rehlinger, who was consul three years ago and whom I think was with you, is moderately learned in Latin, but is considered by many good people to be a very cunning fox and not sincerely seeking Christ, and he is already planning to move elsewhere if he gets the chance. Therefore, I do not think you will achieve anything by dedicating it to him. Welser, however, is a man who is very favorable to the cause of Christ and is truly worthy of being revered by all good people.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul, in Christ Jesus, the eternal Word of the Father, who wishes you, your wife, and all your dear ones the happiest beginnings of the new year and every heavenly blessing, which all my people wish for you, whom you will lovingly greet in my words, especially Consul Röist with his son, etc. Farewell again and again. January 5, 1544.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
      <p>I read your letter on the last page to my dear cousin; he was very surprised that the matter came to your attention and would like to know through whom it reached you; I have concealed everything.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, he has agreed to inform you that such an art is present here in Konstanz and that it has been examined and recognized as completely certain and just by some experienced in war, as I myself can well believe from excellent reasons. However, he has asked me not to mention his name for the time being; therefore, if you write to me further about this, please keep his name silent.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I understand that we both agree on everything, namely that the matter is dangerous, that we should pray to God and keep in mind that this matter should not be revealed to the Emperor, King, princes, or others, that their good words and promises should not be believed, but that we should wait until God, through a common or special necessity of His own (which we daily expect), brings this matter to light.</p>
      <p>And since it is very important that the art does not become public, I would really like to help find means and ways to prevent its disclosure. Therefore, I would like to hear your advice and good opinion. For although I can rightly trust my cousin with all good things, yet he and we are all human, and since the King and Landgrave are in negotiations with him, I must worry for several reasons that he might be misled and, as has happened to many others, be deceived.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have thought that it would be good to find a way for my cousin to commit not to reveal this art to the Emperor and King Ferdinand for at least a few years; for if this were achieved with him, he would then abandon all other negotiations and let the matter rest, which otherwise would hardly happen with requests and admonitions. But I truly know no one who could handle this matter more fruitfully than the French or perhaps a commune in the Confederation.</p>
      <p>For it is known what the Emperor plans against the French, and as I have now been written, he accepts everything that wants to wage war, and he intends to attack the French with four forces violently, and as strong as he is, to delay all dealings with smooth, flattering words until he defeats the French, and it is also well to assume that if he succeeds, what he would undertake against a Confederation, so it seems to me that it would be much more necessary for the French to prevent their adversaries from getting such an art into their hands than to bribe the Emperor's captains with great wealth and money and bring them to themselves, with other similar things, etc.</p>
      <p>So I have thought that if my cousin could benefit himself through such a way and yet the art would remain secret, he might be able to manage this matter in the best possible way. If you also think it would be good to undertake such a course of action, and you could further and learn something with the French or otherwise, you could do so and let me know such, or if you think it should be handled in another way or through other persons, so that nothing is wasted. May God grant grace and favor that all plans serve His honor!</p>
      <p>But if something should reach the French regarding this matter, it must be kept completely quiet and secret; for if the Imperialists were to find out that the French knew about the matter, they would, as can be entirely expected, deal with my cousin all the more miserably and forestall the others.</p>
      <p>Also, you are most urgently requested, if you wish to handle or mention this matter in writing or orally with anyone, not to mention either my cousin's or my name in it.</p>
      <p>Consider the matter diligently and with invocation of God's grace and spirit; for it will certainly be of great importance. I know that there will be no rest in this matter and that every day more efforts and dealings will occur; for I know a prominent man at the King's court who is very eager in this matter and also hopes to gain great favor and thanks for himself. Therefore, I am very anxious about the matter, wishing perhaps that I knew nothing about it at all. Pray to God earnestly for my cousin, that He may preserve him and not let him go astray; for these are truly, in my opinion, difficult and slippery matters. I consider him a man of God and of great understanding; but great people sometimes do great improprieties, although I know him to be innocent of greed, and if he had a hundred tons of gold, I do not doubt he would use it all for the common good and the promotion of good things. But this might make him all the more easily misled if he finds himself innocent in his conscience and thus disposed, that he does not seek his own, but the common welfare. I do not need to write everything I know. May God protect him and us all, and not lead us into temptation; great offers and promises are present around this matter, and flesh and blood are a deceiver.</p>
      <p>The pious Grynaeus also knew something similar; I hope it died with him; he said to me he did not trust the princes' willfulness, but he was considering revealing it to an imperial city; for they would not start a war, but only think of protecting themselves and their own from unjust violence. I do not know if this art is the same as his or comes from there or not; it is a terrible thing. May God arrange everything according to grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>You should not give any drink money or messenger fee for this letter; I have taken care of it.</p>
      <p>To the dear Christian lord Röist and his son, and also to his wife, please convey many services, good wishes, and greetings from me, wishing them many gracious, faithful, and patient years with all good things; I desire their faithful, believing intercession.</p>
      <p>Given on the fifth of January, 1544.</p>
