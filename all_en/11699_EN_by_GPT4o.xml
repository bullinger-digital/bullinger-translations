    <p xml:id="regest1">Last summer, Theodor Bibliander handed over the Turkish law, called the Quran, along with an accompanying Turkish history to Oporin for printing - not because the Zurich printers had not accepted it, but because Oporin helped him procure text templates. However, it is now heard that in Basel, some do not want to allow the printing of such an unchristian book. In Basel, as well as elsewhere, many books have already been printed - for the benefit of the Church - in which heresies are described and refuted, as is the case in the writings of Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Augustine; books with pagan, Jewish, and other false teachings are also tolerated, as they serve as a warning to Christians. The teachings of Mohammed and Turkish history are essential to church history; Christians learn much from them about the seduction to apostasy and about Antichristianity and are strengthened in their resistance against the Turks. Christians have previously spread the Quran to counter error, and nothing else is intended with this edition. Since Basel cannot suffer any harm from it, the Zurich theologians ask not to prevent the work but rather to promote it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, esteemed, prudent, and wise Lord Mayor and gracious, dear gentlemen, our willing service is always ready for your wisdom, which we also urgently request, that you kindly listen to our proposal and accept it favorably from us.</p>
      <p>This past summer, our beloved lord and brother Theodor Bibliander, a faithful lecturer (teacher) of the Holy Scripture in the church of Zurich, with great effort and labor, and not without our knowledge, prepared the Turkish law, called "the Quran," from the best copies, with an added, very useful and diligent Turkish history, for printing and handed it over to Mr. Oporin; not because our printers had not accepted such a book for printing, but because the mentioned Mr. Oporin had provided some copies and assisted Mr. Bibliander. However, once such a book was printed, we heard that some disputes and doubts arose among you, whereby some want to believe that the mentioned book is entirely detrimental to the Christian faith and the holy church, and therefore it should not be allowed to be printed from the renowned city of Basel, etc.</p>
      <p>And although we know thoroughly that your wisdom does not lack knowledge of such matters, we still want to remind you from a very good heart that if the mentioned book is printed in your honorable city, it does not harm the Christian faith and the Christian church, nor does it undertake anything new or unusual from you, but rather promotes a useful, good work. For it is well known to you that books have been printed in your city of Basel, containing no less impurity and heresy than is contained in the Quran. For Irenaeus, the holy martyr and bishop, the excellent Tertullian, the holy teacher of the church Augustine have made books and have very explicitly expressed therein terrible and godless heresies from article to article. Books have been printed - not only in your city but everywhere throughout Christendom - containing the beliefs and false opinions of the heathens in the books of philosophers and poets, also the Jewish faith, and shameful blasphemies; books written about all kinds of superstitions are printed and read, all of which are no less erroneous and evil than the beliefs of Mohammed. Since such books are all tolerated so that Christians are warned against error and understand what is Christian or unchristian, why should the Quran not also be tolerated for the same reason? For the holy teachers and bishops have not only endeavored to present true teachings but also to report the grossest errors, also to express them clearly, and then to refute them; all of which is now also used in and with the mentioned Quran.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the teachings of Mohammed and the Turkish history are not a small part of the history of the church, useful and necessary to know how the ancient churches fell away, through which they were seduced, whereby one also learns how to guard against such seduction and how every honest Christian should strengthen himself in the fall of the Turks in the Christian faith. One also learns a good part of the Antichristianity from this. Seeing this, pious Christians, under what unchristian, deceitful, shameful beliefs those must live who submit to the Turks. Thereby Christians are encouraged (strengthened) to pray more earnestly against the Turks and to resist them more bravely.</p>
      <p>Since the mentioned book did not first appear in your city, but many years ago and also recently by honorable, holy, and Christian people, who spread it in the church and among the people, but only to counter error, and we know thoroughly that it is now printed with no other intention, since we cannot think that any harm can arise from it for you, our friendly admonition and urgent request is that you do not prevent such a fruitful work, but rather, as we trust you with all good, promote it much more. If we could then do something to please you with our poor services, yet willing hearts and good faith, we would not spare it.</p>
      <p>With this, we ask you to accept this writing of ours as a friendly intention from us, for we have written it to you in good faith and all honesty. May God faithfully keep you in His will and protection.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, August 26, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your entirely willing servants, pastors, preachers, lecturers, servants of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise gentlemen Adelberg Meyer, mayor, and council of Basel, their gracious, beloved lords.</p>
