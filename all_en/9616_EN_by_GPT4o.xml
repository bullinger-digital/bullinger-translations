      <p>Most revered father, today I received your letter along with the recommendation of Mr. Lentulus's book, for which both of us express our deepest gratitude. I will send him this illustrious, albeit brief, testimony of yours, and I know he will express his abundant thanks to you. In return, we share with you what we have from Italy and other places. Yesterday, concerning the affairs of the Belgians, almost the same things you wrote to me were reported orally and in writing by Limacis Laurentii's brother, who has the daughter of the late consul Tscharner as his wife here. Alas, how everything changes! Who does not see the fate of tyrants at the doorstep? Nero once said: "This is loyalty." Agathon wisely said that a prince or king must remember three things: 1. that he rules over men, 2. that he rules according to laws, 3. that he will not always rule. If only the lilies would think and flourish in this way. It is strange that nothing certain is reported about our soldiers being led out. I see some hovering around, whispering these things. Many are eagerly waiting with open mouths for when the soldiers will be summoned, and I do not think any legal barriers will be so strong that lust and hunger will not break through everything. If we remain silent, we betray and harm our brothers; if we speak against it, we expose ourselves to all dangers. For we painfully realize what gifts can do, especially at this time. Forgive me, I beg you, if I always sprinkle something about Gantner. Yesterday I visited Mr. Pontisella, who is gravely ill. As I was returning home, his son accompanied me, and when I asked him what had recently happened in the senate with Gantner, I heard that Gantner is now prepared to accept our confession and even approve it with an oath; he only asks not to be compelled by oath to the completion of the communion; in other matters, he will satisfy everyone and surpass others in duties. He said that consul Willi had dealt more leniently and gently with this man after hearing these promises, and whatever he promised here, it was hoped that Mr. Campello could succeed again; if he were reinstated, I would not tolerate such a person nor preach alongside him; hence, on this occasion, he could creep into my place, and another could succeed him. Behold, most reverend father, the thoughts, arts, fears, and anxieties of these men; they do not know what they should do, what they should plan and scheme, to occupy this church under the guise of repentance, which they will then handle and overturn according to their desires. Meanwhile, they create various dangers for me, lay traps, attack me with slanders, defame, denounce, and move every stone to make the senate and people more alienated from me day by day, and finally, harassed by false accusations, I may be forced to abandon my post and become burdensome and ungrateful to you. They direct and gather all their concerns here and openly gather in public places to confer their plans, which certainly cannot happen without the approval of the majority of the senate, as there is no one who wishes to even touch upon these conspiracies with a word, let alone prevent them. The younger Pontisella also said that he often encounters Gantner and his accomplices, and recently Gantner said he gladly reads Calvin's books but is nauseated by those of the Zurichers; for when he reads even two, he still does not know the meaning or what they intend. Immortal God, if I were not a Zürcher, perhaps this most arrogant and hate-filled man would not vomit these things against your holy labors and vigils. Thus, with these goads, he aptly approaches his Marius. See how truly he offers to accept our confession, who is nauseated by the writings of the Zurichers and receives and defames them with all mockery. It is possible that the one who reported this to me orally yesterday wanted to incite and inflame me against Gantner so that he might better achieve what he hopes for; for they seem to be rivals in outward appearance; but inwardly and in reality, they agree; hence such mutual familiarity. Gantner also lets his hair grow back in the summer, which he has shaved off in the winter and becomes a shorn boy, as he has declared, no longer to burden the church, but to be a layman. Forgive me for bothering you with these matters.</p>
      <p>All friends greet you, especially Campellus. We have not yet received anything from Simler's writings.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from Chur, Rhaetia, March 29, 1574. May Mr. Erni be safe."</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Grossmünster.</p>
