    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns the opinion [of the Zurichers] for Baron [Balthasar von Kuenring] and is pleased with their agreement to his own stance. Hears nothing about Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg; Thomas [Blarer] has only reported that the new church order is now in the hands of [Johannes] Brenz. Bullinger has already learned everything about the concord with Luther from Capito; he has shown [in Konstanz] Luther's response to a letter from the Augsburgers. Zwick knows that Bullinger does not expect any money for the dedication [of his commentary on] four Pauline epistles. Promises intercession for the preservation of Pellikan, Leo [Juda], Theodor [Bibliander], and Bullinger from the plague and includes recipes recommended by Doctor [Johann] Menlishofer. Inquires about a [preacher] who could be made available to the Baron and asks if the latter has met [Ludwig] Carinus in Zurich. Sends greetings and good wishes.</p>

      <p>Salvation through Christ.</p>
      <p>I send back your judgment given to the baron; and I am very pleased with it. I am glad to hear that my opinion pleased you, although perhaps I may have seemed too anxious to you. But I wrote everything with diligence.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing about the Duke of Württemberg. Ambrosius's brother, Thomas, recently returned from his domain, bringing nothing further about the matter of religion, except that the established order of the church cause is now in the hands of Brenz. Do not trust anyone rashly, I will always keep you informed about all matters.</p>
      <p>You have everything about the concord with Luther from Capito. He showed us his letter, in which he responds to the Augsburgers. However, he did not show the letter from the Augsburgers. But may the concord be happy and auspicious!</p>
      <p>It is pleasing that you have inscribed the four Pauline epistles for us, but it was also a joke and laughter for me if I wrote anything about the angels; for as we know you seek nothing of the sort, so we know most of all that you seek nothing of the sort from us, who could provide nothing less.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you ask for the Lord to be interceded for you by us. We will do this with the whole church, and may we pray that, while the plague reigns among you, it does not invade those to whom the keys of the church have been given. May the Lord protect Pellikan, Leo, Theodor, and especially you, and may He not punish us with the injury of the kingdom of Christ. We will pray privately and publicly diligently with all good people. And so that you feel our care for you, we have seriously discussed with Doctor Menlishofer, so that he may note something good for you and other dear brothers. He has now done this. I send you here noted on a slip: they will comply with it. But it is about a water therein, which my brother wanted to send you, and if it comes over, it is spoiled; therefore, they need the triacle for the water. Also, I have otherwise written down a powder for you and let the doctor read it beforehand. He says it is very good (very effective). So now try what God grants you; thereafter let them care for it. Yet may He protect and shield you, and that for the sake of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>You know what that most courteous man, the baron, spoke with you about, and how he desires a learned but notably modest minister of the word, whom he could appoint over his people. He wrote from Zurich that he would send me money for travel expenses, and, oh good God, I have no such person at hand; indeed there would be, but the churches should not be despoiled. Do all you can, my Bullinger, so that we do not fail such a good man, if perhaps Christ could also be known among his people. As soon as someone suitable for this function comes to your mind, let me know. May the Lord send workers into His harvest. Amen. Then please indicate whether that Carinus, whom you perhaps know by name, has been with you and met that baron. For his sake, when he was recently with you, he had decided to travel to Zurich.</p>
      <p>But farewell with your whole house and all good people, especially Pellikan. Your wife and mother send me many good wishes, and they are comforted: When God is with us, who can harm us? We will pray to God with utmost earnestness for you. May He also keep His hand over you with all His grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, September 3, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
