      <p>Greetings. Your letters were most welcome to me (most esteemed one), both because of the sympathy they show in my adversities and because of your devotion and truly paternal love towards me, which I have now clearly perceived. Two weeks after I sent my previous letters to you, I received letters from England, which declare that I am completely deprived, as was previously explained, but nevertheless, some hope now appears from elsewhere. Therefore, I thought it right to inform you of this as soon as possible, so that just as you previously felt sorrow on my behalf, you may now give thanks to God our Father with me: whom I do not doubt you have prayed with me and commended me and my cause to.</p>
      <p>And regarding Bancho, I have great reason to thank you. For Leverus (our dearest brother) showed me that Mr. Sulser has arranged for me to send Bancho (to the Frankfurt Fair) to Basel: for he met a certain Parchus (I think a printer) with whom he will place Bancho.</p>
      <p>I would say more, but I am suddenly interrupted by the messenger, who will carry these immediately early in the morning. Therefore, I ask you to take this in the spirit you are accustomed to with all my matters. For I thought it better to send this now rather than nothing, lest we cause you more pain and anxiety than is fitting; because not only from your letters have I perceived, but I have also understood from others, about the diligent care you had decided to undertake if this did not succeed for Bancho. May God preserve you for a long time for the benefit of His church and the consolation of many.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 8, 1555. Your most devoted, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and esteemed (in Christ) father, Mr. Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
