    <p xml:id="regest1">Leo [Jud], Theodor [Bibliander], and Bullinger himself have attempted to appease the Bernese with letters regarding the [Communion] confession. Myconius can gather more details about the meeting in Konstanz from the transcript of [No. 496]. A reminder to remain faithful in the face of impending persecutions. He defends himself against accusations of accepting a bathhouse and excessive wine consumption. Greetings and a request for news.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Our Leo [Jud] responded to the letter of the Bernese, Theodor [Bibliander] responded, and I also responded. Leo showed that there is nothing in the entire confession that cannot be found in the books of our Zwingli, and for this reason, he cites several passages. Theodor certainly proves that the confession is entirely consistent with itself, never contradicting itself. I explain the reasoning of how we discussed the Eucharist, and thus how we refute with our words those things that the Bernese thought they derived from us. Everything is more extensive than what could be written back. However, we hope that our brothers will be appeased by these things.</p>
      <p>Moreover, you will learn what was done at the meeting in Konstanz from the transcript of the letter that the brothers of the 8 cities of Swabia sent to us. May God grant that we may someday unite in holy and true concord.</p>
      <p>You see, my brother, how storms of persecution threaten us from all sides. Some report dire things from France. Some, eager for something, promise themselves something about the emperor's endeavors. We can have no doubt about the conspiracy of bishops and abbots. What then? "The grace of the Lord is sufficient for us. For power is made perfect in weakness" [2 Cor 12:9]. "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake" [Mt 5:10]. And "he who endures to the end will be saved" [Mt 10:22; 24:13]. But the truth of the Lord is immortal. Let us therefore watch, pray, and encourage our churches to constancy and strength of faith, lest the saints fall asleep and be absorbed by negligence when the Lord comes to punish the ingratitude, crimes, and contempt of the divine of our Germany.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and refresh me with your letters.</p>
      <p>But listen, I hear that someone reported to you that while I was bathing in the Urdorf baths in the summer with Zwicky, Pellican, and other pious and good men, I accepted a gift from the impious and pensioners, and then filled myself with wine to such an extent that it offended the pious. Know, therefore, that whoever it was, a frivolous man reported a shameless lie. For good men and pious citizens, whose names I can provide if you ask, honored the whole company with a gift. Among them, very few were not sincerely favorable to the gospel. Furthermore, no one lives today who has ever seen me either staggering or buried in wine. Therefore, do not rashly believe such informers, indeed I know you did not believe any of this about me. Otherwise, I think, you would have warned your most loving brother in a letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and love me. For I am entirely yours.</p>
      <p>January 10, 1535.</p>
      <p>I wish well to our common father, Carolostadt, and the other brothers. And if you have any certain news from France, the Chatti, or the Cherusci, let me know.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most prudent and vigilant pastor of the church of Basel, dearest brother.</p>
