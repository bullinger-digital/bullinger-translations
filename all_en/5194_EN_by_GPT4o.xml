      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, esteemed lord and dearest brother, along with Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>I deeply regret the situation of the most excellent and learned man and do not cease to pray to the Lord for his well-being; I regret that the fault of one very insignificant man has caused such a delay in our expectations. However, the Lord thus compels us to fervent prayers and shows us what to expect from the flesh. Let us diligently pray to the Lord, that He may have mercy on that wretched man and sustain and promote His cause. I would have already sent you Beza's letters, had I not sent them to our Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The noble Hartmann von Hallwil was most indignant that the messenger received a thaler from you, and I do not doubt that he has now thrown him into prison; he earnestly requested that I excuse him to you, lest you think he did not sufficiently provide the messenger with travel expenses. "I provided not stingily," he says, "but liberally; however, that vile rascal used deceit, which could not have caused me greater indignation than it did with that man, to whom I wish to be recommended as of better reputation." For I know that you are singularly loved and esteemed by him, about which he often speaks with me. Therefore, my lord and brother, let that illustrious man understand that I have defended and excused his reputation with you. He sent the thaler to me and instructed me to send it to you immediately, which I am sending here.</p>
      <p>I hope you have received my letters along with Hesshus's book, which I had received from Heidelberg along with letters to be transmitted to you; I sent them to Bern to Haller as well as these, to which I added those I received from Poland. They send me a confession, which if they make with a sincere mind, I congratulate them, and unless I had thought a similar one was sent to you as well, I would have shared mine with you. If any news, whether fortunate or unfortunate, is announced from France, I pray you send it to us.</p>
      <p>The good people among us fear that Navarre will subject himself and the kingdom to the Council of Trent. The brothers greet you; greet the brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time!</p>
      <p>I send to your kindness my response opposed to Brentius's opinion. I pray that you freely tell me, unless this is troublesome to you, what you think of this little work of mine. Again and again, farewell. The last day of February in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
