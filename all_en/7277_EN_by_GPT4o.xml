      <p>S. D. What I received from Bern the day before, I share so that you may share it with Mr. Charles and greet him in my name as warmly as possible, especially Mr. Mayor Willi and the other councilors. The Solothurn assembly has also concluded. On the 7th day, namely the 5th, also Fribourg and Solothurn, have agreed to march; they would have liked to have been allowed to march with 6000 and under better conditions. Glarus has not agreed, wanting to first consult the communities. Basel did not send anyone in the previous campaign, nor do they want to send anyone now.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen has declined, not wanting to send anyone. Appenzell is also in doubt; they do not want to march against the French. It is said that it is not about religion; but others say otherwise. Those in the 5 places cannot keep it to themselves; they are exceedingly heated. May God grant that this matter is resolved amicably, and may the pious Confederates look out for themselves, so that they do not march against themselves. In the imperial war, the emperor consistently claimed it was not about religion; rather, they wanted to make some disobedient princes obedient. However, the matter turned out differently in the end; for the disobedience was due to religion. Thus, if Cond√© and the admiral accept the Council of Trent, they would not be disobedient. All the adversity in France comes from the Guises, whose head is the Cardinal of Lorraine. They did not shed enough blood in the previous war; more blood must still be shed. May God bring them to peace and keep us all in His grace.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Pontisella, Ganthner, etc. Zurich, 27th October 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich and Bern forbid marching with honor, life, and property.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the mandate was forbidden here at the pulpit, although otherwise no one is eager, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my kind and dear lord and brother. [C]hur.</p>
