      <p>Greetings. I received the money through your fellow citizen along with the letters, and I will diligently take care of everything through that Jacob, the Parisian bookseller, whom our printers are expecting at any moment. If he does not come, as you request, I will consider another plan, which I will first discuss with you and await your opinion on it. Regarding the son of Brother Rhetus, I wish I could promise something certain, as I would sincerely like to serve the most pious man, both for the sake of our common ministry and your recommendation. However, I am unable to do so due to the daily influx of students coming to us from all directions, and even from Rhetia itself, who wish to be supported by public funds.</p>
      <p>Some of them are supported by the academy, some by trivial school stipends, while others live on their own means, waiting for the opportunity to succeed those who leave the regular order. And if he were here, I would certainly not fail him, provided the opportunity and means are available, and the young man proves himself with talent and piety. But since the opportunity I mentioned is uncertain for us, I do not know if the brother can bear the expenses to support his son here temporarily; for just these days, the son of a deceased minister, recommended to us by the clergy of Chur, has come, who lives on his own under similar conditions, waiting to obtain public support. However, I do not approve of the practice here, as well as among my Bernese, of considering only the natives and neglecting the newcomers, to whom some portion of support should be given. Furthermore, I am seeking advice regarding your relative from Rinfeld, and I will do my utmost, if the Lord grants it, to ensure you understand that I have not lacked the will to do well by you; but in this matter, we also need an opportunity, which I would have had in my hands a few months ago if the business had been settled then. We are receiving no news at all now, except that wars are expected everywhere in Germany, which, already greatly worn down, may be completely overthrown. From Vercelli, the French took 600,000 crowns and captured the imperial commander, Lord von Tschalan.</p>
      <p>It is written that Kulmbach, the town of Albert, has been horribly devastated by the confederate enemies. Farewell, most distinguished man, in the Lord, with your wife, children, sons-in-law, and other brothers. Basel, December 27, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, lest you be unaware, our church is gravely afflicted by the illness of our Lycosthenes, whom the Lord struck with paralysis on the 20th of this month, so much so that he is completely deprived of the use of his right side and tongue, and we fear he may not easily recover, as so far, despite the faithful efforts of the doctors, nothing has been achieved. Therefore, I earnestly commend him to your prayers and those of your church, as he is a man in whom the highest gifts of Christ contend with doctrine, and the church would therefore suffer a greater loss by his passing. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
