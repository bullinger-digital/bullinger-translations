      <p>My business has succeeded, as you will understand more fully from Mr. Froschauer's report. Regarding Florian's affairs, Mr. a Lasco could not report to me, nor have I heard anything from him.</p>
      <p>Our prince, whom you have addressed in your letters, will be consoled by them. Fourteen days ago, my elder brother, who was the Bishop of Münster, passed away. He wished to be buried without any pomp and departed to the Lord with great constancy. I thank you for the book of mutual agreement. Mr. Peter Martyr is very pressing about the edition of the commentaries in his letters to me, which I received immediately after Froschauer's departure, along with the preface included here.</p>
      <p>Froschauer should be reminded to hasten the edition and to send one copy of each printed sheet after a month.</p>
      <p>The Brabantians are silent, but Friesland is erupting more and more every day. Mr. Caesarius departed to the Lord before the Christmas holidays with the utmost faith and grace. I have various poems written by him with me, which I will send to you at the first opportunity; if you see fit, they may be printed. I will faithfully take care of the letters to Embden, God willing.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received the business of Mr. Hooper. Mr. Bucer also departed from this world a month ago.</p>
      <p>Various things are being said about the people of Magdeburg; if they are true, it is clear that everything is happening not by human industry, but by the divine arm.</p>
      <p>Gropper, who is now the Archdeacon of Cologne, is very vehement in his visitation; whether it is done with a sincere heart, I do not know; however, that business does not always succeed as desired. Please greet all my friends for me. That our Echtius did not respond to Mr. Gesner is not my fault; various occupations stand in the way. In the meantime, however, Mr. Gesner's business is not neglected. If you happen to write to Mr. Canterbury or to the magnates, I would wish for mention to be made of the English Bibles and for them to be more promoted by your commendation. Farewell, my most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, and use me as your own. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Johann Birckmann the elder. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
