      <p>Reverend lords and likewise the most illustrious and distinguished men, our dearest friends, who faithfully teach the most holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ in the church of Zürich, partly in the school and partly in the church, namely superintendents, pastors, doctors, elders, and faithful ministers of the word of God, we convey to your excellencies our inclined and ready willingness to gratify in every kind of duty and we greet you lovingly and amicably through this our letter.</p>
      <p>How grave and how significant the controversies in religion about the primary foundation of our faith concerning God or the Trinity have arisen among us in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and what ruins, dangers, and perils they bring with them due to the obstinate dissensions and contentions of those teaching in the church and following different doctrines, we have thought it should be reported to your excellencies.</p>
      <p>These and similar controversies will be abundantly known and understood from this our writing or letter to the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, which we send to you, which we had conceived to him while he was still alive, but since he, as it pleased the Lord, has departed from this mortal life, the purpose for which we wrote this letter to him, we now turn to you.</p>
      <p>The hope and confidence we had once conceived in Mr. Calvin in this matter, we now conceive in you.</p>
      <p>The occasion of all these controversies was provided by a man of restless mind, Franciscus Stancarus of Mantua, who accused and charged all your Swiss, Allobrogian, and other churches throughout Germany, as well as ours in Poland and Lithuania, and especially the late Calvin, Bullinger, Philipp Melanchthon, and other illustrious men who have deserved well of the churches and the entire republic, of Arian, Eutychian, and many other heresies in his publicly published writings, whence our pastors and ministers, while defending the honor of your churches, while striving to refute and reject his delusions, have finally come to dissension and schism between the parties, as will be more clearly understood from these letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, from your excellencies, as faithful pastors of the church of God and principal instruments of God, whose consensus in the confession of faith and in the whole doctrine we have hitherto followed and do follow throughout Poland and Lithuania, we ask and request in the greatest manner, as from brothers, and you especially, most learned and illustrious lord Johannes Bullinger, we address by this name, that by your outstanding learning and your remarkable piety, you may not with idle minds look into such controversies more deeply and, when you weigh each thing, then refer all to the balance of the word of God and assist us who are laboring and anxiously concerned about peace and concord and also about the dangers that seem to threaten the churches.</p>
      <p>You will assist, however, if you write to us your judgment and opinion sought from the word of God and the sources of Israel through a private or public letter.</p>
      <p>By this name, we also address the Genevans as well as you, and we beseech you by the faith of your ministry and by the talent entrusted to you by the Lord God, not to make our expectation of you in vain.</p>
      <p>For we will expect at every moment of time your response, that is, your opinion and judgment on all these matters, and that through our illustrious son, Lord Nicolaus Christophorus Radziwill, who is now engaged in studies of letters and piety in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>What remains, we wish for your excellencies health and happiness and especially peace, concord, and tranquility, which indeed fluctuate among us, but are to be restored by your help, counsel, judgments, and opinions.</p>
      <p>Given at Brest on the 14th of September in the year of our Lord 1564. Your excellencies' good friend Nicolaus Radziwill, by the grace of God Duke in Olyka and Nieswiez, Lord in Kleczko and Grodno, Palatine of Vilnius, Grand Marshal and Archchancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, General Captain of Brest, Kaunas, Borisov, and Šiauliai, signed with his own hand. (Good friend and signed with his own hand, etc.).</p>
      <p>There have also recently appeared pamphlets by some ministers from Poland and also by a certain Polish knight Cazanowius on these contemporary controversies, which Cazanowius, among other things, responds to Mr. Calvin's admonitions written to the Poles. From these pamphlets, the merits of the present cause could be learned, but they were not at hand for us at present, yet we will ensure they are sent and delivered to our illustrious son in Strasbourg, who will in turn ensure they are sent and delivered to you, although we do not doubt that these very pamphlets have penetrated to your excellencies from Poland into Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend, most illustrious, and likewise most distinguished men, lords superintendents, pastors, doctors, elders, and ministers of the word of God in the church of Zürich, our dearest and most honorable friends.</p>
