      <p>Greetings. By the grace of God, I am now feeling a little better, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Fabricius's letters.</p>
      <p>The envoy from Chur also wrote to me.</p>
      <p>He says he has nothing new, but is waiting for me to write something.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish, Mr. Bullinger, if you have anything by tomorrow, when you have time, to share it with me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and forgive the half-blind and now also lame writer. Yours, Konrad Ge√üner.</p>
