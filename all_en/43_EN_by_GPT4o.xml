    <p xml:id="regest1">The fact that Schürmeister has not yet responded to the two very kind and truly moving letters [hbbw XX, No. 3039, from October 13, 1547, and a letter not received] is certainly not due to his lack of agreement with the writings, contrary to Bullinger's assumption. Quite the opposite! He has openly admitted before many important men that he was instructed by Bullinger's letters. The reason [for the lack of response] is rather this: He was completely unsettled by the turmoil, dangers, and uncertainty caused by some whom he does not wish to call "false brothers," as they are friends (God knows if true). Blinded by flattery, he was deprived of his office! But God, who will rehabilitate him, is and always has been with those who suffer injustice!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The efforts Bullinger made in his last letters to Schürmeister, as well as in the writing "Considerations on whether the traitor Judas also sat at the Lord's table," were not in vain! For many agree with them: Bullinger has not only convinced Schürmeister but also many others who were similarly stuck in false teachings, making them defenders of the booklet. So powerful is the careful reflection on the truth! Clearer than in a mirror, one can recognize in it what is incomprehensible and hidden to the human mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Schürmeister will soon personally speak to Bullinger about his situation. He cannot write about it in detail now due to the haste of the messenger [N.N.] and his inner unrest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[P.S.:] Schürmeister has moved out of the parsonage and now lives with the pious Brittnau pastor Johannes [von der Mühle], who gladly took him in due to their long friendship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">His successors and Johannes Ulrich Göppel, this good Swabian, are the learned and pious Bremgarten native Johannes Räber from Schinznach near Brugg and [Johann] Georg [Will] from Bözberg. The latter is not yet known to Schürmeister.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Another greeting. Bullinger, who is indebted to Schürmeister and other good people, should continue to support Schürmeister.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The reason I have not yet responded to your two very kind and truly moving letters, dearest Bullinger, is certainly not because I find them disagreeable, as you might suspect. Quite the opposite. I have openly declared before many important men that I have been abundantly instructed by them. But the reason is this: I have been completely unsettled by the turmoil, dangers, and uncertainties caused by some whom I do not wish to call "false brothers," as they are friends (God knows if true). Blinded by flattery, I was deprived of my office! But God, who will rehabilitate me, is and always has been with those who suffer injustice, I know, and He will judge my cause.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Do not ever regret the effort and labor you put into the previous letters sent to me and your booklet on the dissertation about the traitor Judas, for they are so well received by many that you have not only convinced me but also won over those who were similarly stuck in false teachings, making them defenders of the booklet. So powerful is the diligent search and meditation on the truth, in which one can see more clearly than in a polished mirror whatever is obscure and hidden to human senses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I will soon be with you as a living letter and will inform you of everything about my situation in person, as I could not capture everything with the pen due to the haste of the messenger and my inner turmoil.</p>

      <p>Farewell. February 15, 1548.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have moved from the parsonage to the pious brother Johannes von Brittnau, who now hosts me due to his long-standing friendship with me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In my place and that of Göppel (the good Swabian), an excellent and learned man, and certainly pious, Johannes Räber from Schinznach near Brugg and Georg uff dem Bötzberg (not yet known to me) have been appointed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Again, farewell and continue to support and promote Benedikt, who is now indebted to you along with other good men.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Schürmeister, yours in Zofingen.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
