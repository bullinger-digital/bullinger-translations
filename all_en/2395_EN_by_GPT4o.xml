      <p>S. P. Do not be surprised that you have received nothing from me from the Baden assembly. Whatever news there was, I gave to your lords, and I know you have seen a copy of everything. Furthermore, my secretary told me how he greeted you and explained part of what he had. Therefore, I could add nothing to these. Since that time, I have received from Picardy, as news, what I am sending here in two memoranda, of which, if you please, you will give a copy to your lords, so that they may be read in the council; for it is the truth of Picardian affairs up to the 10th of this month. As for Germany, indeed Augustus, the brother of Maurice, is defending the succession and the electorate with the help of the King of Denmark and the Romans. He has sent envoys to the king, who will not fail him.</p>
      <p>I hear that he loves learned men and diligently supports them, which is very pleasing to me. I will await from you if you have anything more from there. Vergerius wrote to me and indicated that all my things have been returned to him through your efforts. Therefore, I give thanks. When I have more leisure, I will write to him. Farewell, excellent and good man. Given from Solothurn on the 18th of September.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
      <p>The heavy rains greatly troubled our army at the beginning of this month, and I greatly fear for the Camerarians, who until this day had been neutral between these two princes and now, having received the Emperor's garrison, have thrown themselves into open dangers.</p>
      <p>As I was closing this packet, I received a second letter from Vergerius, which he had sent to you. I give thanks and will satisfy him with my first letters. And because I also found among many other French letters sent from Paris one for one of your citizens, which is included here, you will take care, if you please, to have it delivered; for I do not know the others. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To Master Bullinger.</p>
