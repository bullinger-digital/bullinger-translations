      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I thank you and Susanna for the two young partridges you sent me, which have been well received. If I come across anything new, I will share it with you. Herewith I send you the latest news I have. Please send it back to me, if possible, by Friday, so that I can send it elsewhere. When you were here, I gave you memoranda on the Psalms; you promised to copy them in 14 days. If illness has intervened, send it to me as soon as you have used or copied it. I do not have time at the moment to write more.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna and the children for us, also young master Hans Peyer in Flach.</p>
      <p>Dated on Oswald's Day, it is the procession of the beggars here in Kilchberg. And it is certainly true that the two priests in Lucerne, who committed great disgrace with the woman on the open street and abducted her, have been executed by the sword, and the executioner has taken away their consecration. O well-done deed. 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
