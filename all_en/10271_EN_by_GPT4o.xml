    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger asked him to write, which he would have gladly done if he were only as learned. He recalls their shared conversation, which he has recounted to some sincere friends of the truth who would do anything for the cause of God. There is concern about the attitude of the people of Zurich, who endure everything just to live in peace. Bullinger should urge his people to embrace the Kingdom of Christ. With the messenger, Konrad Schnitt, Bullinger can negotiate safely. In Basel, the evangelical cause is doing well, as Theodor Brand has been elected as the chief guild master. News about the synod's negotiations has been sent from Strasbourg. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Peace and joy in Christ.</p>
      <p>When I was with you, most kind brother, you asked me to greet you more often with letters. But how anxiously I have always desired both to greet and to be greeted with letters - no one knows better than God and my conscience - if only an equal share of Latin had fallen to me as to others! But whenever I attempt this, seizing the pen, that barbarism within me advises me to stay within my own skin. Yet the humanity I know and have experienced in you breaks the silence and overcomes the shame. Therefore, if I have erred in this part, it is through you and your fault that I err, and you should blame yourself if I have acted rashly.</p>
      <p>You remember, I think, dearest Heinrich, what we discussed while walking, where we parted the other day. I have shared this with some, and those most faithful, as much as I could, on occasion. Since they are lovers of the sincerest truth, there is nothing they would not attempt for the sake of God, and they agree that this is the only way by which wavering hearts can be raised again. Meanwhile, however, the disturbed spirit of your people, who seem to endure and do anything just to live peacefully, somewhat frightens them. Yet I have no doubt that what seemed best and most advisable in this matter has been entrusted to our messenger. It is your duty to more frequently advise and exhort your people to yield more to Christ than to the entire kingdom of darkness, and to hold and love Him tenaciously. Then, however, you should confer much with our messenger - for you can do so most safely. If only you could persuade your people's faith and constancy more. It seemed to some that we could never be more helped in any part unless we are freed from the opposing parties by dissolving the alliance.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the cause of Christ is doing well with us. We have received the Tribune, whom I judged would be present, Theodor, with the greatest applause from all. And he presents himself in such a way that if he continues, I have no doubt that he will bring great fruit to both Christ and His church.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new, except what Strasbourg has sent regarding the synodal acts, from which it is easy to observe how that enemy, now almost falling, intends to extend his horn. For what he could not achieve by force until now, he attempts under the false guise of religion and hypocrisy. But the Lord will judge him in His day. I do not doubt that these things are very well known to you through the brothers from Strasbourg and others.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet my most pious Leon and Pellicanus.</p>
      <p>13th of July.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Wissenburg.</p>
      <p>To the learned and equally pious Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
