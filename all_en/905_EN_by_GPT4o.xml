      <p>S. I believe you have already learned from others, most esteemed lord and godfather, that I have returned safely to Bern with my wife. The reason I have not written in the meantime is that either a messenger was lacking or I did not have the opportunity and means to write, although I always greatly desired to do so. It was especially necessary, as I had promised to inform you of our decision regarding the petitions of the people of Lausanne, to hasten and mature it, so that your response would not precede ours and differ from it. As soon as I returned here, I presented your advice to the brothers collectively, and although there were different opinions and desires regarding the importance of the matter, which affected some more than others, we finally agreed amicably and unanimously with your opinion, namely, that we should respond amicably and calmly to their more than sufficiently insulting letters, adding that they should be content with the concession made to them and not again cause trouble for the most honorable council or us.</p>
      <p>Although this has not yet been done, it will be done in these days, so that your letters to them will not follow inopportunely. Viret has not written to me at all in the meantime. He is cleverly waiting for our response first. It is difficult and arduous for us to deal with such a contentious kind of people, who seem to lack all love and continually aspire to something higher than is fitting or expedient for the ministers of Christ, and unless they are restrained by the authority of the magistrate, they would cause us new disturbances every day. Their spirit is entirely that of Strasbourg, delighting in new things, aspiring to greatness, impatient of civil authority. I therefore ask that you do not allow yourselves to be drawn away from us by their tricks and schemes. They know well that we agree among ourselves. They would like to throw some apple of discord among us, so that they could defend their cause with your authority.</p>
      <p>It is therefore absolutely necessary for our churches that we do not allow the fellowship that has existed between them until now to perish. This about them: to which I will not inappropriately add that Calvin and Viret have secretly come to Neuch√¢tel to Farel in these days, and some others have also gathered there. Those who are suspicious suspect that they are plotting something again. I do not envy them. May the meetings be in the Lord and for the peace of the churches.</p>
      <p>There is no special news here, except that the talk about the young Duke of Savoy, how he was stabbed, is growing bigger and bigger; also that many people have perished for the emperor in the Netherlands. From Augsburg, we are written to by Mr. Hieronymus Seiler, whom you know well, that he, having been in Antwerp for a year for his business, has been summoned by the emperor along with another, called Nithart, to Brussels, where he is accused by the imperial fiscal of having made a large sum, up to 300,000 crowns, in a bill of exchange from there to Lyon, to the king's advantage against his majesty, and also of having taken an exorbitant interest in a short time, for which he has forfeited his life and goods to the emperor. In short: he has been imprisoned, but released on heavy bail, and may not come from Antwerp, comes back only for what he has; his wife is very distressed. You may inform my godfather, the bailiff Vogler, who is related, if he has shown any comfort to the lady.</p>
      <p>Hervagius writes to Musculus about Florian Susliga, the Pole, that he is a great rogue and has deceived many prominent people; thus no one knows anymore whom to believe. In Valais, letters have been set up on all sides against each other and promised never to deal with such mischief again, whatever may happen in the future, to settle it legally and amicably; but it is to be feared that it will not be kept for long.</p>
      <p>The plague is breaking out here somewhat; this week Hans Mangoldt and his wife have died, and a young woman of Musculus, also otherwise 4 or 5 persons; it has now subsided somewhat. We stand thus in the Lord's hand; may He deal with us according to His grace. Otherwise, I have nothing to write to you this time, except that a scandalous affair has happened to us with a pastor from the countryside, who raised a girl from the beggars, then seduced her, and when she became pregnant, incited others to him a second time, so that he sold both children with others, and finally also married her to his own stepson; the whole affair is known, it is a lamentable outcry and scandal, but it cries out against the priests. God have mercy, that we are such wretched people, that His name must be blasphemed so badly because of us. In this matter, the question arises whether the stepson can have the father's wife or whore as a wife, about which I would like your advice. With this, you are entrusted to God. My household greets you and yours, also Mr. Musculus with his. Dated Bern, May 12, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Please quickly forward the enclosed letters to Hospinian; they have a subject that cannot endure delay.</p>
