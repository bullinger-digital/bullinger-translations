      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, since I do not have time to make an extract from the letters for you, I am sending you the letters that have been given to me these days, themselves, but with the condition that you do not let them out of your hand and do not open them to anyone at all, - you may well note and share the new news with whomever you wish, - provided that you return them to me all properly and well taken care of, as soon as you can, etc. Otherwise, we have had peaceful days, and the city is quite well. May God grant stability in all good things.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hans Hugen in Glarus has had his house burned down, and everything he owned; he has escaped with his wife and children with difficulty. May God comfort all the afflicted. On Sunday night around 12, we also had a fire here, in which Hans Petters Eberhart's house, the trumpeter of the guild, burned down completely, along with everything he owned inside; it is located in front of the Augustinian gate next to St. Anna in a pretty garden by the city moat, etc. Therefore, everyone should take good care of the fire and pray to God to protect us.</p>
      <p>At this time, they have begun to print Josias' Latin book against Jacob Andreae and other associates, as well as my little book in German on the same subject; it will probably be 7 or 8 sheets soon; because our opponents make the matter so coarse that we can no longer remain silent, nor should we. I am sending you here a copy from a printed book by Jacob Lachner; send it back to me soon...</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg in the Flaachtal.</p>
