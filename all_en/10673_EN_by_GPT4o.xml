    <p xml:id="regest1">Konrad Zwick is of the opinion that the evangelical cities [of the Confederation] should send a Basel envoy to [Duke Ulrich of Württemberg] to counter the influence of [Erhard] Schnepf and advocate for moderation in the reorganization of church practices. Capito requests a recommendation with Zurich politicians and thanks for the hospitality.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It seems to Konrad Zwick that a Basel envoy should be sent in the name of your Christian republics to [Duke Ulrich of Württemberg], who is believed to be more favorable to them, with the mandate to express your desire to cultivate peace and friendship with him and to wish for moderation in our rites, which are not too resistant, so that the minds of the more ignorant populace may be kept in check. It is believed that under the authority of Schnepf, the churches will be burdened with many ceremonies by this new constitution, which they are producing, soon to be published.</p>
      <p>I beg you to kindly and dutifully commend me to both Master Camlin, Johann Haben, Etlibach, and especially to Kiburg. Farewell, you too, with the brothers, to whom I am grateful for the cheerful gathering at your generous table.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, on the 6th day after Bartholomew's Day.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, lord and brother to be respected in the Lord.</p>
