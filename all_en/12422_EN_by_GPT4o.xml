    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received two letters from Myconius, which he wants to briefly address.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- There is nothing new to report about the conflict between Emperor [Charles V] and the French [King Francis I]. However, it is certain that [Charles V] wants to eradicate the Gospel and subjugate Germany. Therefore, a war against [Francis I] is unlikely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger is pleased to hear that the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Colloquy was interrupted, especially since it would not have yielded anything anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger has heard similar things about Hungary from Constance. The Turkish [Beylerbey of Buda, Mehmed Yahya Pasha], is right in thinking that the veneration of images is the reason for the captivity of [Christendom].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger forwarded the [letter] intended for Constance, as well as Myconius' letter to Vadian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Ludwig] von Reischach reported on negotiations between [Francis I] and [Charles V] in Cambrai. Perhaps Myconius can write more about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger thanks for the resolutions of the Council of Trent transmitted by Myconius. He has received a similar [document] from Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- He has not yet met [Rudolf] Gwalther, as he returned late from the countryside the previous evening. However, Gwalther had already had Myconius' letter delivered to him by a boy. [Theodor] Bibliander is well-disposed towards Myconius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Here are some excerpts from letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- From Augsburg:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Haller [writes] that he was warmly received in Augsburg [on February 28]. It was reported by letter from Nuremberg that Luther died on February 17 [correct: 18]. However, this is not very credible, as a report [from such a great distance] could not reach Augsburg so quickly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Frölich [reports] that [Charles V] is behaving in the Netherlands in such a way that the wise no longer trust him. He has war in mind and will come to Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- From Constance:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Blarer [reports] that Luther is said to have died. It is confirmed by booksellers returning from Leipzig that Luther has written nothing against the [Zurichers]. The [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Colloquy was interrupted, and the colloquents have been summoned to Trent [to the Council]. [Landgrave Philip] of Hesse writes of [Charles V's] war plans against the [Protestants]. Allegedly, an army is being raised in the Diocese of Bremen against the Landgrave. Duke Ernst of [Brunswick]-Lüneburg is dead. After the Landgrave, he was the second great hope of the [Schmalkaldic] allies. [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, has written to the Landgrave that [Charles V] plans nothing against the [Schmalkaldic] League, which arouses suspicion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- From St. Gallen:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Vadian [writes] that [Charles V], who intends to go to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, had his quartermaster [...] in Nuremberg and is arranging quarters [in Nuremberg] for mid-March. He wants to dissolve the [Schmalkaldic] League, whose allies are to meet in Worms on April 1; and if he does not succeed, he will invade Germany with Spaniards, Sicilians, and Italians. He is also said to have invited all princes and estates by letter to participate in the Regensburg Imperial Diet. Allegedly, to prevent the [Protestant] cities of southern Germany from coming to the aid of the north, he plans to attack both the north and the south of Germany simultaneously.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Myconius should not show this letter to everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- He should excuse Bullinger's hurried handwriting.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I receive two letters from you, most esteemed man. In the former, there are a few things to which I should respond, and likewise in the latter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the new conflict between the Emperor and the French, I have nothing certain to tell you. I am convinced that the Emperor is entirely focused on eradicating the Gospel and subjugating Germany; therefore, it seems unlikely to me that the Emperor, with his Spanish, that is, deceitful nature, would renew his long-standing hatred against the French (about which I have no doubt) with any war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I hear that the Regensburg Colloquy is suspended, and I am glad. For it is certain that no fruit is to be expected from it, and that for no uncertain reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What you wrote about the Hungarian iconoclasts, I have meanwhile received from Constance; and the account agrees. The Turk very rightly judges that idolatry is not the least cause of so many disasters, so many calamities, and indeed of our most disgraceful servitude; and you judge most rightly, who think that the Lord preaches the truth to the rebels through such apostles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>What you sent to be forwarded to Constance, I have sent. Likewise, today I sent your last letter addressed to Vadian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If in the meantime you have received any news about what was done between the envoys of the French and the Spanish at Cambrai, where Mr. von Reischach indicated they would meet, let me know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The articles you noted from the Council of Trent, I similarly received from Constance, yet I give you great thanks for your labors and faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have not yet met Gwalther, for I returned home late yesterday evening from the countryside to the city. I found your letters at home, which he had sent through a boy. I write this in the morning. I understand nothing else than that Mr. Bibliander wishes you well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Now, what friends have shared, I also share with you, and indicate briefly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>From Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Haller: I was most kindly received in Augsburg at the end of February. Letters were sent the next day from Nuremberg, indicating that on February 17, Mr. Luther had passed away. - However, no credence was given to those letters, nor do I think they should be believed, as they could not have reached Augsburg in such a short time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Frölich: The Emperor behaves in the Netherlands in such a way that the best and wisest no longer trust him. He is contemplating war, etc. He will come to Regensburg, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>From Constance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Blarer: There is a rumor that Luther is dead, whether true or false, I do not know. It is certain that he has written nothing against you. For the booksellers have returned from Leipzig. The Regensburg Colloquy has been suspended, and the colloquents have been summoned to Trent. "Hesse writes to our people about new wars, which the Emperor and others are now seriously and entirely contemplating." There is a rumor that an army is being gathered in the Diocese of Bremen against the Landgrave. Prince Ernst of Lüneburg is certainly dead. All good men mourn him. For among the allies of the League, he was the second hope after the Landgrave. Granvelle, in letters sent to Hesse, excuses the Emperor, saying he is not plotting anything against the League; but this increases suspicion, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>From St. Gallen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Mr. Vadian: The Emperor had his quartermaster in Nuremberg at the end of February and had quarters arranged for mid-March; for he has called an Imperial Diet to Regensburg, where he intends to travel. His plan and intention is to destroy the League, which is to be concluded in Worms on April 1, etc. If he cannot achieve this, he will turn to arms and lead Spaniards, Sicilians, Italians, and other people from his lands in great numbers over the Germans. He is also said to have invited all princes and estates to come personally to Regensburg, where it is expected they will not come as he wishes. There is also said to be a plot against the cities of the Upper Country in the Gospel, so that they will be hindered and unable to help those in the Netherlands. For if the Emperor wishes, he will attack both above and below. March 9.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>You will not share this with just anyone. For you know that friends do not want all their matters to be disclosed to just anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Farewell now and excuse the poor handwriting; I wrote in haste. March 10, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Oswald Myconius, my dearest brother.</p>
