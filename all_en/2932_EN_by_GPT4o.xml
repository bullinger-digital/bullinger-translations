      <p>It has been quite a long time, if not more, since I received a letter from you, incomparable friend. But I am compelled to attribute this to the injuries of the times and your infinite occupations; for the current state of affairs demands tireless care and concern, especially from those who have received an abundance of gifts from the Lord. Many things are being reported here, the outcome of which only God knows, which our sins, our ingratitude, and the remarkable intolerance of fraternal correction deserve; I expect the dreadful judgments of God, so great is the insolence of minds and vices almost everywhere. Ears have become deaf to any admonitions of the Lord, we have developed a callousness, so that even in the midst of fire, the sense of heat is absent. I am indeed weary of life, not to mention the assigned duty, my brother, to such an extent is my tireless labor drawn in different directions, which I endure not without great pain of my soul. May the Lord grant me to keep my deposit until the day of my liberation with steadfast faith. As for my body and domestic state, the Lord has provided well for me.</p>
      <p>I live with my family in utmost peace and harmony. The Lord sustains me according to the nature of His grace. I am eagerly awaiting the remainder of what I have on the Apocalypse; I have the fiftieth folio, the fifty-first folio remains to be sent.</p>
      <p>Send it, I implore you, my Bullinger; you have the bearer of this letter, a very pious man and most devoted to me, to whom you can safely entrust it.</p>
      <p>There are various rumors of various things among us; however, nothing that I would write to you, who perhaps have more certain information. I patiently await the outcome of events. Greet your wife and the whole family on my behalf. In the meantime, may the Lord keep you safe for us and His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent man, keep me commended in your prayers. May 23, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>This is the income of my benefice:</p>
      <p>In grain, 78 mutt of grain, in oats, 2 malter of oats, in money, 13 guilders, 15 batzen per guilder.</p>
      <p>Also the wine tithe, usually yields 10 eimer of wine per year, I hope it will yield more this year.</p>
      <p>Also an orchard, a well, and a vegetable garden. The improvement from my lords of Lenzburg is: Also 10 guilders, 15 batzen per guilder.</p>
      <p>Also a meadow without rent for ownership, so that I may have and winter two cows.</p>
      <p>Also a well-built house near the church, in a very quiet place.</p>
      <p>Also a stable for hay, cows, and pigs, well prepared, as is the custom in Lenzburg, that one cannot live well without livestock.</p>
      <p>Also the city moat by my house for grazing the livestock; if I lease it, it yields a rent of 1 guilder.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lord, brother, and old friend in Christ.</p>
