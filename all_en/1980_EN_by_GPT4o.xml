      <p>S. P. If you wish to know anything new from me regarding the war, you can learn it from the letters I am writing to your lords; for there I truly include what comes from Picardy, Piedmont, as well as from Italy and other places. I wish and urge you to send a copy to Lord Vergerius. I received his letters from the time he returned from Germany, along with a booklet he dedicated to me, which is excellently and learnedly written, and I hardly believe there is a second in Italy who writes more purely and with greater force and energy in Italian. I am responding to him; please ensure, if you will, that my letters are delivered. What is further enclosed here, you should know for certain, you can send to him; but I ask that you do not name the author. You are expecting something about the English; for I see from your last letters that you are observed by many there. Everything is unfortunate; that first queen was rejected by the Imperialists, and Northumberland was so imprudent or timid that he hardly dared to resist them when he could have; thus Mary, the Imperialist and papist, is declared queen. You know how she hates your people, how uniquely she observes contrary things. These are too certain, and now she seeks a husband similar to herself from the Emperor's counsel; thus great changes are expected in the church. This is the Emperor's art, which he can use in no way except through the divisions he fosters in the churches. Thus, the dying Granvella predicted to him that he would be the greatest Emperor and that by this means Germany and the Swiss could be destroyed. God has forbidden and will forbid it; but he attempts the same in England, where things are altogether in a bad state. I also wish you to say something to Lord Vergerius; for in leisure I no longer have time for more to him, and I refer everything to you. I awaited news of the battle.</p>
      <p>May the Lord of Hosts grant victory, on which certainly many things depend, and look upon those who do not stand with us.</p>
      <p>I greet your lords and you uniquely. Farewell excellently, and if you have anything about the Nurembergers and other Germans, write, I beg.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, good man. Given from Solothurn this Friday. Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
      <p>To Lord Bullinger, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
