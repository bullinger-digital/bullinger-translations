    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should inform Peter Huber that he can come to Bern with his family, as his position as a schoolmaster is secured from March 1st. Bullinger's letter alarmed and shook the brothers in faith in Bern; the more courageous ones want to rush to the aid of the beleaguered people of Zurich, if necessary, even against the advice of the more prudent. He is pleased with the Zurich synodal resolutions. Greetings to Zwingli's widow from her little son Wilhelm, as well as from his guardian Lienhard Tremp and his wife.</p>

      <p>Inform Peter Huber that he should appear with his family and belongings for the upcoming service, namely on the first of March, where the position assigned to him will be pleasing, specifically for each service 25 pounds of our currency. He will have the favor of the council if he diligently applies himself to teaching the children.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what you write about the state of public affairs has alarmed the brothers, and still alarms them today, because there is no faith among us so intact that we can promise you anything about us. There are many wise ones who, while the enemy tries to harass you, will be present, whatever the elders have ever deliberated. Your letter moved many to tears, who certainly hold much authority among us. The brothers could not advise anything to which I could now respond to your letter. See that you do not fail us in writing. The brothers whisper this, that when the enemy attacks, the more courageous will be present, whatever otherwise seems prudent. The synod is quite pleasing, and how could you displease me, in whose love I am so captivated that nothing displeases me that reflects your genius?</p>
      <p>Finally, greet Zwingli's widow in the name of little Wilhelm, who is doing very well in his studies and life. Little Wilhelm's guardian Tremp, his adoptive mother Tremp's wife, sends a Bernese coin to her as a sign of how much she loves her and the little one, and thanks her for all the gifts sent. Therefore, perform the duty of a messenger and greet this widow from the little one. Give thanks for the shirt sent.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be frequent in writing. Command what we should do, and we will be ready, as far as we can.</p>
      <p>January 6, year 33.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
