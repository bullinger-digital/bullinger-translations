      <p>My friendly service beforehand, dear lord and friend. You have some news from Augsburg, especially concerning Magdeburg; I am sure you will also share it with me. I believe that God has shown His grace to the pious people of Magdeburg. He will again be their true helper in the future. In the enclosed letter, you have all sorts of news.</p>
      <p>Queen Maria, the Duchess of Lorraine, is supposed to come to Augsburg alongside Maximilian to arrange all matters to the benefit of the House of Austria and to make a marriage before the emperor's departure; in this, there will be great haste, and for many reasons, a significant war is to be feared after the emperor's death. Whatever is dear and of service to you, I gladly do. The answer to this letter was to be sent off immediately. Dated Basel, the 15th of November, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Schertlin, knight, has signed. To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and friend, to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
