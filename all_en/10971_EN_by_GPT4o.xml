Requests the acquisition of Greek commentaries on Aristotle for the library, as these works, which justify the study of the Greek language more than others, are unaffordable for students; [Johannes] Fries and others join in this request.</p>

      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, patron of studies, dearest patron.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I wish you all to be in good health and to remain long in piety and studies. If I have used prefaces with you, I fear that I may become tedious. Although today it is almost a common fault of all who write, bringing many and long digressions to those who are of higher status, and thus they rather incur tedium and suspicion of vain ostentation than gain commendation for themselves. But to have proposed the matter simply and in simple words prevents all opinion of flattery and deceit. What I say does not pertain to the fact that I am about to ask something from you; for if I ever did so, I did it as if it were not very liberal, with my own nature unwilling and resisting, and I would rather lack twice than ask once. Therefore, you will not think me so impudent and unskilled a man. I acknowledge your kindness and benevolence and will always act so that no one may be beneficent to me in vain. And if only I had more free time, so that I could prepare myself to be more useful to you and the country at some point in the future! Furthermore, what I ask from you, I do not ask for myself, but for the common benefit of students, and that is concerning the Greek interpreters of Aristotle, that you make an effort to have them added to the library's collection, if it can somehow be done. For it is true that the Greek language will not be useless nor will it satisfy the labor of learners unless someone seeks the fruit of labor from Aristotle and his most learned interpreters. For what other part of studies is there where the Latins do not contend with the Greeks? In many they even surpass, do they leave this one alone? The Greek commentaries are absolutely necessary for the sincere knowledge of philosophy, but they are acquired at great cost, and if someone among us wishes to buy one or two of them, he exhausts his entire stipend. Therefore, it would be worthwhile for you, the parent of studies, to ensure and take care that they are placed for common use. It is certainly a necessary matter and worthy of you. Our [Johannes] Fries asks the same, and indeed everyone does. It will not be possible to adorn the library with a greater treasure. If you try, you will make others agree, and if it is agreed upon, Fries and I will easily take care of having them brought at as reasonable a price as possible. I wish nothing further, except that Christ may grant you to enjoy the new year happily.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 3 days before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Konrad Ge√üner.</p>
