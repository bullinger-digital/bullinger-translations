    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger considers himself unfortunate because he writes in such a way that Myconius misunderstands him. Myconius has known Bullinger's disposition for many years. However, Bullinger fears that Myconius does not fully trust him. Why did Myconius not consider that there was a reason the response [regarding Schwenckfeld's request for a conversation] was written in German? Namely, not because of Myconius, but because of the Schwenckfelders, who write everything in German. Myconius could have suspected this. Certainly, the response is categorical, but, to say it again, not because of Myconius, but because of [the Schwenckfelders], to whom the command "And let us be unconcerned about him [Schwenckfeld]" also applied. This should have allowed Myconius to reject them more effectively. Myconius should therefore calm his agitation. If Vadian's writing has caused offense, then Myconius should attribute it to [Vadian] and not to the [people of Zurich]. Myconius dislikes that Schwenckfeld is allowed a conversation; Myconius should therefore maintain this disposition and continue to guard against this hypocrite and chatterbox in the future. - As Myconius knows, the Baden Diet has concluded. In the name of all the Confederates, envoys, [namely] two from the cities of Zurich and Lucerne, two from the cantons of Uri and Schwyz, are being sent to the Milanese Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos] to complain about the [suffered] injustice and to request that he grant the [Confederates] access to the [Milanese] market. Additionally, they want to see how the troop movements in Italy are progressing. The alliance has now been strengthened through assurances and promises, as it could not be renewed by [swearing] the oath formula. However, it was decided not to take offense at the fact that the oath was not sworn. In Baden, two wagons with military equipment were also confiscated. Some believe these are weapons brought from Milan by the Emperor. - If Myconius has anything noteworthy to report, he should share it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I consider myself rather unfortunate, as I write in such a way that I have you as such an unfair interpreter. If I err here, it is not out of malice, but due to a false opinion. Until now, I have thought of you as someone who first considers the writer's intention and then examines the circumstances. You have learned over many years and through numerous arguments what my disposition towards you is. Regarding the circumstances of this particular case, in which you are so impatiently grumbling, I will say nothing. Certainly, there are many things that would excuse both me and my letter.</p>
      <p>However, to speak frankly, I fear that you do not fully trust me in all matters; hence, you are so easily upset and complain against me.</p>
      <p>Should you not have especially considered why I wrote the response in German? Indeed, it was not because of you, but because of the Schwenckfelders, who write and act in German. Could you not have inferred from this, if you had wished, that it was not addressed to you, but to the Schwenckfelders? But everything is imperious and emphatic. Indeed! It was done with intent, not because of you, but because of those to whom the response was to be presented.</p>
      <p>Those people are wicked and importunate. Hence, it was written: "And let us be unconcerned about him." You could have opposed their importunate requests and intercessions with this declared will of ours, which was so clearly testified to them, that it would benefit you and you could conveniently dismiss or rather repel them. Have we sinned against them in this way? But you have indeed shown some emotion; therefore, remove it again and understand that we did not write with the intention you suppose. If the writing of Mr. Vadian has offended, attribute it to him, not to us. Your mind does not favor admitting Schwenckfeld to a conversation. Persevere in this and beware of the hypocritical and talkative man, and the matter will be well.</p>
      <p>You know the Baden Diet has concluded. Envoys are being sent in the name of all the Swiss Confederates, two from the cities of Zurich and Lucerne, two from the cantons of Uri and Schwyz, to the Milanese vicar, the Marquis of La Quasta, to complain about the injustices and to request that he open the market to us, etc. Furthermore, they want to see how the expedition in Italy is progressing. The alliances have now been renewed at Baden with solemn oaths and promises (which had previously been hindered, as they renewed the oath formula), so that the alliance is now renewed, and everyone knows that each will most sacredly observe the articles of the alliance, and that no one should take offense at the fact that the oath was not sworn, otherwise, they would prove their loyalty to each other against anyone, to protect our lives and goods, lands and people, etc. In Baden, two wagons were also confiscated (seized); since military equipment was on them, they want to know where they came from and where they are going. Some believe these are weapons sent by the Emperor from Milan, etc. If you have any matters that you think concern us, let us know.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with all the brothers; the brothers greet you. Zurich, October 27, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger, as always.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, minister of the church of Basel, his esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
