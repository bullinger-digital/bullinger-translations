  <input>---  exiguum quidem, at multa in sese complectentem dono mittimus, quem nostra lingua ac sub alieno nomine aedidimus [!] in lucem, primo quod Quintum Septimium Florentem Tertullianum in eo scribundo sumus imitati, unde et nos Octavium Florentem, nempe a Septimio Florente, inscripsimus, deinde quod eam mihi invidiam apud nostros concitarint inimici crucis Christi, ut multi nostro inspecto nomine plane contempturi essent ni, novo nomine novos et perversos attraxissem auditores ad lectionem fortassis, si non longius. Est enim hoc unum e mortiferis multis pestilentissimum, quod incognita damnamus inque heręsum tartara praecipitamus quae nondum scripturae trutina expendimus.

Mecum alias quam optime agitur; nam opulentissimo praefectus coenobio nec minus pratis virentibus silvisque garritu avium perstrepentibus amoeno pias pariter ac bonas profiteor litteras. Et hactenus quidem Mathei et Ioannis evangelion, dein et Paulinas aliquot epistolas, Romanorum videlicet, Corinthiorum utramque, Galatarum, Ephesiorum, Philippensium et Colossensium sumus interpraetati, quibus et postmeridianis horis «Copiae» libros Erasmi et artem illorum ob oculos subiiciens «Bellum» eiusdem cum Sallustio et aliquot Vergilii libris adiunximus. At in praesentiarum Thessalonicensium epistolam cum «Dialecticis» Philippi profitemur.

Unde et in Helvetiorum quorundam senatusconsultis, obtecte tamen, proscriptus, totus in cruce hereo neque latum culmum e Tigurinis agris progredi audeo, ni vitam Vulcano aut gladio libeat dedicare. Verum suave mihi est pro dulci nomine Jesu Christi, domini mei, peripsima [!] hominum [1 Kor 4,13] fieri, qui iam olim longe crudeliora peccatis meis promerueram. Tu pro me praecare dominum, ut hoc in me et fidelibus omnibus confirmet, quod ex gratia incoepit, utque in morte nostra cum Sancto cantemus Ignatio: «Parati sumus ad bestias, ad ignem, ad gladios et crucem, tantum ut Christum videamus, salvatorem nostrum et dominum.»

--- [Hel-]vetio, hoc est rudi et severo adolescenti. Ignosce, frater mi, iuvenilibus adfectibus et moribus, tum quidem per deum non renatis, nunc autem in ardentissimo pectore te praeceptoresque indesinenter volventibus. Comendabis me illis.

Michael noster ab infoelici descivit sacerdotio et textrinam lanariam subintroiit. Ioannes frater meus etiamdum sacrificulum, imo pastorem Uraniorum agit. Jacobus uxorem duxit, tabernarius effectus. Antonium vero plurimum valere iubeo, cum quo et tu valeas perpetuo.

  <output>We send you a small gift, containing many things, which we produced in light with our language and a foreign name; first, because we have imitated Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus in writing it, whence we have called ourselves Octavius Florens, namely from Septimius Florens; secondly, because my enemies, the adversaries of the cross of Christ, have aroused such envy among our people, that many, upon seeing our name, would have entirely despised it, unless I had drawn new and perverse readers to the reading, perhaps, if not further. For this is one of the many deadly and most pestilential diseases, that we condemn what is unknown and hurl it down to the bottom of hell as heresy, without examining it by the balance of Scripture.

With me, they deal most excellently; for the prefect of our opulent monastery, as well as the meadows with verdant grass, and the woods resounding with the singing of birds, I confess to be devoted to pious and good letters. And hitherto we have interpreted the gospel of Matthew and John, and then a few of Paul's epistles, namely the Roman, both of the Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians; to which in the afternoon hours we have added Erasmus' books of Copiae and the Art of the same, and with Sallust and some books of Virgil, the Bellum. But at present we teach the epistle to the Thessalonians with Philip's Dialectics.

Wherefore in the decrees of certain senate of the Helvetians, though secretly, being proscribed, I dare not go beyond the limits of the Tigurine fields on the cross of a martyr, unless I choose to devote my life to Vulcan or the sword. But it is sweet to me, for the dear name of Jesus Christ, my Lord, to be made a spectacle among men [1 Cor 4:13], who had deserved much more cruel punishment for my sins. You pray for me to the Lord, that he would confirm this in me and all the faithful, which he has begun out of grace; and that we may sing with the Holy Ignatius in our death: "We are ready to be offered up, to the fire, to the sword, and to the beasts, only to behold Christ, our Saviour and our Lord."

--Helvetius, that is, to the rude and severe youth. Pardon me, my brother, for the affectations and manners of youth, which, indeed, were not renewed by God, but now revolve incessantly in my most ardent breast. Recommend me to them.

Our Michael has deserted from the unhappy priesthood and has entered into the weaving of wool. My brother John still acts as a sacrificer, nay, as a pastor of the Uranians. James has taken a wife and become a shopkeeper. I wish that Anthony may be in good health; with whom, may you also be in perpetual health.

From Cappel, our monastery beyond the Rhine at the Tigurines, the second of May 1526.</output>
