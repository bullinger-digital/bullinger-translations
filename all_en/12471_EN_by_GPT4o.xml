    <p xml:id="regest1">Erb can be sure of Bullinger's friendship and therefore can dispense with introductory phrases in his letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- It greatly saddens Bullinger that [Johannes Engelmann] has stirred up a new conflict [in Montbéliard]. Erb and [Pierre] Toussain should stand together. An examination [of the believers] to be conducted by the pastors before the Lord's Supper is based neither on a directive nor on an apostolic example. Rather, both Paul's statement in [1 Corinthians 11:28] and Christ's behavior at the first Lord's Supper, to which Judas was also admitted, oppose this practice. The proposed examination is actually nothing more than auricular confession and leads to various abuses. Since the pastors are ignorant, it was right to seek help at the court [of Ulrich of Württemberg]. This is how the prophets and the apostles acted. Also, [the kings] Hezekiah and Josiah contributed more to the reform of the Passover feast than the priests did.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Erasmus [Schmid] died in faith. His widow [Martha, née Blarer] approves [the settlement between Erb and Schmid] and sends the receipt. She thanks Erb for his efforts and sends her regards to him and her children. She will write more to [Nikolaus] König. Schmid had settled everything before his departure, except for the matter of Cosmas [Meuchlin], who had to pay twice. The widow will entrust this matter to Schmid's brothers and respond kindly to [Meuchlin].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- What Veit Dietrich writes in his work [“To the Christian Church in Regensburg”] about the adoration of the Lord's Supper is inappropriate and blasphemous. From the Decalogue, John 4 and 9, Acts 1 and 10, and Revelation 22, he could have learned who is to be worshipped.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Emperor [Charles V] is only waiting for an opportunity to cause harm. Obviously, the Germans do not yet know this little Spaniard!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The half-baked church reform [of Frederick II] of the Palatinate is more harmful to the Reformation than Antichristianity. Why does no one want to reform according to the example of the apostolic church? Erb should continue to report on the events in the churches of the Palatinate and Lower Germany. Allegedly, Bucer is in Heidelberg to be able to participate. Erb should also inform about the decision of the princes in Heidelberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Luther's pompous funeral displeases Bullinger. Even the learned pagans advised moderation, and Stephen was also mourned only in moderation. Some already abolished [customs] are being reintroduced! Even though Luther was useful to the church in many ways, he also harmed it. What will his successors do now? In a letter [No. 2404], Bullinger urged Melanchthon to peace. What will he reply to this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The costly and fruitless religious discussions greatly displease Bullinger. Luther rightly disapproved of such meetings. The monk from Colmar [Johannes Hoffmeister], who wants to convert the world, instead danced [in Regensburg]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The Augsburg church is developing excellently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- On the morning of March 27, a terrible murder occurred. Alfonso Diaz, a judge of the Roman Rota, sought out his brother Juan Diaz in Neuburg an der Donau after hearing that he had converted to Protestantism. For 14 days, he tried to persuade him and even offered him a bishopric. He finally left unsuccessfully, but secretly returned and had his brother murdered by a servant [Juan Prieto], just as Cain once killed Abel. Allegedly, the murderers are imprisoned in Innsbruck.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Bullinger does not yet know what was decided [on the day] in Baden. A delegation of the Schmalkaldic League will request that no Italian or Spanish army be allowed to pass through Switzerland to Germany. The people of Zurich, Bern, and all others who have bridges and river crossings will rather accept a military confrontation than allow a passage.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Greetings to [Sigismund Stier], [Oswald Fürstenlob], Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger], and [Nikolaus] König.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Bullinger could not read through the letter again.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I thought long ago, most esteemed brother in the Lord, that I was so dear to you and united in fraternal friendship that you would know you need not use any introduction. Yet, in the meantime, you introduce yourself and apologize, as if you were not speaking to the heart of a brother. Know, therefore, that I am entirely yours, and I should speak no differently to you than to myself.</p>

      <p>I am saddened that Diabolandrum is stirring up new troubles by sowing seeds of discord. It is your duty, together with Toussain, to faithfully assist in the struggle. You rightly think that the private examination by the minister, which is neither commanded nor left as an apostolic example to the church, should be done away with and never admitted once removed. "Let a man examine himself" [1 Cor 11:28], says the apostle. But even the Lord Jesus, at that first and most perfect supper, did not examine anyone. He taught and admonished publicly, and even admitted Judas, though he had been admonished and warned beforehand. Therefore, the old church purified by the preaching of the word and not by private examination. This private examination will soon bring back auricular confession to us; indeed, it is nothing other than auricular confession. This examination will serve ambitious ministers to confirm tyranny, the lustful to fulfill their desires, and the greedy to accomplish their affairs. It will harm the church, not benefit it. You are right to seek help from the courtiers. For when ministers lack wisdom, but princes have it, one must appeal from ministers to princes. The prophets and apostles did this. Hezekiah and Josiah restored the Passover more than the priests did. These things must be impressed upon and inculcated in noble and good men. We will pray to the Lord to bless the matter.</p>

      <p>Lord Erasmus, with great patience and fervent confession of faith, and finally with the invocation of the name of Christ, peacefully departed to the Lord. His widow, having read your letters and heard mine, kindly accepted the matter and sends you here the receipt, as they call it. She gives great thanks for your kindness and labors and commends herself and the children of the excellent man to you and yours and to the prayers of the brothers. She will write more to Rhegio. Lord Erasmus died in such a way that he solemnly testified that he had satisfied the hostess in all things, where, however, a certain Cosmas was forced to pay a second time. She will refer Cosmas's case to the brothers of the deceased husband and will respond kindly to Cosmas.</p>

      <p>Vitus Theodorus wrote absurd, impious, and incongruous things with the scriptures about the adoration of the Eucharist. He does not know what it means to adore. He could have learned from the 1st and 2nd commandments of the Decalogue, or at least from the words of the Lord in John 4, [21-24], and the gospel history in John 9, [38], Acts 1, [3-11], and 10, [25f], chapters, Revelation 22, [8f]. But these men are very pleased with themselves. May the Lord have mercy on them.</p>

      <p>The Emperor truly nurtures a monster, and he is only waiting for an opportunity for his Spanish cunning. When the opportunity and ability to harm are given, he will act so energetically and fiercely that all will be amazed. People in German lands do not yet really know the little Spaniard. It is to be feared that one day they will experience it. May the Lord protect and preserve His church!</p>

      <p>The beginnings of the Palatinate are corrupt and depraved. The inept reformation will give more trouble to good people than manifest Antichristianity. No one wants to look to the apostolic church in reforming the churches, as if it were imperfect. Therefore, since we follow our own plans more than God's, we do not achieve what God promises to those who obey. I pray that you will always write to me diligently, if you can have certain information, about how things are going in the Palatinate and the other churches of Lower Germany. I hear Bucer has gone to Heidelberg, so that he may be Peterly in all costs. If you hear what the princes in Heidelberg are going to decide, please let me know, etc.</p>

      <p>Luther has passed away, and I wish it were happily! That funeral pomp displeases me. "Nothing in excess," even the wise pagans teach. The pious mourned Stephen, but only to sobriety. We are restoring many things that had almost fallen; we are recalling some things that had been cast out. Luther was beneficial to the church in many ways, but he also harmed it much. Let us see what his followers and successors will attempt. I wrote to Melanchthon and urged him to pursue peace. I await what he will answer.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Those colloquies have always displeased me. They have already been held so many times at incalculable expense and with no fruit, but even now there seems to be no end to the colloquies. The fisherman does not even learn from a blow. I attribute this stubbornness to one or two who think what they conceive is the best and irrefutable. I praise the deceased Luther, who never approved of these assemblies. The monk of Colmar, a converter of the perverse world, shows himself worthy fruits: "Let them dance, dance"; thus they reveal themselves.</p>

      <p>On March 27, at dawn, an unheard-of parricide occurred in Neuburg. For Doctor Alfonso Diaz, a judge of the Roman Rota, came to Neuburg on the Danube within a few days as a courier, where he found his brother, Doctor Juan Diaz, a Spaniard, whom he heard was defecting to the evangelicals. He dealt with him for 14 days, promised a bishopric, but when he achieved nothing, he left. He soon returned secretly and had a servant split his brother's head with an axe, just as Cain did to Abel. They say the parricides have been thrown into chains in Innsbruck.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The delegates of the Swiss have met in Baden. I do not know what they will conclude. The Schmalkaldic League sent a delegation to them about not allowing an Italian or Spanish army, if there should be one, to pass through Switzerland to Germany. It is certain that the people of Zurich, Bern, and the rest, who hold all the bridges and crossings, will never allow it. We would rather have a military confrontation with them, with God's help, etc.</p>

      <p>Faithfully greet Dr. Chancellor, the scribe, Gerold, Regius, and all the brothers. All the brothers greet you.</p>

      <p>Hastily, in Zurich, April 16, 1546. Farewell forever. I was not able to read it over again.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger, entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Matthias Erb in Richenweiler, preaching Christ, his dearest lord and brother.</p>
