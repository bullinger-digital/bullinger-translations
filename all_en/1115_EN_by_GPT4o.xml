      <p>Greetings. This evening, letters addressed to me were sent to a certain renowned merchant from our people and delivered by a certain messenger, but with an unknown author and without the author's name. You yourself will see what matter I am reminded of, for I have sent them enclosed with mine, so that you may read and judge. Indeed, a zeal for piety and love for our homeland is feigned; but because everything is useless, they are very suspicious to me. Perhaps some trickster or rogue wanted to fabricate these trifles and frighten us with such a tragic image and thus restrain us, so that we would not join our forces against the impious in any part; although in the meantime I admit it is prudent, in such slippery points of ulcerated times, to not rashly reject any admonition. But it will be yours to judge. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, December 20, in the year 1550.</p>
