    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A mocking German-Latin poem by a German about the Schmalkaldic bath. Heat up, Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]! Pour in, [Johann Friedrich of] Saxony! Shave thoroughly, [Sebastian] Schertlin! Cleanse, Father (or Barber) Charles! Pay up, Imperial townsmen, you foolish Imperial townsmen, who were led into the sweat bath by the bleary-eyed [Landgrave] and the Saxon amphora, so that you endure what they could not bear. The French, the Swiss Confederates, the Venetians, the indecisive King of Denmark [Christian III], and the English have made you great promises! Even your Word of God could not protect you. Alas, the Turk will also prove to be a deceitful fellow! You hoped that the peasants would incite rebellion against the scholars! But this rural mob preferred their (hay)forks to the spears! However, Nuremberg was wise enough to dance at two weddings, as it realized that you were completely intoxicated. Well then! Become wise by remaining loyal to the Emperor, so that it does not become necessary to warm up baths [like that] of Seneca for you!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Poem] by an unknown author: Heat up, [Hans] Baumgartner! Pour in, [Anton] Fugger! Shave thoroughly, you merchant! Cleanse, Father (or Barber) Charles! Pay up, Imperial townsmen, you foolish Imperial townsmen, who were led into the Spanish sweat bath by the mob of merchants, so that you endure what they could not bear. While you despised the strong Swiss and became unfaithful, you perished in your treachery. You also did not make room for Christ, who could protect the weak, in order to keep the deceitful societies of merchants alive. You placed your hope on the wretched rags, scraps, and goods, and thus the people will eventually perish with the rags. Nuremberg lacked wisdom, it danced at two weddings, deceived both camps, and did not remain faithful. Well then! Become wise by preferring Christ over goods, so that it does not bring joy to see you fall into the baths of the devil.</p>
