    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and book, which the printer [...] has delivered. Bullinger's guidance can prevent seekers from falling into false opinions or forgetting where they have set out from. Returning there would be disastrous, for the religion of Christ is incompatible with the old superstition, as it is - unlike some medicines - only healing in its unadulterated form. Has long awaited an exposition on the incompatibility of old superstition and Christian religion; with his two books "De origine erroris" [HBBibl I 12], Bullinger has brilliantly accomplished this task. Del Prato values this work all the more as the author himself has gifted it to him.</p>

      <p>Bartolomeo Del Prato to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>The arrival of the printer was very pleasing to me, as he brought me letters from you, which testify to your mutual goodwill towards me, and also a book, which will not only serve as a memento but also as a perpetual token of the same. But what kind of token? Indeed, one that I consider to be most precious. For while I am wonderfully delighted with this literary equipment and, as it were, the world of Minerva, this work of yours is so highly recommended in this genre by the authority of the author, the beauty of the material, and the great desire for knowledge, that I believe no commentary has been published in our memory that is either more commendable or more necessary. For what could people wish for more, especially in our age, when everyone desires to have the true way of divine worship and religion known, and there is great contention among different parties, which keeps minds in suspense, than for someone skilled in this way to arise, who would not only guide those willing to enter this path but also point out and block erroneous paths as much as he could. And since it is a great help for someone traveling, even if they do not know where to go, to know where not to go, and to remember where they have passed, the former ensures that you do not deviate too far from the intended journey or encounter difficult and dangerous passages, while the latter ensures that you do not return to the same place from which you set out. He will easily hold the right course who, relying on your, so to speak, itinerary, will not only be able to have both known but will also see a beacon shining brightly in the darkness of human life. In this matter, it is worthwhile to recognize our happiness and to lament the misfortune of our ancestors, who, deprived of such aids and using unfortunate pilots, either crashed upon the rocks of erroneous opinions or returned to the same place from which they had departed, that is, they imprudently relapsed into obsolete and false ceremonies. And since the ancient ceremonies and sacred rites of the ancients were supported by the natural superstition of men, while our Religion is founded on the institution of the one God, the Best and Greatest, which is most alien and abhorrent to the futile inventions of human superstition, we see that it has gradually happened that the minds of mortals are more inclined to that part to which their inherent vanity inclines them, wanting to recall and demand the divine religion of Christ to that deceptive and erroneous one of the ancients, not noticing how dissimilar the Christian Religion is when confused with that one. Therefore, those who are endowed with some knowledge of antiquity, so that they easily recognize the superstitions of those ancients in the ceremonies of this age, indeed seek the religion of Christ. For the more the same Christian Religion is fashioned after that old one, the more it degenerates from itself. Nor does the same thing happen in this matter as in the art of medicine, which concocts salutary medicines both simple and compound. Since the Christian Religion, taken purely and sincerely, brings salvation. But when mixed and compounded with others, it is corrupt.</p>
      <p>Having long considered this with frequent reflection, it often came to mind to wish that someone would finally emerge who, by writing such, so to speak, parallels of the old superstition and the Christian Religion, would demonstrate, as if by a commission of both, how they cannot concur, and how no concord can bring these together and (so to speak) tame them. You have emerged first, in my opinion, who would most skillfully, copiously, and learnedly undertake this task, by writing these two books on the Origin of Error, by which you must have obliged many, who, led by this your commentary or the thread of Theseus, will easily be able to extricate themselves from the errors of the Christian Labyrinth. You indeed have me greatly indebted to you for this, not only in the public but also in the private name, because besides publishing these books for the public benefit of all, you also wanted them to be a monument of your goodwill towards me, with which I will be all the more delighted, because they were written by you and sent to me as a gift, just as he says, the most acceptable gifts are always those which the author makes precious. But since I do not have the means to repay you equally, and to return the favor, I will certainly not fail to express my gratitude as much as I can, and to promise that it is placed with a grateful and mindful beneficiary. And otherwise, since I will have the book itself as a delight, it will not be possible for it not to come to mind from time to time by whom it was written and by whom it was given to me. Venice, November 11, 1543. Farewell.</p>
