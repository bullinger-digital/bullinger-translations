      <p>S. This man, requested by us and sent to us by you, as is your kindness, has arrived here. We would have retained the man; but he continually excuses himself for some reason, specifically saying that he cannot come because of this obligation. He could have stayed in Zürich if he did not want to come now. However, I believe he was honorably dismissed; for he was given two Rhenish florins. He tells us about that man from Constance.</p>
      <p>The situation is such that it can be said in one word, which is: if your prudence judges that he possesses the necessary knowledge and is suitable for us here, as much as you hear or can know about him, let him be here on the 21st or before March; but if he is not here by that day at the latest, we will immediately send to Lindau to seek another. The matter cannot be delayed any longer. All this has been told to him; if, however, he wishes to come himself, he knows what it means for him. Consul Tscherner thanks you greatly for your effort on behalf of the master, especially for the book given as a gift, and sends his most respectful greetings to your kindness, as does the other consul Ambrosius Martini. - From Italy, we hear that war is continually being waged in Piedmont and that the people there are unaware of the peace made; when I hear more, I will write. Father Comander and I also thank you for the book sent to us. I will think at some point about expressing my gratitude. In the meantime, may the Lord Jesus preserve you for a long time, endowed with many gifts of God, for His church.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 7th of March, 1556.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness as always, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord, most worthy of all honor, in Zürich.</p>
