      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, wise, gracious, dear sir, after you wrote to me recently regarding Master Rudolf Weber, I have made such efforts and inquiries that it seems to me he will be welcome here, although I cannot yet promise anything. If he is inclined to come here, I would earnestly handle his matter so that it would be known what he is about, and I would also assist him on your and his behalf to the best of my ability. I wanted to write this to you in good faith as a complete response to your last letter. I am writing to him in the same sense.</p>
      <p>With this, may the peace of God be with us all.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the 28th day of July 1534.</p>
      <p>Your well-wishing H. Jakob von Wattenwyl.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable, and wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
