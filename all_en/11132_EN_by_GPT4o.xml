    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not yet report on the council's response to the admonition from Zurich in his last letter [No. 1086]; the rejection [of the waiver of the catechism revision desired by Zurich] will be known to them by now. Wants to return [to Zurich] as soon as accommodation is ready for him; has heard that the house of Mayor [Matthias] Wyss is vacant.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to write, dearest brothers; for recently I have shown and revealed to you the state of our church as best as I could. One thing was missing from my last letter to you, namely the decree and decision of our council and people regarding the friendly admonition from the people of Zurich. However, it was not due to negligence that you did not receive this; for when I was writing, our council and people were still in session. And because I do not doubt that by now you are well aware and know what the letters from the honorable lords of Zurich have accomplished and could accomplish among us, there is no need to explain it to you in detail at present; in summary: "We do not wish to change the established order, even though sometimes we are inclined to change, nor do we assert that anything new should be introduced here." May God grant that the minds of all our people be changed and that everything we do may contribute to the glory of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am anxiously and eagerly awaiting news about the rented house. As soon as I receive this, I will depart from here on the very first day. They say that the house of Mayor Wyss is either vacant or occupied only by a single midwife. Please ensure, I beg you, that I have a house and let me know this soon.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the fifth of January, in the year 38.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the preachers of the word in Zurich, Bullinger, Leo, my dearest brothers in the Lord, pious and most vigilant.</p>
