    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Myconius has a lot to do on Saturdays, he can only write briefly and share that two days ago someone returned from the [Schmalkaldic] camp with the following news: Neuburg [an der Donau] and Rain [am Lech] were occupied [by the enemy] because they could not be defended by the [Schmalkaldic forces] located north of the Danube. The latter otherwise have sufficient troops, food, and money. They are also in good spirits. Furthermore, no one was injured during the occupation of the two towns. This news greatly pleased Myconius, while the Spaniard Francisco [de Enzinas] was beside himself...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The [Schmalkaldic forces] are asking the [Four Cantons] to occupy the lands of the Emperor [Charles V] and his brother [Ferdinand I]. Myconius has long supported this! The Five Cantons, which are too greatly feared, are to blame for it not happening. They could have been convinced, and if not, one should have trusted in God! The fear of the [Swiss] cities, so greatly blessed by God, is incomprehensible! God will probably have to humble them because of this. If Myconius were an influential person, he would do something! But as an old man, he can only ask God not to abandon His word.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Due to the Sabbath, I was unable to write what is on my mind. My duties hinder me. However, I cannot remain silent about this: Two days ago, someone returned here from the camp, who reported the following: Neuburg [an der Donau] has been captured and Rain [am Lech] has been taken back, because our forces could not defend them. They are beyond the Danube. Furthermore, there is such a great number of people that nothing is lacking. There is abundant provision; there is sufficient money; there is safety through God, as much as they could wish for; and finally, there is spirit. Therefore, nothing is lacking except that the Lord's help be obtained through devout prayers. Moreover, none of the soldiers were harmed, but were freely released; the citizens of the towns were also released with their goods, which they were able to carry away, along with their families. After I heard this, I was quite content, although Francisco the Spaniard was clearly beside himself.</p>

      <p>Regarding the matter that the Protestants are asking for, that the lands of either the Emperor or his brother should be invaded, I freely say what I feel: I have felt the same for a long time! However, the Five Cantons delay as they are to be feared. They could have been persuaded to see things my way, so that they too would have done their duty. But if they could not have been persuaded, I would not have omitted what is mine, trusting in the Lord. I cannot sufficiently marvel that after such great benefits from God towards us, the evangelical cities are so fearful, especially after such foul crimes of the adversaries, which they commit as if in contempt of God! I, a man of no account, if I were something, I would do something. But as I am nothing and weak with age, I can do nothing but pray that the Lord does not abandon His word; nor will He, but perhaps He will humble us because of our fear.</p>
