    <p xml:id="regest1">Stephan [...] has returned; Zwick thanks for the help shown to him. Thanks for [the copy of] Luther's letter [to the reformed cities of the Confederation]; before making a statement, the recovery of [Thomas] Blarer is to be awaited. He is also interested in the letter from the princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse]. Frecht writes that Bartolomeo Fonzio was drowned in Rome because of his confession, but already 13 evangelical preachers have taken his place. The Englishman [John Butler?] will report on the church in Konstanz. Ambrosius [Blarer] is expected [in Konstanz] and is unlikely to return to [WÃ¼rttemberg]; the reasons are not yet known.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>That poor Stephan has returned to us safely, most honorable Bullinger; I am grateful to you for the great diligence you have shown him.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for Luther's letter; for I was very curious to know what he would finally respond. As for what we think of these letters, you will hear later, when it will be possible to read them to our consul Blaurer; for he is currently very ill. However, we hope that, with the Lord's favor, he will be granted to us through the prayers of the pious.</p>
      <p>Regarding what the princes have written otherwise, I ask you not to forget your promise. Frecht writes that Bartolomeo Fonzio, a Venetian who was once with Bucer and you, if I am not mistaken, came to Rome with public faith given and received by the Roman pontiff and bore witness to the faith of Christ, for which he was ordered by the pope to be drowned. In place of this deceased, it is said that 13 evangelical preachers have emerged, who preach Christ in Rome against the will of the antichrist.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is nothing else to write. The Englishman, a holy and excellent man, will report to you about the state of our church.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household. July 28, 1538.</p>
      <p>We are expecting Ambrosius, and I do not believe he will return to the duke's domain. He has not yet written to us about the reasons. When he returns, you will hear.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
