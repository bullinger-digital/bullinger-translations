      <p>S. D. I received your letter, in which you promised a response to three certain sermons on the supper, in Amberg, the metropolis of the Upper Palatinate, in full. I am very eager to see your refutation; then it will be very worthwhile to silence the mouths of the foolish Pythagoreans, who, apart from the vain authority of their teachers and their "ipse dixit," can impose nothing. They now run around like rabid dogs, whose teeth, eyes, and faces openly demonstrate madness, more pernicious than the papists themselves, by the faith of a true man. I live, or rather dwell, among asps and basilisks. Believe me, brother, I bear the loss of 4000 gold coins, which I recently suffered, more lightly and patiently than this kind of impious men. If only I had moved my foot and made myself a participant in the company of the good when I was in Zurich two years ago; perhaps now there would be no need to lament over such great goods of fortune. Now, alas, having purchased a possession, which I cannot sell without enormous loss, I am bound here and held as if captive, not without great sorrow, because now, being old, I am forced to stick in the mud. What more can I say? I see no hope here for the establishment of true religion. I call upon God and all the pious to witness that I have moved every stone to erect the Lord's house, but in vain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have decided to spend the remaining time of my life in a corner, as they say, especially since I have suffered an irrecoverable loss of the goods of fortune, so much so that I am unwillingly forced to reduce my household.</p>
      <p>You mentioned certain books dedicated to someone I do not know. You can easily guess what needs to be done; I am tired of the inspection of these men.</p>
      <p>My agent is from Augsburg, called Hanns Weyhr; he invested 3100 florins for me at the French crown for ordinary use. Of this, he has annually received over 100 for his trouble; he owes me the principal and overdue interest of over 3500 florins and has received all the money in his hand and then left with it. I am told he is staying in Geneva under protection. I kindly ask you, if you could, through the city scribe or others, inquire from Bern whether he might be apprehended there; then I would ride after him myself or send someone, if it were possible, to recover something from him. Let me know, even if it costs a pot of money. I am riding this very day to the Reichstag in Regensburg. If I hear anything worth writing, I will let my lords and brothers know.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await the refutation of the 3 sermons. Farewell and pray for me.</p>
      <p>Given at Schlachteck, October 6, 1556. Yours, G. Laetus from Lemnitz, etc., Palatine councilor.</p>
      <p>[...] and highly learned... Bullinger, ge... of the church... dear lord... to hand. Zurich.</p>
