      <p>Greetings. Today a rumor reached us that the council and people of Lindau, even with the common people's protest, have accepted that infamous Interim. However, I believe this did not happen without some secretly agreed and made conditions, since it is likely that the imperialists feared only this one thing: that the most convenient use of this city would be taken from them by any means. They certainly sense something, which we pray to the Lord will be favorable to us. I certainly would not want Constance to be taken from Switzerland, a city wonderfully suited in so many ways either to be preserved by us or to be destroyed or at least miserably harassed. But we hope that the present assembly will grant something to the Thurgau region.</p>
      <p>Musculus is staying with us with his wife and children, a man commended not only for his learning but also for his integrity, whose letters we send attached to mine. The day before yesterday, all his furniture, along with books, was brought from Augsburg. You will ensure that he is appointed to some distinguished and populous church. There is no doubt about the soundness of his doctrine, much less about anything else that could disturb or offend any assembly. They say the Emperor is moving towards Speyer; from there, he may perhaps resume his plan and first compel Strasbourg, then other cities lying along the Rhine, to accept their bishops. The matter itself proves that this whole war, which the Emperor is waging with the Germans, was undertaken for no other end than to suppress the religion, which the madness of the pontiffs cannot tolerate. What remains of the evils will threaten not only our religion but also our liberty. Farewell.</p>
