      <p>Greetings. The person who delivered this letter has arrived here and indicated that he is going to ZÃ¼rich, asking if I wanted to write anything. Although I have nothing of significant importance, I did not want him to come to you empty-handed from me. Therefore, I dismissed someone who had detained me for two hours so that I could write a little. Letters, or rather a booklet, have arrived here from Augsburg, containing the response of the princes to the articles of faith that the Emperor proposed. They are trying with all their might to prevent any attempt at war, but to find another way, whatever it may be, through which peace can be achieved.</p>
      <p>They indicate a colloquium or council, in which they demand the freedom for anyone to speak without any trepidation.</p>
      <p>They demand these and other things with such effort that some hesitate to believe if the Emperor can resist. But you know how impossible it is, in this malignant storm, to hold a council where Christ can defeat the Antichrist. Therefore, the princes consult in vain and hope for a good outcome in vain.</p>
      <p>You have surely heard of the stratagem of the people of Braunschweig against their duke; it pleases me so much that I have not been able to forget it for some time.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that the people of Braunschweig understand the favor and help of the victorious God and be grateful.</p>
      <p>Granvelle's wife passed through here. Her deceased husband was carried over the Strasbourg bridge but did not enter the city; thus, he avoids the evangelical cities even after death. I hear that a good part of the Emperor's power perished at his death, which does not concern me much. It is certain: a great abyss of gold and silver has been removed from Germany.</p>
      <p>I hear that the people of the Five Cantons completely favor the Emperor, whatever they may shout against him and excuse themselves. They are a horror to me. I rarely or never think of the Emperor; I cannot forget them. May the Lord grant them a sound mind. Farewell with your family, Gwalther, Otto, and the others, in the Lord. In Basel, hastily... September, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, chief theologian, brother in his Lord.</p>
