      <p>Indeed, my most persistent or rather most constant father Bullinger, since the time I took on this ministry's care, silence has been necessary for me. How else could I have withstood so many and such great snares, assaults, and arrows of Satan? The Lord commanded me to be silent and also granted by His grace that I remained silent. Therefore, I am so far from regretting my silence that I rather give immortal thanks to God for it, and I pray that He may continue to keep me in it. However, as for my father Bullinger, I give thanks that he accuses me of silence, even though I had written not once but repeatedly about myself and the state of my church to our mutual friend Julius and to my dearest Simler, with the condition that they would greet you in my name and inform you of all matters. But since this accusation of yours stems from paternal love, it is most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>Henceforth, I will be more diligent. You indeed write of many new evils; but two have greatly tormented me, the death of our most learned and best Hyperius and good RÃ¼ger, and the severe illness of Calvin. We have lost many great and distinguished men within a few years, Philipp, Martyr, Musculus, Hyperius; if the Lord also takes Calvin from us, what else can we conclude but that God is hostile to us because of our ingratitude? Now you alone remain among the veteran commanders; for as for that other one, the old man, it would have been better if he had departed from here long ago than to have published his impious work, and I do not doubt that the Lord will preserve you at least until his death, so that there will always be an opponent in this present battle who will not allow an unjust triumph over the conquered truth. May the Lord grant him a better mind! Certainly, the Lord will not fail the church, but will continually raise up strong, pious, and sound teachers within it. Our Fabricius sent me an index of the works of our Martyr, which you are arranging to be compiled into volumes. This matter has mitigated my previous sorrow; for it brought me incredible joy, and I thank you for this honor with which you are arranging to honor such a man, an ornament of our Italy. Without a doubt, some Codrus will burst with envy. The one you write is preparing a bitter writing against you, sent here a certain very brief and quite inept apology; he especially attacks you for papal tyranny and the magistrate for injustice, and accuses the church of many and great errors; he claims he will soon demonstrate these, by which kind of writing he condemns himself and makes himself odious to every good person. But what can you do, when God reveals His judgments in this way? Certainly, the doctrine of your pious church and the equity of the magistrate and your humanity and piety towards all, especially towards our nation and particularly towards the pious and good, are well known to all pious and good people.</p>
      <p>Our churches here are doing excellently in Christian doctrine, and there is peace and concord among all. However, Satan is not lacking, who incites peaceful men to war. He previously stirred up dissensions here, as you know, and is now attempting to do the same; but, as I hope, he will not triumph over us. At the beginning, all the ministers of this Chiavenna and Bregaglia valley gathered and deliberated on remedies by which the churches might be preserved in true doctrine and peace and Christian love, and the mouths of the impious might be stopped. It was concluded that it is absolutely necessary to make known to the whole world, by whatever means possible, the Christian union that truly exists among us, and then to meet once or twice a year, following the example of the ancient and even recent reformed churches, to deliberate on matters pertaining to the reformation of the churches and to promptly address scandals that arise and extinguish kindled fires. And so that everything may have more authority and weight, after we have deliberated, we should communicate these matters with the pastors and brothers of the Chur church to be observed and also await their approval.</p>
      <p>It will happen that when the papists see us seriously meeting annually, they will gnash their teeth, the antichrist will burst, the weak will be encouraged, the pious will be strengthened, the churches will be established, and brothers from Italy will be stirred to join us. If the Lord grants us that these valleys may be filled with the pious of Italy, there is hope that from this desert some entrance to the land of Canaan may eventually be opened to us. May the Lord grant it. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since everyone approved this opinion, they judged that I should be sent to other pastors and churches in the Valtellina to hear their opinions. Therefore, I went, taking with me my companion Ulysses. All and each approved the plan and decreed that Ulysses and I should go to Chur for the sake of completing the plan in the name of all. However, when we returned, our college indeed permitted Ulysses to depart; for he was otherwise about to set out for Geneva; but they did not grant me leave, because due to the plague that is raging here, my presence is necessary for the strengthening and comforting of the church. Therefore, I remain at home and perform my duty as the Lord grants. Many have departed; not a few have died. We are in the hand of the Lord. Therefore, I ask you to commend this church to your prayers and those of your church to the Lord. Farewell, most excellent father, and keep me in your commendation. I also bid all the brothers to be well. Friedrich, who once painted the oral manducation with an open mouth, reverently greets you, Mr. Simler, Mr. Lavater, and Julius, and commends himself to you. Chiavenna, March 29, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant H[ieronymus] Zanchus. To the Reverend Father of the Church of Zurich, Mr. H. Bullinger, to be observed.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
