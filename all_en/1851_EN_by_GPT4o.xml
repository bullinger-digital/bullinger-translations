      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I would have responded to you long ago with some letter, most learned Bullinger; but due to my wife's severe and intense illness, I could hardly breathe at times to fulfill my duty of replying, and while she is better, I have been suffering from a headache for some time. However, now restored by the grace of God, I respond to your kindness, so that you do not think I have given up on this fleeting life. As a sixty-year-old, I both expect and desire the liberation of this body; I am far from wishing to see the wickedness and impenitence of the present age. O good God, deliver me at a good hour and preserve the remnants of your church; for everything seems to threaten the Germans with disaster or the day of the Lord approaching, because iniquity abounds and the love of many has grown cold. The Gospel sounds, is announced, and heard among us; but all discipline has perished more than ever.</p>
      <p>Our prince is expected daily; the lodging is prepared, which will receive him upon his return. Would that he be better and more pious than when he left; for the theologians of TÃ¼bingen have bewitched the man with their ceremonies, whence I fear, lest a new king brings a new law, and as the saying goes, new things are more pleasing. These matters perhaps at another time, my Bullinger, more verbosely. Pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, that he does not allow us, placed in the midst of wolves, to be scattered. Amen.</p>
      <p>The French here in Alsace and elsewhere have their captains, who secretly enlist an army. The assembly of some princes in Heidelberg has been dissolved; they say it has been transferred to Worms, which itself is now also dispersed. What will happen, time will tell. Farewell with these words, most esteemed brother in Christ, and greet your family, fellow ministers, Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, and pray for us, lest Satan write us down. Our people greet you. Hastily from Riquewihr, April 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Write back often to the decrepit old man Erb, who now sometimes leans on a staff, so that he may have some consolation from you in so many storms that are coming. Yet I hope for the sun after the clouds.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, defender of pure doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his patron and dearest brother.</p>
