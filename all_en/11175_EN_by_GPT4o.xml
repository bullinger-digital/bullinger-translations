Reports on the journey to Germany by [Simon] Sulzer, who brought back letters - especially from Luther and Jodocus Neobolus - and inquires about Bullinger's correspondence with Luther. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I now congratulate us both, my dear Bullinger, with the Lord being so gracious to us that there has finally been this ease of friendship between us, which will allow us to communicate freely with each other. For I have always had a constant hope for a future friendship with you (to finally speak frankly). I read your writings diligently and happily, gaining not a little fruitful knowledge from them, for which I am continually grateful to you. While reading your works, I immediately perceived in them a gentle spirit, a candid mind, and a very perceptive judgment.</p>
      <p>While conversing with friends, as often happens, I gladly expressed my opinion of you. They frequently asked me to attempt a friendship with Bullinger, even if only through a letter. Two things stood in the way: one, that I always hesitated to write to strangers, and the other, that in these turbulent times, I could hardly guess what your disposition towards me might be, especially since I feared that there might have been some who perhaps spoke ill of me to Bullinger, not because I was not fully aware of my good conscience in this common cause, Bullinger, but because those days were so troubled. But now, since by the grace of Christ it has been arranged that I could see and hear Bullinger in person, I confidently promise myself everything from him. I bless the Lord God of Israel, who has given peace to His churches, whose love we know is beautifully growing day by day. We have clearly heard with what faith and love you have handled our cause in your venerable synod, so much so that your integrity has brought great joy to all the pious among us. In our churches, nothing false and nothing but candor is heard about you in all things; for we proclaim to the brethren your humanity towards us and the many services with which you refreshed us while we were with you in Zurich. Therefore, they magnify the Lord in their hearts, who has so sacredly restored faith and friendship between us.</p>
      <p>Sulzer, in order to establish connections with the learned throughout Germany, undertook a rather long journey. However, he returned safe and sound, recounting many and various dangers, by the gods. You would gladly hear him narrate about the churches and brethren that Germany cherishes for us, with what love, sincerity, and services they refreshed his spirit. Many of them wrote to us simply and piously, showing us their hearts, longing for peace and concord with us with all their hearts, especially Luther and a certain Jodocus Neobolus, a man both pious and learned. I know from a letter of a certain friend that Luther greatly approves of Bullinger's qualities, which made me wonder if you ever wrote to him beyond public writings, even in private letters to Martin, and whether he in turn wrote to you. But about these matters. I refrain from further delaying your muses, dearest Bullinger; yet I know you will not take it amiss, whatever this might have been of my duty, as a devoted friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I will anxiously await your letter. Greet your brethren, your fellow ministers, diligently and lovingly in our name. Our Sebastian, a friend of Bullinger from the heart, greets you. May 26, in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>The same Peter Kunz, always most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious ecclesiast of the Zurichers. Zurich.</p>
