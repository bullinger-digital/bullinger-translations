    <p xml:id="regest1">Lüthard does not like it [in the Duchy of Württemberg] at all, because as a Zwinglian he feels humiliated and excluded; therefore, he asks Bullinger to enable his return to Switzerland - to the Zurich, Bern, Basel, or Schaffhausen area. He also requests assistance for the bearer of the letter, a colleague from the neighborhood, who was found to be Zwinglian during the visitation and was therefore dismissed; [Erhard] Schnepf is opposed to everything Swiss. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace be with you and peace from God, our Father, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear godfather, I let you know that I am doing well enough by the grace of God. However, I must show you my concerns and lament as my special dear and gracious lord and countryman. Namely, I let you know that this land is completely against my nature, and I do not know how to stay here. Therefore, my highest request to you, and I beseech you by God: If it could be possible that you help me return to my fatherland, whether it be in the area of my lords in Zurich, Bern, Basel, or Schaffhausen. If I could repay this, I would gladly do so. And help through God, through God help, and I ask you to let me know an answer by this messenger, whether it be bad or good, if I should hope to return to my fatherland or not. Also, you should know that we must endure much disgrace and contempt because of the pious Master Huldrych Zwingli, which could break one's heart. I ask you, my Master Heinrich, for the sake of your pious father and mother, to let me be recommended to you, as I trust you. For I do not know how to stay in this land; my heart does not want to accept the nature of this land. And I am praying, my dear Master Heinrich, and help me return to my fatherland.</p>
      <p>Also, you should know, Master Heinrich, that the good lord and brother was my good neighbor and did the best for me. However, when the visitation came, and he was examined and questioned about his teachings, especially concerning the sacrament (the Lord's Supper), he drew a collection from his bosom, in which Master Huldrych was involved, yet as much as Zwingli, he is suspected, as I know, and he is dismissed from the benefice. Therefore, I ask you most earnestly to also be helpful to him; for he has led an honorable life among us and always stood on the side of our confederates. And therefore, I ask you to do the best for him, wherever he might find refuge. He also has an honorable wife and a child. He was also initially involved in the lord's affairs and established the church. In summary: Schnepf is Schnepf, especially concerning our confederates. For what our nature is, he does not favor.</p>
      <p>No more, but greet your wife, my godfather, and your mother. God be with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given on the tenth day of July in the year 37.</p>
      <p>From me, Konrad Lüthard, always your willing servant.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear gracious lord and godfather, to his hands.</p>
