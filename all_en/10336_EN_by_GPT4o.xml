    <p xml:id="regest1">Encouraged by Bullinger's kindness and especially by Berchtold Haller, who has already recommended him to Bullinger in a letter, he dares to write to him. He is pleased with Bullinger's commentaries on some of the Apostle's letters, but asks him to also publish such commentaries on the four Gospels, as for the simple rural people of Bern, only the four Gospels still count as "the Gospel".</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Christian Danmatter sends greetings.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I hesitated, dearest and most pious Heinrich Bullinger, whether to write to you, partly because of my ignorance, partly because I was ashamed to interrupt your studies and affairs, with which you are undoubtedly overwhelmed daily. However, my burning love for you and your kindness, which does not reject or disdain anyone, finally prevailed. For whenever Berchtold Haller, the most faithful and pious minister of the Bernese church in the word of the Lord and your most loving friend, and I meet, we never fail to mention you, and both of us, for some reason, reveal that our love for you is greater than for other learned men, which I have also often heard from many other fellow ministers who pursue you with no less favor. He often reminded me to write to you. Yet I kept rejecting this, aware of my ignorance and childishness, thinking it would be importunate to trouble you with my unlettered letters. However, when recently Berchtold, my dearest teacher, wrote to you and for some reason mentioned me in his letter, you also showed your humane spirit towards me and others, giving me the opportunity to write to you. Therefore, most loving brother, I address you, having set aside my shame.</p>
      <p>First of all, on behalf of myself and all others, I give you immortal thanks for your tireless and unyielding labor, which you undertake for the benefit of the republic. For it is evident to me that many of us have been greatly aided by your expositions, which you impart to us by the grace of God, firstly because of the easy, pleasant, and at the same time most elegant style, which affects and delights everyone, and secondly because of the piety, which you teach piously, learnedly, and vigorously. Therefore, most learned Bullinger, we earnestly beseech you with great prayers, as you have done with some of the Apostle's letters, to undertake the same task in expounding the four Gospels. For although there are commentaries on these, they are sometimes more obscure and less clear than we, who are not learned to the point of miracle, can understand. However, among our rude and intractable people, whom we have in the upper parts of the Bernese dominion, it is the evangelists that we must constantly preach, while in the meantime they consider nothing worthy of the name of the Gospel except the evangelists, even if we inculcate that all the sacred scriptures are the Gospel to the point of weariness and nausea. Since it is therefore convinced to all of us that you were born to promote the glory of God, we unanimously pray that you will also comply with this for the glory of God and for the benefit of the republic. In the meantime, we do not want you to be unaware that we do not rely on commentaries, but on the scriptures, yet we want you to be convinced that we, who are ignorant of languages, are greatly aided by them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most Christian brother in the Lord, whom may He keep safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given in the village of Gerzensee, in the year 1533, on the 21st day of December.</p>
      <p>Cris. Danmatter, wholly devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the faithful and pious minister of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
