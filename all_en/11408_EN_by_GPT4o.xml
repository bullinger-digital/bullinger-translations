    <p xml:id="regest1">He has written to him in detail [No. 1294] and hopes that a reply is on the way. A dispute has arisen about the necessity of infant baptism for salvation; he himself rejects emergency baptisms and insists that baptisms should take place on Sunday before the assembled congregation, but he would like to hear Bullinger's opinion.</p>

      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus sends greetings to Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I sent you a lengthy letter at the last fair, most excellent man, in which I sought your friendship and resolution in my doubts. For it is fitting to extend helping hands to each other, since we are in the same ship. I hope you have responded briefly according to your innate kindness.</p>
      <p>Now a dispute has arisen here about the necessity of infant baptism. Some insist on it as necessary and tie it to salvation. I indeed responded that salvation is affixed to Christ alone, not to the elements, nor do I want midwives to baptize, but I desired that every holy office be conducted publicly before the church and that infants not be condemned if they are not baptized, but that the parents are at fault for neglecting or despising the Lord's institution. Here it is customary to baptize infants only on Sundays. I desired that they be simply brought before the church and thanks be given to the Lord for the gift and liberation from the greatest pain, and if they die in the meantime, they be commended to the Lord, lest we seem to tie salvation to the element or external action. I indeed know the Lord's institution; but we are brought back under the law if we are so bound by the command, when charity and faith do not demand it.</p>
      <p>You have my opinion, lovable man; I pray you add your refinement and correction. I prefer to be taught than to instruct.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most diligent pastor, with all your co-workers. Hastily, Emden, February 27, 1540.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent pastor of the Lord's church. Zurich.</p>
