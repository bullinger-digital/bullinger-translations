      <p>On the 24th of May at 9 a.m., Melchior Schloßer, that public courier, arrived here, bringing me your letters along with those directed to Calvin.</p>
      <p>He promised to return to me before he departed, so that in the meantime, if I wanted to write anything, I could prepare it; but neither did I write, nor did he return to me. For soon after lunch, after he learned from the consul that he did not have to stay any longer, he left without saying goodbye to me. This is the reason why I did not reply through him, as you requested. As for why he did not return to me, I can easily suspect the reason; for he did not want to stay with me for lunch; indeed, last winter he carelessly broke a tortoise that was entrusted to him to deliver to me on the way; hence he avoids me as much as he can. However, I have now encountered that younger Ritter, who arrived here, in case he might be able to provide for himself in some way with us. I thought he was a student of the Zürich church and had some stipend there, which he denies; he says he was compelled by poverty to come here because he sees that he cannot have a place there. I trust him little, although I am uncertain about his affairs; for his impudence has been known to me for a long time, and, unless I am mistaken, he is one of those who last year was publicly whipped by the decree of all of us for some fornication committed; I would like to be informed by you about his affairs.</p>
      <p>Now he has obtained nothing from me and will not obtain anything without your testimony, to whom we have referred him. As for what I should respond to your matters, they are these: D. Bartholomäus Metzler came to us on the 21st of March. I recommended him from you to the other brothers as well, and things turned out very successfully according to our wishes; since there was no position available at the time that could meet his and his children's needs, he voluntarily offered to stay at Steinen for a few more months rather than accept a meager position, from which he would have to be transferred to another not without heavy expenses; provided he could obtain this, that he be received as an "expectant," as they call it, until the Lord offers us a suitable position. We obtained this from the senate and, moreover, that if it happens that he is called to a church, he does not have to return here again, but can proceed directly to the appointed place with his belongings. They added two crowns for him and entrusted us to look after him honorably. He wanted to thank you in his name upon leaving, as he had decided to return to his own not through Zürich, but through Baden. This about him.</p>
      <p>To Jakob Zorn, after I understood from you how his case stands, I reply briefly that there are currently no positions available that I think could provide for him (as there are none), except for one, which is in the hands of the abbot of St. Urban; it is his to present and appoint someone who conforms to our doctrine to our senate. If he is received by that abbot, I do not think he should be rejected by the lords, provided he also has a testimony of honest conduct from the Zürich lords. He fears the examination, as I gather from his letters; he wishes to be heard publicly, not examined privately. Here I do not respond for all of us; I do not know what the senate will decide; otherwise, we usually examine those coming from the Zürich church here.</p>
      <p>That the entire region, along with the city, is so brave, rejoices me and all good friends from the heart. God be praised; may He grant us perseverance! Here, too, things are well by God's grace. Only those from Geneva are here now, desiring in the matter, not without the permission of my lords, whose citizens they are. Whatever is negotiated, I will let you know at any time.</p>
      <p>I will send the letters destined for Calvin to him as soon as possible. In the meantime, I have received nothing from him or the Geneva printer; if I receive anything, I will send it.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that you do not send my response to Calvin; I did not retain another copy. I am sending you 15 copies of the ecclesiastical doctrines, so that you may also send some to the author himself; I sent him 5 in these days, I could not impose more on the merchant from Kempten (where he now preaches), who was traveling to him; I would therefore like more to be sent to him. Keep the rest for yourself to share with the brothers you wish; if you want more, I will send them. Apiarius sends you and the author his greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote about Erasmus's son; he is not lying fatally ill, as I heard from his mother that he was understood. Among other things, you faithfully reminded me not to spend so much on him as his mother's poverty and frugality could not bear.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he came to me these days asking for money to go to some baths; for he thinks, according to the advice of some, that he can be freed from fevers. I indeed refused him this, as I did not understand his mother to demand anything else from me than that, if extreme necessity presses him, I should ensure that nothing is lacking for him while he is ill, which I promised to do in my last letter, but not to provide him with so much money that he can live at those baths for a whole month. Therefore, I would like you to inform his mother of this first; if she wishes, I will ensure he has it; but if she denies it, it will be dangerous for me to expose such a sum.</p>
      <p>Nothing new is happening with us that you need to know, except that Vannius, that famous musician, died in Interlaken on the very day of the Lord's resurrection, and Abel Mülhofer, that young man who last year was studying in Zürich with Schnevli, one from old age, the other from the plague. Meanwhile, I translated your writing against the Interim while I was bathing in the hot springs, having a scribe who wrote what I dictated. I will send the copied version to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>I reminded Bäler through letters about sending the autograph to you; whether he sent it or not, I do not know; he rarely comes here otherwise. As for my affairs, they are still pending. Most of the lords are not in the city. I will present my business to them when they return; may the Lord direct everything to His glory, amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Convey my greetings to the most esteemed lords and brothers Pellican, Bibliander, Gualther, etc. Musculus, Jodocus, Weber, Eberhard, and Nicolaus send their greetings to you. My entire family sends their most respectful greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, 26th of May, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of Christ and the church, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable compatriot. Zürich.</p>
