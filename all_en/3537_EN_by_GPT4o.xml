      <p>S. I cannot refrain, reverend father in Christ, from informing you of what has been done by us since your letter about the persecution of pious brothers in France was delivered to me. In the meantime, I will ask you to keep this to yourself or at least share it with a few of your colleagues, but in secret; for you know, with your prudence, that these matters cannot be safely entrusted to everyone. Furthermore, I would like you to consider that we have spoken much more vehemently than perhaps would be beneficial for the republic to perform and execute. But this is how we must deal with these people: we must demand the unjust to obtain the just.</p>
      <p>As soon as your letter was delivered to me, I immediately gave it to Mr. Philippus, my colleague, to read.</p>
      <p>It was agreed by common counsel to draft a certain formula, which we arranged to be offered to the royal legate through Aurelius Scytharcha, and this was done. But behold, opportunely, Aurelius unexpectedly arrived while we were discussing these matters. We then took him home with us and read aloud what we were going to send, which I have appended here, and indeed we added that we would ensure, and indeed shortly, that the legate would be expelled from our Confederation.</p>
      <p>However, when Mr. Aurelius hesitated and said that we were attempting things that were not within our power, we finally cornered him so that he left us astonished and disturbed, lacking counsel. But you should know, reverend father, that we have not threatened anything that we could not accomplish, unless we were considering the tranquility of the republic; I would prove this to be the case with sufficient arguments if I were with you. Mr. Aurelius returned to us the next day and explained to us at length how seriously he had advocated our cause to the legate. He also added that the legate was very concerned because the matter was of great importance.</p>
      <p>For this last alliance is not of much concern to the king; much graver fears are that the king might be cut off from passage, which would be particularly intolerable for the French. For whatever the king grants to our people, he grants everything for the sake of passage.</p>
      <p>The legate therefore considers, if it seems good to us, to go to the court by swift horses and advocate the cause of the pious there; however, he desires to have a certain formula and instruction from us on how to conduct the matter. To which we responded that it is not our place to prescribe how he should intercede in this or that way. From the outcome of the matter, we will take counsel; for unless the impious efforts of the papists are immediately countered, we will not fail in our duty. This is what has been discussed with the legate so far.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, our leaders and centurions return from war laden with the rich spoils of the poor, not without the greatest offense to many pious people. This matter also gave us the opportunity to attempt and speak more on this sentiment. Today, too, a frequent senate was given to us.</p>
      <p>On this day, this letter was prepared, and the council was well assembled. We returned to them with a proposal, as follows: "It is well known to them, our gracious lords, how the king of France has for some time cruelly persecuted the poor Christians; yet they have always been of good hope that he would desist from his wrath. However, we learn not without great heartache the contrary" etc.</p>
      <p>Thereupon we recounted at length how he deals so mercilessly with the poor people, also indicating here that he is more merciful to the Turks; likewise, we made it understood what we had the legate speak about, what answer we received, which we cannot accept.</p>
      <p>"They are those who would gladly speak of peace and unity of the lands; but if it could not be otherwise, that we must either anger God or men, we would rather let men go than God and begin to speak that one should have no alliance or friendship with such a tyrant, nor give him any support or help with either the better or other means for his cruel undertakings.</p>
      <p>But where our speech would reach, and what would result from it, we leave to your honorable wisdom to recognize. For you yourselves know how the common man is very sensitive and rebellious, and what is spoken of daily, how also all preachers in the common Three Points look to us in such a case, to whom such cruel raging of the king can be as little pleasing as to us." These and more, with a request, they would speak, advise, and help, how, where, and what to advise and help, so that the poor people may be relieved.</p>
      <p>The response of the senate: "Trust, dear lords and friends, our gracious lords have understood your proposal and request, thanking you, our dear lords and brothers, etc., for the friendly warning, with the offer to be indebted to you for it at all times, etc. And first of all, it is a great sorrow to us all to hear that such a one, with whom we are in alliance and unity, so cruelly mistreats our members; for we would not be Christians if such did not go to our hearts.</p>
      <p>Thereupon our gracious lords, court, and council have appointed five men; they shall ride out to the legate, inform him of all matters, and also make it understood at length and with seriousness what is at stake and where all this will lead in our lands, (also) warning him to be aware of harm and danger, and at the same time protest that if further trouble follows for him or the king, they will remind them that they have been warned in good time about this matter.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we ask you, dear lords, to proceed somewhat cautiously in this matter. He may then give an answer or obtain one from the king, which you and we may come to. But if there is no hope of mitigation, we cannot ask you to act against your conscience, and you must let preaching and God prevail. However, we are not concerned about the last alliance; we could well endure being out of it, hoping also to come out of it in time: it is about the rebellion and division of the lands. Therefore, we kindly ask you to, as much as you can answer for your office and honor, aim and speak for unity and peace." This was the summary of the response given to us by the consul in the senate.</p>
      <p>After giving thanks, we commended the church of Christ to them. These things, reverend father in Christ, I have thought to inform you.</p>
      <p>I know, believe me, that we have caused the legate and even our own to have scruples, which would not seem strange to you if you were fully aware and understood the state of our republic. May God direct all these things to the glory of His name and the safety of the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and convey my warmest greetings to all your people; all of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 14, 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zürich, his lord and patron, to be greatly respected. Zürich.</p>
      <p>S. I am sending here, most illustrious man, the letters of our Mr. Bullinger to your kindness; if you read them and explain them to the magnificent Mr. legate, return them to us.</p>
      <p>You will ensure that Mr. legate fully engages in this matter with other princely men, so that the king's mind is somehow appeased, lest this cruel crime against our fellow believers is perpetrated. But if your king, not made milder, continues to act tyrannically, we can in no way fail in our duty; we will therefore advise our people to break this alliance made with the enemy of our religion and what is more, which cannot be safely entrusted to letters. Does the king, therefore, take so much courage and spirit from the victories won with the blood of our people, that he now turns his arms against the bowels of our people? From the single accession of Calais, the French, made more insolent, now dare to insult God himself; what would have happened if the enemy had been defeated? Are we therefore supplying arms to the French against our people? Will our people never be safe and at peace? In the previous months, the French had suffered a defeat from Philippus, and yet this was borne with the gospel.</p>
      <p>Now the matter has been well managed: arms are drawn against the bowels of the church. Either we must thunder these things from the pulpit and mix heaven and earth, or we will be unfaithful ministers, and the innocent blood that is shed will be required from our hands. This whole business is not ours, but God's; for we serve the King of kings, and woe to us if the obedience you show to your king as men to a man, the King of heaven will expect from us. This has been extorted from us by love of divine glory mixed with anger and sorrow, that is, zeal for the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and remember that you are advocating the cause of Christ along with ours. Chur.</p>
      <p>Here Mr. Philippus would have signed, had Mr. Aurelius not come himself; therefore, we recited these things to Aurelius from the script.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, minister of Christ in the church of Chur. Our people, who are returning from the military, also say that a brother was recently burned at Dijon because of religion.</p>
