    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Even if Curione owed nothing to the parents of Hans Rudolf Bullinger, he would be inclined to contribute to his education solely in consideration of his special character traits, which are loudly praised by the people of Zurich in Basel, and all the more so because he is passionate about promoting young people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] However, since Curione's family is highly indebted to the parents of Hans Rudolf, it is a special concern for Curione to show a sign of gratitude and to support the family in their efforts towards the education [of the children], especially since, apart from religion and piety, nothing is more important than scholarship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Curione still clearly remembers how his entire family, fleeing from Italy, was received like shipwrecked people by Hans Rudolf's parents five years ago, and how the latter showed them so many kindnesses (even at their departure). He also recalls how he tested the language skills of Hans Rudolf and his siblings, remembered the character traits of all the children well, and concluded that they would one day be the joy of their parents, the ornament of their homeland, and a support of the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Since Hans Rudolf and his siblings lack neither role models within the family nor the means required to achieve extraordinary scholarship, it would indeed be highly reprehensible if they did not strive for perfection with all their might, especially since the present times tolerate no laziness and (which is of utmost importance) the voice of the heavenly Father calls them to do so through his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] To return to his dear Hans Rudolf (for he no longer knows how he came to speak of all the siblings in the course of his remarks), Curione wanted to assist him and recently sent him his booklet on the art of conversation [De omni artificio disserendi]. However, he learned from a letter [not received] from his father that the person who was supposed to deliver it did not hand it over. Curione is very annoyed about this, not only because of the loss of the book but also because of the letters that were supposed to be sent to Italy and contained important matters. O faithless people, oh dangerous times! Enclosed, therefore, Hans Rudolf receives a new copy of the booklet already sent to his brother Heinrich, to reach the goal of his studies all the faster.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings from Curione's entire family, also to Hans Rudolf's parents and siblings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Caelius Secundus Curio to Rodolphus Bullinger, son of Heinrich, sends greetings through Christ Jesus. Even if I owed nothing to either of your parents, dearest Rodolphus, your remarkable character, which I hear highly praised here in Basel by the people of Zurich, would still compel and move me (for I am accustomed to genuinely favoring young people and their talents) to love you, wish you all the best, and, as much as I could, educate you in letters and the liberal arts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now, since both I and my wife and indeed our children owe so much to your father, a most distinguished man, and also to your mother, a most honorable woman, that it would be very difficult to repay, I think I must always consider how I might at least be able to offer you something, which would serve as a testimony of my affection towards you and could also aid you in the cultivation of learning (which, apart from piety and religion, nothing can be more excellent).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>For I remember and hold dear how both your parents received us all with such affection and hospitality when we fled from Italy (it is now the fifth year), as if we had escaped a shipwreck, and with what kindness they supported us as we departed. I also recall observing your faces and silently noting your character, which even then gave no uncertain hope that you would one day bring joy to your parents, be ornaments to your illustrious homeland, and supports to the church of Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Therefore, since you lack neither domestic examples nor the resources required to achieve exceptional learning and the good arts, and since these times (which can tolerate no sloth or idleness) urge you on, and (which should most of all awaken you and others) the heavenly Father calls you with such a clear voice through his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, it would indeed be most disgraceful if you did not strive with all your might and sails (as they say) towards the highest goals.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>To this end, I too, dearest Rodolphus (for as I began to speak to you, I was somehow carried away to address your brothers as well), wanted to contribute something, and recently sent you my treatise on the art of conversation, but the person to whom I entrusted it (as I learned from your father's letter) did not deliver it; this caused me great annoyance, both because of this and especially because of certain letters and other very important and necessary matters that I had entrusted to him to be carried to Italy. But oh, faithless people, oh dangerous times! Therefore, since he failed, I am sending you another copy of that kind of booklet, by which (as I believe) you will be able to reach the goal of your studies more quickly. For we have already sent one to Heinrich, your brother.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell, my sweetest Rodolphus, and greet both your parents along with your brothers and the whole household diligently in the name of myself, my wife, and my children. Basel, 9th day before the Kalends of November, 1547.</p>
      <p>To Rodolphus Bullinger, son of the most renowned theologian Heinrich, most dear to me. Zurich.</p>
