      <p>Greetings. Although it is not necessary for me to burden your ears with the trifles of my letters and thus interrupt your most beautiful labors, since my brother, who must always be observed, and your most devoted Johannes Faber writes what is necessary in the name of both of us. Nevertheless, it seemed appropriate now to write to you myself.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I give thanks, most humane man, that you always remember me and so often wish me well in the letters you write to our same Faber; for he always shows them to me, as I believe, or informs me of what you have written.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I also give the greatest thanks for the booklets, which you have now sent as a gift for the third time, especially adorned with the more than sufficiently honorable writings of your own hand about me. Indeed, these writings will be pure relics for me and my children forever.</p>
      <p>Was it not enough that you labored for us in writing those, unless you also burdened your house with expenses for me? I understand that it is our duty to repay, if it were within our means; however, I will show some sign of gratitude at some point. If there is anything else, our same Faber will write.</p>
      <p>Farewell, greatest man, in the Lord Jesus, who may preserve you for us for a long time. Amen. From Chur, on the 20th of September, 1558.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in humanity, Philipp Gallicius. To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
