      <p>Greetings to you in the Lord, most reverend bishop of the church in Christ. For the great act of kindness you showed me last October, most honorable man, I give and hold the greatest thanks to you and all the fathers and brothers in Christ, and if I can ever repay it in any way, you will find me ready and grateful to you. But you may wonder why I dare now to trouble you with my letters, busy as you are with great matters, since I have never sent any to you before, and not only am I bothering you with my letters, but I am also asking, having received benefits, not having given any. However, my sense of duty and your unique kindness and piety towards God and neighbors have compelled me. For today, an old man brought me letters from Italy from a certain nobleman, in which he recommends a man to me greatly and asks that I assist a man of true religion and proven life, who is poor, so that his son may receive a stipend here with us, which certainly cannot be done at this time; for the number of foreign stipend recipients is already full, and he did not find Caelius, to whom he was recommended by many letters, here. Therefore, he immediately decided to flee to you, most humane men, and asked me to recommend him to you if it could be done in any way.</p>
      <p>Which certainly I do not dare to refuse, since your benevolence towards pious foreigners is well known to me, as this old man is described to me. Therefore, I beg and beseech you, most faithful bishop of the church, that if it can be done, you receive this boy, not unskilled in Greek and Hebrew, into the number of your poor. I would wish for many boys to be educated in true religion, especially the sons of Christian foreigners, who do not fall away as easily as the others. Farewell in the Lord, and if I can serve you in any way, I will gladly do so.</p>
      <p>Give my warmest greetings to your son-in-law, Mr. Ulrich, now becoming a father, and commend me to him. Given in Basel in the year 1553, on the third day before the Nones of August.</p>
      <p>Johannes Acronius Frisius, most devoted to you. To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful bishop of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
