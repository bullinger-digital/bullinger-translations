      <p>S. Just now, at the 9th hour of the morning on May 19, 1570, I returned home from the court. However, I could not refrain from writing to you about what I did in the senate, even though my verbosity may delay your holy affairs somewhat. I recently wrote about our bookseller being exiled on the previous Tuesday unless he splendidly and truly amended himself. But listen, I pray, to how the hypocrite revealed himself. He appeared on the very day when the deadline and exit were prescribed for him, in the most distinguished senate, not alone as before, but surrounded by his relatives and friends, who interceded for him as supplicants in his name and, as they claimed, by his mandate and commission, even promising golden mountains, obedience, conversion, and all the duties of a Christian man, thus hoping to obtain the benefit of impunity for the wretched man. The most distinguished Mr. Consul Willius, being a sincere and prudent man in religion, ordered the others to withdraw, but retained the bookseller alone in the senate and explored his mind with such a question: whether he sincerely confessed that paedobaptism, which the Church of Christ has used with great piety for many centuries, is Christian and consistent with Christ, the apostles, and their writings; whether he desired and wished to attend our sermons, thinking honorably and well of us like others. He answered the first question: that he did not at all recognize our paedobaptism as necessary or Christian, but considered it among the adiaphora (indifferent matters), and that children should first be catechized and then baptized; thus Zwingli himself once taught and committed his oral doctrine to writings and pamphlets; that he would gladly attend our sermons when we speak and present the truth and do not impose a sense alien to Scripture. His relatives, ashamed of the man's inconstancy, departed; but the bookseller himself was decreed exile.</p>
      <p>Then all the supplicants returned and asked the lords to extend the delay of exile until the upcoming fairs were finished, so that he could settle all accounts and depart without blame.</p>
      <p>However, since he had already been admonished for this matter long ago and ample time had been granted to him repeatedly to satisfy everyone, they ordered that he should not be visible to us beyond today, but should leave immediately. I, fearing that they might obtain a longer delay through their cunning and eventually recover the time requested through their pleas, during which he might sell his Svendfeldian pamphlets at the fairs in his usual manner and thus be the wicked author of greater discord, immediately approached Mr. Consul and diligently learned what had been done in the senate on the very day I mentioned. Having discovered the truth of the matter, as I wrote above, namely that he had odiously criticized the life and doctrine of the most holy Zwingli, publicly in the crowded senate, and privately in other citizens' houses, with good citizens present, listening, and reporting to me, I quickly asked Mr. Consul to allow me to appear in the senate and refute all such slanders. I also reminded him that it was time to bring forward certain things that I had hitherto passed over in silence, from which they would recognize that seditious man like a lion from its claws. Today was given to me. I entered. I delivered a speech for nearly an entire hour in this manner: first, to make it clear to them with what faith and great efforts that most courageous citizen and full of heroic virtues, Zwingli, had fought against, suppressed, and expelled such fanatical spirits, and had nothing in common with those errors with which our detractor now wishes to cover his impiety. Having gained their goodwill, I introduced the origin of the Anabaptists, who were first called heavenly prophets and enthusiasts, from your book translated into Latin by Mr. Simler, so that I brought in many principal points about their patriarch Muncer, both from your most complete book and from Sleidan's book 5, concerning his doctrine, progress, and death, so that the supporters of B[...] could see what kind of end those tumultuous men always met and on what frivolous and rash trifles and seditious foundations they relied. Then, on the occasion of that history, which did not deter many of Muncer's disciples from madness, I descended into multiple discussions, conversations, and disputes held in Zurich with those furious men, in all of which those wretched and insane little saints were convicted of error. Where also, with decent and preserved order under learned presidents, Mr. Z[wingli] conducted himself with other ministers in such a way that they reported a brilliant victory from all both familiar conversations and public disputes. This is testified by publicly expressed acts, which I do not have; however, I brought to light that concise and complete Caiaphas, who was so easily going to force Mr. Zwingli to recant. I did not conceal what followed that public dispute, namely the serious edicts of the most distinguished republic against seditious authors, etc. However, these did not satisfy the contentious spirits so much that, with the new monster Hubmeier having arisen, they believed they had appeared in heaven, having left heaven. What that factious man accomplished at Waldshut, everyone listened with raised ears. From here and there, I came to the peak of my speech, namely to make it clear to our people where the bookseller drew his slanders, which he vomited against the holy man, namely that Hubmeier often boasted in writings and speeches and even in letters to the most distinguished Zurich senate, arrogantly promising to prove by the word of God and Zwingli's writings that paedobaptism was not legitimate, but that children should first be taught and then baptized. After Hubmeier, a fugitive from W[aldshut], had hidden in Zurich for some time and was taken into free custody after a trial, he was admonished by the senate and ministers to now fulfill his promise. This indeed did not succeed from the 18th conclusion of Mr. Z[wingli] of blessed memory, especially since he did not interpret correctly what he had said about catechumens; for it could not be deduced and concluded from here and there that paedobaptism was therefore illegitimate. From this Hubmeier's slander, I believe our fanatic drew his similar slander. Therefore, I emphasized this to many, how disgraceful it was that he was forced to retract his boastful Thraso-like glory and could not even defend his slanders in appearance, but was completely dumbfounded and, after a feigned and spontaneous recantation, was finally driven to Moravia and paid the penalty. And since his disciples were made no better by the impudent inconstancy of that man, anabaptism was also prohibited in Zurich in 1530 by capital punishment.</p>
      <p>However, I left it to our senate to judge how great this rashness and impiety is, that the master was forced to retract his lies, which he had spread among the people and the nobles, but his disciple, namely our Frell, revives these from the dead and, as if under a new anvil of lies, forges and polishes them. I brought with me to the senate some pamphlets, which I had brought with me, about the baptism of the Anabaptists and paedobaptism in 1525 and the tricks in 1527, etc., all written and published by Mr. Zwingli, by which it would be clear to the blind and the barbers, as they say, with what vigils and cares that invincible hero was worn out before, by the grace of God shining forth, he could break through the pernicious gatherings of those furious men, refute erroneous doctrines, and keep and protect his afflicted sheep within the enclosures of tranquility, and that no honest man would say with the truth that the victorious Hercules of the Anabaptist Lerna had anything in common with those errors, which he had conquered with such great fortitude and success. However, having considered these things, which were most odiously called into hatred by our scoundrel for his doctrine, I also prepared to defend his life, not because I think Mr. Zwingli, a man praised throughout the world among all the pious, needs my defense, but because I thought it was not right for our B[...] to be confirmed in his proud contempt by tolerating and keeping silent about his slanders. Therefore, he openly blurted out more than once: "What are our preachers? Drunkards, adulterers, usurers, bankrupts, warriors, just like your doctor Zwingli, who did nothing but act as a warrior and ended his life as a raw soldier, thirsting for blood." I showed many things to the contrary, that Mr. Zwingli from the beginning had to swallow many things and that Ahab, not Elijah, was the disturber, although he was accused as such by the king and courtiers; many slanders were also heaped upon him, but they were mere lies fabricated and spread by malevolent people, whose avarice and profit were greatly diminished by the reformation of the Zurichers. His apology, sent to the Swiss legates in Bern in 1523 on July 6, still exists and should be examined, and no less publicly is your apologetic book against Fabler, the Viennese bishop, and Mr. Gwalther's apology for Zwingli, his father-in-law, in everyone's hands, not to mention what is brought forth in Sleidan's true history, in all of which it is clearer than the midday light what the cause of our unfortunate Cappellan war was, not Zwingli, as the common people blame, but there were many civil causes and seditions and the slanders of the enemies gave rise to the blockade of supplies, which Zwingli, although he tried many times, could not prevent, nor did he advance into battle as an armed warrior breathing slaughter, but according to the custom of the country, hoping to settle the dispute, as had been done before. But with God deciding otherwise, he bravely fell for his country and the Christian religion and most steadfastly confirmed the doctrine, which he had peacefully and usefully professed in Zurich, with his martyrdom and blood as a seal. To now attack such a man with slanders and to wickedly reopen some wounds and warfare, I do not know what, is the impudence and rashness of our Frell, etc. To these and many other things, I added a list of those whom he himself infected and seduced with his poison. I also recalled to their memory your confession, to which the Rhaetian Curia subscribed, in which the subtle Swencfeldian with his superfluous subtleties and arguments was completely exploded; unless they wish to defend and preserve that confession, we cannot serve them with a clear conscience, as we wish to live and die in that confession, constantly with Christ as our guide and God as our supporter.</p>
      <p>And what should have been said before: I also showed Frell's own handwriting, in which he does not hesitate to call us all Arians, as if we assert that Christ is a creature, as if we therefore deny that he is God by nature. In one rush, I recalled many things of this kind, which the wretched man had rashly and obstinately done in contempt of the republic, the ministry, and civil peace and honesty. Afterwards, I urged the senate not to allow themselves to be further imposed upon and deceived, nor to permit him to offer books for sale at future fairs, but to treat them and their master in such a way that no one in the future would be exposed to their poison to the devil's jaws, etc., and thus I finished speaking and left the senate. What they decided on all this, Mr. Consul himself later told me with his own mouth: There were many who thought he should be imprisoned: but the milder opinion prevailed, not to do so, since otherwise he is weaker in body than to be able to bear chains.</p>
      <p>However, it was decreed that, as soon as the senate was dissolved, four of the superiors, among whom was Mr. Pontisella, were appointed to search and examine the house and all the chests of Frell's house and to gather all kinds of books, whatever he had stored or displayed, into one bundle and to ensure they were brought to the court. This was certainly done with great diligence, and many Svendfeldian pamphlets were brought to me by the order of the polytarchs. It cannot be said how deep a nest of erroneous pamphlets was found there.</p>
      <p>Thus, I think, the ability to spread poison among curious and factious people, of whom our Rhaetia perhaps harbors more than is suitable for the professors of the gospel, will be hindered.</p>
      <p>Then, as for the bookseller himself, it was decreed that the polytarch would lead him out of the gates in the usual manner the next morning and, by the intervention of an oath (which he will never take), he would be exiled from our city and all of Rhaetia and not return until he is recalled. However, the butcher's time was extended until the next Monday. What will then be done with him, I may perhaps also include in these letters, which I wrote immediately after the action on Friday. - What was done with the butcher is not worth mentioning; for I myself advised that they should approach him only after the fairs were finished, and this on this occasion: The bookseller, after he smelled this evening what was to be done with him on Saturday morning, left voluntarily in the evening before, so that he would not be forced to hear the form of the oath; but he did not escape far, only out of the city to the nearby bishop's castle, seeking hiding places among the papists, so that he could slander us more odiously among the enemies, and also to manage his affairs more conveniently through his supporters, of whom he has not a few in the city, and to seduce more. But all good people also doubt whether he took this counsel from the one whom he should have had most against him, namely from my colleague, who immediately after that action publicly from the pulpit and now for the fourth time, relying on his wealth, impatient of labor and the impenitence of men, resigned from his office with great displeasure of the whole senate, saying that the good are expelled, but many wicked scoundrels are cherished and kindly treated within the walls. But although Mr. Consul, Pontisella, and I had agreed not to trouble you with this wound before the time, I am nevertheless compelled to mention it to you because of that heretic, so that you may more easily understand where he takes and raises his crests. More about this most troublesome business next time, in which I have been able to swallow nothing so far for the sake of fostering concord among us; but eventually they will burst forth and be ashamed, who are little conscious of their legitimate vocation. When I learned that our bookseller had joined the papists, I arranged with the consul to deal with the bishop, so that he would not want to harbor that plague odious to the senate; moreover, so that some seditious people would not raise their clamor, I advised the same to defer the butcher's business to the end of the fairs; thus I think it will be. However, the sum of my colleague's importunity is: he perceives no amendment or fruit arising from his sermons; therefore, he will act like a farmer, who sows the seed, then ceases from labor and rests and observes how it wants to sprout and rise. This is a wonderful method and, in my judgment, to be avoided by all of us, lest we seem to have shamefully deserted our station in this difficult time for the sake of wealth and a happier state of the world. But, as I said, more about this next time; in the meantime, we will see whether he will persist in this purpose. Now I have presented enough troubles to your humanity. I pray, forgive me for his incredible benevolence towards me, and always have me committed to your paternity. Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. G[antner?], Mr. Bonettus, and Mr. Campellus, etc., greet you. I wrote this on May 23, the day our synod was convened here by the brothers, whom I expect. May the Lord deign to illuminate us with his spirit, so that in all our institutions we do not deviate from the orbit of his law, but that all we do may conduce to his majesty and our salvation. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. 1570. Chur. I bid Mr. Ernius farewell.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I pray, the letters; for I wrote everything hastily, indeed hurriedly.</p>
