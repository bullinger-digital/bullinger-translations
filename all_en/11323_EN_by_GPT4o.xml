    <p xml:id="regest1">Adam Frey told him on June 12 [in Schliengen] about reports from Zurich regarding the hostility of his wife [Agathe Studler]; she is particularly supported by the new bailiff in Baden [Jost von Meggen] and is perhaps not without reason suspected of having poisoned Frey. The pious and patient sick man hopes for Bullinger's assistance; Gwalther requests on his behalf to intercede for him in conversations with council members when the opportunity arises. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the twelfth of June, most kind father, I was with Adam Frey, who complained to me greatly about the injuries, insults, and threats from his wife. There were indeed some who reported many things to him about this matter. There was also a citizen of Zurich who exposed all of his wife's plans to him; he shudders at her name, threatens all sorts of dire things, and proclaims that she will avenge the captivity she endured. Nor are there lacking vultures, who, induced by the hope of prey, flatter the most pestilent harlot. There are those who promise help. Among these, however, the leader is that bailiff from Lucerne, who will reach Baden, with whom she, pretending some kinship, confers many plans. He gave a not insignificant gift to his wife. He promised help. Meanwhile, this excellent man, pious and otherwise remarkable for his patience, is not a little disturbed. He fears that she might harm him with her deceptions, he dreads that he might be reduced to extreme poverty by her cunning, and finally, he fears that the favor of the Zurich magistrates might be alienated from him. However, you are not unaware, dearest father, of the suspicions that have long been conceived among you about his illness; for there are indeed many who perhaps not falsely suspect that this morsel was offered to him by his wife. The other doctor, who passed away, said this to the same Adam. This woman, who is now treating him, who previously did not want to reveal the cause of the illness to anyone, threatened, moved by the wife's atrocity, to expose the whole matter, namely the cause and author of the illness. This, I say, she reported the whole matter to me, that Adam contracted this illness from poisoned food and that the provider of this meal was his wife. Adam asked me to write this to you. He implores your advice in this matter. For as far as can be judged so far, these things will also be revealed by other witnesses from this woman. He hopes that you will do what his most friendly person would do. I ask you to take up his cause, if perhaps the conversation arises privately among some senators, so that a good, pious man, and most loving of his country, may not suffer any harm, ensnared by the plots of a most wicked woman. He has conceived hope of recovery. I also hope well for him. May God grant that we have not conceived a vain hope. I wanted to pour these things into your bosom in his name, since he himself requested it. Please, explain what should be done in this case.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write now. May you consider these things with fairness and goodness. Please convey my most familiar greetings to your wife and mother, most kind matrons, and indeed the whole family, and especially the assembly of your children. Farewell, most kind father, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>From Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, June 15, 1539. Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
