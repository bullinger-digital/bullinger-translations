      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Westheimer told me that you have the works of Cyril, and Boethius is not yet finished; therefore, I cannot write about the price or the pages, as they have not yet been collected. However, you will soon receive a list of all the books printed here with us.</p>

      <p>Luther passed away in February, as I learned from someone who attended the funeral. The Papists rejoice that he has been taken from the living, but they do not consider that they cannot escape the wrath of God unless they repent.</p>

      <p>It is said that the Emperor intends to stay in Metz for a few days, either to collect money there or to completely extinguish the flames of the Gospel. Some spread the news that the Emperor intends to spend the night in Strasbourg, and it is possible; nor do I doubt that the people of Strasbourg will receive him most honorably and in an imperial manner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Margrave Ernst, having his court in Pforzheim, called to himself four preachers from Strasbourg; for he is gravely ill. What he is doing with them, I do not know, although I am certain he is contemplating something about the reformation of the church before he departs from here. I also know this: the Emperor wrote to the Margrave that he suffered greatly this winter and had no rest day or night because of the wolf he has on his thigh. He does not want to acknowledge the present mercy of the Lord, which corrects him. He is like Pharaoh, having a hardened heart.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>May the Lord open the eyes of his heart, so that he may recognize the truth of God and not persecute the Gospel of Christ Jesus.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In Bonn, when the Emperor's mandate was published, the elderly bishop gave a most sweet speech before the nobles and all the people about the true Emperor, Christ Jesus, who can destroy both body and soul, as I received from someone who saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears. Meanwhile, as he was admonishing the people to constancy, the envoy of the Landgrave appeared, who consoled all the nobility and the people themselves, so that they should not care at all about the Emperor's threats. They held a public prayer in that place to God, and all returned home with cheerful spirits.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You undoubtedly know that Schnepf, the ill-fated bird, has passed away. Farewell in the Lord. Many are dying here from a pestilential fever. They rave for a few days, then they give up the ghost. Farewell. Basel, March 25, 1546. Yours, Gastius.</p>

      <p>I would like you to share this with Mr. Theodor and Mr. Pellican, most beloved men and teachers in Christ, Gwalther, etc.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
