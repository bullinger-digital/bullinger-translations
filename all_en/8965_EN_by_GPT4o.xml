      <p>S. I am writing briefly now, most reverend father, because I have recorded a few things in the acts, which are not yet completed, so that I can send them, and it is better to observe tomorrow's subcommittee, which will be held here, as it will undoubtedly provide something new in the manner of others. The main topic will be the tithes, the nature of which is far different than you imagine; nor is that tumult free from the fault of the nobles of the Valtellina, as you will soon abundantly learn from the response of the subjects, who will make it clear with public authority and writings that the blame lies not with the community, but with a few individuals against the will of the community.</p>
      <p>It is provided and established by the native laws that if private persons possess such invested fiefs, they can be transferred from private uses to communities if requested, and there is no longer a place for minor tithes in Rhaetia, unless the usage has lasted beyond human memory, which certainly was usurped by the Beccaria family for a span of three hundred years; but then they were subject to the jurisdiction of Como when that correction of the laws was added. Now, since they are entirely subject to the Rhaetians, they think that with the cause removed, the effect should also be removed. But what is this to me? I do nothing here except present myself as familiar to them, so that I can extract the matter conducted and the decrees that are sanctioned from them. - As for the apology, it was not my intention to write it myself, but for the senate of the Three Leagues to write for me with testimony, and thus my apology would be sent. I have otherwise sufficiently experienced the humanity of these people; but with what face would the most honorable senate reject the apology, the contempt of which would reflect no less on them than on me? But I will gladly acquiesce to your advice, for which I thank you; you will know that even the thief, who is accustomed to being heard in assemblies, is preferred to Christ. Meanwhile, I will observe this man, the polyp, and live for myself in many things, not for others. I will not neglect, if yours have demanded from him; for he has affected me with greater injury and is not rarely in sight, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lord. July 22, 1572.</p>
      <p>I will write to Mr. Simler another time, whom I wish well along with all the others.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli (Iconius).</p>
      <p>I have safely received all those new things from the Netherlands, and we give eternal thanks; but I will certainly return them soon with others. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
