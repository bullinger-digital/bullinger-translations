      <p>Dear lord and brother, as I recently wrote to you about how the Lord of Savoy sent his envoy to Bern and how the Bernese dismissed them, the following true story has since occurred, which I have from the envoys from Baden: The Genevans have made a sortie and have burned about 16 houses of the Savoyards, fought, plundered, and brought back to the city whatever they could seize. In response, the Savoyards have armed themselves. However, many well-meaning Bernese have been moved by the plight of the Genevans, and secretly, noble and good-hearted people from Neuchâtel, Nidau, Biel, etc., have set out for Geneva through impassable paths, gathered together, and become about 500 strong, having elected leaders and commanders. They were followed by young lord Ludwig von Diesbach and the brother of the treasurer Nägeli. When they arrived near Nyon, a fierce storm came upon the 500 men, and the Savoyards had gathered against them, numbering about 2000 to 2500, surrounding the 500 and not only intending to turn them away from Geneva but also to slay them. Von Diesbach saw the great danger and urgently requested, with a castellan of the duke who also arrived hastily, to ride to the army for the sake of peace and to dissuade them on both sides; for it was feared that a battle would ensue. However, the castellan delayed (hoping that the strong, well-armed army of the duke would destroy the small band). The castellan wanted to eat first. But as they were eating, the rumor came that they were fighting, so they fled. And the Savoyards lost the victory, and the small band triumphed, so that now the duke's envoys in Baden, not without tears, called upon the Confederates to help and advise, to speak and make peace; for the poor people are in great fear and dread. They lost about 200 honorable men in the battle, etc. In summary: Not many envoys have ever called upon the Confederates more lamentably. Also, the 7 places have not been more friendly and willing in 4 years. The banished are almost half forgotten. Thus God knows how to make a way for His own. May God continue to be gracious to us!</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 22nd of October 1535.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
