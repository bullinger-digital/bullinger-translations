    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings. As a youth, Gessner, during his classical language studies, which the addressees enabled him to pursue, accidentally came across Martial's epigrams and soon noticed the typical weaknesses of the Latin language of the time, although he liked the author. Later, however, he gradually developed, strengthened by his newly acquired knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, an aversion to the poet, as the obscenities found in the epigrams, which can only be warned against, defile the reader; therefore, he decided to remove all obscenities, and in some cases entire epigrams, [in the present edition], taking the origin of the medical art in antiquity as a model and considering the epigrams as medicine for the mind; he worked with considerable time investment and proceeded conscientiously. The collection, now cleansed like the Augean stables, was not arranged randomly and in just a single book, but in such a way that the epigrams are as easy to find as possible; the reading now not only brings joy but also serves education; the principles of selection and arrangement are extensively explained in the conversations in the appendix; Maximus Planudes already achieved something similar for the cleansing of Greek epigrams, as Raffaele [Maffei from] Volterra testifies. He asks for indulgence for interventions in the arrangement and occasional emendations; however, letters are added to the epigrams indicating their original place: the Greek letters and also numbers with them, indicating the order of their creation (which can also counteract any impression that Gessner might have included something not belonging to Martial); this also makes it easier to find the places in the commentary of Domitius Calderinus, and in addition, a concordance is attached according to the notes of Jakob Micyllus, which tabularly indicates all differing epigram numbers and should be consulted when using the commentary. To those who might take offense that Gessner made a distinction between dirty and pure epigrams and demand an integral work, the comedy phrase "Follow your mother, you piglets!" [Aristophanes, Plutus 308. 315] can only be answered; Gessner has indeed worked out his book for himself, the Muses, and the youth, which gives the best reason for hope. His announcement, directed to the people of Zurich and associated with the hope of using the edition in school, is justified by the fact that it faithfully and carefully promotes both the church and religious and secular studies; he asks for a friendly reception by the educated addressees, who never disappointed his expectations. Greetings and best wishes.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished gentlemen, Felix Frey, Provost of Zürich, and Heinrich Bullinger, Caspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Rudolf Gwalther, preachers of the divine word, and the remaining professors of divine and human wisdom in three languages, patrons and esteemed teachers, Konrad Gessner sends his warmest greetings.</p>
      <p>After I, as a young man, esteemed patrons, had acquired the rudiments of the Greek and Latin languages through your benevolence, I began to apply myself to poetry as soon as I thought I was somewhat capable. While I was eagerly engaged in this, I happened to come across the epigrams of Martial and took more pleasure in reading them than was appropriate. As a result, I made some progress in poetry and the knowledge of the Latin language, but instead of gaining a better understanding of things and ideas, which should have been the focus of a young mind, I became acquainted with many and various kinds of vices, which tainted my mind, as that poet's era was plagued by them. For even the mere contemplation of illicit matters is a significant part of the crime.</p>
      <p>Then, gradually, as I grew older and became more equipped with the readings of the Holy Scriptures as a kind of antidote, I developed a certain distaste and aversion to that poet. However, I could not entirely restrain myself from occasionally picking up the book to read only the more decent parts for the sake of my mind, but even then, many obscene things would present themselves against my will. Since I clearly understood what had harmed me, I could not, in good conscience, refrain from warning others and publicly declaring my own losses, so that others, especially young people, might guard themselves in the future and not be polluted with greater harm than I once was. For even among the most ancient people, before the art of medicine was discovered, those who were afflicted with any disease would publicly display on dedicated tablets in temples what had been beneficial or harmful to them, until a method of the art was finally established from many collected experiences. Similarly, I now judged it my duty to proclaim to all what I had found harmful to the medicine of the soul. However, after more mature deliberation, I devised a remedy for this poet's evil. Although both my age and my profession now call me away from these studies to more serious matters, I have eagerly undertaken this labor for the public good.</p>
      <p>For I have cut out and discarded whatever was of a more sordid nature, whatever was indecent, shameful, obscene, unspeakable, monstrous, or that might in any way present an occasion for improper thoughts to the untrained minds of readers. Thus, I have abolished entire epigrams - either because they contained nothing healthy or sacred, as they say, anywhere, or because of one or two verses or as many words of improper meaning -, while in other cases, I only cut out some part, so that no vice might be contracted by a healthy body, provided that the complete meaning seemed to remain intact. And I did not spare even those that might seem slightly lascivious, so that the utmost care would be taken for the sake of the youth. Indeed, not a little labor and time were consumed by me in this task. Everything had to be read, and many obscure passages had to be carefully examined, lest anything more shameful might escape my notice.</p>
      <p>Having separated these things and, as it were, having cleansed the Augean stables, I did not want to randomly compile the remaining epigrams into a single book, but I arranged everything according to several commonplaces, so that not only would candidates of the Latin language have a source from which to draw its pure abundance as from a clear fountain, but they could also easily find whatever they sought. This is useful in many ways, especially if someone wishes to imitate this poet's example in a similar subject, as they can immediately take in hand those things that delight them most by reading.</p>
      <p>If the chief philosopher of the academy had read this poet beforehand, he would undoubtedly have banished him from his Republic further than all others: not crowned with white wool, nor with his head anointed with precious ointment, as Homer once was, but driven away with pitchforks and stones. However, if he had then seen him reborn and purified, as he is now, he would have wanted to recall him with a reward offered, as one who could cheer and teach minds with honest and witty verses, composed elegantly and politely, and divert readers from worse pursuits, which idle men are captivated by. But the reasons for my undertaking are more fully explained in the dialogues written for this purpose and added as an appendix to Martial. Maximus Planudes also once achieved the same in Greek, as Raphael Volaterranus mentions in his anthropology: "for he collected the epigrams of the ancients, having cut out the more lascivious ones, into a single volume, now commonly scattered, and distinguished by subjects."</p>
      <p>However, if any epigrams in this work should seem not quite suitable in their places, I ask for forgiveness. For there are some of such a nature that, unless you force them, they can hardly be assigned to a specific head. And it was enough for me that, if not entirely, at least in some part, the poems would fit the places assigned by me; although sometimes they fit no more than a cat with gray eyes fits Minerva. I have indeed attempted to provide as much as the material itself allowed me. There are some that could be inserted in multiple places, but are placed in only one, so that repetition would not cause any annoyance. Furthermore, in many places, I have corrected the text, partly as the meaning clearly required, partly after inspecting various editions.</p>
      <p>Then each epigram has its own letters of the alphabet with a title attached, indicating the number of the book in which it was previously read. I used the Greek letter α in the book of Spectacles, which, although it precedes the others, is not inscribed first nor found in ancient manuscripts; yet it is not doubted to be Martial's. I chose not to distinguish it otherwise, as it is of a certain subject; only one or two epigrams have been removed from it. The following books are all indicated by Latin letters, the first by a, the second by b, and so on.</p>
      <p>Next, we added numerical characters to each letter, showing which epigram of this or that book was previously in existence. For example: The title of the first epigram, where Martial speaks of himself, is "To the Reader a 2." This indicates that this epigram was previously the second in the first book. I did this so that no one would suspect that anything foreign had been added to Martial, and so that in the Commentaries of Domitius Calderinus, the same places could be conveniently found if anyone inquired (especially some professor or schoolmaster, for many are obscure), immediately. Therefore, we noted the numbers of the epigrams, which in various editions (especially those with commentaries, and all others printed without them) differ greatly in order and position in several books, immediately after the annotations of Jakob Micyllus as in a table; these should be consulted by anyone who wishes to transition from this or other editions to the commentaries.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if there are any who, as people are now, are displeased that the impure has been removed from the pure, that gems have been selected from the dung heap, and who shout that it is not appropriate to prove their wit in the works of others, that they prefer the book whole, as it was written by the author himself, and complain indignantly about such things: to them, I would not even respond with a grunt, unless perhaps with that comic phrase "Follow your mother, you piglets." For they indeed deserve the name of pigs, whose minds delight in such filthy wallowings. Let them defile themselves as they please; but let them leave me alone, for I have worked out this book not for them, but for myself, the Muses, and the boys of good hope.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I have rightly decided to dedicate this work to all of you, most distinguished men, because you all equally and diligently promote the truly pious institution of the Zürich church and the better studies in sacred and secular matters. And it is indeed most fitting that such a work, which I hoped would someday be of use to your gymnasium (to which I owe the beginnings and progress of my studies), should be offered to none other than you, by whose benevolence and generosity I have devoted myself to good letters almost from childhood to this day. Therefore, I beg and beseech you, most esteemed lords, most pious fathers and teachers, to interpret this monument of gratitude towards you, however humble, with kindness, and to receive it with the serene countenance, which is your innate candor everywhere. I promise myself this all the more easily from your humanity, since you have never yet disappointed my expectations in any matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long for the benefit and glory of the Christian church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, on the Nones of March, in the year of salvation 1544.</p>
