      <p>Praise be to God always through Jesus Christ, on the 24th of October 1550 in Milan.</p>
      <p>My humble willing service and everything that I can offer with body and goods, always at your disposal, gracious worthy dear sir, etc.</p>
      <p>Your letter and gift have reached me; for this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, soul, and strength. May God, our Lord, grant that I may deserve and be able to repay it. It has delighted my heart to hear of your health and tranquility; may the Lord preserve it for you for a long time. The news that has been written to you from Augsburg, I have understood well. May God the Lord let it happen that the plague and the honor of God are. It is commonly said that the inquisition, which was announced in the Netherlands and Antwerp, is supposed to be taken back in all things. May the will of our Lord be done. The emperors have taken Africa, a small town in Barbary, by force; it is said that His Imperial Majesty will hand it over to the Knights of Rhodes. Regarding the Council of Trent, it is said that the Pope is not willing, saying that enough councils have been held, etc.</p>
      <p>If you write to me, please write in Latin, although I cannot write to you in Latin, etc.</p>
      <p>Justice is completely dead here in Milan. May God have mercy on the poor people.</p>
      <p>That in England all things are in peace and the believers in Christ are greatly increasing, all Christians have gladly heard; may God let it come further into the whole world. It is understood that Laelius has gone to Saxony and that you are expecting a letter from him from Frankfurt. May God increase His grace upon him. In the past days, I have been in Bologna with his father and have spoken much with him about various matters. In summary, he judges both Laelius and those like him to be insane.</p>
      <p>May God enlighten him.</p>
      <p>Dr. Balthasar Alterius fell asleep in the Lord in the past month of August.</p>
      <p>Herewith a package; I have received it from Venice with the order to send it to you. Once you have received it, I humbly ask you to let me know in response.</p>
      <p>I have let many pious people see your letter; they all greet you and yours. I desire to come to you this winter; may God our Lord let happen what is to His honor and our benefit.</p>
      <p>I have a small animal, called a dormouse, against the fates at the miller, as I came to Bergamo, which I want to send to Dr. Gesner. The little animal is alive; I would have liked to send it alive, but it is not really possible.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet all the faithful in Christ. I ask you to kindly accept my writing. If I can serve you, I will not spare myself; you will find me willing. Farewell. Remember us in your prayers, for punishments are being prepared for us. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Useless servant of Christ and his followers, Francesco Bonett from Bergamo.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
