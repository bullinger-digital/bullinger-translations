      <p>Greetings. Once again, I must trouble you with reading my unpolished letters, most venerable lord father, if indeed it would be bothersome to you, which I do not think, whatever has flowed from the hands of the most sincere and excellent man, Mr. Scipio Lentulus.</p>
      <p>He has sent me two letters in these days, both full of news, which I will write to you in order.</p>
      <p>"From the first letter: Rome, April 16, 1575. On Saturday, the judges appointed in the case of Lord de Foix were together until night, and although it was rumored that he had been acquitted, nevertheless nothing was completed, so the Pope himself took up this case for consideration, and they say that all the difficulty lies in the fact that he once pronounced a sentence against the edict that Huguenots should not be admitted to the dignities and offices of the kingdom; however, it is said that he will enter the city the following week with the pomp usual for legates. - A thousand soldiers, who were enlisted to be sent to Malta, have been dismissed, as it is certain that no danger from the Turk threatens this year. As for the other thousand, who were enlisted both in the Florentine and Urbino territories, since they had already begun their journey, they continue their journey having received their pay. The commissioners, who had been sent by the Castellan to establish a militia in the papal territory, have returned, and those who are registered to belong to it will be given leaders by the Pope from the first nobility of the cities and towns to which they belong, and they will be exempt from many burdens. The Duke of Urbino sent the Pope the proceedings, as they call them, drawn up against the Counts of Montisbellus and Pietro Bonarelli, to show that they had erred gravely and that nothing had been done against them unjustly.</p>
      <p>The privileges of the Duke of Ferrara, which his ministers had offered, the Pope ordered to be examined by Cardinal Albano, so that he may report back to him whatever they contain. To this prince, Cardinals Farnese, Justiniani, Gambara, and others wrote, honoring him with the title of Most Serene and Highness; to whom, when Alexandrinus wrote, calling him Most Illustrious and Excellent, he returned the letters sealed.</p>
      <p>Genoa, 8. In the senate, the Pope's brief was read, as they call his letters, in which he signified that he would send his legate to them, and urged, indeed commanded, that they abstain from arms, under penalty of excommunication. The new nobles wanted to be admitted to dignities; the old ones, with their families and belongings, had left the city, so the people began to be in a bad state and suffer damage. The Pope, however, commanded that they adopt the form of government that was established in 1547, and it was believed that this would be done, and the legate was expected today, for whom three galleys had been sent to bring him. The Duke of Savoy had arrived at Nice with his galleys, where he was to await John of Austria, to accompany him to Italy.</p>
      <p>Venice, April 23. This week letters were brought dated the 21st of the previous month, which announced that the city of Constantinople was suffering from a great scarcity of grain, and therefore the Turk would arm no galleys this year except those that are for the defense of the maritime borders of his kingdom. The one who had been sent to lead the captives back had not yet returned; but he was expected daily. On Tuesday, Mr. Pietro Medici, the brother of the Duke of Florence, greeted the fathers in the college, whom two senators accompanied there and showed him the treasury, the halls of the palace, the mint, and the shipyards. Here it is rumored that Orange has been captured; but it is not believed.</p>
      <p>Rome, April 23. The Pope spent four days in the Villa to go through the proceedings, as they call them, drawn up against Mr. de Foix, since the cardinals who were appointed judges in that case did not agree among themselves, and he awaits letters from the king concerning those matters that Mr. de Birago had written about this case. Meanwhile, Mr. de Foix remains in Tuscany. On Sunday at the 19th hour, a bastion of the Castle of St. Angelo, which Paul IV had ordered to be built, collapsed and crushed many shops that faced the river. - In Genoa, it was reported that the spirits of those citizens were still suspended and that nothing had been changed. The legate entered the city on the 16th and was received cheerfully, which is believed to mean that he will settle the discord, although some say he will do nothing, as the troubles have grown too strong. - In Ferrara, they write that the Duke offered the King of the French a great sum of money to cede to him the rights he has in the Kingdom of Poland.</p>
      <p>From Malta, they write that the Turk will not send a fleet to Italy this year, not so much because of the plague and famine in his kingdom, but because he fears that his brother, who fled to the King of Persia, will cause him trouble.</p>
      <p>From Spain, it is written that John of Austria set sail from there on the 19th of the previous month towards Italy, where he was to be in April.</p>
      <p>Venice, April 30. They say that these lords have decided to send two legates to Genoa to negotiate peace; but so far nothing has been accomplished. The brother of the Duke of Florence has not yet left here, who, since he has been here, has indulged in pleasure and delights.</p>
      <p>From the latter: From the court of the King of Spain, April 1, 1575. After the feast days were over, John of Austria set sail for Italy, leading with him 40 cohorts of Spaniards and bringing a great sum of money. Vespasian Gonzaga refuses to return to Africa as governor and to be the chief counselor of John of Austria in matters pertaining to war. The king seems inclined to confer the rank of chief commander in matters pertaining to war in the Milanese territory to Mr. Antonio Colonna, a position previously held by Caesar Gonzaga.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard ordered that nine thousand soldiers be enlisted in Italy, of whom four thousand will be commanded by the Duke of Boiano, three thousand by Tiberius Brancatius, and two thousand by Stephanus Muttinus.</p>
      <p>Genoa, 22 of the same month. Moronus began to negotiate with both parties, urging all to lay down their arms and decide civilly on their discord and controversies, bringing many examples from histories to show that such tumults will eventually bring ruin to the country and liberty.</p>
      <p>But so far, words have been given to him, as the people look entirely elsewhere and do not want to be subjected to the nobles in any way. The old nobles, who had left the city with their families and belongings, have been recalled. However, the people do not lay down their arms, but rather kill their enemies wherever they find them, so much so that it is thought the cardinal will leave there with the matter unresolved. The old nobles utterly refuse to admit anyone from the people to the number of nobles; the people, however, do not allow themselves to be governed by the old nobles unless some of them have been elected to magistrate offices by the free votes of the people. From each faction, six have been elected to inform the cardinal of everything, so that he may not be ignorant of what each party seeks.</p>
      <p>The cardinal urges those appointed by the people in the government to prohibit small firearms and to do something about the wine taxes in particular in favor of the people. ... unless some of them have been elected to magistrate offices by the free votes of the people.</p>
      <p>Rome, 30 of the same month. The Duke of Urbino has been confirmed by the Spaniard the grant of twelve thousand gold coins annually. The same Spaniard orders that 200 cannons be cast in Milan, from where many chests full of arms have been exported to be sent to Naples and Sicily. The prefect of the Castle of St. Angelo appointed 30 leaders for the soldiers who have been enlisted in the ecclesiastical territory, along with a thousand other foreign soldiers. On the day dedicated to St. Mark, the Pope prayed for the people as usual, and about 80,000 people were present.</p>
      <p>Locusts infest the fields of Corneto and Pyrgi, to which the Pope sent a certain Frenchman with 12 horsemen to destroy them with certain minerals. In the maritime places belonging to the city of Siena, such a multitude of locusts has grown that they have brought incredible damage, so the Duke of Florence has appointed 12,000 men to destroy them.</p>
      <p>Lyon, 19. From letters brought from Paris on the 15th. It is reported that the Huguenots had an audience with the King of France and requested that all foreigners be entirely removed from the dignities and offices of the kingdom and that two cities be given to them in each province for their security with free exercise of religion, so it is believed that the king will rather come to arms than accept such conditions.</p>
      <p>Naples, 27 of the same month. The Sicilians grant the Spaniard certain taxes in aid of the war, which belonged to them, which amount to 180,000 gold coins annually.</p>
      <p>Venice, May 7. The illustrious Soranzus, appointed bailiff of Constantinople, was preparing for his journey there. Sforza Paravicino requested dismissal, claiming that he finally wants to rest from military cares, as he is worn out by old age and poor health."</p>
      <p>Chur, on the day after the feast of Pentecost, in the year etc. 75.</p>
