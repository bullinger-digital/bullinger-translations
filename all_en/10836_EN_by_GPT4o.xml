      <p>Greetings. The Italian Angelo, who was a companion and student of Bucer for two whole years, a learned and exceptionally pious man, is coming to you, whom I commend to you. I ask nothing else than that each of you make himself available to him. For he is very eager to meet and greet you. In doing this, you will perform an act of charity and indeed of humanity, which, while it reigns among the pagans, ought to flourish even more among us Christians.</p>
      <p>Today, my dear Bullinger, concerning the Saxon convention. Great heat, a long journey, a weak and affected body, and yet I will go, with Christ keeping me safe, which may perhaps be my last journey. Meanwhile, pray to the Lord that He may do for the concord of the churches what we, with a sincere mind, as God knows, strive to achieve for the public good of the churches. Write to us soon with friendly and general letters, which we may use for the benefit of the churches as the occasion arises. However, I beg you, do not mention the reasons.</p>
      <p>I similarly commend this excellent man to Pellican and Bibliander, with whom you may share these letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>18th of April, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang KÃ¶pffel.</p>
      <p>To the most learned men, Heinrich Bullinger, Pellican, and Bibliander, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
