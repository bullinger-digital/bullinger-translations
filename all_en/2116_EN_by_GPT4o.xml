      <p>S. D.</p>
      <p>The later letters you sent arrived before the earlier ones; for Marcus Hoffmann brought those you wrote on November 22nd promptly, and he also presented the writings on the death of the most illustrious man, Sturm. Some think this incomparable man would have been so if he had not observed the Emperor so much; however, others believe that he did many things to preserve public peace, which many (ignorant of the causes) have taken as slander. May the Lord grant the Republic of Strasbourg more upright men who wish to preserve both the complete religion and public peace, and with God's help, keep them safe. You too will pray for the well-being of those among whom you live; for your happiness is linked with their integrity, and unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman watches in vain. The later letters, which were delivered later but written earlier, I received on November 19th a little late, but I felt no loss from it. You respond diligently enough to mine; I command you to always do so, and I request that you write elegantly, so that I may continually see the fruit of your studies. I have no doubt that you can live as honorably and safely with my singular friend Mr. Burcher as you could with me; you should see to it that you revere him as a father and regard the lady as a mother. The Greek Testament has not yet been sent from Lyon, and unless I snatch some copy from our friends under the agreement of exchange, I do not know if I can send you anything now; however, God willing, you will have the sacred Greek codex, and that shall be your good year. May the Lord bless you, my son, in soul and body, and grant you a happy entrance into the year and a much happier exit. This is what your mother, your brothers, your sisters, and indeed the whole house pray for you from our Lord God. See, my son, that you fear God, that you pray diligently, that you live holy, honestly, and frugally, and that you consider all time lost that is not spent on studies. Everyone in our house is well; I alone am afflicted with severe headaches. May the Lord grant me health. Our Margarita Lavater has given birth to a son, Felix; may the Lord bless him. Regarding books, know this: buy Cicero's speeches and see that you use them cleanly, yet diligently. Your master promised in his letters to me to buy larger books and kindly grant you their use. But I know he is not without a Latin lexicon or dictionary; use it too, but purely, so that he sees you as a man, not a pig; it is piggish to fill books with filth. Otherwise, I do not want you to buy those large books, which you might later sell for half the price or not be able to carry away.</p>
      <p>I received the expense sheet and find no fault in it, except that you spend 2 cruciates in the barber shop. I, who shave my beard here, do not spend more than half a local batz. You must not give young noblemen's shaving money; you are a student. Großhans will later receive a small bag. However, continue to record each item on paper, and what you record after these, I will send after two months; I keep what you send me. 6 batzen was also a large ship's fee. Mother seemed to report a monster when she read from your letters that you feared you might not have enough boots for this winter. What do I hear? So every year I will provide you with nine pairs of boots? For the week is now perhaps the 15th since you left; and then you took three new pairs of red, ash, and black color. If these three are not enough, at least 3 more will have to be provided; thus, you will wear out 6 pairs each year, while two suffice for me in a year. I think you are made of flesh, not iron, or certainly you wrote in error, which I am entirely convinced of; otherwise, it would be quite beyond the crooked bean song. You say your studies are progressing successfully; I commend you. Ensure they proceed successfully; may the Lord grant grace. My brother suffers more dangerously from his leg day by day and does not restrain himself as usual, hence the disease must increase. May the Lord restore him; I fear he will die from this disease. His son, my nephew from him, remains always the same in the Italian or Piedmontese military; I wish he would someday cheer his father with frugality and dedicate himself to holy labors, having deserted the military. I could not send the tortoise, nor did it seem worthwhile; you will always find friends who will lend you one temporarily, nor would I want you to forget what you have learned. I send a selected cheese to your host; offer it to him for a good year.</p>
      <p>Pray for all happiness for him from me, from your mother, and the whole family; add from yourself too, what is fitting for you. I write letters to the lady; I included a very beautiful silver coin, I know; offer it to her and pray for all good for her from me and your mother and family; add from yourself also a favorable prayer. Nor is there anything you should add; for I send these to them on your behalf, although I also send them for the sake of sowing friendship; for I love Mr. Burcher and hold him in high esteem. Offer or present the letters with your own hand to Mr. Peter Martyr and Mr. H[ieronymus] Zanchus, and conduct yourself courteously and dutifully towards such great men. If they are not in Strasbourg, keep the letters until they return, or send them back to me, unless you can certainly ensure they are delivered into their hands. You will also greet and wish all happiness to Mr. Garnerius, Mr. T. Gypson, whom I am surprised to hear is now with you. Greet your companions S. Fabritius, P. Stubius, M. Farnerius; tell them I urge them to spend all their time on studies. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet your whole family. All of ours, especially your mother, wish you well, as does Jacob Sprüngli, who was recently made tribune of the people and triumvir of our republic. Zurich, December 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, in the house of Mr. Burcher in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>December 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>From the κειμηλίοις of I. R. Hottinger. To be communicated to Mr. relative Heinrich Hottinger, professor, etc.</p>
