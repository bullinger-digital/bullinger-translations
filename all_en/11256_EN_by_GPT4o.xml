      <p>In Überlingen, someone posted a rhyme on the church door, which was taken down and circulated. The town clerk sent me a copy of it out of curiosity. It reads as follows: I ask here without any deceit, why are there so many devils and only one God?</p>
      <p>Answer: Dear friend, now have patience, it is the fault of the monks and priests.</p>
      <p>If they had consumed as many devils in all their masses as they did the Lord God, the devils would have been completely driven out and none of them would have remained.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, January 13, 1539.</p>
