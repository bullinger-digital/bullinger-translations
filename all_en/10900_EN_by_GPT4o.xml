    <p xml:id="regest1">Kaspar [Megander] would like to leave Bern only in the autumn. The Bernese do not engage with any foreign lords; there are no agreements with King [Francis I] of France regarding the [Vaud], Emperor [Charles V] is very friendly in his letters. In Bern, Zurich's prohibition of passage is indeed appreciated, yet in Murten, a recruiting Solothurn captain was let go. He has heard from a Frankish captain in French service that [Francesco], the Marquess of Saluzzo, has defected to the Emperor and that King [Francis] does not yet have a capable army, although France alone, due to the excellent Queen [Margaret] of Navarre, would deserve much fortune; the King wants to get 12,000 mercenaries from Bern, and 30,000 would be sent to him from England. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, dear godfather, Mr. Caspar in Bern did not have time to write to you, but instructed me to tell you in person that he has changed his plan to leave Bern and will remain until autumn. He hopes the church in Bern will be well secured, and therefore he will be able to leave with good reason, as he has brought his memory to a great decline with unbearable work.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, Mr. Caspar and Tremp have shown me that they are willing in the city and country to go idle of all lords. They also have no contract with the king regarding the conquered land, so they owe him nothing. They also say that the emperor is very friendly towards them in his writings.</p>
      <p>Caspar also showed me that many in Bern, who were not previously favorable to my lords of Zurich, now praise them highly; they believe they have acted wisely in prohibiting passage. However, Mr. Caspar is still concerned and complains much about the instability of the Bernese. Recently, they captured a Solothurn captain, who was recruiting their people, in Murten and released him under certain conditions, which greatly displeases Caspar.</p>
      <p>A captain of the Landsknechte, who was riding home with me, is a servant of the king, a Frank, a well-spoken, well-read man, knowledgeable in Latin and German, well-versed in the gospel; he told me that the Marquess of Saluzzo has defected from the king to the emperor. The king does not yet have a proper army. He has about 6,000 mercenaries and 6,000 Landsknechte; they are not very diligent, and the camp is full of whores and boys. He says if France were to have any fortune, it must be due to a woman, the Queen of Navarre, the king's sister, who cannot be praised enough for her faith, love, wisdom, and virtue, etc. Furthermore, I understood from him that the king's practices continue among us without interruption. When I told him the Bernese do not want to go to war, he said the Bernese would still give the king 12,000 men, and he continued, you will see what happens with time; he also said the king of England wants to send 30,000 men to the French, etc. May God direct all matters for the best.</p>
      <p>Caspar, Rellican, my brother, and other good fellows greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Kappel, on the 8th day of July 1536.</p>
      <p>Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear godfather.</p>
