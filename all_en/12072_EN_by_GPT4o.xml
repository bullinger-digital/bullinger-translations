    <p xml:id="regest1">The current messenger [Heinrich Tischmacher?] could not have come at a more convenient time; Bullinger is aware of the controversial atmosphere in [Bern], and Rümlang does not want to describe how even among prominent citizens, things almost came to blows. A combative barber [...] from Zurich, now a citizen of Bern, would have fought to the death for the Bucer supporters if others had not intervened; a good man, unsuspecting of any evil, was injured and warned in a hostile manner; the dispute was about the [Bern] Disputation [of January 1528], which the Zurich citizen opposes. The [Bern] churchmen of both hostile parties will clash as soon as the council gives the signal; the council knows the situation, which is why it delayed its decision for so long until now it comes to the worst end; the council fears a riot; it is regrettable that no one intervenes; if Bucer knew about it, he would be ready to fight immediately. Last Friday [October 24], the Small Council summoned the preachers and urged the factions to keep peace until the currently absent patricians return; then the matter will be discussed in the council; if no one intervenes, the situation is on the brink, for even the Papists are allowed to express their opinion. He knows that the Bucer supporters - [Simon] Sulzer and Beat [Gering] - will persistently insist on a synod; should they achieve this, Rümlang must fear the voting of the simple [minds], for many expect material benefits from those they vote for; there is much flattery, and only a few are aware of the consequences. Therefore, he asks [the Zurich citizens] for help; it is claimed [in Bern] that they are in greater danger than ever since the beginning [of the Reformation]; [the Zurich citizens] should act and not wait; since the disputes over the Word of God, the sacrament of the Eucharist, and the authority of Scripture ultimately concern the authority of the [Bern] Disputation, this matter should be reported to the [Zurich] council; given the restless situation, they should be convinced to write to the [Bern] council and offer mediating assistance; the scholars of Zurich should also do this; the matter of faith knows no territorial boundaries. The [Bern] council is anxious, but the Zurich citizens are held in high regard and will be heard, as the Zurich citizens could otherwise accuse the Bern citizens of rejecting their advice; presumably, the [Zurich] council will not be able to refuse this request either, as it owes the [Bern citizens] everything in worldly matters; why should it not promote the cause of Christ, he who has come to the aid of the enemy [Charles V.]; Bullinger will surely know that all Bucer supporters [in Bern] also support the Emperor and that the others favor the opposing party; yet there are many common interests between [Zurich citizens and the Zwinglian followers in Bern], and [meanwhile] one can be glad about the settlement of the war; but how did it come about that this Emperor, who has so weakened and depopulated Germany, is so feared? [The Zurich citizens] have influence and a large number of scholars; they should now advocate [for the Bern citizens]. Bullinger should not reveal [Rümlang's] name, as everything could be interpreted negatively for him. Bullinger should also know how the Bucer supporters argue: Everything that is the simplest and most perfect truth must be attributed to the [Holy] Scripture; but since no human can fully comprehend the divine, what is spoken or written by humans must not be equated with the Holy Scripture; therefore, no one should be required to commit to the [Bern] Disputation as if it were a simple and perfect truth. Rümlang sends his regards to all scholars and the councilors [Johannes] Haab and [Hans Rudolf] Lavater; he longs for Zurich and laments his fate; he asks for a response to this and the last letter [No. 2017]; he is currently dedicating himself again to the study of medicine; but in middle age, one thinks twice about becoming a doctor. The confidential considerations [regarding Rümlang's future] should remain secret, and Rümlang asks [again] for advice. Greetings to Pellikan, who is said to have recently upset Myconius in Basel in a private conversation; also to Gwalther, who likewise upset [Myconius] with a letter; to Erasmus [Schmid]; to Theodor [Bibliander], who should not give too much credence to his godfather Beat [Gering] - there are deceptions and intrigues; should [Gering] do what [the Zwinglians in Bern] have heard, it would be the end with the latter; the matter is well known -; greetings also to Kaspar Megander and [Konrad] Gessner, who should rather deal with serious topics than with poetry; likewise to [Johannes] Fries and to [Georg] Binder.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. The messenger, excellent Bullinger, could not have arrived at a more opportune time than now. You are well aware of the kind of controversies that exist among us, which have erupted with such insane intemperance that the fires of discord rage and spread most perniciously among us. I do not wish to recount to you how the disputes of certain leaders have almost flared up into fights during public drinking and feasting.</p>
      <p>There is a certain barber from Zurich among us, now our citizen, a fine man indeed, who is accustomed to fighting with fists and sword. He would have fought for the Bucer supporters if others had not intervened. The good man was beaten with a fist to the point of bleeding, unsuspecting of any hostility, and was thus unjustly attacked. The contention was about our disputation, which the Zurich citizen opposed, etc.</p>
      <p>Our churchmen, with both sides prepared for battle, stand ready to engage in open conflict with hostile intent as soon as the council gives the signal; among them, there has been long and bitter skirmishing with open bites and accusations from the pulpit. The council is aware of the dissenting factions. Therefore, out of reverence for the matter, it has postponed the business until it has reached an extreme point and fears a tumult; it seeks a way and means to pacify the minds. We lament that no one intervenes. If Bucer knew, he would be ready for action, etc.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, the Small Council summoned all the preachers and declared a truce and peace to both parties until those patricians who are on diplomatic missions return home and the council is more numerous; they will then take up this matter and commit them to their dispute; for they cannot bear such contentions any longer, especially in this dangerous time. If no one intervenes, the outcome is indeed uncertain. For even the Papists are free to speak what they approve of. We are led by emotions, which we indulge too much; nor are there lacking those who wish for peace and calm at any cost, even if it were at the risk of truth.</p>
      <p>I know that the Bucer supporters - Sultzer and Beatus - will urge a synod with the utmost efforts; if they acquire and obtain this, I will indeed fear the votes of the simple-minded. I also know that many are led by private interests; for those who support them feel that they are promoted to richer benefices, while the rest are neglected and considered as stumps (fools), logs, and blocks (clods). Many are also deceived by flattery; they do not foresee the consequences.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you to weigh the matter with a just balance and deign to help us. It is said among us that we are now in greater danger from this discord than we ever were from the growth of the gospel. I think it is the duty of a just man to help a brother in danger through Christ. If you hesitate, your advice will be inauspicious for us. I do not wish to instruct you, but I think it should be done. Since our internal dissensions are about the word of God, the sacrament of the Eucharist, and the authority of the scriptures, tending to deprive the disputation of its authority, it is your part to report this to your council in this manner. Since the matter among us has such a troubled appearance, you should unanimously offer your effort and zeal to write to our council, stating that if your assistance is needed, you are all ready to settle our affairs so that everything may be brought to tranquility. Freely write that our dissensions have reached you with favorable Mercury; they cause you no small pain. If you please, and you are learned, write that you are ready to foster and nurture our peace, not without the proclamation of your concord. I know that many will approve of this and that the wavering will be strengthened. The matter is one of faith for all and not bound by the law and limits by which jurisdictions are terminated. I beg you to consider it well.</p>
      <p>I know that the mind of our council is somewhat trembling at the magnitude of the danger, and since your illustrious authority and concord are highly esteemed among us and have great influence, I trust you will not be neglected, lest, if any adversity occurs, you may rightly accuse us of having neglected you. How could it be that your council would refuse to do this, when otherwise they owe themselves entirely to us in secular matters? How could you not expend your effort and diligence in promoting the cause of Christ among us, when otherwise you are sufficiently industrious in promoting the affairs of the Emperor's Spangerlis, who is an open enemy of our religion? All the Emperor's supporters among us are Bucer supporters, and you know well enough the part of the rest. We have many causes, and they are not dangerous; yet we rejoice in this peaceful war and give thanks to God for it, because the Emperor's efforts, which he had undertaken, did not succeed in every part. How is it that we so dread the tyrannical Spanger, who is the plunderer of the German substance and strength and men? Has our courage become so emasculated that we are disheartened by some of his successes?</p>
      <p>Etc. But let these things be left aside.</p>
      <p>Seek a way to establish the cause of Christ among us. You have the authority and the most renowned assembly of learned men; ensure that such men also abound among us through your effort and industry. I trust the Lord will provide the increase, who is present to his little ship, which is tossed by the waves and almost sinking. I trust that by his grace we will not be left without safety. I write these things hastily and truly and from the heart.</p>
      <p>Ensure that my name is not revealed, for nowhere is faith safe; I fear that perhaps among you there may be an informer who would betray me. For since otherwise the greatest envy weighs upon me, I know that they will expose everything about me in the worst light, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to keep from you the kind of syllogism they use to evade the disputation, and that under the pretext of vindicating the authority of scripture. Major: Whatever is the simplest and most perfect truth must be attributed to the scriptures. Minor: Since, however, we have faith according to measure and no man can perfectly know the divine nor does anyone have all gifts, for different things are distributed to different people. Conclusion: Therefore, no man's word or writing should be so exalted as to be equated with the sacred scriptures; all human words and writings must yield and succumb to this (scripture) and consequently the disputation should not be unjustly prescribed to anyone as a simple and perfect truth to which they must be bound, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend me to all the learned, to the senators, especially to Consul Haab and Treasurer Lavater. I congratulate myself on Zurich as my homeland; I cannot express in words how much I wish it well and how much I long for it.</p>
      <p>I often lament my fate to myself and complain to God, who has made me devour too many bitter grapes, from which my teeth become numb. They wish to have my molar worn down and pulled out, so that I do not bite back, etc. Respond to these and my previous letters, I beg you, especially to the brief appendix of the previous letters; I am distracted by medicine, which I have pursued for a while - delighted by the study in the schools -; it pleases me not a little. But constant age deters me from practice, because experience, according to Hippocrates, is dangerous. I do not wish these secrets to be made public; yet consult me, whose opinion will be considered as if it were delivered from the tripod, indeed as if it were from the oracle of God. Farewell with your whole family.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, October 28, 1544. Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>I beg you to take everything in good part; I burn with zeal for the truth. I beg you to greet Pellican by name, who is said to have recently disturbed Myconius in Basel in a private conversation; also Gwalther, who is said to have agitated the same with writings; Erasmus too; Theodor, whom I advise not to trust too much in his compatriot Beatus - I think he purges himself with him; yet there are deceits and frauds; if he has done any, by God, we feel it too much and are openly endangered; the matter is not hidden -; also greet Kaspar Megander, an upright man; likewise Gessner, whom I admire - I wish him to devote himself to solid writings and not to rhapsodic ones -; also Fries and Binder and in sum all, etc. Farewell again, excellent one.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Eb. von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious, most upright, and most faithful Heinrich Bullinger, chief churchman of Zurich, a most friendly man and always to be revered and respected in the Lord, his distinguished patron.</p>
