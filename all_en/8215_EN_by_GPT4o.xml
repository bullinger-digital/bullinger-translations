      <p>Greetings. When the bookseller, my godfather, planned his journey to your kindness, most illustrious man and venerable father in Christ, I did not want to let him go without at least a note for the sake of greeting. We received the opinion on the matrimonial case, which I was requesting in the name of a very good friend; with which both of us have been abundantly satisfied, we give you the highest thanks for this service and effort. I am returning, however, the judge's note, as you wished.</p>
      <p>From Lyon, it is written to our local merchants about a certain peace made in France, but the conditions are not added, and many wonder what the new expedition of our people means. I hear that the emperor, with his brothers, is threatening the people of Ulm with dire consequences unless they restore the canons expelled from their church, and it is said that the emperor's assembly is being held in Prague, in which the Elector of Saxony will also participate, and another is announced to be in Nuremberg and furthermore a diet in Speyer. Many assert that strange plans are being secretly agitated almost everywhere in the empire. Would that our people would stay at home and carefully tend to their own affairs, lest, as we have long mourned, they hasten other impending punishments on the fatherland with their furies. Many predict all sorts of disastrous omens for the Palatinate.</p>
      <p>The ruins of the empire seem about to perish completely. In all these evils and dangers, there is no one who repents and seeks forgiveness. It was the duty of the cities in Switzerland, which profess the pure doctrine of the gospel, to restrain the fury and tyranny of their allies with just and pious reasons, following the example of their ancestors, to protect the blood of the innocent; but most are dozing and conniving under some pretext I do not know. Christ and his most afflicted members are miserably neglected; inevitable punishments will therefore follow. Would that there be peace in our days, which indeed it is doubtful whether any remnants can still be preserved with great difficulty; but I cease to complain further. I beg your kindness, that if you have more certain information, you also share it with us, especially for this reason, that pressed by the weight of dangers, we may implore divine mercy with more ardent prayers and at least save some from this latest flood of the world.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 21, 1570.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, the distinguished servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the church in Zurich, his friend and father in Christ, to be highly honored.</p>
