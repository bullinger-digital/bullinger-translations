      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard), etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received your letter and are pleased to hear that the originals of the previous matters have reached you, and that the delay was not on our part. We have informed you through our servant on the third of this month about how it all transpired.</p>
      <p>It is very agreeable to us that you wish to first publish such a booklet in German. We are eager to hear the French news, whether the Almighty might once again grant a place and rest to His persecuted church in foreign lands, thereby showing His grace and comfort, etc.</p>
      <p>As far as the council is concerned, it is to be expected that the word will be little heard among the obstinate, as it was with Pharaoh. Nevertheless, the serpents of Moses must devour the serpents of Pharaoh's wise men and magicians in Pharaoh's presence, so that God's testimony and power may stand all the more gloriously against the obstinate. Therefore, we believe one should still send to the council.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Württemberg Confession, we would otherwise gladly see it promoted as much as possible; for we ourselves do not doubt that you will know how to further it well, etc.</p>
      <p>We also send you herewith the confession of our noble, friendly, dear lord cousin Duke Christoph of Württemberg, etc., hoping it will also please you. Even if there is not yet complete understanding everywhere, we do not think that one party should shun the other at this time, but rather, with timely zeal, bear the weak on both sides, until God grants the spirit of wisdom and revelation and enlightens the eyes of our minds, which He will surely do in His time, and guide and unite His own in the unity that is in Christ. For we hope that there is a Christian zeal on both sides and that the honor of Christ is gladly promoted, as many good people have been committed and suffered for it on both sides. May the Lord grant us all true brotherly love and faithfulness to show and to pray for unity, etc. We did not want to withhold our most gracious opinion from you and are kindly disposed towards you. Dated Schaffhausen, February 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave is to be released on a guarantee of 20,000 guilders, which are to be provided by his guarantors Fucker, Pomgartner, Welscher, the city of Augsburg, Ulm, Nuremberg, if they are willing to do so. However, there is little belief in the matter, as they are merely Spanish intrigues. If Charles had the money, God knows where the Landgrave would be; in sum, he desires to drain all of Germany and to mortgage it, etc.</p>
      <p>We also thank you for the treatises you sent us at our request, along with the new news, etc. Master Thoman Hausinger appeared before us on the 8th of February, and we have spoken well with him. He is truly a capable, understanding man. You should all help and advise, as those who have conducted themselves in a Christian and proper manner, so that those from Magdeburg may be protected in their great need and petition, and you will be pleasing to God.</p>
      <p>Acted on the 8th of February, 1552.</p>
      <p>We are not able to further address Duke Moritz's pending matters and others at this time; we remind you of our previous letter to you, sent a few days ago, containing matters that have been ongoing for the past three months, as the time of the Farnese will bring further developments with more content. We leave it at that for now. Remain entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Written by Württemberg in his own hand.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
