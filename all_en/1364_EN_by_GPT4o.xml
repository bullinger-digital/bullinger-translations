      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I know, most esteemed godfather, that my prolonged silence displeases your piety, but I myself am very displeased with myself for that reason. But when you understand my affairs, you will be easily led to forgive due to their difficulty and magnitude, and I will free myself from the disgrace of ingratitude towards you, such a dear friend.</p>
      <p>Although, as your letters and those of Mr. John Butler, brother and singular friend, testify, I have sent away all from England who were traveling to you empty and without my letters, yet I have often written to you; but because they were either intercepted or lost on the way, I blame the negligence of the couriers, who not only disappointed my efforts but also the expectations of my best friend. Even if I have sent letters to you less frequently than your immense benevolence towards me has deserved, it was not done out of forgetfulness of you, most learned godfather, but due to the difficulty and magnitude of my affairs. For the past year, I have been laboring under great, continuous, and arduous affairs, as you have undoubtedly heard from others.</p>
      <p>A serious dispute was being agitated between the Bishop of London and me regarding vestments, which has always greatly displeased me; for I, if I am not mistaken, rightly criticized their use in the church and contended that they should be completely removed from the church; but he insisted and most stubbornly asserted their use. But since the Lord has put an end to this controversy, I do not think it worthwhile to violate the grave of this unfortunate tragedy. Hereafter, even if my occupations do not cease, I will fulfill my duty in writing to you and will not send away anyone traveling to you empty-handed. Relying now on your readiness to forgive, I cease to excuse my silence any longer. My whole family, as well as yours, we hope, is well, and we continually pray to God that both may remain well for a long time. However, know that we have not been blessed with any offspring since we left your holy company. If our little daughter Rachel is preserved for us, so that she may embrace and promote your son Jesus Christ, we consider our prayers abundantly fulfilled in our old age, even if we do not have more children. She often hears from her mother about the place and country where she was born, and being instructed with great diligence and care in the faith, which she once promised through your charity and the wife of Mr. Bibliander to the church of Christ, she gravely complains about me for not more frequently greeting such a holy church and faithful ministers of Christ with letters. Now, as a token of reverence and honor, she sends one whole piece of cloth, one half to your piety, the other to the wife of Mr. Bibliander; giving heartfelt thanks to the heavenly Father, that she was accepted into the fellowship of that sacred church with you as witnesses. If it seems good to you that your sons see England for the sake of their studies, there is no need for you to be much concerned about the cost of living here: I will take care of them, and I will do so with a good and cheerful spirit.</p>
      <p>Your writings, which I brought with me from Zürich, (you know what I mean,) I was never able to have printed; not because they are less pleasing to pious and learned men, (indeed, they are very pleasing to all to whom I have given them to read,) but the calamity of the times, or rather the fear of men, who prefer their own plans to the glory of God, has hindered it. Many learned and highly esteemed men desired to read that book, to whom I had given permission as I ought; and now it is with Mr. Cecil, the principal secretary to the royal majesty, a man endowed with great learning and piety, and very favorable to the gospel of God. The rest of your books, which you sent to the royal majesty, I delivered with great diligence to the Marquis of Northampton, the great chamberlain of all England, so that he might present them to the king in your name, which he did diligently and willingly; through whom the king always ordered you to be greeted with great thanks: nor do I doubt that the king will always be mindful of you. In return, I ask you, as you are accustomed, to commend the one who is running well, and to always exhort him to perseverance with your letters. The king also diligently reads your letters, and by reading them, he is greatly affected with a desire for their reading.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not think your effort is misplaced, even though you do not receive a response to them. The Archbishop of Canterbury, indeed very loving towards you, when I received your last letters in his house, and informed him about them, could hardly contain his tears, when he understood your mind towards the king and the kingdom, and the perseverance of your church in these most sorrowful times.</p>
      <p>He commended both you and your great learning most honorably. I know you have no one among all your dearest who loves you more anxiously and eagerly in Christ.</p>
      <p>I know and am certain that he loves you from the heart. I conferred with him and asked him to help the Italian you wrote about with the king: he promised all his effort, and do not doubt it. If the best and most merciful God would once free us from this difficult and harsh tyranny of the adversaries of Christ, by which we are dangerously oppressed on all sides, provision will be made for all pious and learned men according to our ability. You asked me to deal with Mr. a Lasco regarding the eighteen crowns you lent to a certain Italian: I did as you ordered, but whether you have been satisfied, I do not know. I know that you willingly wish to be a burden to no one, (although what you consider a burden, they consider an honor;) thus your most excellent gifts received from God have benefited the republic, and especially the church of Christ, so that we owe you all things, as you will experience if you wish.</p>
      <p>After I began this letter, my wife and five others of my preachers and household fell into a new kind of sweat of ours, and they labored dangerously for twenty-four hours: I myself have just now somewhat recovered from the same disease.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord, that he may have mercy on us, and that we may always await the day of death in the fear of God. The plague of this disease is very severe in England, and, which is the most evident sign of divine vengeance, people are seized by sudden death. By the next feast of Michaelmas, when my affairs have somewhat subsided, you will learn more about my matters in detail.</p>
      <p>My wife and the rest of the sick have also escaped the danger of the disease by the grace of God. We commend your whole church and republic to God, especially the most reverend father Mr. Pellican. Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, your two sons-in-law, Mr. Gesner, with their wives; all others who worship Christ's religion with you; our sister your wife with your whole family, Mr. Bibliander with his wife and whole family, we truly and sincerely pray in Christ to be safe. May the Lord also preserve Mr. Consul. We ask you to greet Mr. Coelius Secundus in your letters in our name as much as you can, and you can as much as you wish. Urge Mr. John Butler, our friend, to return to England: he can be of use to the republic and the church in many ways. You know that we are born for our country and not for ourselves: if the matter were otherwise, I would not perform the office of bishop. At least you will ask him to visit us in England once, and through us, he will understand by what way and means he and his can be conveniently provided for. May the Lord Jesus keep you long for the glory of his name. Gloucester, the first of August, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, as always and for a long time, your most loving brother and godfather, John Hooper, Bishop of the Church of Gloucester.</p>
      <p>I have given to this student, who brings my letters to you, and to his companion, forty-five English crowns as a loan to the people of Zürich.</p>
      <p>If it pleases you to send me books printed in Zürich at a fair price for them, especially those containing your works, you would do me a favor. If the people of Zürich, who migrate here for the sake of study, need my help, I will assist them to the best of my ability. For your books and letters to me, I have the highest and eternal thanks. When I have emerged from the waves of dangers, most esteemed and learned godfather, I will send a personal messenger through whom you will understand all my matters. Do not be surprised that I make no mention of your letters, which I often kiss, I pray: I could not be unmindful of you or your benefits to me. Because of the matter and how such a fierce and contentious dispute was begun between the bishops and me, you will understand in due time. I strive that the dispute may be settled by the judgment of pious men, so that I may briefly explain the cause and field of the disputes: the use of peculiar papal vestments in the ministry of the church has caused great tumult here; only Mr. a Lasco among all the foreigners, who have some authority, stood on my side. Farewell. I pray to God that you may long and prosperously fare well, and that all the people of Zürich may fare well in Christ. Amen. I have written what I can; you know what I mean.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, if indeed his, and deservedly so.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, let it be given, from the given.</p>
