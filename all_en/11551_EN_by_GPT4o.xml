    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not yet answered the last two letters; must write before a messenger is ready. Agrees with the criticism expressed in Bullinger's first letter towards Emperor [Charles V] and the princes. In Memmingen, the pastors are successfully fighting for the victory of truth. Leo Aretius [Martini], whom Bullinger inquired about, is an adulterer and a fraud. Bucer reported in two letters from the Diet of Regensburg and lamented the general decline of religion, but also expressed hope for the discussion set by the Emperor. [Martin] Frecht writes that there is still no knowledge of the intended procedure, yet he distrusts the peace promised by the Emperor; Melanchthon also fears that they will not get far. According to Schuler's expectation, the Emperor will probably demand help against the Turks, but [the Catholics] will not allow the religious peace demanded by the Protestants as a prerequisite; the Emperor will attempt a patchwork, but the outcome of the matter is in God's hands. Mayor [Balthasar] Funk just reports that the Emperor has appointed Bucer, Melanchthon, and Pistorius as well as Julius Pflug, Johannes Eck, and Johannes Gropper as colloquents and may appoint Elector Palatine Frederick as president; Schuler remains skeptical and shares more details about the presence of princes and envoys in Regensburg; unlike others, he places no hope in the Emperor. Greetings and a request for intercession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have already received two letters from you, dearest Bullinger, to which I have not yet responded, I confess. But indeed, either the burden of my labors or the scarcity of messengers delays me; therefore, I am compelled to write and by writing to anticipate the time when the letters prepared to be sent to you are ready in the presence of the courier. But I know your firm and whole-hearted spirit towards me, which I do not wish to break by my "sluggishness" - as you write.</p>
      <p>First of all, know that I received your letters on January 25th, in the year 1541, in which you thank me for having sent you the acts of the Worms Diet, which is certainly a small thing in which I have gratified you, being prepared to give much greater things. As for the cunning of the Emperor and the other princes, that is, their foolish wisdom, which you describe to me so much, you act wisely; for I do not always clearly perceive their impostures, as they cover their hypocrisy, tyranny, and bloodthirsty hearts with a marvelous artifice of feigned probity, and the venomous sting of the bee scarcely protrudes for a long time, nor can the evil that abounds in their hearts be sufficiently exposed. But I trust in the cause, which relies on the most invincible truth, that it will always prevail.</p>
      <p>Our church in Memmingen grows in the word of truth day by day, fearing no threats. I, along with my fellow ministers, labor by the grace of God not in vain, although sometimes we fight fiercely with the ancient enemy, not without the reward of God's glory. For although Satan, that old enemy of truth, is cunning, yet Christ always conquers in us and through us according to the promise, to which we cling by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Regarding Leo Aretius, whom you inquire about, know this: He is a lion through whom Satan has imposed upon our church not without great scandal. For soon after his return to us from Zurich, he was accused of fornication, adultery, and drunkenness by the senate of our city and was summoned to defend himself on the appointed day against the accusations. When he learned that he was summoned by the senate, he secretly left with his wife (whom he had unlawfully joined to himself), being heavily indebted in the meantime, nearly two hundred florins.</p>
      <p>While leaving, he borrowed a horse from a good man (for he had deceived everyone with his feigned sanctity) as if he were soon to return, which he sold to an innkeeper for five florins, having borrowed the horse. He defrauded the former of the horse, the latter of the money. Then he took the woman, whom he claimed to be joined to him in marriage, through adultery while her former husband was still alive. In short, there is no soundness in him from the sole of the foot to the top of the head, that is: He is a complete rogue and scoundrel in the past and present. This is enough about Leo Aretius.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Diet of Regensburg, the following was written to me by Bucer on March 23, 1541: "The Emperor and most of the princes now more than ever want to hear our cause and consult about the reformation of the churches, while our people here very coldly accommodate themselves to God's calling. Meanwhile, religion is declining everywhere, discipline is being abolished everywhere, churches are deprived of suitable ministers, the wealth of the church is left to the antichrists to dissipate according to their desires, and the minds of the people are being prepared for Turkish tyranny as they are stripped of religion." On April 19th, he writes to me thus: "The Emperor has instituted a colloquy of a few. You will pray to the Lord to guide it. Among the papists, there are very few who are willing to concede to Christ as much as they should; but we, by the grace of the Lord, will give nothing that Christ does not command to give. Therefore, you will diligently pray for the church, that we may piously and happily use the present opportunity. In such actions, although no just one has yet been granted to us, some addition has always been made to the kingdom of Christ. Therefore, we pray earnestly that the effort of the saints may not be in vain now." This is from Bucer.</p>
      <p>Frechtus writes to me on April 2nd: "You will not expect" (he says) "from me or my dearest brothers, who have gathered here, what is being done about religion, as it is not yet known to us, nor, I fear, will it easily become known, in what manner and way the leaders of the empire with the Emperor will act with the Protestants. The Emperor indeed presents himself as willing to give and establish peace with the healthier and indeed large part of the empire's leaders. But unless this peace is established with religion, it is to be feared that it will not be lasting and solid. Therefore, we await what the God of peace will do through the Emperor, and may the outcome of this diet not be similar to the success and outcome of the previous assemblies! Our Melanchthon indeed conjectures that not many religious matters will be expedited here as they should be; so varied are the things that seem to stand in the way." This is what he says.</p>
      <p>You can, my Bullinger, from these words of Frechtus, estimate the lion as if from its claws. I have not yet conceived any hope of better outcomes, as far as the work of the wise of this world is concerned. The Emperor, unless the Lord directs his mind otherwise, will attempt to have some cohorts of soldiers permitted to him by the leaders of the empire; our people will refuse as they have so far unless the matter of religion is settled. The papists, on the other hand, will take the greatest care that nothing sound and solid is established in the matter of religion. Meanwhile, the Emperor, overwhelmed by the present necessity, will think of some kind of paper patchwork; he will arrange some patchwork, a tinkerâ€™s work, until he also persuades our people to agree to his request for waging war against the Turks. May the Lord prevent these attempts with His spirit! For we need remarkable constancy in this matter. Therefore, you have my judgment on the matter of religion in this place, a judgment, I say, not of God, but of human reason. Meanwhile, I acknowledge by faith the power of the deity, whose matter is being conducted and of all His elect. The Lord has long since determined the outcome of this cause with Himself, of which the prophets, Christ, and the apostles assure us.</p>
      <p>While I write this, dearest Bullinger, Mayor Funckius comes to me and indicates that the Emperor has appointed only six for the colloquy, from our side Bucer, Melanchthon, and Pistorius, the preacher of the Prince of Hesse, and from the papists' side Julius Pflug, the canon of Mainz, Doctor Johannes Eck, and Doctor Johannes Gropper. Then, when it seems good to the Emperor, he will appoint one to preside over those six. There are those among our people who think the Emperor will give us Duke Frederick of the Palatinate as president, a distinguished defender of lies. And no one is to listen, and the conversation is to be unconditional (without reservation). It seems to me as if the Emperor had arranged a trap behind the stove. These are the things that especially disturb me, and the matter seems suspicious to me.</p>
      <p>None of the electors is in Regensburg except Margrave Joachim the Elector and the Archbishop of Mainz. The Prince of Hesse is present; the Elector of Saxony is ill. The papists are flocking in droves. The Pope's legate, the cardinal, is plotting marvelously; what he will accomplish, the Lord knows. There are those who promise us many good things from the Emperor; I certainly promise myself nothing from him. May the Lord help His afflicted church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name and my wife's your wife. Greet Leo Jud, Pellican, Bibliander, and all the brothers. Farewell in the meantime and live for the Lord in all diligence of spirit and pray for me, that the Lord may keep me whole in His work, so that I may stand with an unbroken spirit against Satan and the world, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, in the year of our Lord 1541, April 29th. Your Gervasius.</p>
