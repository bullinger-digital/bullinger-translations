      <p>God's grace first! I received the copies from Gallo, who is traveling to France, and I thank you greatly for your diligence and work; I will try to repay it, where possible. As for the Geneva affair, whose outcome you wish to know, it is as follows: That Jerome was exiled and would have suffered worse, if your and our letters had not mitigated the matter. Now, as Viret writes to me, he is staying somewhere in our region, which causes Viret and all those who are like Calvin's soul to be very restless; they wish him to be banished by our people as well.</p>
      <p>Viret writes to me very seriously about this matter, as if the church as a whole is at stake if that man, no matter how peacefully he acts, is tolerated. Thus, whatever evil it is, it will eventually return to us, and unless we counter it with moderate firmness, we will experience very serious disturbances. May the Lord avert them with His spirit and grace, amen.</p>
      <p>As for other news, I have nothing except what I received from you and Vergerio, unless perhaps this is new to you: it is written to Musculus from Augsburg that Maurice and many other princes of Germany, among whom are also the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg and the city of Strasbourg, have sent their confessions of faith to Trent; there, most of the Italian bishops did not want them to be read, but the Archbishop of Mainz and the Archbishop of Trier intervened with their authority and insisted that they be read, otherwise they would leave the council. Thus, they were read, and many hearts were touched, and as a result of this reading, everything is now suspended, and the fathers do not know what to do or how, etc. Whether these things are true or not, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Since they were written to him, I wanted to share them with you, although you might learn more accurately from his own letters.</p>
      <p>As for the other letters you entrusted to me to take care of, I have done so diligently. Tremp came to me after reading his letters,... inquiring about a certain booklet mentioned by your son-in-law in his letters to him; he said he had not seen or received the booklet. I could not respond to him, as I received nothing except two bundles pertaining to him, in one of which I recognized your handwriting, and in the other Zwingli's; I sent them to him. Therefore, inform him if he perhaps neglected to send what he wrote about, or if he did send it, Gallo did not deliver it to me; I saw nothing more than what I mentioned.</p>
      <p>Thanking cousin Elsbeth for her good year; may God give her and all of you much good. I recently sent her a thick penny as a gift for God's sake, but I do not know if she received it or if it was perhaps lost.</p>
      <p>I did not need to give the leather and rope to the messenger; I will send them to you next. Regarding Scharnachtal, dear, make sure that I am not mentioned anywhere. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all of yours from all of us. Given in Bern on January 13, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>The booklets are pretty and please me well. However, my brother has money that belongs to me; I am writing to him herewith; he will settle the binding fee and the drinking money.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
