      <p>I do not doubt that you have already learned of the death of our Musculus from my recent letters to my brother and that you grieve with us and are greatly affected by sorrow.</p>
      <p>May the Lord comfort us all and help His church, and may He preserve you, the only survivor among those veterans, safe and sound with us for as long as possible! Here we are like orphans deprived of the best father, and we do not quite know where to turn.</p>
      <p>We would need another man like him; but where will we find one? And even if one were found, how will we obtain him? I direct all my thoughts towards Hyperius; I hope that he alone can be persuaded to leave where he is and be accepted by our people as well.</p>
      <p>Regarding Zanchi, after that subscription, there is nothing we can do or hope for here.</p>
      <p>However, I ask for your advice, which you may wish to give me promptly, and I also ask that you use your authority and letters with Mr. Steiger, Mülinen, and Grafenried, who have the most authority in these matters, to help them turn their attention to summoning Hyperius.</p>
      <p>If we could have him, it would seem that the wound of our church would be moderately healed.</p>
      <p>Among our own, we have no one who can succeed except Benedict Aretius, Abraham Musculus, or Valentin Ampelandrus; but their authority is not as great as this position requires.</p>
      <p>I am very concerned about this; for I fear that that Proteus of Basel, who insinuates himself everywhere, will introduce something that will disturb us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would like to counteract him in time. Meanwhile, I pray to the Lord, who arranges everything according to His providence and will, that He may help us and appoint another, by whose work the purity of doctrine and harmony among us can be preserved.</p>
      <p>You will pray the same with us.</p>
      <p>As for Musculus's wife, although she is still bedridden, she seems to be recovering nicely, as does her son Johannes Friedrich; may the Lord comfort them and restore them kindly.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else new to report.</p>
      <p>I thank you for those things you have shared with me, and I ask that you also share with us what you receive from Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>You will learn from the letters I write to my brother where the Savoyard affair stands.</p>
      <p>It was rumored that the prince had died; but it will be nothing.</p>
      <p>May the Lord also look upon this and settle everything! I hear that the Genevans will not accept any peace at all unless they retain all the freedom they currently have; the prince, however, demands that his rights be restored to him; thus, I do not know where the matter will end up.</p>
      <p>Many good people here mean well, they have deeply involved themselves; they would like to keep everything; but they want peace once and for all.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it turns out well.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul Steiger, Mülinen, Haller, Hagius, and Emanuel greet you.</p>
      <p>Grafenried is in Baden, as you know.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all friends and brothers, especially those who are of your household, along with the entire family.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 9, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
