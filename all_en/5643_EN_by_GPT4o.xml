      <p>Greetings to you, reverend father in Christ. All your letters have indeed been delivered to me, and nothing has been lost.</p>
      <p>I presented your book to the consul; he received it with gratitude and goodwill and promised to read it at the first opportunity. He also earnestly encouraged me to express to you his profound thanks for that splendid gift in writing.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that Pellizarius has also delivered my letters to you; for I am well acquainted with and have observed his faithfulness and integrity.</p>
      <p>There will be no need to return those letters of Augustine.</p>
      <p>Would that it were true, what is reported about the death of Guise; such an event would pave a certain path for future peace.</p>
      <p>It is certainly reported that the Lord of Aumale is dead.</p>
      <p>A certain Frenchman passed through here the day before yesterday, who was known to our people because he had worked in the kitchens of the legates' courts here some years ago.</p>
      <p>He assured the consul's son that he had attended the funeral of the Lord of Aumale; however, the death had been concealed for some time (because of his wife, if I am not mistaken). It is certain that the council has been dissolved.</p>
      <p>It is said that those fathers of Trent are leaving behind monuments to their lust.</p>
      <p>The senior Cardinal of Trent, who was once the governor of Milan, is said to be the one who has lost his mind and is bound in chains; the cause of his madness is reported (as I heard from Remigius of Schouwenstein, who heard it from the bishop) to be a poison that was administered, which was not sufficient to cause death, but spread throughout his body and caused this madness.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is in Innsbruck.</p>
      <p>It is said that Maximilian flew there with very few of his own and had one or two preachers in his company, but after greeting his parent and having lunch, he suddenly set off again and departed from there.</p>
      <p>It is said he went to Austria.</p>
      <p>The count writes..., who resides in the castle of Vaduz, who is now at the court of Ferdinand, that the Cardinal of Ems has incurred the great displeasure of the Emperor; he is in great disfavor with the Emperor.</p>
      <p>Dietegen comes from the court, speaks of many marriages that are supposed to take place; particularly, it is thought that one will occur with Ferdinand (the Emperor's son) and the Queen of Scotland; but I believe only what I see.</p>
      <p>Some of the Five Cantons have allowed themselves to recruit soldiers in these lands.</p>
      <p>Our lords have seriously prohibited it; yet I am told that some from the Upper League are secretly running away at night towards Uri.</p>
      <p>Yesterday a certain merchant came from Milan, who affirms that it was announced by post in Milan that Guise was lethally wounded by a cannon shot.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Sessa is said to have entered Milan with great pomp on February 28th; he returned (as it is written) from Piedmont, where he took the son of Savoy from baptism.</p>
      <p>I have nothing of importance now, but so that you may compare with others and judge; for if individual things are not useful, many help.</p>
      <p>We desire to hear the outcome of the affairs of France. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I hope that Orl√©ans is not captured; for nothing of the sort has yet been reported by Tschudi to our papists, which is an indication to me that our affairs are not in a bad state.</p>
      <p>Today Gregory Carlinus came here with a certain Metzler, who reports that Lazarus Schwendi is gathering 15 companies of soldiers; it is not yet clear for what purpose, but it is commonly believed to be for the coronation of Emperor Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>There are those who spread some rumors and have been quite consistent for some time about the Duchy of Milan being restored to the Empire; but I can affirm nothing.</p>
      <p>I do not believe that Ferdinand or Maximilian are so steadfast that they would undertake any of these matters at this time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the death of Guise is again reported from Italy; we are eager to learn the truth from you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. To H. Bullinger.</p>
