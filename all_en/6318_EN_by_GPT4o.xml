      <p>Postscript.</p>
      <p>Holy Reverend Father in Christ, I wrote yesterday, but today I ran into the courier, who said he would leave tomorrow. Meanwhile, it is written here that in Basel in France new tumults are being stirred up, Cond√© and the admiral are gathering forces anew, and a certain fortress has been burned. If these things are true, they will disturb everything for the French.</p>
      <p>But because often many false rumors are spread, Mr. Consul and Carlinus, and I earnestly ask you to teach us the truth; for if things were as they are said, it would not be advisable for us to involve ourselves in such disturbances.</p>
      <p>Please, do not keep us in the dark; we anxiously await to know what is happening. There is no need to wait for merchants; the host of the Stork sends reliable men with letters every third day, through whom you can also take care of your matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Reverend Father in Christ, and forgive me for being so often a bother to you. Chur, the day before the calends of December in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. That news greatly frightened us; for if it were true, the Spaniard could do much on this occasion. But we hope for better things.</p>
