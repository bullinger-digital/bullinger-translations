      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Benedikt and I have been appointed to go to Basel - our companions will be Mayor Waldkilch and one of the guild masters -, but under the condition that Benedikt and I travel at our own expense and that of the other fellow priests. Do you see, dearest brother, both the wisdom and piety of our council? They had decided that they did not want to send anyone from the ministers, but only two from the council. I do not know what finally came to their minds that they also added us.</p>
      <p>But please let me know what issues we are going to discuss.</p>
      <p>Farewell, January 15, 1536.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
