      <p>Greetings. Letters were sent to me, enclosed here, from Mr. Wolfgang Haller, and as he requested, I am sending them to you. There was an error... in the name, namely addressed to Wolfgang, which should have been addressed to you, as I can gather from the rest of the inscription title and Haller's letters clearly indicate they were sent to me. What else I might write, hardly comes to mind.</p>
      <p>Six Venetian ships, filled with provisions and soldiers to bring reinforcements to others, were cunningly intercepted by the Turks; for the Turks, having raised Venetian flags, pretended to be Venetians, and the Venetian ships, thinking they were allies of the Turks, approached them and were thus easily captured, with nothing escaping from there. The cost of provisions is rising among us, and I fear it may increase daily unless by some other means this is remedied, not less harshly: certainly, that new plague is spreading, namely an unusual and deadly headache, more and more each day. Internal wars were long said to be imminent, wars and rumors of wars have vanished; however, now some new signs of these are emerging, about which, when I have more certain information, I will inform you. In Italy, everything points to war between the Spaniard and the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given at my estate on the 25th of August in the year 71.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>The Spanish fleet, which recently arrived at Genoa, then at Messina, went straight to Tunis. Thus, the Venetians were frustrated in their hope, which they had placed in the help of the Spaniards against the Turk.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote that the Wittenbergers, as far as the Lord's Supper is concerned, and others also, feel completely with us; for so I seemed to have understood from their propositions, which they had published and I had glanced at; now, as I examine their catechism more carefully, I notice that they indeed abhor that monstrous ubiquity, the gross eating, and do not think badly of all these things, yet do not dare to openly express what they feel. May the Lords themselves and others wavering be strengthened... more and more to the glory of His name and the advancement of His church.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
