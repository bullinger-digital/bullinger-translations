      <p>Greetings. What I have done, I owed to you, dear brother, and indeed I did it willingly, and will continue to do so as long as I live, fulfilling the duty of a most faithful friend and closest brother. When the consul returns from the assembly, I will handle your business with all the faith and diligence I can muster.</p>
      <p>I commend to you in return the business of SuÍ¤ler and myself. Beyond my expectation, my son Johannes Rudolf has been appointed to take care of the church in Berg. I pray to the Lord that this will be fortunate and auspicious.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I would have gladly assisted our Leon, if only for the benefits of his father's pious memory; but in the council, things turned out differently than we had planned; I hope the Lord will not forsake him. All my family, whom you greeted, were with me when your letters were delivered; they all send their greetings to you in return.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I received letters from England dated June 21st from London, containing nothing else but that the affairs of the church and religion are in the best state, that the Queen of Scots is seeking marriage with a certain English prince, not without deceit and suspicion of new developments. If this matter succeeds, I hear that England herself is considering new marriages; Charles of Austria is courting her, and there is some hope, if he wishes to remain steadfast in religion; but this is our rather uncertain opinion, as the princes change their opinions hourly.</p>
      <p>Balthasar, the interpreter of the lord ambassador, has returned; he reports that the Spaniards and the French met in Bayonne with great pomp, and that a Turkish delegation also came, but was not admitted to the court because of the Spaniards; however, while the impatient Turk threatened to leave, he was heard by the king.</p>
      <p>He asks whether the king wishes to keep the agreements made with his father intact, whether he will grant passage, or provide supplies to the fleet at sea. What the response was, I do not know; I hear that everyone is anxious, spreading rumors that the fortress of Malta has been captured, and that Tunis has also been occupied by the Turks, who threaten Sicily and Rome. I expect more certain news from you from Italy.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in great haste, July 20, 1565.</p>
      <p>The assembly is not yet finished.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, pastor of the church in Chur, my esteemed and dearest lord, compatriot, and brother. Chur.</p>
