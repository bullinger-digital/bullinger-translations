      <p>Regarding the many new reports, my lords have today received letters from Geneva, in which it is reported that the Duke of Nemours has taken the abandoned from Guise and intends to hold the wedding at Annecy, not far from Geneva. A great force of the papal party from France is coming there, and there is concern that they might, under the pretense of the wedding, plan to attack Geneva and soon help the Duke to reclaim his land. Therefore, preparations are being made, and letters are being sent everywhere to be vigilant. It is also said that the one from Termes is advancing with many horses towards Savoy, with the pretense of wanting to go to Italy and inspect it. However, there is concern that this might also be a diversion, and therefore greater caution is being exercised. The king is moving to Auvergne until after Easter, when he intends to return to Moulins. From Antwerp, it is written that the king of Spain has sent a priest to establish the Inquisition in Brabant and Flanders and will not return until he has accomplished it. It has been announced in Ghent and Bruges, and then he came to Antwerp; however, no one has simply agreed to it except those in Leuven. The people of Antwerp have tried to dismiss him with good reasoning; but when he tried to force them, they had to comply, which led the people to take up arms, and for three days there was great unrest in the city, though no blood was shed. When a judge in Ghent tried to condemn someone for their faith and was sitting on the judgment seat and had the sentence read out, he suddenly became ill and insane and died miserably the next day. Also, when several prisoners were held there, the people broke into the prisons by force and freed them. Otherwise, we have nothing special at this time. Let us pray to God that He always watches over us and thwarts the plans of His enemies. Amen. Your willing Johannes Haller.</p>
