      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless you and your household and grant you a most prosperous year, and may He keep you safe with us for a long time! I confess that I owe you, esteemed lord and dearest brother, a great deal, for although you are overwhelmed with so many and such great affairs and are otherwise afflicted with health, you nevertheless continue to write to me so familiarly and diligently about all matters.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay you and keep you from evil and bless you with His blessing. I am brief willingly so as not to add labor to your labors.</p>
      <p>I would not write to you now but to our Beza, who would refer all my matters to you, unless you had requested a response from me. You know, my brother, what you asked of me in your last letter.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am so perplexed in this matter that I cannot now respond with certainty to anything. I am prepared to gratify you and the French church, even at the expense of my life.</p>
      <p>However, while I consider our people and our affairs, the customs and characters of our people, the reasons of our laws, and many other things, I cannot see how the affairs of our church and republic can remain safe and intact if that which you know happens. Therefore, I earnestly pray to the Lord day and night that He may show what can be done certainly and healthily.</p>
      <p>He has wonderfully preserved us thus far and has declared His paternal love for us. I pray to the same that He may continue to be towards us as He has been thus far.</p>
      <p>I am well aware that you also invoke the Lord with perpetual prayers. May He grant us what is salutary for us all.</p>
      <p>In this, farewell forever and continue to pursue me with the love with which you have pursued me thus far.</p>
      <p>Regarding the rest, I write to our Beza.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 6, 1564.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Ours greet you and them.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
