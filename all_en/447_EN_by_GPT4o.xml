      <p>Our Funckel, who was also a preacher in Konstanz, has been requested by the community of TÃ¤gerwilen to become a pastor; the village is very close to the city. The good man was concerned that it might be too close, etc., and upon the advice of his brother, Captain Ecklis, he asked what he should do; he was advised that he could well accept the parish; there would be no harm. For even if the Confederates wanted to wage war, they would spare the nearest places to Konstanz and not destroy them, since Konstanz is now under the king's control.</p>
      <p>The ban has not yet been lifted, and yet the matter has the appearance and semblance as if one were absolved; but it is clear that nothing is behind it, as the bishop and others are still holding firmly to their territories. The abbot of Weingarten has reportedly openly expressed, it is said credibly, that he is very displeased with this action of the king, which is why the royal commissioners are also displeased with him. A commissioner, when the bishop's etc. displeasure was reported, said: the bishop must do what we want, and even if he is not well-disposed; we would not give him a stick to lean on.</p>
      <p>A commissioner, who had previously ridden from Konstanz, had said before his departure that there was no danger; no Spaniards were coming to Konstanz. Now, when he returns, he says he will no longer say that no Spaniards are coming to Konstanz, as the young prince is now coming. And a prominent person has said it is certain and truly true that the imperial majesty has given this city to the Spaniards as a prize and has done everything, and even if they like it, they nevertheless still have the claim, and it is very much to be feared that they will start a great mischief in a city like Konstanz.</p>
      <p>A notable imperial person, whom I know well and who is very deserving by the imperial majesty, has written to his people that whatever they have in the Confederation, they should sell it shortly; otherwise, they will lose it; the emperor will certainly visit the Confederates and make them obedient. Similarly, someone from Memmingen has also written. But these are strange things; for they hope the emperor will prevail, so no one from Konstanz will lose their possessions, as they themselves are royal. Therefore, it does not make sense, and these people always go in secrecy and darkness; it will be revealed one day.</p>
      <p>It has been said by a commissioner: "If this city must become imperial and a free city again, it is fundamentally ruined and completely destroyed; for it is not in all its power to satisfy all those and make reparations to those who have claims against it and against whom the king must now defend it."</p>
      <p>Among other things, my cousin, whom I have in Rheinfelden, writes to me that they are not worried about any war; for I know well and better than they do what the people of Basel have committed to. I cannot think what it might be, except that there is a rumor that they have agreed to the Interim. Others say it is otherwise nonsense in their response, hence the adversaries suspect that they will have no trouble with them, which is why I would have liked to understand from you what the response actually was.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
