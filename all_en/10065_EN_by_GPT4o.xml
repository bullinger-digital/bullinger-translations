    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to Steiner's inquiry regarding vows and emphasizes that the rigid fulfillment of them is less important than their content and purpose. There are also godless vows, as the Holy Scripture proves.</p>

      <p>- - - who, if he had either inscribed or revoked his foolish and thoughtless promise with wine, after seeing the atrocity of the vow, would have sinned less and been worthy of pardon; but now, having cruelly fulfilled even the atrocious promise in action, knowingly what he was doing, he has also marked it as a crime.</p>
      <p>I indeed confess that it is true that what you have vowed once must be fulfilled in action, for the honesty and honor of truth demand the same, as does the infamy of lying and inconsistency, but only if in the meantime the vow is such that its fulfillment in action does not lead to wickedness or infamy. But if it either defames or is a crime, it is indeed better to have sinned only in words than to join evil deeds to ill-considered words.</p>
      <p>We have, however, a very strong example of this matter in the sacred texts, in the most courageous and prudent Hebrew leader Jephthah. For he vowed a parricide to God, but unknowingly, that he vowed such a disastrous thing. But when he realized it, would he not have acted more wisely and better if he had refrained from parricide? No one denies it, as even Josephus the Jew otherwise greatly accuses Jephthah's deed, that his sacrifice or vow was neither dear to God nor legitimate, and indeed among all ecclesiastics it has become established that Jephthah was indeed foolish in vowing, but also impious in fulfilling. For this sentence of Jerome is well known to all. But listen here, how steadfastly Jephthah proceeds in his vow: "I have opened," he says, "my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot do otherwise" [Judges 11:35]. For he had persuaded himself with no other argument than that he had vowed, just as you have now objected that you have vowed entirely, whence it must also be fulfilled without hesitation. Meanwhile, Jephthah would have acted more rightly if he had not done what he did through the vow. Therefore, whether we like it or not, these words of the law admit the condition: Whatever you have vowed in word, you will fulfill in deed; namely this: if you have vowed justly, sacredly, and legitimately. For it is not in vain added: "If you vow to the Lord your God" [Deuteronomy 23:21]. For what is impious or illegitimate is not pleasing to God, therefore it is not a vow; hence it would have been better to abstain from an impious deed than to impiously fulfill foolish words or vows.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, as for the place in Psalm 75: "Vow and pay" [Psalm 76:12] it is often cited mutilated by many, with a corrupted sense. For the prophet clearly speaks of gifts to be offered to God, which is a matter of externals and ceremonies. For thus the prophet exhorts to offer sacrifices: "Vow and pay to the Lord your God, all who are around him, bring gifts" [Psalm 76:12]. And indeed this word is frequent in the scriptures: "to pay a vow," which means to pay and fulfill what we have promised, namely of external things. For the vow of the ancients bound to external things, which the whole reason for vowing has been abolished. Not that we cannot vow in the way we mentioned above, but that no one can support vows anymore with those scriptures, which they are accustomed to. For all the sacrifices, offerings, and sacrifices of the law have been terminated in Christ, furthermore, the vows of the ancients were mostly inherent in those offerings, therefore abolished together with them. The offering of Christians is innocence, beneficence, and prayer: Romans 12 [1], Hebrews 13 [15f]. But if you examine the books of the ancient prophets more sincerely, you will find that vows are mostly taken for those things and not for external perpetual rites.</p>
      <p>As for the Nazarenes, others among the more learned and pious have responded thus, that the Lord commanded many things to the children of Israel, which he neither needed nor delighted in, but commanded to be done for him, lest they be done for demons, and that this rite is no less abolished than the whole reason for vowing. But that Paul undertakes a vow, indeed teaches charity more than the rite of vowing, we testify to the Acts of the Apostles [21:23 ff] and a similar almost fact: the circumcision of Timothy, about which also in Galatians chapter 2 [3].</p>
      <p>Moreover, the place 1 Timothy 5 [3ff] does nothing against us, but for us. For Paul commands Timothy not to quickly or rashly undertake those who through foolishness pretend and thus vow chastity; for he knows that many falsely promise and do not truly fulfill what they promise. Whence afterwards, when they change their state of living, judgment or condemnation (ein f√ºrzug) arises, because they have not satisfied that first promise. Therefore, before they promise, he advises to keep them away from foolish intent; whence we clearly understand that condemnation in this place is not taken for the condemnation of the soul, but for the stain of infamy. Let the place of Paul be read in full, and it will appear, to whom it supports!</p>
      <p>These are, Werner, dearest brother, what we had at present concerning vows and we dedicate them to you - whatever they may be, if not polished, certainly not entirely impious - and we pray that you consider these few things favorably.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give our best regards to Pellicanus, our teacher.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of November 1530.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger, Bremgarten.</p>
