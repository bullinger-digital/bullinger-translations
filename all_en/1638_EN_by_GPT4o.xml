      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Today we are expecting our envoys sent to the King of France; they have written in these words: After they were interrogated by His Majesty, a response was given: 1. If the government at Ensisheim releases all prisoners without any compensation, also, if something was taken from someone, it should be returned to him without any of his costs, 2. That they will not hinder anyone in the future who wishes to go to the crown of France, granting a free pass forever, 3. That they are willing to accept that it will be negotiated at the next imperial diet, 4. That they are willing to comply if a tax is imposed on them, also to send him provisions according to his needs: if they swear to observe these articles, the king wishes to preserve this region from all persecution and incursion. What does this mean? King Ferdinand will not do this, or if he promises now, he will not keep it.</p>
      <p>Your envoys are with us, waiting for ours, who will come today, splendidly received and honorably dismissed by the king.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schertlin also wrote (to whom I sent your booklet today through a certain messenger to the camp) that not everyone should be believed who spreads various things about this war and about Duke Maurice. The military matters are safe. Strasbourg has not yet surrendered, sent a third delegation to the king, and Hedio writes that these envoys, who were sent to the king on May 7th, will bring either peace or war. A diet is being held in Worms by the bishops of Trier, Cologne, Mainz, Worms, and Speyer; also the Elector Palatine with barons and nobles are present.</p>
      <p>They will consult on what should be answered to the French. Furthermore, various rumors are being spread, about which I wrote through Held, the preacher of Augsburg. We hear nothing at all about Maurice's army. The entire nobility is terrified both in Sundgau and in Breisgau. The soldiers are stuck without a leader, I don't know in which place; a large number of nobles with their wives and children have flocked to us. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 10, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Parma has been freed from siege. What if the Emperor were to join this army to himself? Soon the son of the late Paul Fagius will come to you, from whom you will hear in detail what is happening in England.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned lords Theodor Bibliander and Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most respected in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
