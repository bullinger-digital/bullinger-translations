      <p>S. D. I hope, my brother, that you have already received our letters along with the token of love enclosed; then you will understand that your letters, which you had entrusted to the coachman, have been delivered to us.</p>
      <p>Take care diligently that the Duke of Württemberg does not spread pamphlets throughout France and incite disturbances and contentions.</p>
      <p>That prince is diligent and in every way strives to impose Luther's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, that is, the Augsburg Confession with the Apology, on everyone.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, he is a good prince, but in this matter, he is astonishingly hasty.</p>
      <p>Now disturbances have arisen in Saxony because of the Palatinate Catechism, with some approving it, others abhorring it.</p>
      <p>They say that the prince has become Zwinglian and Calvinist.</p>
      <p>You know that Sulcer subscribed in Strasbourg to the cause of Zanchi, to the Augsburg Confession and the Apology.</p>
      <p>You know that Eber wrote a book against our doctrine on the supper, in which there are many absurdities.</p>
      <p>In the German example, he has Calvin's name, which he openly connects with Zwingli's, but he did not include it in the Latin version.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the King of France argued with me a lot about forming a treaty with the king, and that at your command, who had discussed this matter with him in Basel.</p>
      <p>I think he made it all up.</p>
      <p>For I hear that he is not to be trusted.</p>
      <p>I have not read Ochino's book, nor would I have time to read it. However, I do not think he aligns with the Servetians, Grybaldists, and Blandratists, whom he openly curses.</p>
      <p>And to Thretio, who was about to depart for Poland, he solemnly affirmed that he abhors the Italians in Poland who dispute against the worship of the Trinity.</p>
      <p>He also promised to give him letters against those scoundrels.</p>
      <p>And he did, if I am not mistaken.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if he refutes strong arguments with weaker ones, I attribute it more to ignorance and senile delirium than to malice.</p>
      <p>In recent days, his wife died from a serious accident, leaving him with children, etc.</p>
      <p>He is very miserable.</p>
      <p>I think he, being very afflicted, will not survive others for long.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, I have written to Mr. Calvin and Ionville.</p>
      <p>I beg you to continue diligently writing to us about the affairs of France.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us. June 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger. Not reread.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Théodore de Bèze, faithful minister of the Church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
