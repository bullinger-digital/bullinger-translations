    <p xml:id="regest1">Just as he revised his booklet on the origin of the error of worshipping gods and images [from 1529], he also revised the one on the error of the Mass [from 1528]; starting from the redemption through Christ, he discusses therein the Lord's Supper, its naming, its simple apostolic form, the origin of the Mass, and the disputes over transubstantiation. Of Wolfgang Joner, Andreas Hoffmann, and Peter Simler, to whom he dedicated his first work [in 1528], only Simler remains; to him, who commendably reestablished the school in Kappel after the Second War of Kappel, he dedicates the present work, for undoubtedly he will continue to protect the truth and combat errors.</p>

      <p>Preface to the book on the origin of error concerning the Lord's Supper and the papal Mass addressed to Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>Just as I have now, with a definite purpose, revised and enriched the booklet on the origin of error concerning the invocation and worship of gods and images, published ten years ago, so I have also wished to bring back under the anvil and render more complete the booklet that was once published on the origin of error in the matter of the Eucharist and the Mass. Trusting in divine goodness, I am confident that I will now expound the whole matter more clearly, more abundantly, and more diligently.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I begin by discussing the mystery of redemption and the union of the faithful with God through Jesus Christ, as well as the institution, power, efficacy, and use of the sacred supper. From here, I bring forth certain things about its nomenclature and various appellations. Then I show with what purity and simplicity, without the pomp of ceremonies, the apostles and those who immediately followed the times of the apostles celebrated the supper. To these, I soon add whence our rite of the Mass comes, furthermore how and by what means that impious and profit-driven market of Masses has grown. Finally, I touch upon that horrible contention of learned men of the later age over the most perplexing matter of transubstantiation, and I add what absurd and impious things immediately followed.</p>
      <p>I had previously dedicated that little work, as you know, to the most illustrious man, Wolfgang Joner, a most worthy patron, Andreas Hoffmann, and to you. Eleven years have intervened, and in the meantime, to the great sorrow of all good men and to the greatest detriment of studies, those most pious and brave brothers have been taken by fate. You alone remain, an old friend and yourself well-deserving of me and of letters and the learned, for you stood out as a kind of restorer of the school in Kappel during the very difficult times and greatly troubled circumstances after the disaster at Kappel. Therefore, I wished to dedicate this revised book of mine on the origin of error concerning the sacred Lord's Supper and the papal Mass to you once again. For you will undoubtedly continue to uphold and confess the recognized truth, and to support and be present for the eager ones, who, after we are dead, will descend into the arena fearlessly and under the emperor Christ, fight wisely and bravely for orthodox truth against papal errors and superstitions, and by the power of the divine will conquer to the glory of God and the safety of His church.</p>
