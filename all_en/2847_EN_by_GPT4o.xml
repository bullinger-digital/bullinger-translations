      <p>Since your, my dear Mr. Bullinger, most vigilant pastor, known is the pious concern, with which you are accustomed to be anxious for all the churches of Christ, even those far distant from you, as to how they are doing, I thought I would do something not ungrateful to you if I wrote to you in a few words about the state of our churches here. They are indeed in a fairly good place and are daily advancing more in the sincere doctrine of Christ. The sacramental controversy now seems almost buried among us, except that some secretly murmur against us and some of the leading men seem to nurture some kind of monster. But the Lord, whatever it is that they are cunningly plotting under the pretext of the Augsburg Confession, can easily overthrow and catch the cunning in their own craftiness. Meanwhile, a certain Anabaptist has given us no small trouble these days, everywhere slandering us among the people as false teachers and claiming that we, being conscious of our own guilt, flee from engaging in public debate with him. The matter has finally been brought to the point that during these Bacchanalia, in the sight of the whole church, a debate was held for three whole days about the incarnation of the Lord Christ, whose origin he sometimes asserted to be from the substance of the Holy Spirit, sometimes from the substance of God the Father, suddenly from the nature of the Word, and finally from nothing, since he was so inconsistent in doctrine and said he could not refute the arguments presented, the truth triumphed and he, with the utmost shame, is now compelled to move elsewhere with his followers. However, he established the main support of his error in the claim that women by nature have no seed, but that they merely receive the seed like fields, which, placed in the womb as in a field, develops into a human being, women contributing nothing to the material of the fetus except nourishment and gestation, for which services women are called mothers of their offspring. Thus Christ is called the son of Mary, the fruit of her womb, her seed, because the divine seed was received from her, retained, gestated, and brought forth into the light, not because she contributed anything of her substance to the material of Christ's human nature, which she could not have contributed in any way, as he said, since women lack seed.</p>
      <p>We, on the other hand, taught with many testimonies cited from the Old and New Testaments that seed is attributed to women as well as to men. If we had not been able to show this, our cause would have come into great suspicion among the people and, in my judgment, could have been defended with more difficulty. And therefore I am surprised that Mr. Musculus writes in the 17th chapter of Genesis as if the propagation of the human race were from the male seed alone, and thus seems to take away the seed from the woman. If our adversaries were to observe this once in Musculus's writings, no one would believe what boasts they would make and would now promise themselves victory among all. Musculus's authority is great everywhere, and if our cause is burdened by his prejudice, it will be more difficult to silence our antagonists, who are very experienced men. Therefore, we wish to ask you in the name of Christ to deign to remind Mr. Musculus about these things, so that if he is of the opinion that women do not have seed, he may nevertheless pass over it in silence in his writings, especially since we have Galen and many places of Scripture on our side, lest Menno abuse his authority against us. But if Mr. Musculus is of the same opinion as we are, he should be admonished to publish it at the first opportunity and explain his mind concerning those words in the 17th chapter of Genesis. I beseech you, for the sake of the churches of Christ, which here and throughout Lower Germany are gravely disturbed and harassed by the Mennonites because of this doctrine of the incarnation of Christ, to remind Mr. Musculus of these things, so that he may come to the aid of the struggling church at the earliest opportunity. I was also going to write to Mr. Musculus about these things at the request of some brothers, if I had been as well known to him as to you, and if I had not also thought that he would be more easily induced to this matter by your authority. We hear, my lord Bullinger, that you are engaged in explaining the Apocalypse; would that you would share with all other churches what you have so richly imparted to your church for several years now, at least publish the heads of your sermons on the prophets, the historical books of Scripture, and the apostolic epistles; in my judgment, you would render the church a most useful service. For the brevity of those heads of your sermons is copious and full of juice and most clearly opens the mind of Scripture. Would that, my lord, you would once allow yourself to be persuaded here and make an attempt from the prophets themselves. You forgive this my liberty, which I take from zeal for the propagation of the gospel of Christ, and I do not doubt that you will interpret it well for your piety. I pray that we may be informed of Mr. Musculus's opinion at the earliest opportunity; for many brothers and ministers of the word are anxious with me in this cause because of the wickedness of the adversaries, who on all sides seize arms like madmen and are more eager to fight with quibbles than with just arms, if indeed they dare to oppose Aristotle to us. What would they do if they understood that Musculus was on their side (for Menno hunts for such things from our writings), unless Mr. Musculus himself promptly intervenes. However, I do not think it necessary to write anything to you about the death of the most holy woman, the widow of Hooper, and her little daughter Rachel. I am now the only survivor of the Hooper family that was with you. May the Lord finally join me to them in his kingdom. Do not be reluctant to convey my greetings to my esteemed teachers Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Father Pellican, and Mr. Gesner. If I were familiar with your language, I would respond to my old hostess Mutter Zwingli's letters, which are very dear to me for many reasons. I beseech you, if it is not troublesome, to deign to convey my greetings. All our brothers here greet you, especially Mr. Johannes Utenhovius and my colleague Vincentius, than whom I could not wish for a more faithful and suitable fellow student. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Norden, Friesland, March 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother and servant, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
