      <p>Greetings. If you are well, that is good; I am indeed very well, thanks to God. For a long time now, we have been hearing various and unfortunate rumors, but nothing is written from Bern or elsewhere that we can embrace as certain. However, since it is in our interest (as Christians) to know the truth of these matters, namely so that we may be rendered more fervent in prayer, I ask you, father, in my name and in the name of other faithful ones, to send me the most certain information you have through the next messenger. Moreover, I wish to be informed about your private affairs and those of your family. Mine are, as always, not only tolerable but also very joyful. I hope, however, that after one or two months, I will see you; for the longer I am absent from you, the more eager I become to share with you whatever joy there is. As for where I derive this (if indeed I inquire into the nearest and contributing causes), I can easily express: your care in education, your example, which I have often noted diligently, has made me thrifty, so that I am more agreeable with everyone, an enemy to no one, and possess, in part, other things conducive to communal life. And now, as the years increase, so does my understanding of the good things I have received from you, and simultaneously, the zeal for true gratitude accumulates, which I wish I could express in the future as is fitting. I now send you Münster cheese, small indeed and not yet mature, but the best I could obtain; I hope it will be good when it has matured.</p>
      <p>I am sending a more mature one to my stepfather; take from it mutually, until yours is also suitable for eating. I ask, however, that you consider the spirit of the sender rather than what is sent.</p>
      <p>My wife greets you, as do brothers Michael with Jacob, my most esteemed lords, as well as Vulpius and the Wittenbachs, my dearest friends. Greet your wife with my words most diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Biel, 5 days before the Kalends of September, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most revered father. Zürich.</p>
