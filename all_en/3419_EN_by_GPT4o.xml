      <p>Praise God always, 1557, on the 27th of November in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Revered, highly learned sir, my humble and entirely willing service is offered to your reverence. Your letter from the 19th of November reached me well on the 26th of the same month.</p>
      <p>First of all, your reverence is most grateful for the friendship and kindness that I show to your son here, which are small kindnesses from me and not worthy of thanks. However, whatever love and friendship I show to your mentioned son here, I wish to do it from the heart and with willing inclination, along with my friendship.</p>
      <p>Your reverence can be assured of this from us, and it shall also be proven by deeds.</p>
      <p>I should have written to your reverence in Latin; however, due to business and dealings, I have fallen out of practice; I ask your reverence not to take offense at this.</p>
      <p>Now nothing more, except that we are known to be at your reverence's and all others' service, and we ask that you do not hesitate to call upon us. The grace of the Almighty be with us all, amen.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's humble servant, Marx Jenisch. To the revered and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor, my gracious lord. Zurich.</p>
