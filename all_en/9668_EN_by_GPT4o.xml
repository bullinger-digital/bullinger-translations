      <p>Greetings. Fietzius returns to you, and through him, I send back to you Schmidelin and thank you for sharing him with me. I have not yet seen the writing of the people of Heidelberg, and I also wish to see it; for that shameless slanderer deserves to be treated badly. We know very little, indeed we have nothing, except that all of France is in turmoil. Andelot and Coligny, who are with us, do not receive any certain news themselves. It was also rumored that Christopher, the son of the Elector Palatine, was killed; but Zuleger writes that he has reached Wesel. A successor to Aretio has not yet been appointed; an election has indeed been held and several candidates proposed; but from these, the senate will choose whom they wish, once more members are present; for most are currently absent from the city.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to add, except to commend you to the grace of the Lord. Your friends and brothers greet you, especially Lavallensis and Coligny, together with Merlin and Gracilis.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 13, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
