    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to No. 110, in which Bullinger expressed astonishment and outrage over the signing of the Augsburg Confession and its Apology by the people of Strasbourg. Bucer does not intend to persuade the people of Zurich to do anything similar; he only wishes that both parties "sign" for Christ. For him, unity means tolerance without sacrificing the truth and consideration for the weaker, as practiced by Paul towards the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem to avoid a break. No one possesses the Spirit alone. Thus, one should also grant the Lutherans, who are brothers, certain expressions; their errors are not serious. Luther is indeed "morose" and vehement, but he has earned great merit by emphasizing "sola fide" and "solus Christus" and is neither ambitious nor a scorpion, but a member of Christ like the people of Zurich. He should not be insulted any more than Zwingli. In Bucer's eyes, Luther means the same to the world as Zwingli does to the Swiss Confederation. To Bullinger's ironic question about what Bucer is striving for if there is already unity on the issue of the Lord's Supper: In the matter itself, there is indeed unity, only in words are there contradictions; human nature, the flesh, loves disputes. The people of Zurich do not understand Luther; they hear something from him and attribute to him something he never said, namely the presence of the "substantial" body of Christ in the Lord's Supper. They hate and despise Luther and judge him unjustly, as also shown by Bullinger's remark that Luther could not even hold a candle to Reuchlin, Zwingli, etc. The people of Zurich conceal Zwingli's mistakes, while the disgraceful peace is due to his alliance policy (his refusal to sign the Tetrapolitana and thus secure the support of the Lutheran states). The Zurich argument from the Creed ("Sits at the right hand of God") does not hold, as this phrase is only an allegory. One should not speak so confidently about such difficult questions, rather remain silent and wait. A look back at the Lord's Supper dispute since Marburg shows that Zwingli misunderstood Luther from the beginning, on the other hand, Luther also came to the false conviction that according to Zwingli's teaching, nothing but bread is offered in the Lord's Supper; therefore, he insists on condemnation. The people of Strasbourg did not inform Zurich about the signing beforehand? They were not consulted at all before the disgraceful peace agreement of the people of Zurich! Despite all the agreement with the Lutherans, the people of Strasbourg did not sign a condemnation of the people of Zurich. The accusation of inconsistency is unfounded because the people of Strasbourg have always declared since the Augsburg Diet that they agree with Luther on the matter and do not want to be considered his enemies. He, Bucer, is slandered by the people of Zurich, yet he only wants to help heal the rift among the churches and sees himself as an ambassador of Christ. The people of Zurich should not doubt his brotherly love, even if he writes so openly. In the future, neither party should publish anything on this matter without the knowledge of the other side. - In conclusion, he summarizes: The people of Zurich should 1.) pray that Christ frees them from self-love and hatred, 2.) read all of Luther's writings, 3.) agree on the criteria of being a Christian, 4.) show Christian love and reconciliation, 5.) practice tolerance, 6.) reconsider the doctrine of the sacraments from Scripture so that believers better understand that Christ is in their midst, 7.) exercise forbearance with the weak.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, most esteemed Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I respond late. Do not suspect any other reason for this than that I wanted to respond in a manner that I believe is worthy of both you and me and will help preserve our friendship in the Lord. To make this clearer and more sincere, I wanted to write back to you with my responses attached to your letters. This way, you can more easily judge your and my writings when compared. I wish to do this as is fitting for ministers of Christ and in such a sacred matter. So, you began thus.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger: I was so astonished by your letter to Leo, most learned Bucer, that I could not help but oppose it with these, however humble, of mine. Since they come from a friendly spirit, I do not doubt that you will consider them in good faith.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer: I am grateful, not at all displeased, that you oppose your writings when you think they should be opposed. For everyone must act according to their faith everywhere, especially when dealing with the business of Christ. But that you were so astonished by my writings, you are of a different mind than the most excellent minister of Christ, Zwingli, who, when he read the same writings from the Augsburg Diet, did not express any offense. But I also take your astonishment in good faith. Everyone is affected by their faith.</p>
      <p>Heinrich: Your entire letter revolves mainly around persuading us to either subscribe to or yield to Luther in the matter of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Martin: I wanted to persuade neither and would wish that whenever the writings of brothers do not appeal at first glance, we would examine them a little more diligently upon rereading before judging them among ourselves, let alone undertaking to oppose them. In those letters, I was urging that you should not rashly reject concord with Luther and that he should not be provoked without urgent cause. Then, if that does not please you, you should still strive to understand what he writes correctly. Then you should oppose him more modestly, and finally, you should not count us among those who dissent from him. For in reality, we do not doubt that we feel the same on both sides, even if he does not acknowledge this. If you had sent me my letters or a copy of them, I would prove with my words that the matter stands as I write.</p>
      <p>H.: Thus, indeed, you have subscribed to the Saxon doctrines.</p>
      <p>M.: You did not read this in my letters with such generality. For we did not subscribe to their doctrines but deemed it necessary to ensure that nothing contrary to them was taught openly among us. Furthermore, since the plan for peace to be obtained from the emperor, in which this condition was to be included, did not proceed, nothing was accepted or subscribed to, and we all remain in the same freedom we were in before this assembly, etc.</p>
      <p>H.: Before you begin the truth, you try to obtain that you may enjoy your faith, since you allow Leo to abound in his.</p>
      <p>M.: I took the name of faith here in the sense that Paul does when he says: "Whatever is not from faith is sin" [Rom 14:23], where he calls each person's persuasion about what is approved or disapproved by God, whether true or false, faith. For if you falsely believe something displeases the Lord and yet do it, it is sin.</p>
      <p>H.: To which I would not much object, provided faith keeps its rule. For we know that "faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God" [Rom 10:17]. We also know that the apostle wrote: "If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God" [1 Pet 4:11]; "if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent" [1 Cor 14:30]; "and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion but of peace" [1 Cor 14:32f], and elsewhere: "Therefore, as many as are perfect, let us have this mind. And if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you, nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind" [Phil 3:15f]. And therefore, if your faith, my dear Bucer, or anyone else's is from the word of truth, we accept it; if not, we will modestly decline.</p>
      <p>M.: If you had deemed my writings worthy of closer inspection, you would have seen that these are unnecessary for me. Who does not know, my dear Bullinger, that no one's faith should be followed unless it is true, that is, based on the word of God, and that only those who truly speak this are to be heard as prophets? Nor did I ask you to follow my faith, but that it should not be required that I follow yours where I do not recognize it as true, that is, I asked, using Paul's trope, that you would not require me to speak anything other than what I can believe to be the word of God.</p>
      <p>For it often happens that even the holiest do not understand the word of God in the same way, and yet each is persuaded that they are following the true sense of Scripture and the undoubted will of God. Certainly, when Paul and Barnabas could not agree about Mark, neither wanted to follow anything other than the word of God.</p>
      <p>H.: So also in the matter of Luther. If Luther has the prophetic spirit, he is subject to the prophets; moreover, if he is subject to the prophets, he will plainly confess the truth, and if he confesses this truth, all discord will be removed. But if he is not subject and causes disturbances, he does not have the spirit of God, who is the author of peace, not of disturbances. Who then will subscribe to him?</p>
      <p>M.: If this argument proceeds, no mortal at all has the spirit of God, and no one at all can be subscribed to in any matter. For there is no human who does not err and often causes disturbances, even when they seem to be most earnestly establishing the kingdom of God. We ourselves have more than enough examples. But look at Peter and Barnabas now "not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel" [Gal 2:14]. The spirit, that is, the power of prophecy, is subject to the prophets who are truly endowed with the same power, yielding in place and deferring so that the word of God may be rightly and orderly administered in the church. Luther accepts this. But in what you oppose him, he does not recognize you as prophets to whom he should subject his spirit. You judge the same of him when his prophecy opposes yours. And it may be that you err somewhere no less than he does. Yet you are of the mind that you will never knowingly refuse to subject your spirit to true prophets. Therefore, it does not follow that if his spirit does not subject itself to true prophets in some doctrine - because he thinks they, not he, are mistaken - that he therefore never speaks the truth. Nor does it hold: If he is subject to the prophets, he speaks the truth. For they can be mistaken on both sides. We are still burdened with the flesh, the seedbed of errors and lies, nor do we immediately speak from the spirit of truth in all things, even though we are truly endowed with it, nor do we immediately lack it entirely, "even if we stumble seven times in a day" [Lk 17:4]. Therefore, we are of the opinion that no one should be subscribed to because they have often spoken the truth, nor should anyone not be subscribed to because they have often erred, but rather all things should be tested, by whatever authority they are presented, and what each recognizes as true by their own spirit, that alone should they embrace, for the just lives by their own faith, not another's. But all these things are disputed outside the case. For it never occurred to me to command you to subscribe to Luther. What I aimed at was that you would recognize that in the matter of the Eucharist, you are not so far from the truth on either side - if only you would bear to understand each other well - that you could not, if not subscribe to them or they to you, at least confess that both subscribe to Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: Indeed, Paul does not want the weaker to be accepted for the sake of concord, but he says that the weaker are led by God to embrace what is more perfect. Now, you yourself may explain what is more perfect in the Eucharist. So explain to us, most learned Bucer, what kind of doctrine we have attained from God in the Eucharist, in which we agree and proceed by the same rule, whether it is Luther's or ours. Certainly, Luther's doctrine is weaker, as even your books prove, so ours is more perfect. For if both opinions are the same, why do you labor for concord, which otherwise comes through the assent of truth? But if they are different and ours is more perfect, theirs weaker, why do you call us to a concord to which Paul did not call?</p>
      <p>M.: How desirable it would be if we would examine the writings of others as we want ours to be examined. How much less strife there would be and more concord in truth. Neither Paul nor I, who cited Paul, are of the opinion that anyone should desist from a more perfect opinion to an imperfect one. But neither is one truth more perfect than another, that is, more truth. Every doctrine is simply either true or false. But one faith can be more perfect than another because one person can be more persuaded about more truths and more certain about the same truths than another. Hence Paul calls some stronger in faith, who hold more fully how far Christian liberty extends, and others weaker, who indeed believe in Christ and have embraced him as their redeemer, but do not yet see that they have been made lords of all things and can use anything to the glory of God. He exhorts those who are stronger in faith to accept those who have not reached where they are in faith and are thus weaker, not to contentious and anxious disputes, but to bear with them amicably and to be careful not to urge them to do what they cannot yet recognize as permissible against their conscience. From these, I usually conclude thus. Paul commands to accept those who, due to weakness of faith, thought there was still a necessity for the ceremonies of the law, which indeed implied that not all righteousness was to be expected from Christ, which those weaker in faith did not recognize as following, otherwise they would have explicitly denied Christ, which Paul rightly affirms when writing to the Galatians. Much more, therefore, are those to be accepted who piously feel about the Eucharist but think that the true opinion should be expressed in those words which we believe are not clear enough and are generally an occasion for error. And let it be that they also err plainly in their sense and believe that Christ in the supper establishes his body present by some miracle beyond the manner of presence which we affirm is salvific from the scriptures and granted only to believers. If some were still held by the superstition of foods and therefore did not yet seek all righteousness from Christ, yet they were to be regarded and cherished as brothers to such an extent that more perfect Christians had to yield their liberty to them in place and Paul dared to say of these that they do not eat to the Lord and therefore should be left to their Lord. How much more fitting is it to regard the Lutherans as brothers and to yield our liberty to them in time, so that those who believe that fictitious miracle to the Lord may also be left to their Lord. For this error, in which those Judaizing Romans were held, is not to be compared, from which it followed that Christ was not our savior - for you know what Paul infers from this in the letter to the Galatians - since this is a simple error born from a false understanding of the words of Christ, it does not by itself overthrow any part of Christian truth. For the Lutherans everywhere explicitly preach that everything is to be placed solely in faith in Christ. Then they proclaim Christ to be as true a man as he is true God, with natures unmingled. But what the Lutherans falsely believe, they impose on everyone to believe and condemn anyone who cannot bear to believe it. This is the nature of error. For no one who errs knows they are erring, but thinks they are right, and that those who think differently are erring. Therefore, as much as they can, if they are good men who err and true lovers, they try to draw everyone they can into their opinion and condemn all who cannot be persuaded of the same. And rightly so. For what graver sin can a man commit than denying faith to his God? Which they think those do who reject what they follow. For they do not doubt they have the sense of God because they err. Thus, those Romans were animated. They thought it was a sin if any of the Jews ate foods forbidden by the law. Therefore, they thought these foods were to be avoided not only by themselves but by others and condemned anyone who would not avoid them. Hence Paul exhorts them to be satisfied with each other that they both believe in Christ and, despite thinking that the others err, to cultivate only Christian charity among themselves, that those would not judge these, and these would not despise those nor offend them by prematurely urging them to what they could not yet believe was permissible. Now he would never have exhorted the weaker not to judge those who were stronger unless they had been prone to this evil. But he did not require them to acknowledge that those were right - for if they could have done this, all distinction between them would have been removed, and they would have ceased to be weak and could have imitated the liberty of others without offense - but he would have been satisfied to obtain from them that they did not think the error, by which they thought those who believed rightly were held, so great that they should therefore be rejected, but that they should attribute so much to Christ that, despite that error, he can and will save them.</p>
      <p>He contended the same from the stronger. Hence it was that he who eats eats to the Lord, and he who does not eat does not eat to the Lord. Now in the same way, I usually exhort the Lutherans and you that since you cannot be persuaded that you agree in reality, which is most certain to me, and you altogether think that you and they believe differently and what is false about the presence of the Lord in the Eucharist, that you should think this error, which you attribute to each other, is false only to the extent that you should not therefore renounce each other's friendship in Christ. You have already persuaded yourselves of this and have long since voluntarily offered this condition to the Lutherans, so far you are stronger in faith, that is, in the knowledge of the right, the Lutherans have not yet been able to be persuaded of the same, so they are weaker in faith. Now no one commands you to embrace the weakness of these by abandoning your firmness. To abandon what you rightly believe about the Eucharist, who would command this, would command nothing other than to deny Christ? From whom I wish you to be as far away as possible. But I would wish that, since you have long since offered this benevolence to the Lutherans, that you would sincerely show this spirit, and that you would be ready to acknowledge these as brothers, if only this could be done mutually, despite thinking that they are held by some error in the matter of the Eucharist. Thus, you should strive that they may be freed from that error, by which it is a religion for them to have you in the number of brothers. For this one error has hitherto prevented the peace of the churches from being composed. To this end, it would help to bear their injuries and not to do the same with them in the bitterness of writing, much less in the perversity of slandering, and to interpret what is written and done by them not in the worst part, when it could be in the better. Finally, since the whole reason they abhor us is that we seem to them to believe wrongly about the words and sacraments of the Lord, and that this is because they think we use words alien to Scripture when discussing these, we should use those forms of speaking both in writing and speaking that agree more with Scripture and express the common and true opinion more fully. About which I have written more extensively in the common letter. In this way, I would wish that you, who are stronger, would not embrace any weaker doctrine of theirs. Furthermore, what you command, my dear Heinrich, to explain, which of the two follows the more perfect doctrine, you or the Lutherans, I say in my opinion the doctrine of both is the same, but it is not always proposed by either in such words that I think it permissible to imitate the others in all things. Luther certainly began by opposing yours and defending his own in such a way that, I say frankly, I thought he was establishing a cruder manner of the presence of Christ in the supper than later, when he published his last confession, I learned from his own words. Hence immediately, before Zwingli and Oecolampadius responded to that confession, I attempted to pave the way for the concord I saw in the matter by publishing a dialogue of concord.</p>
      <p>But I wonder, my dear Heinrich, why it seemed to you to have any weight when you ask, if the opinion of both is the same, why I labored for concord, as if there are not many more controversies of words than of things, especially among learned men. How many places in this letter of yours do you quarrel with me where we completely agree? And when I labor to explain this to you, I labor for concord between us, even if the matter about which you have instituted a fight with me is entirely the same opinion on both sides. Concord and discord of minds often matter more than what is in the matter itself.</p>
      <p>H.: But you say: "I know from words and writings that he attributes nothing to words or sacraments but admonition and exercise of the mind to faith." And would that it were so, and that Luther himself would freely confess what you impose on him unwillingly. You indeed would greatly wish Luther to speak thus, to think thus, to understand his own words thus. And perhaps he would, if you appealed from contentious to calm, but he does not want to be such. For if he had ever wanted, you would not have spent so many labors in vain in mending concord, which you yourself confess, having been frustrated repeatedly with the dialogue written, with the colloquies held at Marburg, Augsburg, and Coburg. What then do we make him feel other than he feels or wants to feel? Why do we impose on him, I pray, what he has already given himself to the demon, if he begins to feel as you preach about him?</p>
      <p>M.: In what matter, my dear Heinrich, have you ever found me vain, that you allow yourself to suspect me of lying about what I attribute to Luther? And if the Lutherans do not feel or confess to feel about the sacraments and words as I have written, why, I ask, did Zwingli subscribe to the "Marburg Articles" with us? Therefore, I impose nothing on Luther unwillingly, I make him feel nothing that he does not himself testify everywhere in his words, I have cited his words in the common letter and from that book in which he specifically prescribes what is to be taught in the churches about the sacraments. But what I labored for concord was about what could not be agreed upon at Marburg, about the manner of the presence of Christ in the supper, not about the power of words and sacraments. I confess, brother, it has pained me enough that my faith is not more evident to you than to think that I knowingly want to impose such a thing on you.</p>
      <p>H.: What, that you yourself in this very letter: "If concerning the Eucharist," you say, "he believes and teaches from the promise of God that a certain bodily presence of Christ is established above that by which he inserts himself into our minds, while he does not explicitly confess that this presence or its faith is for anyone's salvation, but places everything in that faith by which it is believed that Christ died for us, how great, I ask, is the error?"</p>
      <p>M.: To what end is this? I write "if," you recognize the condition. I once suspected this error and that Luther asserted it, but after he more fully explained his opinion in his last confession, I learned that he establishes nothing more than that Christ truly offers his body in the supper and does not admit the question of how. Which Osiander also recently attested in writing to a friend. But I meant here that even if he were held by this error I mentioned, it is not such an error that we should renounce his friendship in Christ because of it.</p>
      <p>H.: You think this error should be forgiven him. And indeed we would forgive it if we had ever found any candor of sincerity in this man, if he did not abuse our indulgence.</p>
      <p>M.: I think so, if indeed he were held by it. I have just cited the reason why I think so from Paul, which I believe is satisfactory. But why do you write that you would forgive Luther this error if you had ever found any candor in him and he did not abuse your indulgence? Surely nothing that can be forgiven by a Christian should be left unforgiven by any human wickedness. For a Christian considers not what others deserve, but what is worthy of themselves, perfect in goodness, "as the heavenly Father is perfect" [Mt 5:48], doing good even to the wicked. And I must confess that with many Lutherans we cannot communicate, but not because of this error we are discussing, even if it were certain that they are held by it, but because they falsely think us to impiously feel about the sacraments and reject us first, nor do they endure to admit any just satisfaction from us. For it is not permissible to have communion with the unwilling. But this error, which you attribute to him, we have always deemed forgivable, however much we cannot cultivate the fellowship of Christ with the unwilling.</p>
      <p>H.: Indeed, if it were permissible to forgive this through the simplicity of truth.</p>
      <p>M.: What cannot be forgiven through the simplicity of truth cannot be forgiven, however candidly Luther would deal with you, not abusing your indulgence. Yet you say you would forgive him this error if only he had dealt candidly with you.</p>
      <p>H.: For what need is there to invent another presence than that which is handed down in the Scriptures? What promises of God will he cite to us about a bodily presence? But what necessity was there to establish a bodily presence?</p>
      <p>M.: There was no need, nor did he establish any such thing. I wrote: "Suppose he establishes it - how great, I ask, is the error?" Especially since he simultaneously dogmatizes explicitly and above all that Christ became a true man and that we are justified by faith without any works. Therefore, what you ask here is irrelevant. But since Luther asserts nothing more than what is contained in these words "This is my body," you should not demand any promises from him beyond these very words.</p>
      <p>H.: Finally, to invent another faith with the sophists than that which is salvific?</p>
      <p>M.: What, I ask, does he invent, my dear Bullinger? Do you not acknowledge that faith is to be had in all the words of Scripture and yet, unless one simultaneously believes that God is their Father through Christ, they cannot be saved and therefore there is a faith that is necessary but not salvific? Unless you believe Paul, as he and Luke remember, surrounded by heavenly light near Damascus, you cannot be saved. For you derogate faith from the Holy Spirit. But if you do not also believe your Savior, what will it profit you to have believed that? So in the present, however much you believe that Christ offers his body in the supper for salvation, it will not be, even if it is to your destruction, unless you also believe this is the price of your redemption. These, my dear Heinrich, are not sufficiently considered objections, but are held by others as calumnies, and thus, when they also find in you what they detest in Luther, they think that you are no less than him in this dispute and therefore desire this fight to be ended in any way. How old is this, if you do not believe even the least of what Scripture records, you have denied all Scripture and yet historical faith, if it is alone, does not by itself lead to salvation. Yet I too, before I saw what kind of presence of the Lord in the supper the Lutherans establish, always objected to them, when we could not see in these words of the Lord what, as they also admit, even if you believe, is not by itself for salvation, while agreeing with them on all that we both acknowledge as salvific, that they have a reason to treat us more gently, yet I also confessed entirely that what we could not see, if it is in the words of the Lord, must be believed, however much believing it, unless you also believe that Christ died for you, accomplishes nothing for salvation. Therefore, it is not so absurd to demand that you believe what, though believed, is not by itself salvific.</p>
      <p>H.: But if he explicitly confesses that all those figments of his, about which there is meanwhile dispute, do nothing for salvation, he certainly contends for a thing of no value, but with a perfidious and most impious judgment he has condemned us, indeed he has hitherto mocked the church of God. For if the flesh profits nothing when eaten, why does he continually draw the cord of contention? Why does he pursue those who teach this, banish them, and advise them to yield?</p>
      <p>M.: But where here, my dear Bullinger, is candor? Where is Christian modesty? I wanted to show that there is a reason not to renounce Christian friendship with Luther, for if it is certain that he establishes a certain presence of Christ beyond that salvific one which we both preach, while he inculcates everywhere that we are justified and saved by faith alone in Christ and therefore in that presence which we also acknowledge and preach, this error is not of such a kind that it cannot be borne - against these you object with such dire things, which, I ask, consider to proceed. I have already reminded you, which you do not ignore, but in indignation against Luther you were carried away and did not think when you wrote these things, that there are many things to be believed and done which, although they do nothing for salvation by themselves, since we are saved by faith alone in Christ, yet unless you believe them and do them, you cannot be saved. For those who fight for these things fight for the authority and faith of the word of God, not for nothing. For although they are nothing by themselves, yet those things which are everything cannot be without them and cannot be had. Where does Luther not proclaim that he fights against us for the authority of the words of God? For he who has denied all of Scripture has denied even a single jot, knowing it to be contained in Scripture. For if it is found false in one place, it is no longer the Scripture of God. How much, I ask, have you opened the field for Luther to agitate your negligence or malevolence if you allow yourselves to write against him in this way? The flesh profits nothing when eaten carnally, so neither does the word of God heard or baptism received profit. But does he fight for nothing who asserts that even carnally, that is, externally, the word of God is to be heard and baptism to be received? Or does he condemn with a perfidious and impious judgment who condemns those whom he does not doubt are trying to abolish the commands of God? How does he mock the church who contends that what he contends must be preserved, without which the church cannot exist, namely the authority and faith of the words of God in any matter, even one that by itself contributes nothing to salvation? Therefore, here your hallucination betrays itself twice, that you judge the erring as if they were knowing and, when Luther confesses that believing the presence of Christ without faith in his redemption is not salvific, you conclude that he contends for nothing, when he affirms the presence of Christ, which he acknowledges is not by itself for salvation, and therefore condemns you perfidiously and mocks the church when he condemns you for denying what is established by the word of God.</p>
      <p>H.: Is this the sincerity of a theologian, to envelop the light of truth in darkness, to cover impostures in an open matter, and to weave tricks in Christian simplicity, and to do all this out of a desire for contention and arrogance? Has that saying of the poet escaped us: "The tale of truth is simple, but the unjust word, being sick in itself, needs wise medicines," or that of the most holy Paul: "Do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no? But I call God as witness, that our word to you was not yes and no. For the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, was not yes and no, but in him was yes" [2 Cor 1:17-19]. "For we are not as many, peddling the word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ" [2 Cor 2:17]? Why then do you advise that the whole church of Christ should be considered? Judge for yourself, dearest Bucer, whether it is to have regard for the church to consent to some deceiver, to connive at his impostures, to allow him to impose on the simple with a veil of words, to lead astray and defame the more discerning, and thus to mock the whole church of God, the holy bride of Christ, in the sight of God, and to do all this so as not to seem to admit a designated error.</p>
      <p>M.: O charity, where have you turned? How, I ask, will you ever prove, my dear Bullinger, that Luther knowingly envelops the light in darkness in an open matter, covers impostures, weaves tricks in simplicity, and does all this out of a desire for contention and arrogance? What he believes, he speaks, what he does not doubt is contrary to the word of God, he opposes. He does not do this as clearly nor as modestly as he should, indeed he does it furiously, savagely, cruelly. Let it be, because he is persuaded that you under the pretext of the ministry of the gospel want to extinguish the gospel, I ask, is he worthy of these praises you have heaped here: Deceiver, impostor, who composes the word of God, mocks the church of God, and all this so as not to admit his error? When, I ask, did you so look into his heart that you know what he aims at and with what desire he is carried? Paul could prefer Talmudic traditions to the gospel and thus rage against Christ as a destroyer of the divine law out of ignorance, and is it impossible for him to oppose the sounder sense of the words of the supper and those who defend it out of ignorance? But if this is possible, why does love not dictate to us to incline to the milder part, especially when he otherwise teaches and lives sincerely and with greater success than all of us? But whose charity is it, what you add? I had admonished Leo that the whole church, to which Luther serves so well and happily, should be regarded, lest this man be condemned rashly and any opportunity for restoring concord with him be neglected, which indeed does not fight against the glory of Christ, and when he is to be answered, that everything should be done with reverence for the man. You interpret this to me as if I want you to connive at Luther's impostures and allow him to impose on the simple with a veil of words, to lead astray and defame the more discerning. I do not want this, my dear Heinrich, but I would wish that many things in the writings of this man, which you do not yet fully understand, you would strive to know thoroughly, especially when you undertake to oppose those things which can be taken in either direction, you would not seize upon the worse, then you would be satisfied to have defended yourselves and others and not also to have made equal with him in calumnies and insults. I want you to preach the truth as sincerely and plainly as possible, but in such a way that the truth can be recognized, and that you may seem to agree with Scripture and the fathers. Thus, I would wish that you would not avoid the modes of speaking of Scripture and the fathers without cause, lest when you seem to speak more plainly and simply, you speak to others, who are accustomed not to your new but to the old forms of speaking of Scripture and the fathers, as more insolently and thus more obscurely and perplexingly. You know that saying of Aristotle, "to think as few, to speak as many." Ah, Luther has hurt you, he condemns impiety, in which we seem to excel and have greatly consoled the people of God. Therefore, we are angry and say and write things worthy of the angry.</p>
      <p>H.: Indeed, he yielded to Saul, but in matters pertaining to the worldly kingdom and to his own body. We are in the church, which is the kingdom of Christ and truth, which relies on true faith and pure simplicity, is led by them, and is preserved by the same. If these are dear to Luther, he will know no other faith than the salvific one, and he will not involve Christian simplicity in tricks.</p>
      <p>M.: I had cited the example of David yielding and deferring to Saul in this to remind how much the authority of those whom God has appointed to instruct and govern his people is to be honored, and how much is to be deferred to them even when they sin, whom God has appointed to instruct and govern his people. You, according to the precepts of the rhetoricians, try to show a dissimilar example. You say, David yielded in matters pertaining to the worldly kingdom and to his own body, we are in the church. As if I wanted you to concede to anyone for any authority or function what cannot be conceded without injury to the truth, and not rather in David to consider that he held the royal office in the empire of Saul, even though he administered it impiously, as so sacred that he esteemed the calling and office of God in Luther, who is pious and piously and happily engaged in this, more than that where the glory of the Lord does not require it, we should sustain the diminution of his authority, or when concord with him can be restored or retained, we should think no opportunity should be neglected. I never dreamed of yielding the truth to him. But I do not acknowledge that David yielded to Saul in matters pertaining to the worldly kingdom when he yielded the administration of the kingdom. For in this the care of religion, as so many psalms with sacred history and the law itself testify, is paramount. Which also had David uniquely concerned. For religion had been neglected under the reign of Saul, 1 Chron. 13 [3]. But I did not propose what or how much David yielded, but how much he esteemed the calling of the Lord in a king already rejected, yet a king, to invite. I know the church is the kingdom of truth and faith, and therefore I consider it necessary that those who wish to be worthy in administering it must hold in the highest esteem those whom the Lord has given to excel more than others in promoting and illustrating it. Nor does Luther acknowledge that he fights with you for any other reason than for simple faith and pure truth, which you try to involve in tricks, the inventions of human reason. With which he does not fight, for he calls faith that part by which the words of God are believed, which therefore does not save alone.</p>
      <p>H.: You think indeed that a quarrelsome helmsman should be yielded to, if his moroseness can be borne without significant danger to the ship, lest the whole ship perish through contention. But meanwhile, my dear Bucer, it comes into controversy whether Luther's moroseness and intolerable pride, that biting wit against the best of men, and more than rabid madness, that lust against the most sacred truth and simplicity, by which he fixes and refixes whatever he pleases, involves and perverts, whether, I say, these can be borne without the loss of truth, again, whether it is the part of good men to sail in the same ship and connive at the helmsman's drunkenness, rashness, and wickedness, from which later a capital danger arises for all good men.</p>
      <p>M.: How gentle and modest you are, who would not learn from these so great and monstrous reproaches? I confess, there is in this man no ordinary moroseness and madness almost, as you write, and rabid malice and incomparable wit not against everyone, but many good men. I do not dare to call it pride, because my conscience compels me to ascribe these to the zeal of Christ, though imprudent, much less lust against the most sacred truth and simplicity. But attribute to the man whatever evils you wish, if it is in controversy whether they can be borne without the loss of truth, why do you not prefer to prove them unbearable when you see me not doubting that they should be borne, than to heap so many reproaches, which show more than the study of simple truth an inconsiderate hatred of such a great man? I, when I see this man first of all of us begin to preach Christ as the only savior of the world most purely and constantly and today persevere in it, and first attack that sacraments confer grace ex opere operato, everywhere inculcating that we are justified by faith, not by works, and only therefore rage against us because he believes we want to overthrow the use of the external word and sacraments and not defer to Scripture more than we can understand by reason - I hold him as a man of God, and when I see through his writings today also the true knowledge of Christ is propagated more widely than through any others, and the enemies especially attack him as the standard-bearer of all who think rightly, I consider him the first helmsman in the ship of the church in this time, and therefore I think much should be forgiven him, lest through contention among us the ship be overturned, even if he sometimes does not steer the helm with the best reason. For as long as he perseveres in this doctrine, that we are saved by faith alone in Christ, which is always effective through love, and not by works, whatever he errs, whatever he stumbles, he will not overturn the ship. We indeed must strive that each one for themselves repair what he sins, but without sedition, which would cast others out of the ship. I, brothers, see so many evils have arisen from this dissension among us that I think it should be redeemed at great cost that this question about the manner of the presence of Christ in the supper was never touched, for Luther himself now urged nothing else so much as that nothing is to be believed that Christ is present unless you believe he died for you and gives himself to you as the food of eternal life. By itself, that cruder opinion of the people would have vanished. I do not deny, however, that God, who always brings good out of our evils, has brought forth many things from this dissension that are very useful and salutary to the pious. But these are to be attributed not to this rabid contention, but to the goodness of God, who uses even our sins for the salvation of his own. But to the point. Indeed, I do not doubt that you have desired many things in Zwingli. But when you saw that you could not contradict him without the fear of greater evil than what he sinned, you dissimulated these things because the Lord used him so magnificently to promote his gospel. Now to me Luther is in the world what Zwingli was to the Swiss. I would therefore wish that some things be conceded to him, which cannot be corrected in him unless you admit that contention and sedition among us, from which you would render many or him alone or not a few of both of you suspect of perfidy, and that in the business of religion (in which to act perfidiously is execrable with no crime, at least among the good) and therefore plainly unfit to administer the business of Christ with fruit. I would not wish anyone to connive at what threatens destruction to the good, but would that we measure everything by the glory of Christ, and what we know must be averted, we repel with arms that befit Christians. Where we have been hurt, the majesty of Christ itself has been diminished, the church is in danger, Scripture suffers violence. For under these titles we seem to ourselves to act even with praise among men. But pure zeal for Christ has its own acrimony, its own vehemence, which you can easily distinguish from that which is of the flesh.</p>
      <p>H.: And you indeed: "Would you not rather bear this," you say, "than if someone makes such a necessity of the ceremonies of Moses that without their observance he does not consider Christ sufficient?" But what, my dear Bucer, if I bear neither this nor that, because this one utterly evacuates Christ, while the other opposes the recognized truth, and not only opposes but also with singular impudence dares to demand that the whole world swear by his words and use no others than those he is accustomed to using.</p>
      <p>M.: Paul both bore and commanded to bear as brothers those who, although they had embraced Christ as their savior, yet thought they could not obtain salvation unless they abstained from foods forbidden by the law of Moses and observed certain other ceremonies. Hence Paul admonished such, while they made more progress in faith, not to invite them to the use of liberty, which they did not dare to use without religion. Did not these make such a necessity of the ceremonies of Moses that without their observance they did not consider Christ sufficient? Surely if Christ had been sufficient for them for salvation, they would not have bound themselves by religion to eat whatever they pleased. If you do not wish to bear such, my dear Bullinger, you will act against the opinion of Paul and therefore of Christ, who taught to bear them in Paul. However, you rightly infer from this error of theirs, by which they thought the observance of ceremonies necessary for salvation, that they evacuated Christ, whom he who does not believe to be sufficient for salvation denies to be the savior. But they did not acknowledge this, they seemed to themselves to believe beautifully in Christ and yet, because certain foods were forbidden in the law, they thought they could not but offend God by their use and thus intercept their own salvation by despising God. Therefore, there is a great difference between what follows from a doctrine or opinion in itself, or as it is held in the conscience of the one who has embraced that doctrine or opinion. There is nothing of even the slightest error from which the denial of the whole truth, that is, of God himself, does not follow. But who is so severe that he would make a brother guilty of even a more enormous error when he is not aware of any error or of those things contained in that error? You are plainly mistaken in thinking that Luther knowingly opposes the truth concerning the Eucharist. Now if I were to impute to you what this error entails, see what kind of person I would make you. First, whoever bears false witness against a brother despises the command of God, who forbade it. Whoever despises does not believe. Whoever does not believe one place in Scripture does not believe any, nor God. For whoever acknowledges God cannot doubt that his Scripture and precepts are to be observed above all. I will say, therefore, that you believe nothing at all, derogate faith from all Scripture, acknowledge no God, are entirely impious and atheistic, and therefore a tool prepared for every crime.</p>
      <p>Surely all these things are in what you write that Luther knowingly opposes the truth. But since you think this to be true, you do not acknowledge yourself to be held by any of these things, which nevertheless certainly follow from that judgment of yours about Luther, because it is false. Therefore, it is to be considered not what is in any opinion in itself or is known from it, but how it is held by the mind of each person. Every error of others, in whatever matter you err, opposes the truth. And whoever does not assent to the truth in one thing does not assent to the Holy Spirit, from whom all truth is. What is this but to deny God? Yet no one sane has condemned anyone for this unless they have been more fully instructed in how their error opposes the truth. But to the point: I compared the error by which those were held who thought they sinned unless they observed the ceremonies of Moses, although they believed Christ to be their redeemer, with the error you attribute to Luther concerning the Eucharist. I do not acknowledge that they think Christ offers himself present in the supper by some secret manner beyond that presence by which he works our salvation in souls. And this error, if it is entirely certain that Luther is held by it, while he does not wish thereby to diminish the humanity in Christ or deny that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father or even say anything is for salvation other than faith in Christ who died for us, I still do not see why I should not acknowledge this error you attribute to Luther as much more tolerable than that which Paul commanded to bear in brothers. For what is it but an opinion of a falsely believed miracle? But in that error, since it excluded the liberty of Christ and made more of ceremonies, to which we are otherwise too much addicted and our true good works are postponed, how much more evil was there than can be in the vain opinion of a fictitious miracle. I do not deny, however, that when any error opposes the truth, if you wish to examine what it can produce, you will easily show that it can overturn heaven and earth and overthrow God himself. But you rightly deprecate these consequences from your errors. Therefore, you should not draw them from those in which others err. It has been said several times that I know Luther does not knowingly oppose any truth. Therefore, I exhort you in the Lord, my brother, not to judge what you cannot know. What Luther acknowledges, what he does not, is known only to him who forms the hearts of all. From myself, I observe how gravely you offend the good, who have not yet progressed as you have in censuring the sins of the saints, and you render your spirit and purpose suspect with this not only rash but too bitter precipitation of judgment. Furthermore, what Luther demands that everyone swear by his words and use what he uses is not impudence, but a necessary condition of a conscience well aware of itself. For what words of God he does not doubt he has and uses, why should he not demand the whole world to embrace and use? Undoubtedly, what you think you rightly teach, you wish no less than he to be persuaded to the whole world. You greatly err in not considering how much error can hold even the saints, and what error can do. Both of which should be most clearly understood by those appointed to govern churches and handle Scriptures.</p>
      <p>H.: "But Paul bore that error," you say, "and not only bore it, but also proved himself an observer of ceremonies by deed." But here you seem, Bucer, to overlook what Paul bore, why he bore it, and how long he bore it. I indeed find quite different things in Acts chapter 15 [1-21] and especially in Galatians chapter 2 [11-21], where he also openly resists Peter for Judaizing somewhat to his face and shortly after adds these words: "For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor" [Gal 2:18], and again: "Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing" etc. [Gal 5:2]. Behold, what could be said more plainly? What more vividly than what he wrote to the Hebrews? What then shall we say? That which the heretics say, if Tertullian tells the truth, that the apostles delivered different things to different people? But this opinion, as most false, has long since been expelled from the theater of Christians. For even if Paul became all things to all men, yet the doctrine of Christ always remained the same with him. For as far as the one example of purification is concerned, we know that the reason of the deed is different from that of the law.</p>
      <p>M.: I have already shown from Romans 14 what Paul wanted to be borne in brothers who deferred too much to the ceremonies of Moses. Furthermore, I want nothing to do with those who say the apostles said different things to different people, and for this very reason, I do not agree with you if you are of the opinion you indicate when you respond to the example of Paul that the reason of the deed is different from that of the law. For if you think Paul did what he should not have done by law in that purification he undertook at Jerusalem at the persuasion of James, you are rightly in that opinion you write was long ago as most false expelled from the theater of Christians. For what does it matter whether you teach by deed or by words? Surely such a deed as this of Paul, by which he was commanded to approve himself to such a great church as an observer of the Mosaic law, what else was it but a kind of public teaching? Although it is not likely that what Paul undertook to do at Jerusalem, he did not also confirm by words. But you rightly say that Paul became all things to all men, yet the doctrine of Christ always remained the same with him, to which he adapted everything to promote. But if you wish to compare the places you yourself cited with Romans 14, the eighth, ninth, and tenth of the first to the Corinthians, then what you have in Acts 18 and 21 about the shaving, vow, and purification of Paul, you will easily see that Paul showed himself differently to those who imposed the observance of ceremonies on the Gentiles, differently to those who retained the Jews in their observance, then also differently to those who thought these were to be observed by simple error, and differently to those who sought to impose the yoke of the law on Christians by their own interest, so that they might dominate them in this way. To these, the apostle not only never wanted to defer anything, but always resisted most strongly, but to those who observed the ceremonies by simple error, he not only deferred himself, now circumcising Timothy, now taking a vow, now purifying himself, but also taught and exhorted others to defer most diligently. Thus, when he resisted Peter, who by his example was leading the Gentiles to Judaize, he obeyed James at Jerusalem to prove himself by deed a student of ceremonies. Although he undertook purification as if he had been contaminated by the company of the Gentiles, and by his example confirmed the zeal for the law to which that church was otherwise too much addicted, I do not doubt he did it for the sake of preserving concord with that church. Otherwise, since those ceremonies had to be abolished gradually and could hardly be observed so freely without curtailing evangelical liberty, he would have preferred altogether, as he did elsewhere, to teach by his deed that the time of shadows was now past and that they should rather focus on those things which are the body of Christ and purely heavenly than on those Mosaic ceremonies. But since the false apostles were entirely intent on defaming him throughout all those regions where he had preached the gospel, as one who was disapproved by the apostles and pillars of the church because he did not join the ceremonies to the gospel of Christ, he could not and should not bear to be condemned by such a great church for preaching the gospel wrongly. For that would have confirmed whatever the false apostles had spread about his dissension with the chief apostles, especially since this condemnation would have occurred because of the neglect of ceremonies. Therefore, when he saw that there was no place at present to persuade the Jerusalem church fully about the liberty of Christ and the abolition of ceremonies, but that it would certainly happen, if he did not declare himself an observer of ceremonies in some way, that he would be rejected by that church as a profaner of the law, he preferred to condescend to their weakness for a time and to do what could not be seen to fit entirely with what he wrote to the Galatians and elsewhere about abolishing Mosaic ceremonies, so that meanwhile, with their consent, he might confirm the purer preaching of Christ to his churches against the false apostles and also prevent the Jerusalemites from being prohibited from receiving the same in the future, by retaining them in holy concord and fellowship of the gospel. He saw them as weak, but Christians and placed in such authority that all Christians in the world looked to them. Therefore, he could not allow himself to be condemned by them as preaching a different gospel. For that would have made the Jerusalem church as odious to those who were more attached to Paul as these were to the Jerusalemites, and thus Christ would have been divided, indeed he would have fought against himself with both sides attacking, one attacking the other. Thus, as today, alas, it happens between us and the Lutherans. But Paul so abhorred this evil that he judged it far better for them to err about the ceremonies of the law for a time than for Christ reigning in him and his churches to be more openly opposed and for them to be exposed to mutual attack, by which the kingdom of Christ would have been horribly cut on both sides. Which is now happening for many years because of our dissension. Would that we could finally see with Paul's eyes. He saw well enough that many would seize upon this deed of his to confirm themselves in their error about the ceremonies, many also to disturb those who thought rightly, and some finally to accuse him of inconsistency. But what could he do, who was a debtor to all, whom it befitted to adapt his actions in this way and by this reason to become all things to all men, that he might gain some? He chose this, constrained by necessity, which, although it could delay the progress of the knowledge of Christ among these weak ones, as far as the use of ceremonies was concerned, could undermine his estimation and authority or even the right opinion about Christian liberty among others, finally could arm many to confirm and propagate superstition and to calumniate its sincerity, yet it left with this church, which was then of such preeminence and authority, and therefore with all who depended on them, holy concord in Christ and mutual testimony of rightly administered gospel and zeal for promoting it, as far as it concerns those things in which the hinge of salvation turns. Which holy concord of the churches in the Lord, mutual society and work for promoting the glory of Christ could easily compensate and even in its time heal whatever remained or even seemed to be increased by that dispensation of Paul, whether of the weakness of the good or of the occasion for harming the wicked, since with schism admitted and passions inflamed, not only would the weaker, as is the pertinacity of human nature in defending its own, once contention has arisen, have been more confirmed in their error and more alienated from those by whom their weakness could have been cured - as happens today with many truly pious and even sensible people in Luther's party - but also the wicked, who need only an occasion, and so easily seize it from anywhere, would have been able to abuse this dissension and mutual fighting of the churches to attack the kingdom of Christ with far greater success than they could ever have done from that Pauline dispensation, as that thing itself would have been more pernicious and suited to destroy piety, since that dispensation was nothing other than the use of what was not evil in itself, even if some abused it, in this to maintain the peace of Christ and to secure a place for himself to correct that abuse in the future. What else would you call this but the duty of an apostle in his office, truly vigilant, although some weak ones could have been offended by it and the wicked armed to harm? This example of Paul, as it seems to me to agree well with his doctrine and calling, I have always considered to be imitable. For it is no less necessary to adapt doctrine as well as deeds to the character of those with whom one deals - this has always been my purpose - so that the knowledge of Christ may be advanced. From which end Paul never deviated in all his actions, however varied they may have seemed, we rightly say that he taught and did the same everywhere and among all, namely, he preached the name of Christ, but not in the same way, so that it was not the same for all with whom he had business. To this example of Paul, I usually compare our situation thus: I see the Lutherans sincerely preaching Christ, because they attribute everything to faith in Christ, then they are no less today among those devoted to Christ everywhere in the world in authority than the Jerusalemites were in the time of Paul. Now we do not doubt that we administer the same preaching, some think more purely. But we are accused by them of not having the external word and sacraments in their proper number, just as Paul was defamed among the Jerusalemites as one who taught the Jews to neglect the ceremonies of the law. Therefore, just as Paul not only bore that these remained in their weakness when they could not yet be healed, but also, that they might persist in the faith of Christ and not renounce brotherhood with those who had more fully attained Christ, he said and did among them what testified that he agreed with them, which elsewhere he was accustomed to say and do differently, so it seems to us also incumbent that when we see the Lutherans to be of the Lord and to feel, write, and speak those things which we would wish to be more correct, and who are placed in such authority among the churches, we not only bear them thus weak in the knowledge of Christ, as they seem to us, but also, while we are among them and see that they cannot yet grasp what we think has been given to us, we so adapt both our words and deeds that we do not give them any cause to alienate themselves from us or to condemn us, avoiding not only the "disputes of thoughts" which Paul forbade writing to the Romans [14:1], but anything that can offend them. Indeed, let us dare also for their sake and to preserve concord with them in the Lord to say and do whatever can only agree with the profession of the gospel as much as was committed to us as much as this agreed with what was committed to Paul, that he obeyed James and undertook that purification at Jerusalem. Now let it be the judgment of every Christian whether to leave to the Lutherans certain forms of speaking, which we think are somewhat obscure, while it is entirely certain that they teach everything in the sense that all salvation is to be sought by faith from Christ alone, and even to use for their sake certain forms which, although they sometimes need explanation, are true and have been used by the saints in a holy manner, finally to confess the agreement which we truly acknowledge to exist, which they do not yet acknowledge - for these are the things we advise to be conceded and deferred to the Lutherans - whether these are less fitting for the glory of Christ and the true progress of the gospel, when we seek nothing other than the concord of the churches, which cannot be retained or restored without these, than it was fitting for Paul to testify himself an observer of ceremonies by undertaking purification after so many years of preaching Christ and the liberty obtained through him, and so freely neglecting the ceremonies of the law everywhere and equating the Gentiles with the Jews in Christ, nowhere condemning the arrogance of the Jews, who despised the Gentiles as impure, in that church which was still addicted to ceremonies and meanwhile was so powerful in authority that it mattered greatly what was conceded to them, when he had preached nothing among them but the gospel of Christ, by which alone true purity is conferred. To me, indeed, comparing what we think should be given to the Lutherans and what Paul gave to the Jerusalemites, then these and those, the times and the gospel preached on both sides and all other things, I would not doubt that we have not yet conceded as much to the Lutherans, even if we have given whatever seems to me to be given, as Paul conceded to the Jerusalemites, and if we now seriously seek to propagate the kingdom of Christ, there is no less necessity for seeking concord with the Lutherans than there was for Paul to retain the favor of the Jerusalemites. But what has led us to this opinion, we can show, so that they may have the same weight with you, we cannot make them effective. But I pray and exhort you in the Lord, having once laid aside that truly unjust and false judgment about Luther, by which you make him so impiously proud, arrogant, and deliberately obscuring the truth, certainly a grave sin, of which you will greatly repent when that day comes when the Lord will reveal the hidden things of darkness and bring to light the secrets of hearts, that you may be willing to see what is the opinion of the Lutherans about Christ and about all religion, what is their zeal for truly propagating piety, what is their innocence of life, what is their authority among all who fear God, how much harvest is still left, not only among us but much more among the French, Italians, Spaniards, English, and other nations, even the eastern ones, what is the true reason for extending the boundaries of Christ, how much our discord hinders this, how much concord helps, finally, how fitting it is first of all to interpret words and deeds in the better part, then, how much liberty of all words and things is to be granted to each, finally, how ill it suits those who boast of following the opinion of Scripture and the fathers to so abhor the forms of speaking which they used and command to be used. I do not want the gospel of Christ to be obscured, I do not want to connive at those who obscure it, much less defer to them, but I think he takes better care to make something seen who applies a light adapted to the eyes of those to whom it is to be shown than he who applies a greater one, from which their eyes are blinded and kept from seeing that thing. There are words which present the mystery of the Eucharist more clearly to you and most others, but they so dazzle the eyes of the Lutherans that they see in them far other than you see. What now is better, to use your words, that is, a greater light than their eyes can bear, so that they see nothing, indeed something different from what you say and seek to show them, or to use the words of Scripture and the fathers, in which, although they do not see everything, indeed something appears which is not in these words, yet that which is chief is rightly shown to them, so that they see in the matter itself as much as is sufficient for salvation and, when they acknowledge agreement between us, without which neither they nor we can rightly fulfill our office? But as long as this hatred of the Lutherans, which your letters breathe, does not vanish, I will have spoken in vain to you about these things. Therefore, I pray the Lord to show you how these calumnies you make against the Lutherans cannot proceed from a Christian spirit and true zeal for Christ, that you may strive to eradicate the root of these thorns once recognized, then you will judge all these things truly.</p>
      <p>H.: But you, who leave no stone unturned, repeatedly insist: "But those who are not one are not of Christ. But those who are doubted to be of Christ will never preach the gospel with worthy fruit." But here you continually omit, dearest Bucer, whose fault it is that we are not one. Certainly not ours. For on our part stands constant truth and Christian simplicity, which cannot be safely and with a sound conscience abandoned by us. Therefore, it is Luther's fault that we do not agree. For he, seized by "word-battling and vainglory" [Wis 14:14; 1 Tim 6:4], neither yields to the truth nor ceases to bring forth new webs of contention. Therefore, what you say, that the gospel cannot be preached with worthy fruit by those who dissent, applies to him, not to us.</p>
      <p>M.: I wanted to remind, my dear Bullinger, how those who preach Christ should strive not only to be but also to be regarded as one, because those who are not one must be alienated from Christ, either one or both. Now where we are regarded as alienated from Christ, with what fruit, I ask, will we preach the gospel? For as Aristotle truly wrote in his Rhetoric, "almost the most authoritative faith is character": Those who rightly preach the gospel must speak with the same spirit. Then it is the proper sign of Christians to agree among themselves with the utmost charity. Is it not necessary, therefore, that since we should exhibit ourselves as approved in all things and such that no one is offended by any of our words or deeds, we should especially strive that no one perceives us to vary in the cause of religion or to be little friendly in spirit to each other? Hence I was concluding that since both the Lutherans and we preach the same gospel, we should strive more vehemently that dissension among us does not hinder the fruit of the gospel, since so small a portion of the world is yet illuminated by it, which we see the Lutherans less concerned about, indeed they seem to conduct themselves almost as if they are eager for dissension. For it is the part of every Christian, if they can, to amend and repair what the whole world sins, much more of those who are colleagues in such a great office. Now you transfer all the blame for the dissension between us to Luther, you exempt yourselves from all blame. Would that you could do this as truly as you do boldly, as far as it concerns you. But when you interpret so many things piously and sincerely written by Luther in the worse part, when you attribute to him that he adds salvation to other things than Christ, who was the first of all to attack this error, and as far as this sum of our religion is concerned, opened the eyes of almost the whole world, perhaps even yours, when you further publicly traduce him as proud, arrogant, and of a plainly perverse mind, which you cannot know, when finally you so completely take away from him all learning and religion that you dare to write that he is not worthy to hold a chamber pot for Reuchlin, a man whom I know a little better than you, but I do not want to disturb his shades, when you do these and many other things of this kind which testify nothing but hatred of Luther, I do not see how you will truly reject the blame for this dissension from yourselves. I am silent about the fact that you think it unworthy to try to win him over with milder responses and forms of speaking, which as they are holy in themselves, so they could recall him from the false suspicion he has conceived about us, to mitigate his anger, which should be done by those who wish to be true children of God, peacemakers [Mt 5:9]. Certainly, whoever has not striven to avert any evil to the best of their ability has thereby obligated themselves.</p>
      <p>H.: Therefore, you seem to have preferred Luther to all the doctors in the world. For if, to speak freely with you, one considers his malice and garrulity, he will hold the first place among the learned, as Thersites held the chief place among the Greek heroes. But if one considers the restoration of piety, pious learning, and the sharpest judgment in sacred matters, indefatigable labor, and the most exercised constancy and prudence with a pure mind, now Luther can neither hold a chamber pot for Reuchlin nor Erasmus nor Pellican nor Oecolampadius nor Zwingli, the foremost men in true religion. Why then do we linger on these? Why do we still regard persons? To whom that saying of Paul should have been most evident long ago: "From those who seemed to be something - whatever they were, it makes no difference to me. God shows no partiality - those who seemed to be of repute added nothing to me" [Gal 2:6], and again: "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? Neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase" [1 Cor 3:4f.7].</p>
      <p>M.: However freely you may speak with me, you may, but would that it were permitted for me to speak these things with you. You rightly admonish that no one's person is to be regarded, but in all things Christ, to whom belong all these things you mention, the restoration of piety, pious learning, and the rest. But how many of these things, I ask, have you discovered in Reuchlin? Whom, as I knew more familiarly, so I know I have always venerated for his dignity. I do not want to mention here what I have found out about this man's judgment, piety, and almost every aspect of his life. He was civil and humane and of much reading in three languages, as his writings testify. Erasmus is second to none in judgment and eloquence, but how consistent he is with himself and how certain he is in religion, he sufficiently shows when he attacks you above all mortals, whom we have offended in no other way than by taking up the defense of your churches. He dares to write that the matter itself demands that the emperor restrain us with the sword, and by attributing something to man in the effort towards piety, he utterly evacuates the redemption of Christ. He does not only not defend the idols not to be adored and the Latin readings and songs in the mass with the canon rejected, which have their own communion, as the mass is held among some Lutherans, but also the worship of idols, the invocation of saints, any masses, the canon itself, he not only defends but also confesses that we should be exterminated because we have dared to correct anything in these. Although he is Erasmus, yet if one considers the restoration of piety, pious learning, the sharpest judgment in sacred matters, indefatigable labor, constancy, and prudence with a pious mind, Luther is not worthy to hold a chamber pot for Erasmus? O Heinrich, o contemplation of a pure mind. Another may swear that you considered these things so purely when you wrote these things as pure as it is when you still make Luther unworthy of the ministry. I know Zwingli was a great man in all these things, but how it would have shamed him to be preferred so much to Luther. Oecolampadius, whom I do not think the church has had a more accomplished theologian within many centuries, whether you consider the knowledge of languages, judgment in the Scriptures, or life - but how often did he confess to me that he had advanced from Luther's reading? I think Pellican, whom I do not want to praise to his face, would gladly confess that he owes something to Luther. Not therefore, my brother, because Luther opposes us, is he to be so despised and made of no account. How many good things of Christ would you recognize in this man and proclaim if he were not so opposed to us. Now these so openly unjust judgments, not only judgments but also so rashly praises, to what spirit, I ask, should they be ascribed? And who promotes the peace of the churches when you also vomit out things of this kind among others? Zwingli frankly attributed to Luther that he was the first to dare to attack the pope, such a fortress of Satan. Now he is not worthy to hold a chamber pot for Reuchlin, if you consider pious learning and constancy? Good words, I ask? But to the point. Therefore, because all things are of Christ, I exhort you in Christ, let us strive to lay aside our love, a very bad counselor, for a while when judging the ministers of Christ and certain virtues, and frankly both recognize and honor Christ wherever he shows himself.</p>
      <p>I do not want to bring forth individually what is eminent in this man, lest I further ulcerate your minds. Yet I earnestly beseech you, my dear Bullinger, to consider that since our Lord has used this man to make such an impression on the kingdom of the pope and has given him faith in himself more widely than all of us even today to propagate, so that so many holy souls throughout Italy, France, and other nations have learned and still learn our Savior from his writings with incredible success, how it does not befit us fellow servants to so foully reject him, such an instrument of the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: But as for the progress and increase of the Lutheran churches, we know the day of the Lord will declare what each one's work is like. Meanwhile, we know that the doctrine of Arius and Muhammad was spread throughout almost the entire East, although we do not yet entirely compare Luther to these. We speak of the increase and assent of the churches.</p>
      <p>M.: We write thus while affections reign. I wanted to remind you to consider that no one has hitherto more successfully advanced this doctrine, that our entire salvation consists in our Lord Jesus Christ, than Luther, nor are there today those whom the Lord uses equally to defend it. Believe me: Even among those devoted to Christ, not only enemies, when it comes to reforming the church, to purging doctrine, little account is taken of us and you. Almost solely to Luther and the Lutherans is attention paid. Hence, therefore, most beloved brothers, because the Lord propagates and defends the gospel we also wish to be propagated more through the Lutherans than through us, I would wish us to notice that they are not only not rejected from preaching Christ, but divinely preferred to us in this, so that when we seek nothing other than that Christ be preached, we would believe them to be more to be courted and observed by us. Surely whatever gospel is in Italy, Spain, France, England, and Poland, the smallest portion is due to us. Almost everything is attributed to Luther, because they learned Christ from his writings and those who later embraced ours were first instructed by Luther to accept us. I was speaking of nothing concerning the doctrine of the Eucharist, in which those who err received it rather from the ancient writers than from Luther. I was also speaking of nothing concerning the fact that the world admits his doctrine as less pure, but that what the world bears nothing more iniquitous and by which true religion cannot but be propagated, that we are saved by faith in Christ, which we also learned from Luther, is advanced and defended by none equally, and with such zeal. Now you seem, Bullinger, with what conscience you compare this increase and assent of the churches to this doctrine, which alone is salvific, to the increase of the imposture of Muhammad and the assent of the impious world.</p>
      <p>H.: You ask here, how then shall we repel this evil from us. Certainly with no loss of truth. For it is more preferable to bear this evil even with our own evil for a longer time than to make a poorly mended peace with a man who prefers all glory to himself rather than to the truth.</p>
      <p>M.: May the Lord free you from this perverse and most false judgment about Luther, whom Christ will show you to have seriously sought his glory, not without your great shame. Furthermore, I do not want any peace with the loss of truth with anyone, but I think it better to bear that some in the accessories of Christianity still ignore certain things rather than to so eradicate ignorance that we meanwhile exclude entire nations from the knowledge of those things without which none can be Christians, then, if it pleases to introduce equal knowledge of all things to all against the doctrine and examples not only of Christ and the apostles but also of ourselves, that we would not do this with so many reproaches and using such modes of speaking by which we deter even those devoted to Christ from these very doctrines for which we so strive, often also provoke them against us, then arm the impious against all the truth of Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: "Will you repay insult with insult?" I don't think so. For we have not been accustomed to doing so until now. For whenever our adversaries have hurled such thunderbolts at us, which neither the glory of God and faith nor the ministry of the word itself have advised us to ignore, they have nevertheless been extinguished with such modesty that we have not treated any of them with the dignity they deserve. Therefore, even now, and whenever the glory of God and the welfare of our churches will advise, we will defend the cause of truth in the present case and in other necessary matters not only against Luther but against all enemies of truth, disturbers, and perverters with the strength that divine grace has supplied us.</p>
      <p>M.: Defend the cause of truth most vigorously, but with those spiritual weapons that Christ has supplied. Among these, there will be nothing of perverse judgment, nothing of such atrocious insults, which I am surprised you do not recognize and attribute so much modesty to yourselves. If these are not insults, given out of pride and arrogance to obscure the truth, to mock the church of God, to claim all glory for oneself, to defer nothing to Christ, to continually introduce new causes for quarrels "out of vanity and word battles" [Wisdom 14:14; 1 Tim 6:4], to desire the extinction of the pious and sincere preachers of Christ, to present themselves as enemies of truth, disturbers, perverters, only so that they may not be found to have erred, and many of this kind and the same repeated so often in this single letter to which I am now responding, what, I ask, do you call an insult? Here I would like to remind you, since you are so eager to defend the truth against any of its enemies, why have you not long ago armed yourselves with spiritual weapons against that Spaniard, likewise Campanus, who are overturning the entire religion of Christ, and others who are a little more sane?</p>
      <p>H.: "But you will not succeed with those," you say, "for whom the defense was to be approved." This indeed did not happen to us first, but also to the greatest and most holy men from the very beginning of the world. For neither the prophets nor the apostles, even with the most loving writings, succeeded with the enemies of truth. But did they, for that reason, leave the palm of defending the truth to their adversaries? Therefore: "Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong, and the filthy continue to be filthy" [Rev 22:11].</p>
      <p>M.: How unfortunately I have written. For you have nowhere read what I intended. To whom, I ask, do you think I am to approve your defense? To the enemies of truth? Do you indeed think me so foolish that you believe I want you to approve the cause of Christ to the enemies of truth, when this is foolishness to any ψυχικός and cannot be understood? I suppose you write your apologies to Christians and seek to approve your cause to them. They are either yours or not. If they are already yours, no defense is needed among them, but if they are alienated, the matter itself teaches you that the more modestly you reject the calumnies of your adversaries and the less anxious you are about words, then you will win your cause with them more quickly. This is what I was urging you to strive for. I know that we must be regarded by the impious as Christ was. Therefore, your response to me here, my dear Bullinger, is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>H.: If Luther himself is more irritated by this, the more vigorously we defend the simplicity of truth, we hope that from this all the saints in the church can learn by what spirit Luther is driven.</p>
      <p>M.: It is certain that he is driven by a good spirit, but one to which the spirit of the flesh often gives much business. Therefore, if you seek that the saints believe he is driven by an evil spirit, what else do you seek than the downfall of his ministry and the obscuring of the preaching of Christ, which is entrusted to him and in which he serves the Lord so successfully? But it happens, alas: The more vigorously you defend yourselves against Luther with this vigor, in which the flesh has sufficiently exercised itself, the more he indulges his flesh and becomes suspect to many of his spirit. But in the meantime, your spirit is not judged better, and you cause, as I have already said, that you are of little value in the business of Christ, since people see neither sincerity, candor, simplicity, nor prudence in you, which it is fitting for the ministers of the emerging gospel to show.</p>
      <p>H.: But why many words? We have not learned, dearest Bucer, to sit on two stools.</p>
      <p>M.: Woe to me if I should either attempt this myself or command you to attempt it. May we both sit on the one stool of Christ, and in such a way that it admits all the elect, both humble and great, both weak and strong, and we do not attempt to exclude or drive away anyone from it. Luther is of Christ and therefore a member of the body of Christ; you are the same. Woe to me, therefore, if I do not wish to sit with either. May the Lord grant that we never, when we wish to occupy the stool of Christ alone in our pride, sit on the stool of the flesh.</p>
      <p>H.: If the body of Christ is corporally at the right hand of God, it is certainly not corporally in the supper. Nor do we meanwhile ignore what and how the ancients spoke. Furthermore, if it is at the right hand of the Father and in the supper at the same time and corporally, the body of Christ is infinite. But what is infinite is not a body. Therefore, the body of Christ is not a body.</p>
      <p>M.: First of all, I earnestly pray, when you wish to use these or other arguments in sacred matters, especially when you are dealing with learned men, such as Luther is certainly to be considered, that you take care to speak a little more accurately and to collect your thoughts more attentively. Scripture proclaims that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father, intending to signify that he possesses the highest power from God the Father, just as those who sit at the right hand of kings are usually the first. It is an allegory. It does not say that the body of the Lord is at the right hand of God, although in its own sense this can also be said. It is more properly said that the body of the Lord has been taken up into heaven. Now you infer from contradictory things. If the body of the Lord is in heaven corporally, it is not in the supper corporally. But how does this argument seem insoluble to you, when it can be solved with a word, namely, when we say that the body of the Lord is not offered in the supper in the same manner of corporality - if I may speak so - as it is in heaven, that is, according to its proper dimensions? This is something that even the scholastics did not affirm. Therefore, the body of the Lord is in heaven corporally, that is, locally, in the supper it is corporally, that is, truly, solidly, not locally. And it is offered in this, that it may dwell in us corporally by the communication of his flesh, so that we may be of his body, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones. Paul writes that the whole fullness of the deity dwells in Christ σωματικῶς, that is, corporally. In this way, Philip Melanchthon told me in Augsburg that he understands it corporally when they say that the body of the Lord is offered corporally in the supper. If you are not ignorant of how the fathers spoke, and it is clear that they used this same word "corporally," it certainly was not fitting to attack with this argument, as if it could not be rightly said in any way that Christ is present both in heaven and in the supper corporally, but in a different manner. So that there was no need to add anything about the infinity or the property of the human body. And since Luther himself has abundantly testified, when he says that Christ offers his body in the supper corporally, that he by no means affirms it in that gross manner of corporality, but only contends that we acknowledge the Lord not only to offer bread but at the same time his body, and that truly, you could have restrained these arguments with us, who neither command you nor anyone to speak in this way, but only strive that you do not reject the Lutherans speaking thus or, while we have admitted the confession and apology - as often said - in which the word "corporally" is not in one, in the other according to the sense of Cyril, because it is taken from his words, do not interpret this as a defection from the truth of Christ, which we previously asserted with you. Certainly, while I consider your vehemence concerning this "corporally," although it has been explained so often, I am very surprised at what agitates you so much, since I see no cause, unless perhaps you think that "corporally" everywhere signifies nothing else to us than our "lyblich."</p>
      <p>H.: Indeed, Elijah cried out: "How long will you waver between two opinions?" [1 Kings 18:21] And Paul cries out: "What fellowship has light with darkness?" [2 Cor 6:14] And all antiquity cried out: "ἁπλᾶ καὶ σαφῆ τὰ δίκαια" (simple and clear are the just things).</p>
      <p>M.: Luther's preaching, since it preserves Christ as the true savior of the world everywhere excellently and ardently commends him, is neither Baal nor Belial nor darkness, but it is the truth, religion, justice, which you also follow. Therefore, those whom he has joined in the faith and preaching of his name, who died for us so that we might be one, our God and Savior, I wanted to admonish them to recognize themselves as thus joined, and I have professed and will profess myself joined to both, as long as the Lord has not rejected either you or me. Nor do I know what should be considered simpler and more generous than to use the words of the Savior and these in their genuine sense. Although we tolerate some obscurity in our brothers, which we cannot yet illuminate, and if we try, we would only double this obscurity and also obscure much of the light on both sides, I would believe that we do not depart from Christian sincerity and light, just as Paul did not depart from these when he observed the Mosaic ceremonies to retain the weaker in office, which he taught were to be abolished, or when he commanded them to be set aside, when he ordered the weaker to be received in such a way that those who were stronger were somewhat encouraged to lower themselves to their weakness by observing the distinction of foods and days.</p>
      <p>H.: Now we testify before God that we do not envy Luther's glory, as much as God has imparted to him, nor do we willingly dispute with him, but whatever we do, we do out of love for truth and simplicity. We will prove this to be true by this fact and now promise you that we will receive Luther as a most intimate brother as soon as he gives all glory to the truth, ceases to bite and persecute the saints and men who have deserved well of the church of Christ, and finally those who follow our, or rather not our but God's doctrine of the Eucharist, whether it be Carlstadt, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, or someone else, ceases to involve simplicity in clouds, to pervert the right, to express the pure captiously, to write biting papers and infamous, as they say, pamphlets, to curse, to slander, and to proclaim heretics or fanatical prophets. These things will not be grievous to him, but he will do them most readily and of his own accord, if only he is of our opinion with us, as you say.</p>
      <p>M.: You could not be called Christians if you knowingly and prudently envied the glory of Christ in Luther or aimed at anything other than this in handling the doctrines of Christ. But you would be no less unworthy of this name if you arrogate to yourselves that you do nothing out of love for truth. For you are human and cannot be entirely free from all envy of another's name any more than from all pursuit of your own. Nor will you ever have brothers if you are determined to embrace none but those who have given all glory to the truth, none, if indeed this earth has such. That Luther speaks some things more obscurely and attacks us fiercely - I have said before - he does out of zeal for Christ, but which is beyond knowledge, yet Christians, as long as he perseveres in preaching Christ both with his tongue and his life, must bear with him. It would be very easy for him to let go of this zeal if he recognized that he truly agrees with us as he agrees with himself. But he has not yet been able to do this, and we have given and still give sufficient cause for this. Therefore, I always discuss him, that those who err in many things while they err for Christ, that is, seek Christ sincerely even in their error, as far as they are conscious of themselves, are not only to be borne with but also to be embraced and cherished, and not to be harassed with any sharper disputation, Rom. 14 [1-23], and this is more to be confessed and proclaimed to whom the Lord has given agreement in himself, which they deny so persistently - for it is indeed a gift of God, and what is so important to be persuaded to the pious, who would not wish it to be as well known as possible to all? For what could have happened at all that would have hindered the course of the gospel as much as this, that it is commonly believed that we disagree so much?</p>
      <p>H.: Otherwise, we would rather be ill-spoken of by the turbulent band of Lutherans than be called hypocrites in reality and name by all the saints.</p>
      <p>M.: The band of Lutherans, with whom I am dealing with you, I know to be the church of Christ. Therefore, it is desirable to be well-spoken of among them, since it is Christian to please all for good and, as far as possible, to be commended by the testimony of even the unbelievers. But while I urge seeking and cultivating concord, I do not so much command you to consider what the Lutherans, but what the elect everywhere among the nations, will say about us. For while the world thinks we disagree so much, no one from both sides, but many from neither, judge that Christ is preached, and thus we ourselves blind the eyes of many, lest they see the light of the gospel, which we offer, and we hinder the acceptance of the medicine of life by discrediting our faith. Furthermore, when we advise bearing with the Lutherans' more obscure ways of speaking, which you cannot attempt to amend in them without at the same time making these very obscure ways of speaking prevail more among them and obstructing the access of your purer ones to the good, then you render the gospel administered by them and by you not only utterly useless to many but also subject to horrendous blasphemies, and then using those ways of speaking which, as they are of Christ and the apostles, so they both express the truth better and spread it more widely, always retaining the freedom to explain everything for edification, we cannot be called hypocrites by any saints, much less by all, when they have judged truly. If any erring ones have done so, it is better to bear this false condemnation than to be in reality destroyers of the kingdom of Christ, of which we wish to be called "faithful stewards" [Lk 12:42]. Therefore, nothing of this was to be feared from our advice, much less are we, as I trust, known to you to be accused of such a great evil.</p>
      <p>H.: For we have once resolved, and by the grace of God we will accomplish, to devote our lives to the holy truth and pious simplicity, to yield to no one, unless something better "is revealed to the one sitting by" [1 Cor 14:30].</p>
      <p>M.: We have resolved the same in the Lord. May he grant that we stand firm. But at the same time, we wish to yield, indeed to become all things to all, so that Christ may obtain everything everywhere. It has often been said that it never occurred to us to command you to yield even a little of Christ to anyone. For when you allow others to speak in their own way, which you cannot yet change without great detriment to the kingdom of Christ, and you strive to preach the truth of Christ so that it is received by as many as possible, offends as few as possible, especially of the elect, meanwhile restraining yourselves from insults, calumnies, and even those ways of speaking that make the truth of Christ more odious than clear or acceptable to the good, you yield nothing of the truth.</p>
      <p>H.: "The time is short" [1 Cor 7:29], the world is unstable, people are more unstable, fearful and trembling at the holy cross of God. But we do not want to be marked by this Pauline sentence: "Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ" [Gal 6:12].</p>
      <p>M.: Nor do we want to be marked by this saying of Paul, however much you twist it against us. I have already explained my advice so many times, which is nothing other than to persuade the brothers that the fight between the Lutherans and us is not about the matter but about words, and that they have been placed by the Lord in the church in such a position that we cannot have them as enemies without incredible loss to the progress of the gospel, and therefore we must strive by all means to remove this opinion from the minds of people, which makes them think we disagree, especially so much and consider us to be enemies of each other, and for this reason, some ways of speaking must be granted to them, which, although they should be purer, you cannot deny that they can be rightly used today as they were rightly used by the fathers, and then we must take into use those that have been handed down in scripture and always observed by the whole church with the fruit of piety and will also serve us excellently, so that we may persuade more people of the true sense of this doctrine, about which there has been a fight, and of the whole gospel of Christ. For this is our only goal in all things, that the doctrine of Christ may both spread more widely and reign more effectively. To strive for this does not make anyone seek to make a good showing in the flesh, nor is it fleeing persecution for the cross of Christ. For nothing agitates the prince of this world against us as much as preaching Christ as the only savior, who alone is righteous and justifies. Certainly, that doctrine about the Eucharist is not the whole doctrine of Christ, and whatever opinion you follow about it, if you do not cease to urge this, that we are justified by faith alone in Jesus Christ, by which the tyranny of the prince of this world is most of all dissolved, this very god of the world will never cease to remind you of this persecution, nor will you ever be able to please the sons of this world, and you will have to pray very much that you never forget how short the time of life is, how unstable the world is, and how more unstable people are, so that you may stand firm and fearless in this preaching, which could never be borne by the world nor can it now, and imposes the holy cross of God on all who approach it. We will pray for this on both sides, and also that we may administer the gospel we profess with such faith, sincerity, and prudence of spirit, that it may be a cause for the prince of this world to be indignant with us and to stir up whatever evils there are against us, and that we may not seek to please any of the carnal by appearing not to yield to anyone in the fight, to stand immovable in what we have embraced in any way, and to hold on to what seems peculiarly ours, from which we claim a certain prerogative, as if we were the authors of some new discovery. For it cannot be said how much the flesh favors dissensions and fights, from which certainly it has happened that military virtue is usually preferred to almost all others even by the flesh, which otherwise no virtue pleases in itself, and then this seeks nothing else than to πλεονεκτεῖν in all things, even in sacred matters, which it nevertheless hates in themselves, although it is as stupid in rightly embracing these as it is ingenious in falsely pretending to study them. However, I do not write this as if I think you knowingly fight for the prerogative of a truer sense discovered about the sacred Eucharist and for the praise of constancy, and not to yield to adversaries or to seem to have not handed down something with sufficient circumspection. But since no one is holy who has sufficiently guarded against these deceits of his flesh, I wanted to warn you of these things, so that you may thoroughly examine the recesses of your souls, which we will also strive to do, lest Satan transform himself into an angel of light somewhere. Certainly, where so many things smell of the flesh, it is to be feared that the flesh is also conducting its business. For it is accustomed to infect even those things where the end of the action is plainly holy, nevertheless, so that you may possess less fully and less purely what you rightly seek.</p>
      <p>H.: Now indeed, that you not only permitted but also were the authors of subscribing to the Saxon Confession in your public affairs, we neither wish to approve nor disapprove, since what is done, as the proverb goes, cannot be undone. Certainly, we would not have done anything of the sort without consulting you.</p>
      <p>M.: How we were the authors of subscribing to the Saxon Confession, if the matter had so required, I have abundantly explained in the common letter. What you write that you would not have done anything of the sort without consulting us, I think now it seems so to you, but since you have not consulted us about anything at all until now, except that Leo consulted me about the laws of your peace with the Five Cantons after the recent disaster, although you have attempted those things and enacted ecclesiastical laws of such great importance, it is possible that in such a matter you would have been content to consult scripture and the spirit of God. But would that this were preserved among us, that the churches would do nothing of any importance without mutual consultation, as it pleases us. Certainly, when the dispute about the Eucharist first arose, before we changed ceremonies and some other things here, we sent our own messenger to all the principal churches, desiring to establish in common both what should be taught about the Eucharist and what should be changed in ceremonies. But others thought differently. For it was fated that we should be so horribly agitated by this dissension and that those who were tested, whose number is too small, should be made manifest.</p>
      <p>H.: But perhaps it was so ordained by God that we should be deprived of all human aid and comfort. But come, "let the will of the Lord be done" [Acts 21:14].</p>
      <p>M.: As far as we are concerned, there is no need for you to complain about this. For we have always expressly testified that we would not desert you, as we have you as sincere ministers of Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: It is indeed more evident than can be denied that there are things in that confession that are contrary to sound doctrine, and some things that we ourselves have formerly attacked and disapproved.</p>
      <p>M.: You will clearly show none of these things if you are willing, as you should, to accept everything in the sense in which it was written and to grant the Lutherans the freedom of speech that you see has been handed down by scripture itself and used by the fathers. About which I have sufficiently explained in the common letter, in which I also showed that we have fought in some places in the manner of blindfolded gladiators. At Marburg, when it was explained on both sides in what sense each wrote, we agreed on everything except the sole presence of Christ in the supper corporally. Why should we now renew the fight or deny our agreement, when they have not produced anything in this confession that they did not write at the time when we agreed at Marburg?</p>
      <p>H.: Some things are also quite obscure and childish. Such is the statement that the Holy Spirit is given through the sacraments as instruments, that faith is confirmed by them, that baptism is necessary for salvation. But they speak of the baptism of water. The things they philosophize about confession, absolution, and the mass are more harmful than it is necessary to repeat.</p>
      <p>M.: We have not accepted their rites, although they, if we approve the rites of the ancient church, can be considered among the tolerable. If we were not otherwise somewhat unfair to these men! For we know well enough what they aim at, namely, that with the truth of the gospel there may be some reverence and discipline among the people. But as I said, we have expressly testified that we will not admit their rites. As for the others, in what sense they were written by them, I have shown in the common letter, certainly a pious one, and which they have abundantly explained in the apology. But you do them a clear injustice when you write that when they say baptism is necessary, they speak of the baptism of water, which you can see well enough both elsewhere and in the apology "on the use of the sacraments." Indeed, they most detest in us that we make baptism of water, when there is no baptism for Christians but the baptism of Christ, but which is offered both with words and with the symbol of immersion in water.</p>
      <p>H.: It is also well known what they have defined about the Eucharist, by which they have utterly condemned ours. For whom else have they condemned if not us?</p>
      <p>M.: I have responded to this in the common letter. But I ask you: If someone thought you denied that Christ is true God and, writing against this doctrine, condemned whoever embraced it, and seemed to have utterly condemned you because he thought you had adhered to this doctrine, would you not want to subscribe to such a condemnation, in which he did not name you or anyone specifically, but condemned those, whoever they were, who embraced that impious doctrine, and testify that it does not pertain to you who meanwhile believe that Christ is true God? They have confessed about the Eucharist what we, they feel, which is not impious and in reality the same as we have condemned those teaching differently, whom we also condemn. What, then, I ask, would have prevented us from advising the acceptance of this confession? For we could not and did not perceive that you taught differently, and I was already publicly accustomed to proving that others felt the same. Furthermore, how we understand their words, I have sufficiently declared in our apology and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>H.: Or how could it be that after so many excellent works they have not yet rightly understood ours? Zwingli wrote many things, Oecolampadius wrote many and religious things, and Bucer wrote, you met at Marburg, the confession of both sides was heard. And yet an impudent condemnation followed. Nor did our people say anything different then than they do now. The doctrine has always been the same. What, that Zwingli himself wrote so clearly, so religiously about the sacraments, indeed about the whole religion, both "To Charles" and "To the princes gathered at Augsburg," that no one has ever written more clearly about this matter? But even then, no peace could be obtained from these contentious and arrogant people. Nevertheless, the condemnation stood firm, to which we now so promptly subscribe.</p>
      <p>M.: I too have often been astonished that they have not understood our opinion more correctly before. But since they have from the beginning and always contended that Christ in the supper gives not only bread but at the same time his body, and from the fact that we have opposed their writings, they believed we established something different, although we have contended nothing other than that the bread itself is not the body of the Lord nor the channel of grace and that the body of the Lord cannot become food for the stomach, it has happened that whatever we have subsequently granted to the presence of Christ in the supper, they cannot lay aside this suspicion - seeing that we still abhor using their words - by which they suspect us to be in the position that, while it is not allowed openly and once, we secretly and gradually abolish it, that Christ offers himself in the supper as food for us. Nor do they think we strive so much to extort those words from the church, which solidly express the presence of Christ and fully, and also obtain their consent. Therefore, they both retain those words so tenaciously and reject our friendship so stubbornly and persist in condemning us, thinking this to be zeal for Christ and a safeguard in preserving the purity of the gospel, when it is a false suspicion suggested to them by their love of themselves, offended, of course, because we dared to contradict them, and this has so blinded their eyes that they cannot see that we by no means deny that Christ offers himself in the supper, but deny that he offers himself in the bread as food for the stomach and united with the bread in such a way that whoever eats the bread also eats his body and receives grace. Although, if it is to be said freely among you, neither have our people understood Luther in many places, although he himself has written many things, I do not want to add how clearly Luther in his book against the fanatics published in 1527, everywhere both affirming his own and solving our arguments. He makes this conclusion: "Therefore, it is not mere bread there, therefore the body of the Lord is in the supper" and at the end he wrote in capital letters. And he exhorts many, as he usually does, that our people, having omitted other things, prove this with certain scriptures, why these things fight: Christ's body is at the right hand of the Father and at the same time is in the supper. But Zwingli, when he responds, immediately at the beginning puts this proposition: "So that you may recognize that he dwells in our hearts through faith, Eph. 3 [17] not through the bodily eating of the mouth, as you want to teach without God's word." Again, in the response to Luther's confession, he always makes this opinion of Luther, that he makes the bread itself to be the body of the Lord. "Luther says, bread is essentially bread and essentially the body of Christ." Again: "Luther makes the bread itself the body of Christ." Now Luther expressly denies that the bread is the same as the body of the Lord, affirming that the natures of the bread and the body of the Lord are distinct and are united only by sacramental union. I confess, however, that Zwingli had occasion from Luther's own words to attribute these things to him. For it is too familiar to this man, alas, that when he contends, he almost always uses hyperboles and is not satisfied with having obtained what is just: He wants to seem to have obtained even what is unjust. Such is the vehemence of his mind. Thus it was not enough for him to contend that in this saying "This is my body" "is" is not to be taken significantly. He contends that it is never used in scripture for "signifies." Nor was that enough: He adds that in no language at all does it mean the same as "signifies." Moved by this impropriety, and at the same time because he made no end of calumniating and insulting, our people, as they were human, were also blinded by some darkness, so that in many places they by no means understood what Luther wanted, and on the contrary attributed to him things he never felt, much less taught, as certainly those propositions are all except the second, which Zwingli in his response to Luther's book, to which he gave the title "That these words of Christ 'This is my body' etc. still stand firm against the fanatics," placed at the end of his response under the name of errors as if taken from Luther's own book. For Luther does not confuse the natures in Christ, nor does he attribute the remission of sins to anything other than Christ received by faith, nor does he deny the truth of the human body in Christ, nor does he attribute any virtue to the external reception by itself for increasing faith in souls or preparing immortality in bodies, all of which Zwingli imputes to him, although all his writings and words, which he daily preaches to thousands of people, testify otherwise. When the Lutherans read these things, they complain no less that our people do not read Luther's writings, and if we swear that we read them, they are no less astonished that we do not rightly understand them than you can either complain or wonder about them. Little or no account was taken of me by Luther. Then they have always also thought this of me, that I was aiming at some middle ground between them and Zwingli, to which they thought Oecolampadius inclined a little more. Therefore, at Marburg, they only desired the presence of Oecolampadius and me, not intending to come there if they had known Zwingli would be present, because they thought he was diametrically opposed to them. For when he speaks of the presence of Christ, he uses such language that he seems to recognize only that local and exposed to the senses presence, by which the Lord is in heaven and is absent from here, rarely and moderately touching on that by which he presents himself to us through words and sacraments and also the spirit. Therefore, Luther thought that Zwingli persisted in this, that he taught nothing of Christ in the supper except bread being offered. For although he wrote some things excellently in his response "To the princes gathered at Augsburg" from Augustine, from which I also again conceived hope of establishing concord and began to deal with the Lutherans and Luther himself again, yet at the same time he also adds in both the confession and his response that the body of the Lord is given in the supper typically, and what is about the presence of Christ in this life, he refers everything to the divinity, when scripture so expressly testifies and the whole church has always acknowledged that we here also obtain communion of the flesh of Christ, by which we become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones. When I also testify that Zwingli believed these things, they have no faith in me. And although Oecolampadius also expressly taught the same with me, they always think that we understand these things differently than they do and want to deceive them and cover their mouths with these ways of speaking, so that, having abused the pretext of agreement, we may more easily weaken the truth of the sacrament. Hence, brothers, neither at Marburg nor afterwards could it be fully agreed, and that condemnation of us has persisted among them. If the Lord had given that, having omitted all other things, which are agitated questions, both sides had directed their minds to what was the chief cause of writing on both sides, it would have been fought out long ago.</p>
      <p>For our people would have seen that Luther contends for nothing else than that from the words of the supper it is obtained that the Lord gives his body, not only bread, to the disciples, and Luther would have seen that this is by no means denied by our people, but that they are striving to prevent any reason for the presence of the body of Christ in the supper from being established that would take away the truth of the human body or attach salvation to the external element. Since Luther asserts neither of these, they would have disputed rather about what kind of nature this presence of Christ in the supper should be considered, or rather, how it should be called and by what part of us it is perceived and for what purpose it was instituted. Thus it would have easily appeared that neither Luther affirms what our people ought to attack, nor is it denied by our people for which he must enter into such a great contest, and with very little trouble, they would have either fully agreed or only about how. The rest would have remained, what is not so much perceived here by the impious as offered. In this very thing, there is no doubt that we would have come to the same conclusion in the end, if only the affections had not been given the first place. But as it happened, it seemed good to the Lord. May he forgive us all for having made so little of dissenting from those who preach Christ from this and that side, and grant that each one may strive to make manifest to all what he sees of concord in this matter, and since there is much of this in reality and little of discord, may he cause those to see this who think they have not placed their work in the Christian republic in good faith unless they fight. This should not bring such great admiration to those experienced in so many things and versed in the reading of the ancients, if it agrees with you and the Lutherans in reality, however much no one has been able to persuade you of this until now. For we read that this happened to the ancients and see it happening daily in so many and great matters with the present. We all love ourselves too much, we think nothing less suits us than to yield to others, and we interpret prudence and caution as trusting no one, interpreting everything in the worst part, just as we interpret perseverance and zeal as obstinacy and malice. Moreover, even if these clouds were not cast over the mind, we are very blind in any matters, much less in sacred ones and those that have no proper appellations in human speech. I do not doubt that we all observe and oppose these evils in us in good faith, but they are so akin. They deceive us where we least expect it, and often more those who think themselves entirely immune from them. But those are common, this could have been restrained by Christian candor. What you add here, Bullinger, "to which we now so promptly subscribe": Even if we had simply subscribed to the Saxon Confession, which, as I explained in the common letter, was not done, would we have subscribed to your condemnation, when we have been publicly and privately contending for so long that you have never opposed what they have confessed, since you have never denied that the body of the Lord is exhibited in the supper in its own way?</p>
      <p>H.: From this subscription, however, it will emerge for us, which is now on everyone's lips among us, that both good and bad will accuse us of inconsistency. By which the authority of our ministry will be endangered, not in itself indeed, but because we will seem to be innovators and fearful, to think, believe, and teach something different now than we did before, as it is said.</p>
      <p>M.: From which subscription? Where is it subscribed? What is subscribed? You will say, you wrote to us about this. If you thought we had sinned, the sin of a brother should have been covered, so that both good and bad would not have known it. But neither have we subscribed nor have you learned from our letters that we have subscribed. It was not necessary to believe such impious things about us, as you want to appear, from others writing about us without hearing us. We have testified that we agree with Luther in the matter and do not want to be considered among his adversaries, this we have written. Otherwise, nothing has been done either by us or by our people. And we have always testified to this at Augsburg and afterwards, not first at Schweinfurt. But how consistent we are in this whole dispute about the Eucharist, our writings will testify. What those who take pleasure in saying that we do not agree say, we commit to the Lord, although, if it were allowed, we would prefer them to speak what is true. But how many have engaged in this fight with sincere zeal for Christ, and how many still know what has been fought? O how arduous a thing or an unformed rudiment of Christianity. How secure are those who study this rightly, about all things that are not duties of piety in themselves! How they abhor all contention, burning with sincere love, which covers a multitude of sins! How candidly they feel and speak about the brothers! How cautiously they judge in all things! But the weak must also be considered. They must be considered, but so that fewer and less healthy are deferred to, so that more and healthier are not harmed, and then an offense that hinders the course of the gospel is less quickly neglected. Peter indeed deferred to the weak when he withdrew from common foods because of those who came from James. Nevertheless, he was rebuked by Paul because he preferred the account of the more and better, namely those who believed from the Gentiles, and chose to offend them in a more serious matter than those in a lighter one. But who labors with the disease of innovation and trembles at the truth, we will commit to the Lord, without whose spirit we are all nothing.</p>
      <p>H.: But you: "So that many think we," you say, "have departed from our opinion, I prefer that they say this about me than that I have nothing of Christ, tear apart the words of Christ, measure everything of God by the reason of the flesh." As if we, who do not subscribe to Luther or have not yet wanted to agree with him, have nothing of Christ, tear apart his words, and measure everything of God by the reason of the flesh. We are grieved, Bucer, we are very grieved, and these things of yours displease us, they displease us, I say, more than can be said, nor would we ever have expected such from dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>M.: Nor does it grieve me less, dearest brothers, nor was this less unexpected to me, that you read my letters with such an unjust mind. I testify that we agree with Luther in the matter and contend that this agreement should be borne before us. But what you and others now fear, if we strive for this, that many will say we have departed from our opinion, I wrote that I prefer to bear this than that more say we tear apart the words of Christ, measure everything of God by human reason, indeed have nothing of Christ. From these, you infer, with what candor I do not know, certainly with no dialectic: "As if we, who do not subscribe to Luther or have not yet wanted to agree with him, have nothing of Christ, etc." My dear Bullinger, I beg you to read the writings of others more attentively. Therefore, whatever people calumniate, do I have the truth? Who does not see that I am here comparing calumnies and falsely spread rumors among themselves? For if we strive to be considered concordant with Luther, many calumniate us for having departed from our former opinion, but if not, more shout that we are guilty of those things for which Luther accused us, namely that preferring the reason of scripture we tear it apart and therefore declare ourselves to be utterly alien from Christ. Now I think, since one must be borne - but I would prefer neither - it is more tolerable to be said of us, falsely however, that we have changed our opinion about the Eucharist than to have nothing of Christ at all. I would like both to be avoided. But since it cannot be, why should I not think it should be borne rather, which is lighter? Although I would not want either to be borne with the loss of truth, as far as this can be avoided by us. But people are such that nothing can be conducted so circumspectly, nothing so sacredly, that many do not drag it to calumny. Therefore, in the present business, I take this account. As elsewhere, so also in this place, care must be taken to propose the truth of Christ with such convenience that it can be commended to more people. I do not doubt that this convenience is if we use those words that, as they express the benefit of the Lord more augustly, so they are more consonant with scripture and the use of the whole church, and also contribute to the fact that this most pernicious dissension with the Lutherans is at least partially allayed. For since we perform the same legation of Christ with them, I think nothing should be more carefully or more solicitously cared for by us than that we agree with them in all things, and if this cannot be obtained, that there be as little discord as possible and that what there is be covered as much as possible. We indeed place ourselves beyond doubt that this is what the very religion of Christ demands of us. Therefore, it follows that as much as possible, we should take care that this good is not subject to the malice of people, and since this cannot be entirely avoided, we should nevertheless give our efforts both to explaining everything rightly and to recalling what we have written about the truth of the presence of Christ in the supper of the saints, so that this evil may be diminished at least in part. By striving for this, we easily approve our cause to the good, who sincerely desire to promote the truth of Christ and the concord of the saints, especially to our own, who hear us daily. If indeed this agreement of ours is in reality, the good and prudent easily recognize it when the whole business is rightly explained. If any who have wanted to appear to be ours are not of Christ, they will nevertheless accuse us of inconsistency, but it is better to bear this than to foster such a horrendous and pernicious offense to the world and this so dire discord with those who are truly of Christ and administer the gospel with us with such success. In the same way, those who have hitherto accused us of impious error concerning the Eucharist, some good, some less so, therefore those, if they think we have yielded to them, will give this to praise and will hold us dearer and will want our authority as fellow ministers to be confirmed and not undermined in the future. These, as they will calumniate us for having recanted, will nevertheless harm our authority less than if they persist in defaming us with such impiety, as if we intend to pervert the words of Christ, indeed to have Christ as a mockery and to believe nothing more of him than reason can perceive. For now, the testimonies of these very people will say that we have returned to the way and now follow the truth; in this sense, I wrote that it is more tolerable to be said of us that we have departed from our former opinion than that we tear apart the words of Christ, etc. Of which we have been infamously accused for so many years throughout almost the entire world with the greatest loss to the kingdom of Christ and the incomparable damage to the gospel preached on both sides, but no less falsely than it will also be falsely said that we have now changed our opinion. And this indeed I wanted to be seen in my letters, it would not have been difficult at all if your mind had not been more offended with us at that time. But since we are dearest brothers, you should not have been so rashly moved against us.</p>
      <p>H.: For if you said these things about the insults and malice of the Lutherans, we are surprised if that saying of the Lord has so quickly escaped you: "Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me" [Mt 5:11].</p>
      <p>M.: I want us to consider ourselves blessed when people falsely say all kinds of evil about us, but because of the name of Christ, not because of our fault. Nevertheless, care must be taken that this too is as little as possible. For as we must do all things so that all may acknowledge Christ, why should it not grieve and I complain that we are defamed by them as violators of the word of God and thus the course of it is hindered by those who preach it with us and are considered its ministers before us? But it will not grieve in such a way that I would therefore betray the truth or do anything unworthy of us.</p>
      <p>H.: We also wonder why you still write to us about concord and agreement of doctrines when you still feel such atrocious insults against us.</p>
      <p>M.: I indeed wonder that you wonder at this. For how many times have I testified that there is agreement in the matter, but not in the minds. Otherwise, what reason is there to deal so much with you and with the Lutherans to recognize this agreement?</p>
      <p>H.: Therefore, what Leo advised, dearest Bucer, I also advise, that you conduct this play in such a way that it does not end in a dark tragedy.</p>
      <p>M.: Indeed, I wish nothing less than to give occasion for new disturbances in the church, and therefore I certainly respond to you so late and beg you by the Lord, if anything in these matters does not please you, to seek either an explanation or satisfaction from me and not to disturb the church without cause. I have received this reward from the Lutherans, that while I was striving to compose peace among us, they have almost more importunately than you sought me. I hope for more humane things from you. Certainly, I would never have become a part of this fight if the zeal of Zwingli and Oecolampadius and the defense and reconciliation with the Lutherans had not drawn me here. But, which the Lord avert, if you have not been able to recognize my mind here, I do not doubt that there are many whom it will be possible to withdraw from this fight in the meantime by showing what is in controversy, what is less. I will attribute nothing to you except what you acknowledge, nor indeed to the Lutherans. But since you have both published these things, if I show from these very things that you do not fight as much as many think, you will rightly grant me what will have been without injury to either of you. If even so, it will not be possible for you to use me as a friend, I will nevertheless give my efforts that no one here may make my fault. I will commit the rest to the Lord, never myself either stirring up a tragedy or knowingly giving any occasion for others to stir one up.</p>
      <p>H.: For although you say with emphasis that Zwingli has prevented these things from being received by our people until now, who nevertheless could not prevent them from admitting graver things, we acknowledge indeed that now indeed the blame for all misfortune, loss, and evil is not only cast upon the man of holy memory Zwingli by the adversaries but also by our people, but by what right, we will not dispute now. But we do not know what graver things our people have admitted, since nothing has yet departed from sound and sincere doctrine among us.</p>
      <p>M.: The memory of the incomparable man Zwingli is more sacred to me than that I would wish to cast any blame on him, much less "all misfortune, loss, and evil," as you, Bullinger, write too copiously. Nevertheless, I indeed consider it more tolerable if he had permitted your magistrates to acknowledge our confession as true, which you admitted it to be in reality, by which a league with all the remaining princes and republics confessing Christ would have been formed, than this one thing, that afterwards in the name of your republic the superstition of the Five Cantons and the ancient and undoubted Christian faith was preached in the public instrument of restored peace. I do not want to add about the desertion of allies and other things. That nothing has departed from sound and sincere doctrine among you, I congratulate you on the benefit of Christ and pray that it may be perpetual. For nothing could happen more grievously than if this were to be diminished anywhere, much less among you, so joined to us in Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: But we know well that the apostle Paul was deserted by all who were in Asia, with the glory of God and the doctrine of truth unscathed. We also know that he said: "All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived" [2 Tim 3:12f], and again: "Nevertheless, the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and 'Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity'" [2 Tim 2:19].</p>
      <p>M.: I will gladly attribute all these things to you when compared with the Five Cantons, but I will not attribute them to us. For neither do we turn away from Zwingli nor from you, much less do we persecute. But neither do we recognize the Lutherans as evil men and impostors. I indeed exhort you in the Lord to console yourselves in this, that those "who desire to live godly in Christ must suffer persecution," so that you do not proclaim yourselves to have suffered anything undeservedly before God. For no one has ever administered even much lighter things so holy that if we consider how great the majesty of God is, he would not have deserved graver things with very little trouble, as it seems to the flesh. The example of Nadab and Abihu, the Bethshemites, and Uzzah is well known. The cause we are engaged in is the best, but we must always pray that we conduct it worthily enough, and we must make a great distinction between those who persecute Christ in us and those who either our sins or what they think is sinning somewhere and opposing Christ.</p>
      <p>H.: Therefore, we pray, dearest brother, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that you look more closely into this matter. Do not be too accommodating to Luther nor believe him. He is a scorpion, who, even if you observe him with all diligence, will still sting, however much he may seem to lick at first.</p>
      <p>M.: Do not doubt that you have prevailed upon us. As closely as possible, we will consider this whole matter, as I have indeed strived to do so far. But the more accurately I examine and weigh everything, the more I see certainly that Luther is to be regarded as nothing less than a scorpion. He seeks all salvation through the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, the ruin of no one. But no one is ignorant that it is most alien to his nature to try to draw people to himself with any false blandishments. Rather, everyone complains about him that he repels many who come to him voluntarily or are so disposed that they could easily be led by untimely harshness. Indeed, what I see the man constantly teaching by voice and writings, I follow, from this I make a judgment about him. The knowledge of the heart is God's. I do not want anyone to yield to anyone, but everything to Christ. But if you would bear to hear my prayers in turn, I would pray that you would not make such a judgment about this man or fear him so much for yourselves or others. For, as I see, he is still entirely unknown to you. Nor is it surprising: You have never met with him and have read few of the things he has written with a free mind, especially what he has written and writes outside of contention.</p>
      <p>H.: We also pray that you pursue us with the same love with which we sincerely embrace you.</p>
      <p>M.: Do not doubt: Not a little of our love for you has diminished, who know well with what dangers and labors you now conduct the business of Christ. Would that it were possible to declare this love of ours in some serious matter. And indeed, unless we had you as distinguished in the church of Christ, why would we be so concerned about you, however you might administer your churches? But now, because we place you among the chief ministers of Christ, therefore we seek so much that you may at some time agree with those whom we see the Lord has chosen above all to preach his gospel from the beginning until now.</p>
      <p>H.: I wanted to pour out this fervor of my mind to you as a singular friend and dearest brother, indeed as a teacher to be observed. I pray, however, that you consider it well.</p>
      <p>M.: I also thank you for writing freely, but it grieved me that you interpreted so many of my things so unjustly, but while you testify that your love for us has not been diminished because of this, I bear all these things with an even mind. Nevertheless, I pray that you receive this my response with an equal mind.</p>
      <p>H.: Farewell together with your fellow ministers, especially my dear Capito, whom we also earnestly beseech not to involve us in the pamphlet in which he promises to expose to the world that we are running off course on both sides. Let him consider what such pamphlets can produce in the church both among the weak and the stronger.</p>
      <p>M.: All our fellow ministers here likewise wish each of you in Christ the greatest happiness and well-being. And I assure you, you may be completely at ease about Capito. He will involve you in no business unwillingly. But we also pray that we, for our part, may never be made authors or endorsers of any doctrine or opinion other than this: Jesus Christ is the Savior of all who believe in him, and of what certainly follows from this. And that we make no one our friend or enemy except as each either confesses this faith with us or opposes it. On secondary matters — those very matters in which churches have nearly always been disturbed and misled — let us proceed with such caution that no one passes judgment on the other without his knowledge. By God’s grace, we are close enough to you that neither time nor effort is much required for us to consult each other on such matters. Indeed, if we must admit the truth, it is as certain as anything can be that neither you nor the Lutherans have yet truly understood each other — and that the fight is, in many ways, blind, and the struggle on the main issue entirely unstructured. But more on that in the common letter.</p>
      <p>H.: Pellican, Theodor, Carolostadt, and Erasmus Fabricius all send you their greetings and share the same opinion as we do. They entreat you with just as many words as Leo and I have used in this matter. Zurich, July 12, 1532. Yours truly, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>M.: In the words of myself and all the fellow ministers here, greet these ministers of Christ and our fellow ministers to be observed and hand over what I have responded to you to be read. We also pray and beseech you all. The sum of these is: 1 First, that with minds as pure as possible turned to our Savior Jesus Christ, you pray that he may completely remove from you whatever is of preposterous love both of yourselves and of your own, and of disdain both of the Lutherans and of all who respond malignantly to your mind. So that in this cause you may be able to sincerely look at and fully perceive what the matter is. It is more true than true what Aristotle said: "For things do not appear the same to those who love and those who hate, nor to those who are angry and those who are calm, but either entirely different or different in magnitude." - 2 Then, since the matter we are discussing is of such importance and there are so many reasons why you should rightly suspect that Luther's doctrines are not yet rightly and sufficiently known to you, that he may grant you to once accurately read and in good faith examine what this man has written not only about this matter but also about the whole cause of religion, not deterred by the fact that many things will please you little, many will also gravely offend. We hold the fathers in such high esteem, and rightly so, although they do not satisfy in many things. Why then should this our man be so despised, who in the handling of the gospel, as far as the purity of doctrine is concerned, has left all the fathers so far behind? - 3 Third, that he may grant you to once establish what that is by which Christianity consists, without which no one can be a Christian and with which one cannot be a Christian, and to what extent this itself must be known by us and what signs are sufficient that it is fitting to have someone among Christians, since God alone searches the heart. From which we may judge untimely, in which direction we wish to pronounce certainly about people. Would that it were once agreed among the saints what makes a Christian, how much faith and tolerance of errors is sufficient for this. How much more concord would there be everywhere and how much more powerfully could errors be opposed! - 4 Fourth, that you may see and feel what is the power of charity, by which Christians ought to embrace, observe, and cultivate each other as members of Christ, how much this covers a multitude of sins and errors, what injuries it calls, with what zeal it strives to insinuate, approve, reconcile, what to yield, what to defer, what to do for those whom it has persuaded itself to be of Christ, which it most easily also sustains to persuade itself in the evils of others, not curious or suspicious. "For it is long-suffering, it is kind, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" [1 Cor 13:4-7]. What? To say it in one word, all things are charity, God is. - 5 Fifth, with what equal zeal those who are moved by the true spirit of Christ should seek whatever has proceeded from this spirit anywhere, how candidly they should acknowledge it and how seriously and diligently they should claim it for themselves, indeed for Christ, and proclaim the agreement of what they have received from the same spirit with it, so that whatever are the gifts of God, the oracles of God, these may also be recognized and held in their own esteem and gather us into one, to which various things are given to us by the Lord for this purpose. Paul indeed made even those things that the pagans, and those things that they received with a false sense, but true and therefore proceeding from the spirit of God, agree and serve the gospel of Christ. If we were to study the same, we would have long ago approved our cause with the authority of the holy fathers, who, offended by the novelty and insolence of words, could not bear to look at the light of the gospel that we brought. Then also such great schisms would never have arisen among us. - 6 Sixth, that you may thoroughly consider how scripture is accustomed to speak about the sacraments, the visible preaching of Christ, and the solemn exhibition of the new and eternal life, which is situated in the certain and solid communion of the flesh of Christ, and how it is fitting for us to speak and explain everything in the church so that the elect understand themselves to be in the kingdom of heaven and to have Christ in their midst, who himself wants to speak and act inwardly, which he has commanded us to offer externally both with words and symbols. For lest anyone attribute to us what is Christ's, or attach to those things that are presented to the senses what is heavenly, it is easy at the same time to guard against this by discerning from the Lord the ministers and what is ordained for the church of Christ as the church from those things that the flesh usurps. - 7 Seventh, what is the proper dispensation and economy for those who rightly administer the gospel, what should sometimes be conceded to the weaker, and by what principal reason the doctrines of Christ should be set forth before anyone, what should be held first, what second, what third, so that progress may be made in the knowledge of Christ, of which so much is desired in each one as his life is absent from the exemplary life of Christ, and since no one will ever be able to dispense the things of Christ with such dexterity and faith, without being subject to the detraction of not only the wicked but also the ignorant, whose false reproach it is more tolerable to bear. If Christ, our peace and life, grants us to both know and embrace these things, which we uniquely pray for, we do not doubt that we will conduct ourselves on both sides in such a way that both with him and with all good people the account of the gospel administered by us will be beautifully established and we will serve our churches and others with great fruit to the glory of Christ, our savior, to whom be dominion and honor forever. Amen.</p>
