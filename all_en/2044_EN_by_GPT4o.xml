      <p>S. July 7th, through our local shoemaker, then on the 22nd of the same month through Gessner, your merchant, I wrote to you, after which I again received your letters on September 10th along with the English catechism, but without those articles agreed upon in the London synod, which you mention. I replied to those letters the day before yesterday and do not doubt that you have already received or will soon receive in Winterthur what I wrote back. Indeed, I will never allow, my dearest Bullinger, that you surpass me in the duty of writing, rather I will surpass you if I more often encounter couriers or others traveling there. Regarding Samuel, my godfather and neighbor (which I forgot to mention in my last letters, being carried away by excessive haste), I have heard nothing from anyone for a long time, so that there is not even any suspicion, as far as I know, of that illness, which was more than sufficiently great about him a year and a half ago. However, I desire in the man some other good and convenient duties of a husband, to which perhaps a more mature age will invite him.</p>
      <p>I received your response in the Servetus case, for which I am grateful, although I have not yet read it; for as soon as I received your letters, there was someone who wanted to travel from here to Zurzach and then send some goods to Winterthur, I wanted to write, which must be done more than tumultuously. I thought this plague, I mean Servetus, had been extinguished some years ago; I saw and read his books on the errors of the Trinity more or less 20 years ago with the utmost indignation. Ah, how it pains me that this now causes trouble for our most holy Calvin. But it is necessary for us to be exercised by heresies and monstrous abortions of Satan of this kind, so that those who are approved may become manifest. May the Lord Jesus Christ graciously and as soon as possible free His church from these monstrosities and grant it His solid peace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the other matter you write about, I am not sorry, except that I never knew that this Adlischwyler is your true brother-in-law; otherwise, when I appeared on August 26th to go to Rheinfelden and stayed there until the 29th, I would have inquired about him and made his acquaintance. My dear cousin has always held the old man in great affection and has told us much good about him; she has used him much and always had a faithful, diligent man in him, so that he now suffers greatly in this misfortune that has befallen him with the unruly son, about which she told me much when I was with her, also indicating how he has set the peasants against the noblemen and otherwise erred in other ways, for which he has come into imprisonment and is in bad care, it would be a disgrace to him; she complains about nothing but the good pious father so heartily, that I have had deep sympathy for it and have recently written to her among other things, desiring to know how it stands with the imprisoned son of the old city scribe, how he has fared, and yet I have never known or seen either the father or the son, only I have a faithful compassion with her, as she has had great sorrow about it and has complained heartily; for I firmly believe, if she were in power of the matter, the father would be entirely dear to her, that the son would be punished for his evil with great grace and would enjoy the pious father.</p>
      <p>It is requested of me, I should commend the aforementioned old city scribe of Sch√∂nau, your dear brother-in-law, to my aforementioned cousin, which I will do with special loyalty and great diligence; I would serve you, even if it cost me more and a thousand times more than this, you should certainly trust me. And although my commendation might not be needed, as mentioned above, your dear brother-in-law is commended to my friendly dear cousin without this, it is nevertheless proper that I comply with you in this; I will also do it by the next message and send her your letter along with it. She will not be displeased to have it, etc.</p>
      <p>She is such an honest, pious woman and such a good friend not only by blood but by spirit and good deeds towards me and mine, of which there are few in the whole world; I have always and increasingly found more fruits of faith in her than in many hundreds of others, so entirely resigned and trusting in God and His only Son Christ, so entirely patient and willing in her painful days of suffering, of which she has many, so entirely faithful and generous towards the poor and needy, that she is a great miracle and wonder of God to me, that such a heart should be found in such a place. May the dear faithful God preserve her in the increase of faith and all godliness until a Christian end.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you should also help to pray to the Lord God and call upon Him in faith; it will be the best good deed you can show her. Well then, I will arrange the matter as best as I can. Please convey many, many services, love, good, and greetings to your dear wife and all your household from me and my dear wife and earnestly and sincerely pray for us to the Lord. Given in haste on October 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of Zurich, his most observant friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
