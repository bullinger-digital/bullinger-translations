      <p>Greetings. I had thought (reverend father) to no longer send empty letters, but nevertheless I send these as well. I received yours; I read and understood that the affairs of our people are in no small danger.</p>
      <p>What harm this delay and hesitation has brought to our people now first becomes clear. I read with great reluctance what was added about the queen, nor did I think it should be shared with everyone.</p>
      <p>I did not return your copy because you did not order it. I have nothing with which to repay you.</p>
      <p>It was indeed consistently reported that great disturbances arose in Rome; but since the Italian brothers have not yet written anything, I consider the rumor to be false and fabricated.</p>
      <p>I would recount to you the catastrophe of our marriage, if the memory of the unworthy matter did not even now prick and gnaw at my mind. And since our consuls have done many things to offend the best of us, I am also forced to say many things that break their backs. The one, indeed, whom I have long known, I have now also found to be the same.</p>
      <p>Since the consulship is very profitable for him - for the consuls undertake embassies, the consuls attend assemblies, which are themselves very profitable due to bribery and corruption - he assumes strange appearances and forms. But meanwhile, while he does everything to please the priests, while he is the common patron of the depraved and drunkards, with whom he drinks day and night, while he is most generous to them, he is most sordid to us ministers (for while gifts of venison and other presents are sent from all over Rhaetia, he distributes these among his idols; as long as I am here, he has not bestowed even the smallest benefit on me, to whom he nevertheless devotes himself entirely in words), while he can bear that his daughter celebrates mass, while it is permitted by his wife to visit sermons, and he does all this so as not to offend the provost, in whose house his daughter resides: since these things are so, it is easy to estimate to which side he would lean. He also corrupts the other with his allurements, who is more susceptible to corruption the more he is inclined to avarice. Now at these weddings, you would have seen them as slaves of the priests, the abbot, and Tschudi.</p>
      <p>These things are done beyond example.</p>
      <p>Many see this, they complain; they would like me alone to say everything. I have already said many times what needs to be said.</p>
      <p>They then desert me and flatter him in person, whom they disparage behind his back. Therefore, I am very tired of these manners; therefore, in the latest sermon, I said among other things: "If they want a rooster to hunt in the bushes, they should look for it; I am tired of their ways. If you had seen the splendor and abundance, you would wonder how it is possible that someone who, in recent years, wandered around the village fairs with nettles and leather straps, could entertain a prince. I do not think that a count in German lands could manage to bring such a thing to pass. For three whole days (nothing is given here) they have been at the feast and at the church service for 400 people; but he has always had about 10 tables. I once went to see it; for he did it for 3 days.</p>
      <p>I was amazed at how it is possible to prepare such a meal; if I spent money in vain and a whole yearâ€™s time on a single meal, as he gives many in succession, it would not be possible for me. But this luxury gives rise to avarice.</p>
      <p>They strive to consume, to seek what is consumed, And the very changes are nourishment for vices.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, dancing has also been sought again, which was long ago abolished with us in these dangerous times. In summary: we must flee to God.</p>
      <p>What the state of the Rhaetian republic and church is, I will write to you about another time. There is no reason for you to think that I fear the hatred of the magnates; for I have said everything that needs to be said, but in vain. The difficulties with which I struggle both privately and publicly, I intend to write to the Zurich council in detail at leisure. If the council considers my situation, I have reason to thank them; if not, I will at least petition them to allow me to seek my fortune elsewhere, preserving the rights of citizenship. If I do not even obtain this, know that when I bought citizenship in previous years, I did not buy servitude and did not sell the freedom in which I was born. Every land is a homeland for the brave, as the sea is for fish, As the open world is for the bird.</p>
      <p>Do not take these words as if I am attempting something rashly; you will hear the most serious reasons for my plan in due time. I have not yet written anything of these matters to my father-in-law Collinus, nor have I communicated anything with my wife or others. I await the time when I can explain everything in detail.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 27, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and always to be honored father in Christ.</p>
