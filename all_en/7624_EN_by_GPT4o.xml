      <p>S. D. Indeed, I have not written in 14 days, not due to my own fault, but because of the most burdensome affairs by which I am both oppressed and exhausted. Never, as long as I have been in the ministry, have I been more burdened and afflicted. I pray to the Lord that His grace may be with me; otherwise, I cannot bear it any longer. I have received all your letters, especially those you sent through my messenger. For these, I give you the greatest thanks, meanwhile, I advise you not to trust too much in the one whose advice you sent, but to observe him diligently. Great is the malicious cunning of men. Meanwhile, not everything should be disregarded, even if it is offered to us in such a way. If indeed a safe conduct had not been requested, I do not know what would have happened with the envoy. Listen, my brother: He indeed requested safe conduct; however, the 7 Cantons refused to give or hear him. What do you think would have happened if he had come? This has come upon us in the Confederation! May God improve it.</p>
      <p>In recent days, our senate wrote to the envoy in Baden, to ensure that other cities hear him in a free and safe place. We are waiting to see what will happen. I pray to the Lord that He Himself may see and inquire. I am also warned from elsewhere to take good care of myself; for traps are being laid for my life. But I say: Lord, my times are in Your hand; You are my hope, in You I rest, I desire You; deliver me and bring me to You, etc.</p>
      <p>What you write in your last letter is very pleasing. Continue to serve God and the fatherland in this way. Encourage them to stay at home. There will perhaps be a time when they will rejoice for having obeyed; for God will not endure such iniquity, nor will they always continue in their obstinacy and unparalleled insolence and pride, etc.</p>
      <p>What I have gathered from various letters received from Frankfurt, I have taken care to put into this paper. Furthermore, while I write this, the following news comes from Augsburg, dated September 30: The Emperor held a diet in Austria with the nobility and estates. They have promised him to pay several tons of money in 10 years; he allows them to believe and reform according to the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>The war between Denmark and Sweden is certainly underway, and most of the forces are moving on horseback and foot to the Prince of Orange against the Spaniards. The Duke of Alba is stationed with force near Maastricht (Traiectum Mosae), has occupied and controlled the Meuse everywhere. But the German troops are advancing, and news now comes that Claus von Hattstatt attacked at a pass, crossed the Meuse with force, drove off the Spaniards, and killed 1500 of the Albanians. We are expecting news of a battle at any moment; for the Germans are pressing on, etc.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a Frenchman passed through here on his way to St. Gallen, then to Nuremberg, a distinguished man; today another comes with the same news, namely that the prince has renounced the cardinal and the Guises along with the Italians and French at the court in France; he is advancing, has taken several cities, including Poitiers, Angers, the capital of Saintonge; the nobility and people are joining him, bringing him the keys.</p>
      <p>The Huguenots have moved from the Dauphiné over the Rhône; the royalists did not resist, but followed them, and when he saw this, he turned and fought with them, drove them into flight and killed about 800.</p>
      <p>The people of Lyon fear them greatly. Several hundred shooters, Gascons, who come from the Prince of Orange, are lying in wait to join the Count; they will also come to the Huguenots and the prince.</p>
      <p>Much else of the same kind is written and said; therefore, I await more certain news. For now, consider this sufficient. Greet the mayors for me, as well as our other good friends. God protect you!</p>
      <p>In utmost haste. October 8, 1568.</p>
      <p>HB</p>
      <p>Yours, always Heinrich Bullinger. News also comes from below that a powerful armament is being prepared in Germany, again in France; that recruitment is also happening for the Oranians, as well as the Danes, to join the Prince of Condé. And it is certain: as soon as the Oranians succeed in advancing into France with force; but this would ruin all of France to the ground. The Guises are to blame for this; may God give them their reward!</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, most faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
