    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over Leo Jud's decision against Schwenckfeld. Has sent Bullinger's letter to Gervasius Schuler, who was not led astray. Schwenckfeld has been exposed by many and is therefore very angry with Blarer. In Augsburg, Musculus has nothing to do with Schwenckfeld, while Bonifacius Wolfhart favors and hosts him too much. Blarer thanks for Bullinger's commentary on both of Peter's letters and reports from a letter by the Ulm mayor Georg Besserer about a city meeting in Ulm and an alliance of Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Ulm. Greetings, especially from the sick aunt Elisabeth Blarer, who visited Bullinger and Pellikan in 1533. Asks to inquire with Mayor Röist about Bernhard Sapidus, the pastor in the Sindelfingen Monastery.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I rejoice with all my heart that Leo is so completely ours and I pray to the Lord that he may remain so for us forever. I sent your letters to Gervasius through someone who had returned his to me, in which he clearly indicates how he is not captivated by those embellished words of flattery. I do not think Schwenckfeld will be able to maintain this false persona much longer. He will be forced to come out openly, driven by so many who are pushing and unmasking him. He is very angry with me because I have exposed him to so many churches. It is enough for me if I have Christ's favor. Certainly, it is better for one Schwenckfeld or even all to perish than for so many brothers to be deceived by his tricks, although I also wish for his salvation, if possible. In Augsburg, he has found a suitable place for himself, where anything is allowed to anyone. Musculus has nothing to do with the man. Only Bonifacius favors him excessively, even sharing his hospitality, which also grants him much authority among many, especially the common people.</p>
      <p>For your most splendid and thoroughly learned commentaries, I am as grateful as I can be, marveling at your divine fertility, by which you publish one work after another to the great benefit of God's churches. We are barren in this matter, perpetually distracted by the most troublesome and odious affairs, and yet we must follow where the Lord calls, to whose will I wholly submit myself.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Ulm wrote to me three days ago, among other things, in these words: "The punctual cities have been here these days, held a meeting, and discussed things amicably with each other, but decided nothing. Not everyone is willing to engage with the papal cities, especially with those who do not keep their word and seal, in any understanding. One should look more to God and honor than to any fleshly hand. May God grant grace in this and other matters. Augsburg, Nuremberg, and we have completed our alliance. I hope it will be for us and all other honorable cities that we should undertake less against them." So far he.</p>
      <p>You, my dearest and best brother in Christ Jesus, farewell happily with your most chaste wife and all yours. Commend me to all the brothers, especially to Pellikan, the most pious heart, Leo, Theodor, your companions, and the rest. All of ours greet you and wish to be commended to you, especially my wife, brother, sister, cousin, and that sick aunt with whom you were with Pellikan, who anxiously demands your sacred prayers amid the most bitter pains, lest such persistence of torments finally break her, which may Christian tolerance prevent. It is amazing that a woman of such advanced age can endure so many evils.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Last day of March 1534.</p>
      <p>Make sure to ask Mayor Röist whether a certain Bernhard Sapidus, the pastor at the Sindelfingen Monastery of the regular canons, is or has been with him these days. For I am very eager to know this. You will learn the reason in due time. He affirmed here that he was called to Zurich by Röist, as he is his cousin, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
