      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I continuously learn of your good diligence and loyalty, as well as Susanna's towards us. May God be your and her reward. I have received with thanks what you have arranged for me, and in return, I send you here a thick penny and 4 shillings, which is half a guilder. Please consider it well. I gave Bl√§sy 5 shillings, which he spent in Kloten, and 3 pence as a reward for bringing it in the bad weather; I believe it is not unjust.</p>
      <p>Today around noon, the wedding day will be in Ludwig's house, and afterwards, they will be brought together in my house. I have enclosed here the agreement and conclusion of the marriage, as far as the substance is concerned, and next Wednesday, with God's grace, we will go to church for the early morning sermon and celebrate the wedding. We invite you and Susanna to be here on Tuesday in good time. Otherwise, we will keep it simple and not make much fuss.</p>
      <p>May God grant grace to it. We have no news, not a single letter.</p>
      <p>All our people greet you, as well as Susanna and Lisenbethli. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on Thursday, the 15th of December, 1569. Heinrich Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
