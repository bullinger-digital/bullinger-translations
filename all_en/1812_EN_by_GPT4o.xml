      <p>Regarding the nature and convenience of our school and town, which you, most learned men and dearest brothers in the Lord, wish to know from me, we have many professors of letters in every kind of doctrine. Among them, three interpret the sacred letters: Doctor Balthasar from the Old Testament, Doctor Jacob Peurly, a young man, and Doctor Frechthius, who is not unknown to you and is about to be honored with a doctorate in the coming days. Following them are the law professors, two in canon law and four in civil and imperial law. Medicine is both taught and practiced by Doctors Fuchs, Rugger, and Schegg, who, not long ago, after ceasing to philosophize, was co-opted and admitted into the college of physicians, to which he has now wholly dedicated himself. Two young and diligent masters of arts have succeeded him, one interpreting Aristotle's Meteorologica, the other teaching an epitome of general physiology. Similarly, two teach mathematics: Philipp, known as Emser, and Johannes, known as Schemoly; the latter teaches Euclid's geometry with arithmetic, the former the theory of the sphere with the theories of the planets, and anything else related to this art. Likewise, two are appointed to teach dialectics, so that one teaches the elements of this art, the other some greater things for adults. The latter, as well as Master Johannes Benignus, who has hitherto been in charge of teaching rhetoric, are both gravely ill in bed, almost despaired of by all our doctors. However, it is not so difficult to find replacements for them, and there are already not a few who aspire to their lectures. Since Camerarius left us (about which I have written more privately to Gesner), I have been appointed to teach both languages, especially Latin, which I teach today from Virgil's Aeneid and the history of Titus Livius, and Greek from two speeches of Aeschines and Demosthenes, adversaries. Master Matthias Illyricus professes Aristotle's Ethics with Homer's Iliad. Now, of all these professors, very few, scarcely one or two, take young men into their homes and discipline. There are several reasons for this, primarily the great cost of provisions here, not only the expense but also (which you may be surprised at) the scarcity for many years now, except for wine. Then there is the scarcity of houses (for the town is very small for the number of inhabitants) and their cramped conditions, especially since Prince Christoph has decided to have his court here with us. His retinue is almost twice as large as that of the late Saint Ulrich, his father, who used to spend most of his time in Urach or Bebenhausen or N端rtingen, very rarely in T端bingen. As a result, many who have often come to us to cultivate their talents, because they could not find a convenient place to live, have been forced to leave us again, which has also happened recently to some from St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>We do have a large building with many rooms and heating facilities dedicated to students of modest means; the common people call it a hostel or bursary. The arrangement is this: students are fed there in a large and open dining room twice a day, and each pays seven local batzen (a type of coin) per week; wine, as much as each desires, is provided separately for each to pay for. The measure of wine, at this time when it is cheapest, is sold for five of our coins (eleven of which make a batzen). The price for renting a room is a gold coin, that is, fifteen batzen. The heating facilities are rented by the masters of arts themselves for four gold coins, who then take in anyone who wishes to place themselves under their domestic discipline for about seven gold coins per year each. For those who do not need a teacher or do not wish to use one, the common study room is open during the winter, as always. The food is broth, then meat, about half a pound per person, and finally vegetables or something similar; besides these, if anyone wishes to have breakfast or a snack, as certainly this food is hardly sufficient for that age, or desires any other food at any time, even between meals, more luxurious or delicate, they are not deprived of it; they call it 'extra.' But many often incur great and intolerable expenses for themselves and their families unless they live under the discipline of the masters there, who prohibit it. And so much for these matters. Those who live outside the hostel either take their meals with public professors (of whom, as I said earlier, there are very few who take in students, scarcely one or two) or with citizens, of whom there is a sufficient number.</p>
      <p>The professors themselves live very cramped, then they feed quite frugally for forty gold coins, not to mention the gifts they hope for and expect either for themselves or their families. With citizens, one lives for thirty gold coins per year without lodging; the food is the same as with the professors and in the hostel, except that they are also provided with a quarter of our measure (which is moderate). But here there is great freedom; they incur far greater expenses on 'extra' unless there is someone to prohibit it, as it is profitable for the citizens themselves for them to be as extravagant as possible.</p>
      <p>Therefore, of all the options, I would indeed prefer the hostel or bursary for this purpose; for one lives there under the discipline and supervision of the masters, as I have described above, and the rector, who is called the head of the hostel and lives there, and the entire college of arts. Moreover, we have here among us a man of good and proven life from the deacons or ministers of the word, an Augsburg native, who once, during past tumults, was exiled in Basel, named Parsimonious, with whom several, including four from St. Gallen if I remember correctly, take their meals twice a day (according to the customs of this city) at the same price and manner as with other citizens, and these same pay elsewhere nine gold coins for heating and a room, then one batzen per week for each bed (for no one provides a bed in general without a price). In short, I do not think anyone can live here even very frugally for less than forty gold coins. The plan was that, since St. Gallen is not so far from you, you would learn from the parents of those young men who live with us and from the very master to whom I gave this letter, the entire arrangement of living and studying here.</p>
      <p>By the kindness of the late Prince Ulrich, who has always treated me with a special kind of grace and benevolence, I live far more comfortably and better than those others, and although my circumstances for certain reasons did not allow me to have any personal and domestic students, yet due to the situation of the houses and the number of students and the narrowness of our town, I was also forced to take in three recommended to me by the prince and his mother. They share the same table with me, more generous and luxurious than the others, and are not deprived of breakfast and snacks; they use their own beds.</p>
      <p>They pay fifty-two gold coins each per year. If I could do you a favor here, which I would most like to do, and if your young men could not be better off here than with me, I will not refuse to take them in consideration of you, placing them with me for forty gold coins each, and I will provide them (besides placing them in the same position as the others with me) with whatever service or even benefit I can offer or their circumstances seem to require. Farewell, and please consider my haste, because of which I could not reread this, with fairness and kindness.</p>
      <p>T端bingen, February 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your city's and church's most devoted Melchior Volmar Rufus.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with exceptional learning, piety, and dignity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop and pastor of the church of Z端rich, his honorable lord and friend.</p>
