    <p xml:id="regest1">Report following [No. 1130]: [Peter] Kunz and Erasmus [Ritter] only arrived in Bern eight days after them and had hoped that they would abandon their plan [to return to Geneva]. When they visited Kunz, he reproached them in the presence of Sebastian [Meyer] and Ritter and became extremely angry, while they calmly assured him that they accepted him as their companion and advocate according to the decision of the Zurich meeting. The next day, the pastors initially made them wait and then wanted to first examine their articles, which had already been approved at the meeting. At the second article, Kunz accused them of introducing a novelty by using leavened bread in the Lord's Supper, which disturbed the German churches, and he almost lost his temper; since he even denied that their articles had been presented at the meeting, they referred to the approval of all participants to this document, which Bucer had referred to as their advocate [in Zurich], and sent a copy of it as evidence [enclosure]. When Kunz denied that they had conceded on two out of three points at the Lausanne Synod [on March 31, 1538], except for the holiday question - although Ritter and the council delegate who had led the synod [Hans Huber or Ludwig Ammann] agreed with them - they left the assembly. Meyer inquired whether they also judged their successors [in Geneva] and the pastors remaining in Bern after Megander's departure as wolves and false prophets; when they declared the cases incomparable but agreed regarding [the Genevans], he wanted nothing more to do with their cause, leaving only Ritter with them. A few days later, the council heard them but insisted that conformity with the Bernese church should be based not on their articles but on that decree of their opponents, according to which they should have been thrown into the Rhone. Initially, the council decided that two envoys should precede them [to Geneva] and secure their reinstatement, but they insisted on presenting their innocence themselves, with Ritter and Viret accompanying them. A mile before the city, they were denied entry; at the insistence of their companions, they complied, which saved their lives, as they were awaited by armed men. The [Genevan] councils wanted the people to decide; Ludwig Ammann and Viret skillfully presented their case, but one of the council chairmen stirred up sentiment against them based on their articles, interpreting it as arrogance and ambition that they spoke of "their" Genevan church, referred to the Bernese without titles, and dealt with excommunication. A hearing was denied to them; thus, Kunz's plan succeeded, as he had passed the articles to Pierre Vandel and was said to have expressed hostility at the Nidau chapter, despite having promised them support [at the Zurich meeting]. As feared, Satan now triumphs even more, and [in Geneva] vice flourishes; Kunz accepted this to overthrow them. The disgraceful conduct and lack of education of their successors [Jacques Bernard, Henri de la Mare, and Jean Morand] cause daily offense. Due to the messenger, they break off their writing here; they ask for confidentiality. [Enclosure:] 14 articles on how to achieve conformity between the churches of [Geneva] and Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since it is not possible for us to meet with you in person, which we would have preferred, we must resort to the next best option: to explain or at least indicate the main points of our situation to you through letters. From other letters, you have already learned that on the eighth day after we arrived in Bern, Kunz and Erasmus arrived there, who seemed to leave nothing undone. We thought our patience was being tested in a premeditated way, so that if we had abandoned the cause out of weariness, the entire blame could be conveniently placed on us. When it was announced that they had arrived, we immediately met at Kunz's house: Sebastian and Erasmus were present. Here, unexpectedly, Kunz began with long complaints, which eventually escalated into severe insults. We responded to such aggression with as much calmness as we could, seeing that greater vehemence would achieve nothing but to drive an already irrational person into extreme rage. His colleagues also helped to restrain him. After that, he began to ask whether we wanted him to intervene in our business: he added a reason, as he foresaw that if things went badly, he would be accused of bad faith by us. Although we replied three times that we did not want to take away from him the task that the Zurich assembly had assigned him by decree, he kept repeating the same tune. However, exhausted by his own wickedness, he finally promised not to fail us. The next day was set for the case to be heard: we ascended to the palace.</p>
      <p>After two hours, it was indicated that the ministers were too busy with consistory matters to attend to us. After lunch, we approached them again, but then we found them even less prepared than the day before. They said they needed to examine the articles we had proposed to the assembly, which had been approved without any denial. Although we saw that we were being treated unfairly, we endured this indignity with dissimulation. There was hardly a syllable they did not dispute. While discussing the second article, which dealt with the type of bread, Kunz could no longer restrain himself and burst into many insults, of which we will mention only one. He reproached all the churches in Germany, which were otherwise peaceful, for being disturbed by our importunate desire for novelty.</p>
      <p>We replied that the use of leavened bread was not first introduced by us, but was adopted from the custom of the ancient church, handed down through tradition. Even under papism, there were traces of a purer supper where leavened bread was distributed. He would not listen to any reasoning, but continued to rage more cruelly, until others interrupted the altercation by reading the third article. There, not content with shouting alone, he leapt from the table, and his whole body was so agitated that even when restrained by his colleagues, he could not be held back. When he had collected himself a little, he said that the deceit was intolerable, as everything was full of exceptions. We replied that we had aimed for sincerity, as we had simply and openly made exceptions at the assembly for what seemed necessary. Now listen to the man's impudence. He did not remember that the articles had ever been drawn up by us: since we did not have witnesses at hand to refute such blatant falsehood, we said we would appeal to the judgment of the church, ready to endure any infamy unless all the articles were recognized by the entire assembly, from which Bucer had advocated our cause, from which he had pronounced the brothers' judgment, which agreed in all respects with our demands: and to make you more certain, we faithfully send them to you. When he wanted to accuse us of vanity, he said, how does this agreement of the brothers align with your desire to have your rites approved by the testimony of our delegation, which all the brothers in Zurich disapproved of? You see, most upright brothers, that we were not dealing with a man, much less did he show himself to be a servant of Christ in such an arduous matter. When he was pressed by us with more evident arguments than he could escape: I know, he said, your levity and inconstancy more than enough: for at the assembly you claimed you were ready to yield to us on two points in Lausanne, resisting only on the third, when there you were not willing to concede even a little to us, indeed you would not even endure to hear us. What then? we said. Do you not remember that it was discussed most peacefully among us, and that the controversy was only about the holidays?</p>
      <p>When he claimed all these things were false, we appealed to Erasmus, who was present. He indeed agreed with us, but could not be restrained from proceeding even more boldly. The delegate who had presided over the synod gave us the most certain testimony, adding that he would not hesitate to protest against his lies even before the diocese, if we wished. Nevertheless, with a brazen face, he persisted in denying to the end. Therefore, with all hope cast aside, we descended. When we reached the public road, Sebastian asked whether we thought it true, as some said, that certain brothers were so severe that they called those who had crept into our place wolves and false prophets: we replied that it was not our judgment otherwise. Therefore, he said, we will be condemned by the same law, we who remain here after Megander's expulsion. We denied that the case was the same, and gave reasons why we could not think more leniently of those wolves. From this, you can understand what pretext he sought to extricate himself from us.</p>
      <p>Immediately after hearing that word, he renounced all action on our cause, although he had previously promised to do everything. Only Erasmus remained, who, although he was earnestly engaged in our business, was not very effective with others resisting. A few days later, we were admitted to the council, and three times in one hour we were recalled to abandon our articles. We wanted the church to receive conformity in a legitimate order. The council wanted us to stand as if it had already been received. However, it had been received by a few seditious people with the same decree by which we were to be thrown into the Rhone: we preferred, however, to descend to the most extreme conditions, rather than allow good men to think that nothing was accomplished because of us. A council decree was made that two envoys should lead us to the fourth milestone of the city, then precede us to secure our return: if they obtained it, they would lead us into the city and ensure our reinstatement in the ministry.</p>
      <p>Since we were not satisfied, we again requested to be given the council. Upon entering, we showed that their actions would result in what we most feared, namely that we would be seen as restored through an apology for guilt. We also complained that none of the ministers were attached to the delegation. Therefore, a new council decree was made that we should be led directly into the city by the envoys, and at the beginning, a place would be obtained for us to state our case, so that after giving an account of our ministry, if it was found that we had done nothing wrong, we would be reinstated. Erasmus and Viret were also given to us. We were already one mile from the city when a messenger came to forbid our entry. Although this was done against right and policy, we obeyed the advice of the envoys: otherwise, we would have proceeded safely unless they had more firmly opposed us. And indeed, our lives were well considered in this. For it was later established that ambushes had been placed not far from the walls: and at the very gate, twenty armed gladiators were sitting. Both councils pronounced that the matter should be referred to the people. There, with such gravity, Ludwig Ammann, the other envoy, and Viret, who spoke on behalf of Erasmus and himself, handled the case that the minds of the multitude seemed to be inclined to equity: until after they left, one of the council presidents began to recite our articles with as much malice as he could, with some even echoing him. For it had been agreed that while he was reciting, they would shout to inflame the minds of the people. They had only three things to criticize to stir up hatred against us: that we called the Genevan church ours, that we addressed the Bernese by their name without a preface of honor, and that we mentioned excommunication. Behold, they said, how they dare to call the church theirs, as if they had already come into possession of it. Behold, how they arrogantly despise the princes themselves. Behold, how they aspire to tyranny. For what is excommunication but tyrannical domination? You see how frivolous and trivial the accusations were: for they had long accepted excommunication, whose name they now so abhorred. Yet those fans were effective in inflaming everyone's minds to rage. They decided that they would rather die than hear us give an account. The envoys had indeed brought the articles, but with the mandate not to publish them to the people before we were present, who were ready to remove any scruple that might arise. But our Kunz had another plan. For he secretly sent them through a certain notorious traitor named Pierre Vandel, so that you do not think we rely on obscure conjectures. His treachery is held in hand in this part: for he alone had them written with Sebastian, and that Vandel boasted to many on the road that he was carrying deadly poison for us. Indeed, he could not conceal his attitude towards us: for in the chapter of the brothers held at Nidau, we heard that he spoke thus: The council was deliberating to go to Geneva to restore those expelled (for so he ignominiously called us), but I would rather renounce my ministry and leave my country than help those whom I know have been monstrously slandered. This is the faith solemnly given to you and the church of Christ, which you thought Kunz had no opportunity to break.</p>
      <p>Therefore, now finally believe from experience that the fear with which we were so alarmed before you was not in vain, that we were most reluctantly induced by the authority of the church to enter this labyrinth. Now we are done. Now we seem to have satisfied your judgment and that of all the pious, although we have achieved nothing, unless perhaps that the evil, which was double or triple worse than before, has worsened: for when Satan triumphantly and licentiously triumphed over us at the beginning, both there and throughout Gaul, yet from this rejection, no small confidence has grown for him and his members. It is incredible how licentiously and insolently the impious rage there with every kind of vice, how petulantly they insult the servants of Christ, how fiercely they mock the gospel, how importunately they rage in every way: this calamity should be all the more bitter for us, because as the discipline, which recently appeared moderate there, compelled the most bitter adversaries of our religion to give glory to the Lord, so this furious license to commit all kinds of crimes will be all the more conspicuous for the ridicule of the gospel due to the prominence of the place. Woe to him through whom such scandal is stirred up. Woe to those rather who conspired together in this wicked plan. A good part, although they wished us to stand unharmed, because they could not achieve what they desired, unless the light of truth was extinguished, did not hesitate to serve perverse desire at that price. Kunz, because he could not overthrow us without the ruin of the church, did not hesitate to drag it down with us: and indeed he seems to have destroyed our edification, but we stand firm in the Lord and will stand even better when he himself with the whole nation of the impious collapses. Now it would be better for the church to be completely deprived of pastors than to be occupied by such traitors lurking under the guise of pastors. For there are two who have invaded our place, one of whom, when he was the guardian of the Franciscans at the beginning of the gospel, always resisted hostilely, until he once contemplated Christ in the form of a wife, whom he corrupted in every way as soon as he had her with him. In the very monastic life, he lived most foully and impurely, and not only without any superstition, but without even the simulation of superstition. Therefore, lest he seem to be rightly attacked by the order of bishops, he often shouts from the pulpit that Paul does not require a bishop to be without reproach, but to begin to be so as soon as he is chosen for that dignity. Since he gave his name to the gospel, he has conducted himself in such a way that it is evident to all that his heart is completely devoid of the fear of God and indeed of all religion. The other, although he is very cunning in concealing his vices, is nevertheless so notably and conspicuously vicious that he deceives only strangers. Both, however, being most unlearned and not only incapable of speaking but even of babbling, yet both are most insolently proud. Now they report that a third has been added to them, recently accused of fornication, and about to be convicted, unless he had escaped judgment by the favor of a few. Nor do they administer the office with greater skill than they usurped it. For they forced themselves upon the brothers of the whole province, partly without consultation, partly against their protests, although they rather bear the person of servants of Christ. But nothing pains us more than that their ignorance, levity, and stupidity prostitute and cast away the ministry. Not a day passes without them being openly noted for some error, either by men, or by women, sometimes even by children. But now the haste of the messenger snatches the letter from our hands. Farewell, therefore, most beloved and especially esteemed brothers, and join us in serious prayers to the Lord to rise up soon. Your most loving brothers, Farellus and Calvinus.</p>
      <p>We beseech you, brothers, to be careful that the publication of this letter does not bring us harm. For we deposit anything more familiarly into your bosom than we are to narrate publicly. Therefore, remember that these things are entrusted to your faith in secret.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, D. Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, our dearest brother.</p>
