      <p>Greetings from Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, following your advice and our mother's, I have acted diligently and most faithfully. However, without the help of the arbitrators, I would not have been able to achieve anything with Hediger, not because of him (as he says) but because of Jakob, who, upon his departure from Ottenbach, wanted to have 125 guilders, wishing to gift us 25 guilders out of friendship. But Hediger did not want to argue with us and demanded what was his, as from the trusted ones and his own, which he hoped would not be withheld from him, since we preach and recognize the truth, etc. And he demanded, after all objections and out of friendship, to remain united with us (God grant, what Jakob does) one hundred Rhenish guilders as his gift, etc. Werner and Jakob, his and my authority, accepted this after the delayed matter in Ottenbach and awarded 80 guilders to both as a gift with the coat to Jakob, and thus declared us quit, free, and released from all claims. Additionally, he reserved a free, unencumbered inheritance, which I had to accept. Now my opinion and request to you is that you should sooner or later ensure that nothing becomes of it. I will also do my best. Nothing must come of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love the one who loves you.</p>
      <p>If I can calculate it with everything, it amounts to 103 guilders. It is less, as much is still disputed, and if we can, we will give the arbitrators a gift, as I have felt today that they are inclined towards our side.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear brother in Zurich.</p>
