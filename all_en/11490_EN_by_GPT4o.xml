      <p>Greetings. I beg you, my dearest brother in the Lord, to treat this English guest as if seven Butlers were present there to assist him. I am not speaking of your faith, which needs no witness - let alone seven - but of the diligence, which he greatly needs among strangers.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Bullinger, friend and brother.</p>
