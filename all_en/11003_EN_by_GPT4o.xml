    <p xml:id="regest1">The pending response [to No. 941] will be given by the council instead of him, to make it clear to the friends in Zurich that they will no longer engage with [the canons] under any circumstances; thanks to their departure from the city, the prospects for Konstanz are good, to finally find peace after many storms - like Odysseus. Hopes for a commanding word from the Swiss Confederates, as [Neptune in Virgil's Aeneid] once spoke, and warns against a willingness to compromise. Promises a report, sends greetings, and promises to write to Theodor [Bibliander] on occasion.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has seemed good, honorable Bullinger, to our leaders that the response, which was expected from me, should be referred to the council, so that our friends in Zurich, who wish well for our republic, may not doubt how contrary it is to the safety of this city to once again engage with those canons. For we are very confident that it is at the door, that the Lord, having taken pity on our afflictions, will restore peace to us by His counsel. He will not give a scorpion instead of a fish, nor a peace that is not truly peace. For you know the faithful God, by whose providence it has come to pass that the artisans of that vice, with their self-imposed religion, have left the city. We bear their insolence with difficulty, but what then? It is easier to be harassed by outsiders than by our own people. It is better to rejoice in civil harmony and to cultivate piety rather than to expose oneself to internal danger due to the cunning of others adorned with false promises. For not less than ten years now, like that fabled Ulysses, we have labored with winds and waves, yet we rejoice that our Ithaca now appears to us. But if we must still contend with the suitors, it is to be hoped that Penelope is as far removed from them as possible in these halls. But if anyone argues that we have not yet found our homeland, but rather fled like the Vergilian leader, behold here a new Troy and a new Simois, to which we have arrived, so that neither the Trojans to the obliterated city nor the Greeks to the completed business should return by right of return.</p>
      <p>Would that Switzerland, to whom we have so often and so kindly pointed out the difficulty of our navigation, would at some point command these waves as much as they can, and either restrain the winds with a bag or at least rebuke the ministers of Aeolus, dispersing the gathered clouds and bringing back the sun with these or similar words:</p>
      <p>"Has such confidence in your race held you; now, winds, do you dare to mix heaven and earth without my divine will and to raise such great masses? Whom I...! But it is better to calm the moved waves; afterwards, you will atone for your offenses with a different punishment. Hasten your flight and say this to your king: The dominion of the sea and the fierce trident were given not to him, but to me by lot; he holds the immense rocks, your homes, Eurus; let Aeolus boast in that hall and reign in the closed prison of the winds" etc.</p>
      <p>It is especially to be avoided, Bullinger, that anyone should be persuaded that these winds can be divided to our advantage if a part is received. For by this pretense they have often obtained the greatest things, and a third party has always been found, by whose ruin they would return to favor.</p>
      <p>We will send you the deeds of the past years, from which you will understand by what decree of the people their return to us is prohibited, so that no one may doubt about this matter any further. Therefore, excuse our people as modestly as you can and greet in my words the most esteemed man Dithelm RÃ¶sch and other good men. I could not write to Theodor even now, but I will write during leisure. Pray to the Lord that He may preserve and increase our republic for the honor of His kingdom. And consider it good and fair that I write poetry in such a matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell in our Savior with all yours, most distinguished Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, March 7, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of evangelical truth, his venerable friend in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
