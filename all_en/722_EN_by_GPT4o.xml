      <p>Postscript.</p>
      <p>Paulus Vergerius, whom I now believe to be with you, came to me with his nephew during the recent grape harvest. During our conversation, he instructed his nephew to read a certain confession by Francesco Negro in my presence. After it was read, he awaited my judgment on what I thought of that confession. I said that I needed to think a little about the confession before I could give my judgment. For I knew what he intended. After carefully examining this confession, I later wrote to him in these words: I am pleased with Negro's confession as far as the articles of faith are concerned, but not so much in the part where it deals with the sacraments. For there, some things seemed doubtful to me, and I explained what they were, namely among other things, where it says that the sacraments confer what they promise, namely grace and the remission of sins, righteousness, eternal life.</p>
      <p>However, I wrote this to Vergerius not with the intention of criticizing or censuring Negro's confession, but to advise him not to hastily publish that confession, as he did by sending it throughout Italy. For since I also intended to publish my own confession, which you and the Basel church have approved with your seals and subscriptions, throughout Italy, if Italians and anyone who thinks rightly see that our confessions do not agree but are contrary, so that what one says, the other denies, they will say that we disagree in the doctrine of piety and will be scandalized, knowing that we are here in the same church and in the same place.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I advised that before he published his confession, we should confer amicably and peacefully in the presence of Vergerius himself, because it often happens that contentions arise in doctrines, as they say, about trifles, and the controversy consists only in words and not in meaning. But Vergerius and Negro did not want to acquiesce to my advice, because they do not want, as they say, to contend, but to focus on the reformation of life, as if friendly discussions and Christian contentions are the same and as if it does not pertain to ministers of the word to examine doctrines and attend to teachings. Indeed, Vergerius himself reproached me in a certain letter sent to me. To tell the truth, I was quite surprised by him, who has confessions read in my presence, I who, whatever I am, act as a minister here, and yet he does not want them to be judged, especially since he himself left this confession to me to be examined. I do not write this to you, most wise man, because I want either Negro or others to subscribe to my opinion and judgment, let each one abound in his own sense, but to warn you not to be deceived as good men and venerable fathers to me, Comander and Blasius, simply and in good faith. For they, I do not know whether at the prayers of Vergerius or Negro or some persuasion, confirmed the entire confession of Negro and subscribed to it. However, they did not notice, as I think, that they had equally confirmed our confession with their seal and subscription, in which a contradiction to Negro's opinion on the sacraments is expressly contained. For the thirteenth chapter of our confession, of which you also have a copy at home, clearly states that the sacraments do not confer grace or the remission of sins, but rather are signs of those things; however, Negro's confession affirms the opposite, namely that the sacraments confer grace, the remission of sins, and other things they promise. Although he says that this is not accomplished by the grace of the minister or the work itself, but by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, he nevertheless wants them to be the means and instruments by which the Spirit accomplishes such works, when he says that the sacraments confer what they promise, and when he says that the Spirit joined with the water washes men internally from any sin. For unless he wanted the sacraments to be the means and instruments by which the Spirit accomplishes those works, he would not speak in this way. But that they are the means by which the Spirit works the remission of sins, justifies, and saves, is contrary to Paul; for Paul wants a man to receive the remission of sins and be justified before the sacraments, if we speak of adults, just as Abraham was justified before circumcision, not by circumcision, as you most wisely explain Paul's words in Romans 4. For even the Jews themselves, who attributed justification to circumcision, and our papists to baptism and the Lord's Supper, do not say that the sacraments confer grace and remit sins and save because they accomplish this in themselves and by their own virtue, they are not so gross and stupid as to mean this; they know excellently that the Spirit accomplishes those works, but they err in this, because they want them to be the means by which the Spirit accomplishes those works.</p>
      <p>For although the Holy Spirit is effective through the sacraments and accomplishes and works something, for example, because he confirms us, strengthens us in the faith of his promises, and makes us more certain of his grace, yet he does not accomplish these greatest works, which are to remit sins, confer the grace of justification, through the sacraments, but before the sacraments; the sacraments themselves are afterwards added as signs and seals of these things. You now hold Negro's opinion, which is the same as that of our disturber Stancarus, in this part his teacher. Vergerius defends Negro and writes to me that he wants to do the same with you as with Comander and Blasius, namely to obtain the confirmation of Negro's confession from you, so that they can show your writings here and wherever they want that Francesco Negro rightly thinks about the sacraments against Mainardi's opinion. To tell the truth, I do not care about any of this, as I said; as far as I am concerned, let them say what they want.</p>
      <p>But I wanted to have regard for your dignity and to warn you not to seem to speak contrary things in confirming confessions and to imprint a mark of forgetfulness or inconstancy on your authority. I wanted to write this to you and perhaps more than I should have; but you are a patron and father to me, who will take everything in good part. I will write to you again soon. Farewell again, and if you sign, commend me to Comander and Blasius.</p>
      <p>Your same Agostino.</p>
      <p>To Master Bullinger.</p>
