    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not gather from Bullinger's letter of October 22 [above No. 2018] whether Bullinger received his letter of the 17th [18th?]; Blarer had sent the letter to the house of Matthäus Flar; Flar's wife [Adelheit von Chusen] is the sister of [Regula von Chusen], the wife of the Zurich scribe "Rubi" or "Rubelli" [Heinrich Rubli], who was visiting in Konstanz at the time; perhaps the letter was lost due to the carelessness of the maids. Many confirm that the [Swiss] mercenaries, along with many others, were killed by the English [King Henry VIII], but nothing is known [in Konstanz] for certain, although this rumor is said to have been written by trustworthy people. What Vadian wrote about the peace terms between the Emperor [Charles V] and the French [King Francis I] seems credible, but other testimonies are yet to be awaited. Congratulates the people of Zurich on the harmonious [autumn] synod; if everyone were so concerned about peace, the [Protestant] churches would be better off. It is assured that Luther's booklet ["Kurtz bekentnis"] has been published; however, Blarer has not yet seen it and knows no one who has seen it; Bucer complained greatly in his last letter that the dispute has been rekindled; may the Lord have mercy on the authors of this evil! If Bullinger receives [the draft of] the Cologne Reformation from Vadian, he should promptly return it with his opinion and that of the [Zurich people], for Blarer has significant reasons for wanting this book. Has recommended the son [Felix] of the [Zurich] treasurer [Hans Rudolf Lavater] to the councilor Hans Zangmeister, his friend, who will take good care of the boy; Blarer sends his regards to the father [Hans Rudolf Lavater]. Regards to Bullinger's family and to the [Zurich] brothers; greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From your letter, which you wrote on October 22, I could not discern whether you received mine sent to you on the 17th. At that time, there was a certain citizen from Zurich here, whose name escapes me, but his surname is Rubi or Rubelli, if I am not mistaken. He is a scribe of your city and a relative of our Matthäus Flar; for their wives are sisters, and I had sent the letter to Flar's house, fearing that due to the carelessness of the maids, it might not have been delivered to the man.</p>
      <p>Many consistently affirm that your soldiers were killed by the English along with many others; but we have no certainty, although it is said that this rumor was written by trustworthy people. In such human vanity, I do not easily place faith in just anyone; when I receive something certain from friends of certain faith, I will ensure that you know as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>What our Vadian wrote to you about the peace conditions between the Emperor and the French seems very plausible to me and to many others; however, we will await further testimonies.</p>
      <p>We greatly congratulate you on the synod celebrated with such consensus among you; may the Lord, the author of this good, make it perpetual for you by His kindness, and indeed, may He wish it to be common with many others! If only everyone were as eager for peace as they wish to appear! The affairs of the Church of Christ would be better.</p>
      <p>They assert that Luther's booklet has been published; I have not yet seen a copy nor heard of anyone who has seen it. Bucer, in his recent letters, complains greatly that the flames of discord, not sufficiently extinguished before, are rising again - who would not be tormented by these things even unto death. May the Lord have mercy on those who make themselves authors of this evil and treat the present dangers to souls and bodies as a game!</p>
      <p>When you receive the Cologne Reformation from Vadian, please ensure it is read and return it to me as soon as possible with your judgment and that of your people; for there are significant reasons why I wish to have it.</p>
      <p>I have diligently recommended the son of your treasurer Lavater to a very good man and senator of Augsburg, Lord Johann Zangmeister, my special friend; and I am absolutely certain that he will take care of the good young man diligently, so that he lacks nothing in the office of surgery. Please commend me to the father diligently; for I have long been most willing to gratify that man.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother and my soul in the Lord, to whom I know you commend me and mine with the most holy prayers, as you do. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends. All of ours greet you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, the last day of October 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and more than dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
