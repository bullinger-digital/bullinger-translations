    <p xml:id="regest1">1 Peace and especially grace to the learned and pious, the outstanding Bullinger, who is a very special brother through his pursuit of divine teaching! What better could have happened in this favorable time for literature and linguistics to Abbot Wolfgang Joner of the Kappel Monastery, his brothers, and each individual of his community than the appointment of the young Bullinger as the schoolmaster of the monastery school? Yet this is nothing compared to the fact that Bullinger now has access to countless books from the most significant authors, with the help of which he can enhance his intellectual abilities at his disposal, not to mention his other extraordinary talents (and this without any malicious intent)! All his treatises that came into the hands of scholars are not only witnesses of his studies but also of his scholarship in the service of piety. Did not Cicero already say that people are encouraged to study by their desire to be honored? But even though Bullinger already knows almost everything, he does not boast, except that he knows Christ, the Crucified. His humility serves the glory of God, which is an honor to him and the pious anyway. For those who pursue evangelical truth, there is nothing happier than to take up such a cross, and no one doubts that they will achieve the best results through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Bullinger should therefore continue in this way, and God will make every hour he devotes to study with His help fruitful. May God grant that something more eloquent than the swan song will one day emerge from Bullinger's study, as according to Pliny the Elder, swans emit a lament when they die (as Müller himself has experienced). So may Bullinger also, on occasion, lament the present and long-dangerous times in verse or prose. However, Müller does not mourn these times, especially since Christ, to whom he has completely surrendered, lives in him. But there is no need to explain this to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">2 Müller would now like to briefly present what he has to endure from his contemporaries when he publicly preaches about faith in Christ and cites quotes from the letters of Paul, which, because they are accurate, must be repeatedly impressed upon the people. For if these Bible verses are internalized, they lead to repentance and a better life. God's word is life-giving and effective because it realigns the sinner's mindset and reconciles him with God. Yet even so, man does not escape his tormentors. This also applies to Müller. He has to deal with the Balaam priests, those priests who stab each other and place their trust in outward good works! He would like to rescue them from their ignorance and turn them away from the contempt they show to God. But this is not possible, as God has decided to blind and harden the godless so that these helpers of the underworld will fall and be shattered. For now, some words about the so-called bishops, to inform Bullinger about the resistance he will face from them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">3 This is followed by 436 verses or 218 elegiac couplets, each consisting of a hexameter and a pentameter. Essentially, the misdeeds and vices of the clergy at the Bishop's Court of Constance are denounced, especially greed, corruption, neglect of duties, fornication, as well as gluttony and drunkenness. Müller uses figures from ancient mythology, behind which real people stand, and alludes to events of the time that would require lengthy and detailed archival research to interpret, which cannot be conducted within the framework of a correspondence edition. First denounced is Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg, then the episcopal notary (Beatus Widmer?) and the fiscal (Johann Spreter?), followed by the official (Johann Fridinger) and the administrator (Georg Vergenhans), then the neighborhood, the chaplains (sacellani), the fornicators (scortatores - presumably the priests), and finally the assistant (sinergos), namely the Vicar General Johannes Fabri, who is also referred to as "Zes" (zaes = faber) and "Polyphemus".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">4 Enough of that! And to conclude, Müller wants to use the following words of Virgil from his bucolic poems: "Children, now close the irrigation channels! The meadows are sufficiently watered!" and "Go home, my sated kids! Go! For Hesperus is coming!" (from which it becomes clear why in proverbs the "kids" stand for unchastity). Bullinger should forgive Müller that the words of his so often revised poem do not always hit the desired meaning nor fit well into the meter. Müller also did not succeed in accurately describing the grumblers who always find something to criticize in others. But Bullinger already knows better how these accusers and deceivers in theological matters can argue in vain, how much the bitter hostility shown by these sophists harms those who doubt the word of God, and how far these barking foxes drive their deceit! It is easy for them to escape a questioner through loopholes unless the questioner is well equipped with the shield of faith and the proven weapons taken from the Holy Scriptures. Bullinger already has a great knowledge of the Holy Scriptures and does not need to be encouraged by any scholar to use these weapons, although "it does not hurt - as Ovid already noted - to spur a galloping horse."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">5 He should finally not be annoyed that Müller has distracted him from the study of the Holy Scriptures with his lament and has kept him occupied with trifles for about an hour. It was fun for him to interrupt Bullinger's strenuous study with these entertaining verses. For from these he will effortlessly be able to derive what dangers await those who care for the well-being of their church people, and this in the midst of so many critics and hypocrites who despise both the evangelical truth and the people filled with the faith propagated by the apostles. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">6 P.S.: Bullinger should know that the above verses present a somewhat similar situation to the one Müller is confronted with. In the Zug area, there is a certain man Heinrich Schönbrunner the Elder, a kind of "Apicius" or rather "Sardanapalus", who, with a companion Thomas Stocker, spies on people in the taverns (Horace already said about such people: "Avoid the inquisitive, for he is also a chatterer!"). From one he wants to know how many sons the Virgin Mary had, from another, in what points he does not agree with the Lutheran doctrine, and so this godless informer manages to find out everything! What kind of person he is can be seen from the shape of his body, his lifestyle, and his manners. But why should Müller report in more detail about this lynx, who has the power to put both simple and astute people in a prison cell, who neither knows nor follows God's commandments, who has, so to speak, deviated from Christ and the teaching of the apostles, let alone reads the Holy Scriptures? Any honorable swineherd with an average pure faith could defeat him! This man values nothing more than drinking his wine both day and night! In the whole Zug area, there is hardly an evil more frightening! May God forgive him, although he spares no one with his hatred, envy, and sick mind. In a private conversation, Müller will tell what drives this damned man to cause such mischief. Another greeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">7 Müller could have attached other, more edifying verses from his poetic attempts to the present letter, but he wants to save them for a more suitable occasion. Bullinger should forgive Müller's excitement and presumption. He is nothing but a sinner.</p>

      <p>To the man eminent in the knowledge of letters and in the pursuit of true piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most sacred brother in theology, I wish peace and indeed grace. What could have happened more fortunately in this most literate age to you, a venerable young man, to Father Wolfgang Rüpple and his brothers, and to each individual of the fellowship? There is indeed nothing, for you have at your disposal so many volumes published by the greatest authors, with which you can exercise your intellect, which is at your command, not to mention your other truly remarkable talents (may envy be absent from my words!). Whatever of your writings comes into the hands of any learned person, there shines no less a wealth of good arts than of learning directed towards true piety. Hence that saying of Cicero in the first book of the Tusculan Disputations: "Honor nourishes the arts, and all are kindled to study by glory. And those things always lie neglected which are disapproved by the people." Although you may have been almost raised to the pinnacle of doctrines, you arrogate nothing to yourself boastfully, except to know Christ and Him crucified. This humility of yours for the glory of God causes praise to come to you of its own accord, which is an honor to the pious. Nothing could be more delightful than this form of the cross ever imposed on those devoted to the truth of the gospel, whom the impulse of the spirit carries to all the best things, as no one doubts. Meanwhile, continue as you have begun, and may God make this hour fortunate for you, in which, under good auspices and not without divine guidance, you have applied your mind to the muses. And may God grant that from your study may someday come forth songs more melodious than swans. About which I myself have experienced Pliny to have written truly, when he indicated that they emit a mournful song at death. So may you also, having found occasion, lament in elegiac verse or prose the times which endure, perilous as they are, which indeed I do not care for, if Christ lives in me, to whom faith is safely entrusted, about which there is no need to admonish you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I make you aware in a few words of what I endure from the people of this age, while I speak in public sermons about faith in Christ and other teachings from the letters of Paul, which, because of their purity, must be frequently impressed upon the people, which, if eagerly embraced within the bosom of a retentive memory, prepare nothing but the way of repentance, that is, of changing life for the better. For the word of God is living and effective, which renews the mind of the sinner and makes him return to grace with God. Each of us suffers his own spirits. For it often happens to me from the priests of Balaam, who stab themselves with little spears and place their trust in external works. From these, you may understand that I wish to be separated from them and from the ignorance and contempt of God, who leads the impious into blindness and from that into a stubborn mind, so that they, the grim satellites of hell, are dashed to pieces. And first, about those who are called by the name of bishop, it is pleasing to insert a few things, so that you may see what obstacle you have in readiness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Bishop. I have not learned to sell vain smokes everywhere, miserable, I could not applaud by dissimulating wickedness. Will the bishop, greedy, despoil with forbidden daring? Does he take away the support, which you wish to be present? How many times has he lost the expense, free from all, What good care does he bring to the pastor? Let him sometimes ask; it will be, when perhaps he needs it, If he lacks his own, but unless with a pious heart. Let him fear to demand, repeating the tribute without end, If he has extorted once, let him think it enough. When he has once snatched away or the wolf, needy of food, Then he returns from the fold to seize the soft flock. But no scarcity compels this one to be vigilant in care, And yet the greedy one seeks exhausted wealth. Is it not right to drive away wolves with a staff, to defend the lambs, Will it be right for the lazy to be ruled in pious vows? Scarcely have you come well, let it be open, if the court is said to be ours, But the honor of nobility prevails. Soon the vessels of rich wine are poured for the rich, And the precious kitchen brings its dishes to them. With a great gift (nothing is more acceptable there) And soon the cause for the men is to be expedited. The cause of the elder, who returns with losses, is neglected, The hall of the president denies him drink. He discusses opportunely enough prudently to all, Yet he, deceived, languished before the doors. The vassal, taking away the food, curses him with hatred, Let the parish house be broken by decay. He does violence, or alienates the small revenues, Threatening the priests with atrocious fates. The cleric is led as a great thief undeservedly, The captive head is beaten with a hard sword. Why do you, O president, bear a threatening staff, If you have no care for the savage wolves? Be honored, be free from work, you eat butter with milk, Or with the gifts of those whose you can be fatter. Whoever does not listen to you, never let him lend me his ears. He does not obey the sent ones, who neither does the commands. Now the pursuit of rigid litigation makes the poor, The rapacious informer cares to harm with a bond. He sold the outcome for a price, who exhibits the office of the president's hall not without deceit. He holds them entangled with much bait, Indeed, he compels the empty ones to go home. No less does he burn prone to anger at the coming one, Than a dog is wont to snarl with a treacherous tooth. Then he strikes the air, angry with an empty word, Whose nature is accustomed to be harsher outside. He sometimes brings unworthy things to the innocent, He emptied the pockets not without gall, insolent. He wants the price of his voice, now five flagons of wine, The pride of the lawyer, may your vows be ratified! A half-bushel of wheat moves him and a half-pound of pepper, So that he may devour the salted ham. The pelamydes in the vessel teach beans, cheese, herring, What is needed for the roe deer, stag, boar, A capacious box of silver and gold weight, Or polished vessels drawn by the potter's wheel. If money blinds the judge's mind, The promised evil, then fair safety perishes. The notary, the fiscal, and others of that kind. The inhuman notary may cunningly denounce you, Or the book or pamphlet may betray you. The levity of the lawyer is restrained for gain, Unless you flatter with a gift, he will want you to be guilty. The cause of the poor languishes, if he cannot enrich the purse of greedy Matho, the guardian will want to be absent. It is rashly said that you vex the talkative one abundantly, To whom the art of quibbling opens insults. He prepares a thing in gain than which no one is more avaricious to me, If he will pay the penalty, he has conquered both evils. He dreams of treasure, the sum of the purse to be counted, The prodigal hand dissipates the money of the ward. He also knows how to denounce with monstrous slander to the treasury, So that a part of the contributing master's share may fall to him. The fiscal coin is accustomed to empty the pockets. Therefore, he strives to confiscate with a penny tenacious. If you lack money, you must assign the profits to the treasury, which remain to you. He watches over the storehouse of treasure, so that the rich may abound, Anxious, he accumulates, but without the honor of God. So that he may live more lavishly, he makes the chests languish, He repairs the collected wealth not without fraud. Is it displeasing to conduct cases without increased profit? The civil law places its forum with money. Whatever vice you have, they will want to be recorded in the acts. The lawyers, who openly note shameful deeds. To sell judgment is indeed an enormous crime, If ambition produces foul lust for wickedness. This work indeed suits the pretext for wickedness, For the greedy of gain, nothing can remain. The official and the dispenser, etc. There remains yet the plebeian enemy we expose, The cruel official, tenacious from the mouth. The hawk circles to tear the timid doves, He holds the poor under the jurisdiction of the law. The greed of the kite plucks the defenseless chicks, So he eagerly explores your wealth. Then how often does he irritate the honest priests! What does this tyrant do with these importunate commands! He will make anxious whatever business he decides to command, He postpones pious causes. But neither does the injury compensate for the hard sufferings, Nor will it repair the wealth you have expended. He insists and strives to introduce forbidden customs, So that the anxious prey may bite its own dogs. Indignation dictates that you appear, He accuses you more quickly of being guilty of a crime. Unless you restrain the barking Molossian with bread, The clamorous dog terrifies with impetuousness. Thus, because he does not receive the segments of shining gold, The vast wolf barks incessantly from his mouth. How, oh, does the rapacious patron protect the miserable clients, It is in doubt, lest your safety be feigned! He continually harasses, nor does he defend the cause of the just, Nor does he avenge the crime of inflicted evil. I reveal many dangers that have harmed care, The steward opposes if you are about to warn. The fiscal repeats to defame the pious pupils, The Swabian often goes free and unharmed. The coins of Venus make us grieve for the arena, He tolerates noble suitors not without fraud. Unless you skillfully appease with a gift, He brings great disgrace to light. Now he cites, then he warns, at the same time he excommunicates, urges. He aggravates, imposes, relaxes the sad work. He seeks for his own love, not what is the glory of heaven. Lest there be honor for the poor, he is wise to be vigilant. The whole neighborhood, because the pugnacious neighborhood seizes us with a bite, Expels the native men from their seats. The violent and audacious stranger has driven away the neighbors, The indecent one always dissents fiercely with the invited one. He exalts himself more by the favorable rumor of the people, The glory obtained by the measures of doctrine pleases. He sows destruction for the people if a sermon is made, Often the tumult drives the pious in different directions. Why does Salius strike the shields with swords for Mars, So that the avaricious one may drive the plague (which I think) further? Whence has such wickedness grown among the greedy pastors, That the cause found for pleasure may suddenly flow? The talk is that the offered money fills the coffers, So that it may attract the unlearned people to his words. It will be shameful if the fickle flatterer wishes to be considered. In what way may all things succeed for him now. He does not dare to reveal what are the misdeeds of the people, But he allows them to luxuriate in bad morals. There is nothing more shameful on earth than to spare the truth, To be caught by the easy credulity of sinners. Let there be free power of the tongue to speak the truth, It is disgraceful to have kept silent about deceit for gain. The holy precepts, which the skilled muses elucidate, The sacred poets have explained more clearly. The same things have been expounded by the cultivated teachers in letters, Which they have not abandoned even when given to tortures. There is nothing more unworthy than to struggle with a noble mouth, With masks, as a dog bites bones. Who can recount the sharpness of the verbose tongue, And how often the air yields to inert fists? What can the lazy pig teach Minerva? Why do the muses of the donkey, the jackdaw, and the lyre? What does he proclaim with a worn forehead to the people, He accuses of schism and heresy openly? Indeed, the great poets have sung that the words of God bring hatred, But it is a shame for the pious to have kept silent. The insults of the purpose warn many to be weary, And the bitter plague compels men to be silent. He despises from behind, while he forms with open hands, The ears of the rascal, which the madman agitates. This one derogates from faith, the vile groom does not know how shameful it is, The seditious one violates divine aid. The life of the deceitful chaplain is sufficiently hated, Who is pleased to place himself in the desired place by right. He neither reads nor sings nor performs the solemnities of the mass, If there is no advantage in the office. He scarcely moos for rest, there is fear of the offense of the people, If it invades him at the same time, thus the rebellious one hinders. He gnashes his teeth, blaming you or the kitchen, If he has not always been able to reach your dishes. And because he disagrees, he does not render the honors begun, The envious one dissents from your service. Drunk at the table, with a raw stomach, he now devours foreign feasts or gulps down the diatheca. He sows quarrels, contends with an idle word, He thinks of how to cover his crime with his mouth. Then he is licked sacredly, now drowsy in the temple, While he grieves that the fat goods of fortune yield. Still drinking the draught of Falernian wine in the middle of the night, He places his bones to sleep on his bed. He does not pay the vows at the due time, The putrid vapor bursts from his mouth. He inveighs, accuses, tears, and denounces with a whisper, He hinders, growls, and dissimulates evils. The vain one applauds, while it will be allowed to report false things, He knows how to recite light trifles to please. Always splendidly or initiates the solemnities with a splendid appearance. The proud one performs the sacred vows of the ministry. Oh, how often does he hunt for the empty breezes of the people! Does he not always postpone the pious praises of God? Believe that the sacrificial ones rejoice in a shining appearance, The unstable honor is snatched away by ambition. Hence the trifling and hateful one envies the rich house, So that he may accuse the vice he notes, without delay. How often does he groan when he does not dare to speak against, And while he cuts with a Theonian tooth, he is troublesome. How many thin sands of the Aegean Sea will you count, So many are the snares he bears in your threatening harm. Not to have borne the roles of the lord, nor the care of the people; The sad work of the unfaithful client indicates. He will not want to believe a penny, but to lose everything in forbidden luxury, He will want to snore all night long, lecherous. To whom the mother of the gods demands Atys the eunuch, He lies soft in love with Celenus. Sweetly he covers himself with a kid's cloak, Who has a weak head with a fur garment. Who was just difficult, the same one is rendered pleasant, To whom neither the same thing tasted, he could endure bitter things. He is iron-hearted, an easy informer of a friend, Who strives to say false things to Father Hugo. You can equal the statues of the erect colossus, You are so great, but it is a shame to have the name of the great. The end of envy is to hang the neck from a branch, He makes noise, he expunges, he breaks and rages. Oh Polyphemus, it is known that your breasts have swelled, Such as a raw girl would want for herself. The king's feast does not feed him, nor a thin morsel, The guests of a small cask are disturbed by the turbid wine. Avoid the plague of envy, for with a hunchbacked body Atlas could scarcely have borne the heavens on his shoulders. My dining with you is not worth so much, Even if the priest's feast is lavish itself. Immediately the obscene breakfasts renew the customs, Of which we would be ashamed to speak of their levity. The die will adapt the contamination of forbidden play, The senio is thrown with a deceitful hand. Hence the thin papers are torn by long abuse, The greedy ones are accustomed to empty the pockets. The blasphemous player will want to repeat perjuries, Now others move tedium with scurrility. No one will recount the mockeries of the filthy assembly. They mix luxurious words with pious jokes. Indeed, it delights to have moved so many laughs here, Because they have prostituted vows with a bad example. And the prodigal one, consuming his own with much luxury, Always loves to consume riches, for the gluttonous one loves. He has shamefully consumed two thousand coins in feasts, Than which no one is a lighter spendthrift anywhere. What voracious glutton has not rejoiced to have swallowed dishes with his palate, Or to have reclined on immense couches! He suppresses absurdities with a silent mind and lips, He can bear whatever you want to have endured. This one conjectures badly, led by bile over everything. He will strike with blows from suspicion. He swells with false praise, consumes in greasy dishes, This heir squanders what the old woman left. This one, too sluggish with too much fat, cannot add a song to the lap of the muses, a sweet melody indeed. He burns with the love of a seen girl, Not fearing to establish deceits in the citadel of the mind. Then he is heated by drunkenness, under the middle of the night, Able to bear the wine of Lyaeus, what he drank he vomits again. If the lewd companions are ashamed of their purpose, I wish the muses always to be remembered by me. You know rightly to cast every crime on them, The nation which now sends foreign men. What others do, the informer will bring to the ears of the heroes, The sagacious one sees through everything. The bird is hired with a thin piece of bread, To speak the shameful work of the prelate. This one obscures his native honor, the envious author, The rival who stands to harm the native men. He disturbs everything, he weighs nothing with discrimination, Lest at the same time he harms what he himself builds, evil. Diligent in trifles, this one also obstructs honest arts, The flagitious cohort pollutes the innocent. With a colossal mass, this one has raised his head above all, From the great statue, he resigns the vile work. This one covers the omens of the vast body with a curved back, Combative in mind, a small-hearted man. Of no value, not polished in art, He is hated by all, the obese belly stinks. This one omits nothing to inculcate shameful crime, He is accustomed to consider all the pious as nothing. This one dissolves in laughter, despised in tattered clothing, Whom the wrinkled nose has borne into exile, He despises the learned everywhere with a worse mark, The ample glory of war has fallen for the old man. To embrace the Salian feasts and dinners everywhere, The priest of the flame knows how to recreate. There is no shame in words or reverence at the table, Let anyone say that he has devoured Alban dishes. What does such a great license of foolish voices feed? What does it please to report the vain things of Cybele's Gallus? This one seems to have shaken off the memorable sign, The swollen one with gluttony, to whom the morsel of leaders tastes. It is regrettable to have encountered the giant with an ill omen, Mud in appearance, bald and head itself. Does honor undeservedly yield to you, marked with a stain, Do you wish the degenerates to give you a gift? What does it help to have pleased me with the excessive mode of the insipid tongue, At the same time, what does it help to have pleased me immoderately? Lest you seem willing to be considered sufficiently accurate, Anxiously take your hand from the board or still. Now your chest has swelled with second honor, So that the girl cannot bear your pride. Worthy of disdain, she will flee you, whether grave age, And often the busybody called to you is present. I do not know how to lie, I will not flatter unjustly, That praise soothes to hang vows to God. I am not a deity, why do you equate me with the immortals? Should honor be given to the flatterer? Let us be unequal, hatred and great labor make, And neither wants to be inferior to the other. And if you cannot be an ox, at least be the driver of a donkey, Take what is nearest to you. Whatever good you see to be present, embrace it as just, The lowest fate will make you remember yourself. There is an animal that bears the curved claws of a chameleon. Its color is varied, which the light breeze cherishes. It has a beak, similar to a small pig, The swollen rib ends in long feet. Its movement is slower, but harmful with a gaping mouth, Blood is in the heart, not without gall rigid. The crime of the glutton is enormous, affected by punishment, Although he may have avoided it with compressed buttocks. Although the modest may have abstained from the crepitus of the belly, Each one labors with the vice of farting. In the basin, the boy will bring urine to the fields, Let the floral garlands adorn the yellow hair. This one laughs and plays, consuming the food of the table, He simulates the hope of gain, the troublesome one seeks to bear, As the dog drinks from the Nile and flees, the envious one lightly tastes the arts, nor does he lie down unless it is sweet. The pale contagion of the minty disease, The black plague compels to approach the Stygian lakes. The mouths oppressed by poison pollute the pious, The ultimate tedium of the quartan fever acts. If envy is pressed by a thing successfully done, The rest obtained by labor yields to better. What fortune denies, he takes with another's expense, He suddenly elicits many good things from little. The adulterer, discolored and thin with leanness, Has anthropomorphites to imitate. The creditor exhausted, the garment covered with squalor, And usury makes the skin lean. Let it be that the service is for the debtor for another's money, So that the account of the loan may be a torture. He acts with fraud, he eludes, which the insatiable ardor, Like this pestilential disease, kills bodies. What or where he spends, he has brought in increased accounts, The sportula is given by the condition of judgment. While he repeats the hired homes late at night, He stumbles against a stone, his body spread on the ground. The Gaul smells of Cybele, rolling his limbs in the mud, He quickly expels his head pressed from the pit. The fornicators The priest often acts foolishly due to the vice of age, The old man occupies his mouth with delirium. Blinder than Hypsaea and very similar to a mole, He is deprived of strength and juice, dull. A foolish heart is in the blind or in the swelling one, So that this pest of the mind may cover the bitter evil. Behold, the one who is deafer than the port of Toroneus itself, Has made no small harm to the leader. The adulterer envelops his mind in Cimmerian darkness, He hides it in clouds, lest the work be seen. Not so vehemently does the old man perish in the rigid heat of Amyntor, Because he is always lecherous. The mud is gathered from the crossroads, while the vile adulterer, Whom you make of no value, performs the office. The client, having mocked with infamous art, Always urges to harm with accustomed deceits. You, too much with a badly behaved and unfaithful companion, Do not think the matter of little value. The annoyance of hatred falls upon excessive things, And the badly managed thing falls from its play. He himself will adhere to your side as an unequal companion, Lest he lack a little dinner obtained with jokes. Does not the fierce one strike the head of the prostitute, Who reproaches the deceits not without gall? What crime did the stupid one excuse openly for the adulteress, Which the inveterate trick mocks. To carry the urine of the urinating adulteress in a basin, Is the work of the weak one to smell his own dung. Do you think this is nothing, old man, that you use a concubine, And the friendly hand serves the belly. The crime of nature is a great crime (believe me), As much as you can scarcely conceive in your own mind. It is indeed shameful to say if he masturbates foolishly, Let the joys fostered by his fingers perish. How often have we seen her standing nearby, Noting the guests with a more turbulent eye. Tell me, I ask, what crime is it to look at the lecherous adulteress? We look at the sun, the stars, the temple of God. Should I turn my face away as if Gorgon were offering me cups, And cover my face? If you do not want the guest to look at the eager stepmother, Bear Phineas dining, at the same time Oedipus. To relieve the belly, the light one clings to the friend, Shamefully held by excessive love, he defecates. The assistant Your assistant, who loves, clings to the prostitute, He secretly kisses the beloved place. Zes acts here, the young man of the adulteress, at the same time he burns anxiously, Always loves to sustain your parts. He is present, adorned, whom no cause of business detained, More known to the adulterer Aufidius. I do not know what the rascal sighs in the ears of the adulteress, He desires to be the steward of the house. The face of Thersites, than which none is more deformed, Nor is the Daedalian machine yet polished by hand, The monuments of Pasiphae's nefarious love with the bull, The king Minos left a sad work. Who doubts that the pledges cut from the Swabian parent, Had the indomitable head of the Rhine afterward? How many times was the monstrous one defeated by Hercules with a gaping mouth, Yet the serpent of many heads is not absent! The warrior subdued him through a thousand hard labors, He washed the bones struck in the Brigantine lake. Indeed, they say the eagle devoured the liver of Prometheus; Here he grieves to have perished by the spear of Hercules. Polyphemus drains the cups of Leneus in the cave, He orders to drink and sweet melody everywhere. The cyclops devours with a greedy and fat palate, So that he may be looser than the pelican's belly. More savage than the Harpies and very similar to the pest, Indeed, alienated in mind, he would devour the regurgitated. He is much fuller with the distended udder of cows, Nor does the beard of Cybele's Gallus exist. But the guest, hateful of seeing the spotted backs, More apt to have the sharpness of the lynx. This liquor, uncovered, hardens with a heap of sand, He grieves to be strong with the vices of urine. Nor unless with the whole, now male, now female connection, The rigid hyena bends its head on the neck. This one cunningly expresses the name of the man (whom he sought), He kills the summoned one silently at night. The doctors add castoreum for various uses, The Pontic beaver cuts off the testicles with its mouth. It is not to dissolve the knots fixed with teeth, Unless the bones creak strongly from the bite.</p>

      <p>But enough of these for the present, so that that of Virgil in the Bucolics may support me in finally reaching the end: "Close the streams now, boys! The meadows have drunk enough." "Go home, sated ones, Hesperus is coming, go, goats!" (whence 'goat' in sayings from impertinence). But if these do not fit in all respects or cohere poorly, with so many repetitions of both words and meanings, forgive my slowness, that I have not precisely described the fault-finders and the critics of others' works. You yourself know better what the accusers in theological matters argue in vain, how much the stubborn rebellion of the sophists vexes the incredulous with the word of God, and how far the imposture of the clamorous old fox drives, to whom it is easy to evade any questioner, unless they are well equipped with the shield of faith and the certain armaments of divine law taken from the sanctuary. The knowledge of the sacred letters is abundantly available to you, so it is superfluous for anyone, even the most learned, to exhort you to them, but it is true what Ovid said: "It does not hurt to apply the spur to a horse already running."</p>

      <p>Finally, that I have distracted you from the study of those with my trifles and have occupied you with these for an hour, do not wish to take it badly. For it was pleasing to my mind to intercept you, engaged in serious matters, with these games, so that it may be easy to see what evils threaten the one caring for the people among so many critics and possessors of bad faith, among whom both the evangelical truth and whoever is filled with the faith spread under the apostles are ill-heard. Meanwhile, farewell and love me! Given on the feast of Saint Thomas the Apostle in the year 1523 from the village, etc.</p>

      <p>But so that you may understand what I have signified through these similar things, there is a certain Apicius or rather Sardanapalus among us, who, with his retinue, searches in inns for what is hidden, about whom also that of Horace: "Avoid the inquisitive, for he is also a chatterer." One asks how many sons the Virgin Mary had, another what he thinks otherwise in the Lutheran matter, so that the most impious informer leaves nothing uninvestigated. And what kind of man he is appears from the lineaments of his whole body, life, and manners. But why should I say more about this Lynceus, who has been given the power to hand over men, who are in the simplicity of faith, very perceptive, to the ergastula, to whom neither the divine law itself nor its works are dear, who has almost defected from Christ and the doctrine of the apostles, to whom neither is the reading of the sacred letters, whom any swineherd with an intact faith could easily surpass. But to be drunk with wine day and night would be of great value to him! A more restless evil is not easily found in the territory of the Zug, but may God spare him, who spares no one, a most lost man with hatred and envy, then with other calamities of the soul. What finally he bears before himself and under what pretext he constructs these evils, I can recount to you when we are alone in conversation. Again, farewell.</p>

      <p>I could have mixed in more sound things from these rudiments in poetic matters, but it was my counsel to omit them for a time when they will be more suitable. Again, forgive the fervor and boasting, for nothing is from me except sin.</p>
