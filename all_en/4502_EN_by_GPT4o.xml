      <p>Greetings. Yesterday at nightfall, your letters and those of your envoys, the consul from Cham and Thun, to Diesbach, as well as my brother's to me, were delivered to us. You are not unaware of what has been written by our people to yours in the meantime, and indeed, our people have been satisfied by your latest letters. They are pleased with your steadfastness, that you are ready to assist them if they are oppressed by force. Similarly, our people are also inclined.</p>
      <p>They have their plans ready, and everything is prepared. I hear nothing but that everyone is so intolerant of the arrogance that they would gladly proceed with it, and they are certain: they will earnestly pursue it here and will not allow anything unjust to happen. The rest Diesbach himself will report.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing except that after the uprising that took place in Lyon, a prominent lord at the court, Guido von Chartres, who is said to have instigated it, has been arrested and is to be judged. The Guise family is advancing.</p>
      <p>Vend√¥me has been summoned to the court, but he does not come. It is said that if he alone would take on the governance, he would have enough people and resources to sustain the war. The news you received at this fair, my brother sent to me, for which I thank you greatly. I also wrote to you yesterday; but I think you will receive those letters later than these.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May all your people be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th October 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
