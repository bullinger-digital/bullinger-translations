      <p>Greetings. I thanked you for your chronological summary and added to it my letters, which seemed necessary at the time; I sent them through a certain scholar who called himself Clemens; I hope they have been delivered to you. Now you should know that through the Imperial Majesty, a formula of religion called the Interim has been prescribed and published for us, according to which the Emperor wants us to believe and act.</p>
      <p>At the beginning, concerning sin and justification, it is not arranged too badly, except that works are too freely added.</p>
      <p>The number of sacraments is 7, about all of which incorrect teachings are given, especially concerning the Lord's Supper and the Mass, in which they openly introduce the transubstantiation of bread and wine, the veneration and intercession of deceased saints, and the offering of the body and blood of Christ by the priest. Also, priestly marriage and communion under both kinds, as far as it pertains to laypeople, are tolerated only until the definition or determination of the Council of Trent. Furthermore, no one should preach unless ordained and approved by the ordained bishops. In summary: apart from the papacy, there is nothing else, and in this it is worse, because the papists are praised for their constancy and perseverance in their former religion, and they are also admonished to endure in this way, while the rest are strongly urged to return to their church. In this, the papacy is confirmed in all respects, while all others are condemned. We bear this yoke above and beyond all earthly things trampled upon, and this is our fate, because without the cross, a Christian does not emerge. Pray diligently for us, and if it happens that I perish in these troubles, I will see you in the eternal homeland.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all of yours, Haller, Gwalther. Your affliction is not so far away.</p>
      <p>Duke Moritz of Saxony, Margrave Johann of Brandenburg, Duke of Zweibr√ºcken, and the cities do not want to consent to this Interim.</p>
      <p>If violence is added, certainly a disaster like that of Nero or Maximinus will follow. May 20th.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, etc., to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
