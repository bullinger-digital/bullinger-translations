      <p>If it pleases the Lord, indeed, that I delay longer than I had thought. But I complain of nothing; for I know that I am now rendering not a contemptible service in wounding the Antichrist. Good God, what a harvest and opportunity I have found!</p>
      <p>You will know everything when I return; I do not regret the labor nor the long delay, not at all. I hardly hope that I can tear myself away from here within two weeks; certainly, I will not leave until the end of this month. Share this with my dear Josias, to whom I would like you to say that a messenger could not be sent for certain reasons; but I entrust it to your and his judgment, if it seems that one should be sent to me from there, that is, consider whether there are many letters addressed to me; if so, send them, and I will pay; but if there is only one or two letters, there is no need to send them. I leave everything to your judgment, although I would also like to be informed about Josias's mission, what you have decided.</p>
      <p>I am away from the court; therefore, I have nothing certain of news to write. Strange things are said: that Maurice has come to an agreement with Albert and both are preparing a great army; it is not known against whom, although they add that Ferdinand is joined with them, they say, to resist the Prince of Spain, the son of the Emperor, who is about to enter Germany. About the Emperor himself, who has abandoned the city he was besieging, you could have understood better there. The assembly has been moved from Augsburg to Ulm, but it will hardly be held due to such great war movements. I hear that Melanchthon is alive. Again, regarding the letters and the messenger to be sent to me, I say, if there are many, indeed send them, if few, refrain. I no longer ask for the book from my luggage to be sent, which I had mentioned to Josias; I only beg him to distribute those books as I said. I write to dear Ascanio Marso, to take care to inquire in the Emperor's camp, which is in Piedmont, whether my nephew Ludovicus is there; therefore, I ask you to take care of the letters for him. Josias had left these with me, and I would not want it to have been for my nephew, for whom I am still compelled to have care.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church. Volmar greets you. TÃ¼bingen, July 10, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>If it seems that a messenger should be sent to me, I would consider it advisable that you send immediately and do not delay for many reasons.</p>
      <p>By all means, advise dear Johann Ziegler to take out two garments from my luggage, lest they be ruined, but to keep them elsewhere in his chests.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
