      <p>Greetings. There was absolutely no need for such a preface; for I serve you, my lord and brother, wholeheartedly, and therefore I send to you the enclosed Defectum with the letters and bid you to freely and securely ask from me what you request to be done by me; I serve you and your son, Mr. Josua, most willingly, in whatever matter I can. I wonder if you have received my last letters; I had entrusted them to a certain man from Appenzell, a tall and gray-haired man, who is accustomed to carry letters and dispatch messages; for I certainly think I handed him the letters about 2 months ago, if I am not mistaken.</p>
      <p>Indeed, on the 14th of this month, the most honorable matron Zwingli, the wife of our Mr. Gwalther, passed away to the Lord, to the great sorrow of us all.</p>
      <p>But listen, my brother, to what else has happened. Soon after her, whom they loved most dearly, followed my two dearest daughters, Elisabeth, the wife of my Mr. Simler, and Anna, the wife of my Mr. Zwingli.</p>
      <p>They passed away within 6 days, Elisabeth on November 20th, having been ill since the 18th, and Anna on the 23rd, having fallen ill in the evening of the 18th. The death of these has caused me the greatest grief; yet again, I am greatly consoled by the fact that they were endowed with sincere and firm faith and persevered in the invocation of the name of Christ until their last breath, departing from this world with a calm and cheerful countenance, never taking their eyes off me, as I led them in prayer and confirmed them with the words of Christ.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, we are all still quite well, standing ready and waiting with a joyful mind for the Lord's call, submitting ourselves in all things to the divine will with His grace.</p>
      <p>You pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Greet most diligently the most pious and learned fellow ministers, our brothers.</p>
      <p>Greet your son Mr. Josua, Liner, and our other friends, especially the old man RÃ¼ttlinger, to whom I sincerely wish all happiness.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Zurich, the last day of November 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Kessler, the most faithful head of the school in St. Gallen, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. St. Gallen.</p>
