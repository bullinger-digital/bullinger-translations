      <p>S. D. I have nothing certain or known to write at the moment, except that I am very surprised by the interpreter's impudence. As I understand from your letters, he dares to propose to the most honorable magistrate of Chur something that is utterly false; for the chief preacher and pastor of that church, Mr. Johannes Konrad Ulmer, wrote to me on the 28th of this month, that is, yesterday, in these words: "The King of France issued two edicts in Lyon, by which the ministers of the gospel are expelled from the kingdom, and the listeners and disciples are removed from all public offices.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the royal envoy wanted to persuade our Schaffhausen senate that the doctrine of the gospel is not being attacked with arms, but only the seditious minds and wicked attempts of some are being suppressed, etc. But our people have recalled the military sign, which was previously in the royal camps, and have strictly forbidden their own to serve as soldiers in the future." So he writes. The interpreter presents things to honorable people in such a flattering way, but it holds otherwise. Therefore, we must be cautious not to be led into a trap and deceived by these people with their stories.</p>
      <p>I also saw letters written from Antwerp, which contained that Andelot, while leading 1500 horsemen from Brittany to Cond√©, was surrounded by the royal forces at a certain river, and after some of his men were killed, he escaped with the greater part. I saw other letters again, which contained that the rumor of Andelot's defeat was indeed spread, but it was exaggerated. Thus, it is now also spread, but nothing certain is brought forth, that there was a battle in Flanders and the Spaniards destroyed the first line of the Germans; soon, however, when it came to the reserves, the Germans fought more fiercely and the Spaniards were routed and put to flight with great slaughter.</p>
      <p>I affirm nothing here; for I have nothing certain and I doubt the entire report. Shortly, we will hear what is true. It is reported from Schaffhausen and Ulm that some German bishops, such as those of Salzburg, Augsburg, Freising, etc., and some others have collected five hundred thousand thalers through merchants, and when the Augsburg merchants wanted to transfer this silver to Duke Alba, it was intercepted by the followers of Orange. But let the reader have faith. Some signs of plague are appearing here.</p>
      <p>May the Lord do what is good in His eyes. Farewell excellently with your household and all our friends, the fellow ministers, the honorable consuls, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 29th [October], the day after Simon and Jude, 1568. Very quickly.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
