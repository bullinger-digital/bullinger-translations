    <p xml:id="regest1">[Wilhelm] Peterson reports in his letter from January 31, which arrived on February 24, nothing new; England is still in the state previously described [No. 1361], but there is reason to hope that the situation will soon stabilize. The damage that Peterson has suffered, and about which he will soon tell Bullinger himself, is self-inflicted and was foreseeable, as hardly any of the wood delivered from Glarus had the required properties - square, three fingers thick, seven feet long, knot-free, and planed; Peterson wishes that Bullinger - hopefully not too late - would intervene with the suppliers. Greetings. Wonders if Bullinger has received the Roman coins well.</p>

      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, John Butler wishes all the best in Christ.</p>
      <p>The letters dated the last of January from England, addressed to Peterson, reached me in Basel on the sixth day before the calends of March. I received nothing new from them. The kingdom remains in the same condition as we described in our previous letters to you: however, there is great hope, and all the best people earnestly pray to God that it will soon be much more stable. Furthermore, I will not now report to you how much loss W. Peterson has suffered from the purchased wood: he himself will soon, with God's guidance, explain it to you in person. But it is mostly due to his own fault; he did not provide better for sound timber when he first bid for it in Glarus. Before he left here, I told him in person, from the very first sight of his timber, that when he arrived in England, he would regret somewhat the undertaking of this kind of wood purchase. I predicted this too truly, which causes me great sorrow for his sake. However, no one should judge me a more perceptive prophet for this reason; for the very material of the bows certainly threatened this loss before he left Basel. For when each piece of bow timber should have been three fingers thick, square, seven feet long, and well-planed without knots, hardly any met this standard and description. Therefore, in letters written to me, he earnestly asks you to warn these people of his loss, so that they may examine everything according to this example, which I have just described: but I fear he may not warn them too late; lest, as before, he spends effort and expenses in vain. Therefore, I pray you do what seems advisable to your kindness towards him in this matter. Farewell most happily in the Lord. Furthermore, please convey my greetings to your excellent wife and the whole family. Basel, around the eleventh hour of the night, March 29, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours from the bottom of my heart, JOHN BUTLER.</p>
      <p>So far, I have not understood whether you have received the Roman coins. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church.</p>
