      <p>S. We have delivered your letters to the speaker through a safe messenger.</p>
      <p>Our Traversus was here these days and told me that he no longer wants to see the mass and that he has written this to you; I am sending his letters, which he gave me to send to you. Yesterday we finally heard that the Turk has reached the Neapolitan coast and has already devastated it; this is what those who come directly from Rome have asserted. We return your letters with great thanks; for it was useful for us to know this. When we hear anything from Italy, we will write the same to you. In the meantime, may the Lord Jesus keep you with us for a long time. Amen. From Chur, on the 25th of July, 1553. Comander, Heimius, and Tscherner greet you greatly, who were very delighted to see those letters. A rumor has also reached here that in the Piedmont region, our compatriots lost six banners in battle, but still won.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
