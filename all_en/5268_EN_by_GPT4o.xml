      <p>Greetings. I write nothing at present, reverend sir, except to express my desire to write nothing. For as I unexpectedly and beyond expectation make my way to Frankfurt, your son Christophorus, hurrying to the prince to whom he had been sent, carried with him to Marburg the letters you gave to me. Therefore, I do not have the opportunity to write, which I greatly desired, although I can neither conceal nor should I that I am so hindered by the noise of the fair that I can scarcely prepare myself to write. Many things are heard here; but since they often contradict each other and most are uncertain, who would think it worthwhile to report them to others far away, especially to those to whom men of the highest credibility write from all sides. I commend to your kindness, as much as I can, the one who delivers this, as he has lived with me most honorably for nearly three years and gives us good hope that he will be diligent even in the future. He has begun to exercise himself with us in the instruction of youth; but when his illustrious father recalls him, it is certainly most fair that he obeys, nor did I allow him to be bound to the school or the headmaster even for a short time. But if God wills, I will write to the reverend man at another time, both more extensively and more diligently.</p>
      <p>Do not take it badly that everything is now so confused; you yourself can easily judge what can be done accurately and decently by one who is everywhere opposed by the great noise of many, not allowing thoughts of the mind to rest and meditate, nor do I doubt that you will have heard enough from your Christophorus about all our affairs, which it is now expedient to mention, so that there is no need for me to add anything. I pray to God, the heavenly Father, that He may always keep and protect you safe with your whole household; I wish the same for all those who there with utmost faith and diligence undertake the labors of teaching both in the church and in the school. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt, in the greatest haste, on the 9th day of April 156[..]. Andreas Hyperius, as much as he is, yours.</p>
      <p>To the reverend man most excellent in piety and doctrine, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Zürich church, a master to be honored with all reverence. In Zürich.</p>
