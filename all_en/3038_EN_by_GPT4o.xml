      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis of Chur sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I am unknown to your kindness, most illustrious man, and likewise I do not know you by face, nevertheless your immense piety towards God, which you have uniquely demonstrated through so many commentaries and works published for the promotion of His glory, and your other most celebrated virtues, which shine from all sides, have moved me, with the encouragement of Mr. Philipp Gallicius, an excellent man and a very dear friend to both of us, to dare to greet you with these my writings, albeit briefly and as time constraints allowed, even though I am otherwise unknown to you, perhaps soon to be more known and, with God's favor, in person. Therefore, I greet you, the greatest man of our age in the exposition of sacred matters and one who has deserved exceedingly well of the Christian republic, again and again with these my letters, and I dedicate and devote myself entirely, however small I may be, to you, earnestly asking that you do not disdain to receive me into the number of your friends and those devoted to you. Furthermore, returning now from Venice, where I served as an envoy to the most illustrious Senate of Venice on behalf of my illustrious lords of the Three Leagues, it seemed worthwhile to inform you briefly of what I have been engaged in there. I was sent there to intercede for Francesco and Alessandro Bellinchetti, who are detained in prison in Bergamo for the sake of religion, and to obtain their liberation in whatever way it could best be achieved.</p>
      <p>And although I used all diligence and means suitable for such a business, nevertheless I labored in vain, since both the governors of Bergamo, whom I first approached, and subsequently the entire Senate of Venice responded to me that the authority to liberate those detained for religion pertains to the supreme pontiff by an agreement recently made with him, and that they themselves can in no way and ought not to put a sickle into another's harvest. Therefore, with the matter unfinished, I returned quickly to inform my illustrious lords of the situation, so that they may not neglect to bring aid again to those laboring for the evangelical truth and placed in extreme danger, since I at least achieved that those brothers detained have not yet been subjected to any questioning or tortured and that help can still be provided to them from somewhere in due time. Therefore, tomorrow some distinguished men from the Three Leagues will convene here to consult on what further should be done for the salvation of those brothers. May the Lord God deign to enlighten their minds so that they do everything that will contribute to His glory and the salvation of the imprisoned.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I have learned the following news from Venice: the Duke of Alba has led his army, which consists of 40,000 men, to the city of Rome and is not more than 7 Italian miles away from there, and he has also occupied some significant places, with the protestation, however, that he holds them in the name of the Roman See, and that whenever another pope is elected who also shows due honor to the Emperor, he will then restore those places to the Roman See. The Venetians have sent an envoy to the Duke of Alba, instructing him to dissuade him from his undertaking with sound persuasions, and if he cannot, then he should protest in the name of the Venetian Republic that it will not fail to defend and protect the Roman Church.</p>
      <p>With us, everything is quite peaceful. Would that we could enjoy this peace for as long as possible! I fear, however, that it may change sooner than it should. For there is a growing rumor that the King of France will request soldiers from us; where he intends to lead them is unknown. It is also rumored that Ottavio Farnese has set out for Milan, and all sensible people assert that he did not do this before he returned to the Emperor's favor. And these are indeed the news of new matters that I could share with you.</p>
      <p>It will not be ungrateful to you if I also inform you of the articles for which the Bellinchetti brothers are accused of heresy.</p>
      <p>I will report the main ones. First, they deny that there are more than two sacraments, namely baptism and the Lord's Supper; second, they deny any purgatory other than Christ; third, they deny that we are bound to confess to anyone other than God, and thus they abolish auricular confession; fourth, they assert that there is no mediator between God and men other than Christ, and therefore they abolish the invocation of saints; fifth, they are vehemently accused of destroying the sacrament of the altar by not confessing that the solid and material body and blood of Christ exist in it; sixth, and in which they are most strongly refuted, so much so that this is the hinge of the whole matter, they deny the authority of the supreme pontiff. The remaining articles, for which they are also troubled, are very similar to the aforementioned. You see, most pious Bullinger, how impiously Christian piety is attacked. But God will also put an end to these things, although now it has begun to rage more cruelly against the faithful.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God deign to restrain the desires of the impious to His praise.</p>
      <p>Finally, so that our friendship may not grow without a private duty conferred upon me, I wish you to know that I have an only little son, eleven years old, whom - because he will be, God willing, the staff of my old age and the stronger the more he is adorned with good morals, letters, and finally pious teachings - I wish to be liberally and piously imbued from his earliest years. I had therefore decided to bring him to the city of Zurich, provided a good patron can be found who will support the boy and in the meantime also diligently teach him the grammatical foundations; (for you know how necessary it is not to neglect tender age in these matters). Therefore, most illustrious man, I ask that out of your kindness you deign to write to me whether you advise that the boy should be brought there. You will also do a favor to my father-in-law, Mr. Johann Travers, a man indeed incomparable for his distinguished virtues and who, as I have learned, loves and reveres you greatly. Relying therefore on your singular kindness, I eagerly await your response with open arms.</p>
      <p>Farewell, the chief glory and ornament of Switzerland, and always keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, October 22, 1556.</p>
