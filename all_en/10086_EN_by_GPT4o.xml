      <p>Peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Since all my hopes are placed in you, a most learned and sincere man, I have taken the liberty to pour out my sorrow to you, not doubting that you will forgive me if I have erred unwillingly. For God also willingly overlooks the faults of those who approach Him with trust.</p>
      <p>Behold, my dearest teacher, how I am detained by cunning delays. Before I had prepared for my journey there, the magistrates of Altst채tten promised their diligence so that upon my return I would have nothing to do but receive my salary and depart with my affairs settled. But the opposite has happened. They are creating new delays for me. Meanwhile, they invent things that are not true. Although the envy of the Voglers attacks, it is I who suffer the loss. Therefore, my return will be slower than I would wish or is expedient. But I implore you, most pious man, by Christ, to keep the minds of the patrons in their duty and, if necessary, to soothe them, especially so that you, through your prudence, may take it well. I do not write this as if I think my presence would be of any benefit, but so that I am not deprived of your goodwill. If you felt the cunning of those by whom I am oppressed, you would undoubtedly pity me and mine, and be angry at their trickery. Nor do I consider the greatest loss to be on the side where I gradually spend my due salary, but that I must be absent from your sermons and lectures. I entrust, commend, and dedicate myself to you, the greatest of men.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. Greet your father and wife.</p>
      <p>Given at Altst채tten, on the 16th day of January, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Yours, Karlstadt.</p>
      <p>Heinrich, my neighbor born and raised in Zurich, sincerely wishes you well. His integrity and knowledge please me greatly. He has asked me to commend him to you, although he himself could have done so more politely and better, and I need a recommender.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the first and greatest ecclesiastical teacher of Zurich, most beloved.</p>
