      <p>The letter has neither head nor tail, otherwise it should be nothing, and the paper flows.</p>
      <p>The bishop and chapter of Basel have pledged the lordship of Erguel to my lords of Biel for 7000 crowns, which they have paid them, so that now all tithes, taxes, fines, and all dues that the bishop had here and in the mentioned lordship belong to my lords.</p>
      <p>They have nothing more to do with the bishop, etc. He will also no longer appoint a mayor here, to whom one has always had to swear in the bishop's name. All of that is over, and the people of Biel will themselves elect and appoint a mayor, who will manage everything in the city and country, and this was brought about by the old lord Peter Fuchs, which is a great advantage and benefit for the common city. And therefore, last Wednesday, the mentioned lord P[eter] Fuchs was elected to the mayor's office by the council and citizens (despite the fact that he was a priest, which one seeks in such evil). Praise be to the dear God, may it be a good hour, grant him much grace, spirit, and strength, so that he (as we hope) accomplishes much good! I could not keep it from you, so that you know to wish him luck as your good friend and supporter. His wife has given birth to a beautiful daughter, she is recovering from childbirth. The man is thriving and is lively, though almost beyond his means. May the dear God strengthen him and keep him for the good of this city for a long time! It would be desirable and worth giving something for him to be younger and more capable; but the worries, the unrest of the office along with the young wife will be too much for him. But we will ask the Lord to keep him for a long time.</p>
      <p>My lords have promised help from Bern, as soon as they need it. The new bishop will come here himself next week."</p>
      <p>The TÃ¼bingen school is gradually dissolving due to the rampant plague there. Frechtus hopes to return to his people in Ulm, also called by them, who seem to be contemplating a religion worthy of Christ anew, which I wish they would do with more steadfast minds than before! Frechtus would also like some pious and learned men from the Swiss to be sent to him as colleagues, but such who do not abhor the Augsburg Confession; but, lest anything else hinder, you know, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, how scant the furnishings of these churches of Christ are among the Swiss, so that they scarcely have as much as the extreme necessity of faithful ministers demands, not to mention that, even if they had many of such, none would easily allow themselves to be subjected to the inconstancy of the people of Ulm.</p>
      <p>They have not once, by being too wise, acted so foolishly, while they have miraculously tried to retain the grace of Christ and the Emperor at the same time, turning in all directions so that nothing would have to be risked for the sake of the gospel, and balancing themselves in such a way that, however the dice of these movements in our Germany might fall, they would fall with no danger to themselves.</p>
      <p>But if now the mind is to seriously conduct the business of Christ, there is indeed reason to congratulate them, attributing all this to divine kindness.</p>
      <p>All friends greet you honorably, especially the elder Mr. Jacob, Funclius, your dearest colleague. Fuchsius, the consul, does not know that I am writing to you; otherwise, he would greet you most diligently. May your house be well, which mine greets most lovingly in Christ. Pray for us, my soul, as much as you can, assiduously and diligently.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware, I suppose, of that audacious deed of Sarcerius, who, having called together some bishops of the churches to himself, anathematizes all, more or less 30 or 40, who think differently from him about the Lord's Supper, being in turn excommunicated by them, with the censures of both parties published publicly.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you have received Calvin's writing from him, which he also took care to have delivered to me, at which I will be very surprised if there are still those to whom his brief and clear explanation has not sufficed.</p>
      <p>May your esteemed colleagues and school professors, Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, Zwingli, Lavater, etc., be greeted most reverently and dutifully, to whose holy prayers I commend myself as diligently as I can.</p>
      <p>At this very moment, I receive letters from Theodor Beza, the most learned professor of the Lausanne school, with his booklet on punishing heretics by the magistrate, who writes at the end:</p>
      <p>"The Emperor is raging in Picardy as much as he can; the king opposes him strongly; on both sides, there are great slaughters and fires. In Italy, the state of the Sienese is most miserable. The king cannot bring aid because of the winter storms; the Duchess of Ferrara, the aunt of King Henry, is held in custody for the gospel, which she has asserted strongly. In France, nothing is more frequent than the burnings of the faithful. Yet hear something joyful: In the domain of Ferrette, the town of St. Mary, in which there are silver mines, has embraced the gospel by the will of the Prince of Rapperswil. The citizens of that city have sent to us to ask that we send them a learned and prudent man to govern their church. We have chosen and sent, as they desire, a man of remarkable piety and learning, who had just returned to us, thinking of nothing of the sort, but chosen and set apart by the Lord himself for this task, as I hope. Therefore, since that city is on the very borders of Germany and Lorraine, in a convenient place to receive miserable exiles, I hope that the kingdom of Christ will also be expanded there. May the Lord make it so!" etc.</p>
      <p>Thus far Beza, whose booklet I have not yet had time to inspect, which you perhaps have already inspected and read. Recently, the most learned young man was here with the most learned and holy Mr. Viret, in whom I could not help but admire and adore Christ Jesus in their exceptional gifts, in whom I bid eternal farewell. November 11.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Forgive me; you see the absorbent paper and everything written in haste.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a venerable and most delightful friend.</p>
