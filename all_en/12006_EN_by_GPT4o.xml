    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter from July 22 [No. 1945] and the opportunity to send a reply to Martin Hentius [to Kronstadt in Transylvania]. Although it would be desirable that the events reported by Myconius regarding the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] actually occurred as reported, it seems unlikely that the wise bishop had the citizens take up arms - Bullinger knows the people of Cologne and knows how rebellious they are -; however, this does not mean that he doubts Myconius' credibility. Bullinger is not yet familiar with the decision on the Peace of Religion, which the Brunswick [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel] opposes, and would like to see it; he also asks for news from France and the Netherlands, but has nothing to report from Italy or Hungary himself. He sends a small book ["The Old Faith"], which [by Diethelm Keller] has been translated into Latin in places not quite successfully.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, my esteemed Myconius, written on July 22. In it, you first indicate the way to send what I wish to Mr. Martin Heintz. I am very pleased with that, and I thank you and ask you to diligently take care of the present matters.</p>
      <p>What you write about Cologne is certainly plausible. How I wish it were so! But there are some things that seem a little unlikely, namely, that the very wise prince ordered the citizens of the city, already sufficiently divided and hostile with the most bitter factions, to stand with arms, and that the prince himself ordered these to go to these parts, and those to those parts. For what else would this be than to set the citizens against each other? But the Cologne senate also seems to be more malicious than to have given the gathered people to the bishop, especially since they could have thought that this bean would be pounded on their own head. I know the people of Cologne; they are so inclined to seditions as no other. I truly believe that these things have been written to you by friends, but I indicate what makes me doubtful, so that, since you wrote that I do not believe what you say, you understand that I do not doubt your faith at all, but sometimes I am uncertain about the matter that is indicated to you and to me.</p>
      <p>I have not seen the opinion on the Peace of Religion, against which the Brunswick opposes, and unless it is troublesome for you, I would like to see it. If you have anything further from France and the Lower Germany, let me know. I have nothing from Italy or Hungary.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a small book, not indeed rendered most successfully in all respects, but still sufficiently so.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his beloved brother.</p>
