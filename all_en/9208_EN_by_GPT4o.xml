      <p>Greetings. The Hospinian cousins came to us, one of whom is your niece through your daughter Margareta of blessed memory, and they brought us the dedication of the commentaries by Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law, on the books of Chronicles. If we could have received and treated them as was fitting, we would have gladly performed our duty; but both my poor health and other inconveniences of this time have prevented our actions from matching our intentions. However, they will kindly consider our efforts.</p>
      <p>Regarding the dedication itself, I hear it was received with applause by the senate, although some were less generous than those who have the primary authority would have liked. I know how those who do not understand letters feel about such matters. Nevertheless, Steiger diligently provided his assistance to them. As for your letters, I sent them along with all the news and also Mr. Erastus's letters to Mr. Steiger. After reading everything, he met with me today and discussed almost everything; I particularly asked him about the Spaniards stationed at Lake Lario (as Erastus writes), whether they are not concerned about this, etc. He tells me that the lords are well aware of this and are keeping an eye on it, but they cannot do anything as long as they do not move or it is not yet known what they are planning or where they are to be led. Furthermore, regarding what the same writes about our Quinquepagans having sent a delegation to the pope to offer their services for the eradication of heretics, he replied that this had already been indicated to the lords some time ago; but Mr. Consul von MÃ¼linen seriously discussed this matter with the Urian bailiff at the Baden Diet, who denied and repeatedly denied it; however, it is confirmed that they have submitted to the Council of Trent and wish to consistently uphold it within their borders; but as for causing any trouble to others outside their borders, they have promised no one and will never do so. And the aforementioned bailiff has confirmed this again in writing since that time. Therefore, Mr. Steiger ordered me to respond to you about these matters as well. As for the remaining news, similar things are reported here as well. The people of Strasbourg wrote to ours not long ago about many such things, among which was also this: that the pope, with the college of cardinals, is trying to canonize Cardinal Lorraine and the mother of the King of France for their outstanding actions in France. That Alba died on January 13th, Beza also wrote here, but subsequent events have shown these to be false. We have not yet heard anything here about the death of the king's brother or about Montmorency, who is said to have gone to La Rochelle. As for Belliure, he is increasingly confusing and discrediting himself; for no one can tolerate his impudence. His efforts for the Genevans have come to nothing. On the 5th, they did not achieve anything; with this, Freiburg and Solothurn are also withdrawing; it is, if God wills, their fortune. They have been here for days and have negotiated with my lords on how to conduct themselves towards each other in all matters, should they need any assistance; it still depends on their response.</p>
      <p>Beza indeed writes that hardly a twentieth of the French are in our parts compared to the number who are with them; but I will ensure that you understand from our letters how true this is. Indeed, many were in Geneva; but the majority have returned to France. If the people of Schaffhausen or others contribute anything more, I would wish them to use the advice of ours in this matter; for, as I wrote before, whatever falls into this abyss or Charybdis will not easily emerge again.</p>
      <p>I return your writings to Belliure and will keep them for myself; it is surprising if his conscience is not severely struck; but perhaps he does not yet feel the weight of such a sin, which will awaken in due time.</p>
      <p>We had already received Mr. Gwalther's learned and elegant poem about that new and unusual star from Vinsler of Biel; nevertheless, I thank you for also sending it to us.</p>
      <p>I saw from the drafts what your work on the persecution of the church will be like, which we eagerly wish to have soon, and I pray to the Lord to keep you safe and sound for a long time for his church and for all of us, so that, aided by your works and gifts, we too may fulfill our parts in the Lord's church to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Mr. Steiger sends you his most earnest greetings, as does my father-in-law, the treasurer Manuel. Gravenriet is away from the city; I do not know whether Diesbach is present or not. Greet Mr. Gwalther, Simler, your son Heinrich, and all your family, as well as ours, in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 20, 1573.</p>
      <p>I have attached to this some letters of Satan to the King of France, fabricated by I know not whom, which, although I do not like such writings, God sometimes extracts from Balaam's donkey. After you have read them, return them, so they do not come into the hands of anyone else through us/you(?).</p>
      <p>Yours as always, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
