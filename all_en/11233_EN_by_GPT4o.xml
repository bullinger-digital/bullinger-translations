    <p xml:id="regest1">Wishes him protection from the plague that is raging in his house. Thanks him for what he did for Gwalther, and sends him the money that Gwalther owed him upon departure; asks him to forward a letter and a cap to Strasbourg and to report what he knows about him. The council has made the abbess's house available for the scholarship holders; Rhellikan is their teacher and lives in the same house as once [Wolfgang] Mangolt, while Ammann [Bartholomäus] Köchli takes care of their provision as the administrator. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hear, most learned Myconius, that it is greatly distressing that the plague has entered your house and is raging more cruelly. May the Lord, who rescued Daniel from the lions' den and preserved His people from the plagues while they were in Egypt, also deliver you, His servant, and keep you safe for the benefit of His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>For those benefits you bestowed upon Gwalther on my behalf, I give you the greatest thanks. May the Lord Jesus be your reward. He wrote to me recently, when he was leaving you, and indicated that he owed you a gold coin, which he asked me to pay you.</p>
      <p>You therefore have 15 Constance coins. If the Lord grants life to a man, I do not think it will be ungrateful to you. I have added letters and a cap wrapped in paper; I beg you, as soon as it is possible, to send them to Strasbourg, and if you have any information about him, what he is doing, with whom he is staying, and how he is faring, please share it with me. I have no new matters to write to you about now, except that our council has entrusted the very spacious and beautiful house of the abbess to be inhabited by their scholarship holders. Rhellikan, a learned and diligent man, has been appointed as their teacher. He lives behind the church in that house, which the scribe of blessed memory, Mangolt, once inhabited. Ammann Köchli provides for all their sustenance and acts as the administrator. The students have no business except with their studies. And thus, it seems that the studies and the students are well provided for.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 30th October 1538.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers, especially Gast, Wissenburg, Bersch, Carolstadt, Batt, and the others. My mother and wife wish your wife well.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
