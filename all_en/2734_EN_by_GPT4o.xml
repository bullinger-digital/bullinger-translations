      <p>S. D. P. A few days after I sent my letter to you, most illustrious man, to Frankfurt, I also received yours dated the 20th of September. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to convey this now in at least a few words. However, I am sorry to hear about your affected health and the constant headaches, which you say trouble you greatly. This age, so many labors endured without interruption over so many years, not only weakens strength but gradually breaks it completely. But the heavenly Father will undoubtedly turn whatever discomfort there is to good. Certainly, the sermon you sent me, titled "On the Salvation of Believers," abundantly proves that nothing of the gifts of the spirit in you has diminished, but rather that all are daily rendered more abundant and illustrious. Where the spirit becomes more vigorous and that spirit of the Lord exerts itself so powerfully, there the weakness of the body can be borne with a more equanimous mind. I truly give the greatest thanks I can for that sermon, not so much because it came from you and I know it was sent to me with a benevolent mind, but because I feel my own spirit wonderfully strengthened by its reading.</p>
      <p>As for your son Heinrich Bullinger, I hear he has departed from Frankfurt directly to Wittenberg; however, if he happens to come to Marburg, I will make sure that he can never say he missed any courtesy from me; I will receive him into my home and, as much as possible, I will gladly provide for him. I will ensure that the letters to Mr. Johann Lening are delivered to Molosingen as soon as possible. Farewell. Hastily. Marburg, September 23, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
