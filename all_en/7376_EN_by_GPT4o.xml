      <p>S. D. I have nothing worth mentioning at the moment to write about.</p>
      <p>I received your letters and what you included with them. I hear of no battle committed between the king and the prince. One of our messengers comes up from Strasbourg, saying that there is talk that the prince and the Germans came together at Pont-à-Mousson at the end of the year 1567, and that the prince paid them for 3 months, and no one has seen a more beautiful army, etc.</p>
      <p>There is also talk that the Prince of Orange, along with the exiled Dutch counts and lords, is preparing to march strongly against the Spaniards in Brabant. And as I write this, letters come to me with the content: The Germans have joined the prince, and it is said by many that all the cavalry has become 18,000. It is said that Margrave Philibert fell to the king with 100 horses; likewise, Duke Hans Wilhelm, the Ruiner, of Saxony gathers 2400 horses for the king, and since the king is not well off financially, he has made a start and departure from his own. The other princes are very dissatisfied with this. The army from Languedoc, Dauphiné, and Provence has divided into two camps; one lies at Valence to guard the land and watch over Lyon.</p>
      <p>The other is led by Mouvans to Orléans, and when he came to the river Allier, the king's forces were there, which he drove away with a defeat, and many people perished; he is now at Orléans. Also, there is great hope for peace in the negotiations. The terms of peace were sent to me included in the aforementioned letters, but written in French, namely what the king demands, what the prince in return, what is responded to and repeated on both sides. I have already sent them to Mr. Cellarius, so that he may translate them into German, perhaps I will send them to you in eight days, etc.</p>
      <p>I sincerely wish for peace and pray to the Lord that no treachery is plotted under the pretext of peace; meanwhile, nothing is more important than peace.</p>
      <p>Greet the three lords consuls, Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all the pious ones. Farewell. I wrote this in great haste. January 23, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours, as always.</p>
      <p>My Aernius from Altdorf sends you his most friendly greetings.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
