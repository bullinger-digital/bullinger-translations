      <p>S. Regarding the matters that took place at the Baths, I was informed by Mr. Habius, the consul, through his very friendly letters, to whom I earnestly request you to express my gratitude in my name and also on behalf of our senate. We are not seeking these things out of mere curiosity in such critical times, and it is of no small interest to us to know the disposition of the princes towards the Swiss. For there is no kingdom, no dynasty in almost all of Christian Europe, to which our people do not reach with their negotiations. From this, it is easy to infer how greatly those who continue to be faithful in advising can benefit our republic, not to mention that our people also do not neglect any duty in advising and indicating (if they deem it necessary). However, I am nevertheless grieved and quite displeased that this excellent man was very untimely rebuked by one of our own because of the acts of the assembly, which he requested to be returned to him without being ordered and without a mandate, as if such a great man should be at the service of anyone and should be involved in such deceitful and cunning negotiations, who could nevertheless be accused of betraying secrets by slanderers if they were as prone to speak as some would wish them to be. However, the excellent man thought he would do a favor to our senate if he brought something that was indicated to him by such a great man, and he was completely unaware that the care of this matter had been entrusted to others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will ask the consul not to take it amiss, as it was done with good intentions by that man. Moreover, I was instructed by the senate itself to express gratitude to your Humanity. We will not be ungrateful for your benevolence; but if we cannot reciprocate equally, we will at least return gratitude for our perpetual friendship and alliance.</p>
      <p>You have also previously warned about the people of Bern. Indeed, those who continue to be so curious and disturb the churches with great harm without examining the Scriptures with the diligence they should, deserve punishment.</p>
      <p>Philip's response is full of disdain. He acknowledges Maurice himself, but I think he would prefer John Frederick. Even in such a disgraceful state of affairs, the pens of learned men tend to grow cold. The example sent to me from Augsburg contains a little more than yours; I thought it should be sent to you for comparison.</p>
      <p>I have delivered the lease of Lady Blarer to Junker Jacob Rordorf; it is 5 florins in currency at 15 Constance batzen and for each gulden a Bohemian, as they are supposed to give for the gulden in gold, namely 63 kreuzers, and pay annually. I believe they will be satisfied.</p>
      <p>There is only a rumor that our clergy are conducting negotiations overseas and dealing with them, so that the cities of the Confederation, which are located in the district of the Bishop of Constance, should be forced to accept the mediation of the Emperor with swift threats and warnings, and the Bishop of Constance finally intends to recover his jurisdiction of spiritual administration everywhere and that His Imperial Majesty is absolutely determined that restitution should first be made to the bishops, abbots, and other swarms of today's monasticism, and then also that their brought jurisdiction should not be taken away, especially in ecclesiastical matters and the confirmation of priests, etc.</p>
      <p>The secular nobility should also be involved, etc. This may be true or not: but as I consider all matters and am well aware of the hatred and intentions of these fellows (concerning our holy religion), I must believe there is something to it. I mention this now so that you may consider the counterplay and, in case of need, be better able to help and advise us and others. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the sixth day before the calends of June, in the year 1548. The people of Ravensburg have granted leave to their preacher, located between two monasteries, Weingarten and Weissenau, and have been summoned to Augsburg to appear on the 28th of May.</p>
