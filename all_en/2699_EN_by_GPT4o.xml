      <p>To Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Trusting in your piety and humanity, most pious and learned Philipp, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, I send to you my son Heinrich, and through him, I implore you, our lord, to be a father to him, and to receive him into your house, for sustenance and protection. I will pay you what is fair and what others of his peers have paid you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I bind myself to you and yours, and offer all our services in return: But if it is not at all convenient for you to receive him into your house, at least be willing to assist him, and be a good advisor, so that he may find an honorable or holy host, and that you may meanwhile take his patronage. He will be a burden to no one, he will be troublesome to no one, he will contend with no one. He will live for himself, God, and letters. He follows you, he chooses you as his teacher and wishes to listen. I desire that he may be able to conduct himself peacefully among you and learn both good and pious letters. For I have dedicated him to God and good letters.</p>
      <p>If you strive with me to dedicate him to God and letters, you know you will receive a reward from our living Lord and God.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you will completely bind me and mine to you and yours. Our dearest brother Calvin writes diligently about all matters from time to time. For this reason, I am brief, knowing you are occupied with many things. I send to your piety three German sermons which I published this year and the last, and the last one especially against the Schwenkfeldians. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time in soul and body for his most afflicted church. The brothers and fellow ministers greet you. Zürich, August 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, yours sincerely.</p>
