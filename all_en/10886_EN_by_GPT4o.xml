    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letters [No. 841 and No. 843] and expresses concern about the discord among the Swiss Confederates. This could, as letters from W端rttemberg and Esslingen and a remark heard years ago suggest, be used as a pretext for intervention by Emperor Charles [V] and [King] Ferdinand [I]. The peasants, who are setting out from the regions along the Rhine, are also making threats; however, perhaps divine punishment can still be averted. Even if the church order of the W端rttembergers raises concerns, it is said that they live more faithfully [than the Swiss Confederates] according to the Gospel. In Strasbourg, too, the Swiss and their doctrine of the sacraments are held in poor regard by some people. The leader of the newly emerged Anabaptists has gone there; Myconius has informed members of the council about the matter. Congratulates [Hans Rudolf] Lavater [on his election to the council]. [The people of Valais] accuse [King Francis I] of having become Lutheran. The [Wittenberg] convent and the Turkish threat also trouble Myconius. Asks Bullinger to advocate for a better position for Konrad Gessner; he can still be of great use to Zurich. Myconius and [Grynaeus] will take care of Johannes Fries. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. At least I find solace in the fact that you share my feelings about the current turmoil and equally grieve over the misfortunes, and that we should consider God as our only refuge in these matters. Whoever has God does not fear adversity. Praise and glory be to Him, for He so faithfully visits His people in tribulation through His help. I truly thank you, because by writing, you always fill me with things that are either useful or worthy of knowing. The steadfastness of your people greatly delights me; it is also very useful to know about the discord among the Five Cantons, although I derive little pleasure from it, as I foresee common misfortune for us because of it. For, as you know, there is discord among the Swiss because of faith, discord also because of the gold of the princes, discord concerning the sound understanding of Scripture; here indeed the Anabaptists disagree with us. What good do you think will come from so many kinds of discord?</p>
      <p>Recently, letters came from W端rttemberg threatening war against the Bernese from the emperor. While I write this, letters come to me from Esslingen, which state: "The people of Basel are so dear to me that I would gladly wish that they, through the means, as I hear, they have acquired, might escape the future punishment and misfortune that God will surely send upon a confederation." Therefore, we must expect this, not what they threaten, but what we deserve. Twenty years ago, I heard from Rotterdam about Charles and Ferdinand, who expect nothing from us but an opportunity. And unless the French or the Turks call them elsewhere, war and destruction are at our doorstep due to the offered opportunity of discord. I know what the French are like; nevertheless, I also know how hostile the Spaniard is towards Switzerland, the Bohemian towards the Zurichers, both against the Gospel.</p>
      <p>For almost eight days now, farmers have been setting out daily with banners from Sundgau, Alsace, Breisgau, the four small towns on the Rhine, from the margrave's domain in such numbers that they can be compared to flies. They boast: "If fortune favors us, we will not return home unless we have occupied the Swiss." Whenever I consider this tumult, I find no rest until I turn to the Lord. Meanwhile, we are idle; I would rather be very busy, crying out to the Lord day and night from the heart, insisting on good counsel, living in the fear of God, lest the enemy overtake us unprepared. But what do we accomplish by wishing? Let us, who are in charge of the word, do what is our part, by example and exhortations; who knows, perhaps we may find God to be placable?</p>
      <p>However, whatever we may feel about the W端rttemberg church order, someone reproaches us through letters that they have found another Gospel among them than among us; the people are so diligent in hearing the word, so kind in helping the poor - but from church goods -, so dutiful towards the preachers of the Gospel. Therefore, they also threaten that misfortune is impending upon us because of our ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Some people from Strasbourg accuse us of being insane about the sacraments of the Lord. The name Swiss is so odious to foreigners that even the most sincere Gospel, which we preach, becomes tainted to them. How could it be that they do not see the clearest thing? But that affection makes them completely blind. Therefore, unless we belong to God, we are abandoned by all.</p>
      <p>The leader of the new Anabaptists has gone down to Strasbourg. I have explained the whole matter to certain members of the council. I hope that whatever it is, it will turn out well.</p>
      <p>I congratulate Lavater and all the pious and wish that this dignity may benefit the state of the Zurich republic and the Gospel.</p>
      <p>I have written the truth about the people of Valais. I could add much more if there were time. I add one thing to relieve you somewhat: They pursue the French with great hatred because he has become Lutheran, from which you can easily understand whether they incline towards the Bernese or the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>The convent and the Turkish threat, about which you write, affect me equally.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I would like you to consider, my dear Bullinger, how badly you are doing by allowing Gessner's talent to be wasted in the literary school. It is such that I truly admire it, and all who know it, the learned, admire it. He was here a few days ago, he had gone out for herbs with some doctors, Grynaeus accompanying him along with many others; but there was no one who did not speak ill of the Zurichers for allowing that uncultivated talent. You see where it is heading, and it has already progressed to the point that in a few years it could benefit the city and be an honor. You, as a spectator of talents, will persuade a few, if you wish, to help him. It truly pains me that in such a scarcity of excellent talents, it is not otherwise nurtured. With this, I urge you to consider the good that could arise from it if it is cultivated, and the ruin if it is thus neglected.</p>
      <p>We will have Fries recommended in your name.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with your wife and children and our Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 16, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, evangelist of the Zurichers, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
