      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear sirs and brothers, after you have been informed by me in writing and orally about how my lord bailiff of Sargans is treating me, you should know that he has now, on the second Sunday before Christmas, imposed a ban on me by order of his lords, the authorities, namely, that I should now completely cease preaching until the next day when the lords of the seven places come together and bind me with a final, legally binding document. Therefore, my earnest request to you, as before, is that you be diligent in ensuring that my benefactors and patrons, the community of Wartau, are also heard. It will then be well discovered whether I have kept the peace or not. Also, please try to have the ban lifted from me.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to the Lord Sadai, to whom alone be honor and glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Wartau, on the second day of the Lord's week, the second before the birth of the Lord in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Jakob Hewer, minister of the church in Wartau.</p>
      <p>To the pious servants and evangelists of the church in Zurich, Leo Jud and Heinrich Bullinger, my dear sirs and brothers.</p>
