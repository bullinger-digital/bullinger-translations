    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received well the letter from Bing dated November 10 [not received] with its enclosure [No. 2666] sent via Heinrich Thomann's dispatch and thanks him for being included in the circle of Bing's friends and confidants due to his simple [first] letter [not received]. Bing can also be assured of Bullinger's friendship. Additionally, Bullinger thanks for the war reports painstakingly prepared by Bing, which extend up to October 30.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Thanks be to God, who has so far protected the Christian army from the Antichrist! May God continue to assist [the Schmalkaldic League], weaken the enemy, and end the war through the death of [Charles V], the Pharaoh-like Julian and Maxentius. However, one must not prescribe anything to God but must patiently wait for His grace and ask Him for wisdom and assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger thanks from the heart for the kind treatment of Thomann, who reports much good about the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and Bing. The latter should continue to take care of Thomann.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger and Gwalther send greetings to Doctor [Johann] Meckbach.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Yesterday evening, Bing's letter from November 21 [No. 2688] also arrived. It is evident from this that the letter from Bullinger [on November 5] addressed to Bing, which was sent to the Augsburg city clerk Georg Frölich for forwarding, was well received, although without the planned report [not received]. Bullinger assumes that it was held up in Constance with Ambrosius Blarer but has now been delivered to Bing. In case this has not happened, Bullinger encloses a copy of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The news transmitted by Thomann will probably be seen by Bullinger today. He himself has nothing new to report, except for the convening of a meeting in Baden on Sunday, December 5.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bing should continue to inform about the most important events, in the same manner as he did for the events that occurred between August 31 and October 30. Bullinger's interest in the exact course of history explains why he desires this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger recommends himself [to the Landgrave and the Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony], for whom he will always stand up (even if it would be to his disadvantage). Greetings to Theobald Thamer and to all who are well-disposed towards Bullinger.</p>

      <p>My very willing service, friendly greetings, and whatever I can offer you in honor, love, and goodness, esteemed, pious, and wise, especially beloved lord and friend! I have received your friendly letter dated November 10, along with the enclosed copies, through the letters of my dear and good friend and fellow citizen Heinrich Thomann, properly and as expected. I express to you my sincere and profound thanks, firstly, for so willingly accepting me into the circle of your trusted and dear friends due to my simple letter and request. Therefore, you can be assured that I will, in turn, hold you in friendship and brotherhood as much as God grants me His grace. I also thank you for the effort and work of your diligent writing of the copies of the important deeds of this war up to October 30.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I also thank God, our Lord, from whom alone victory is given, that He has so far graciously preserved the Christian army against the tyrannical Antichristian power. We will continue to faithfully pray that He may further preserve us, take the heart from the enemy, break their strength and arm, and deal with us according to His honor and our salvation. The Lord, if He wills, might end this war through the death of the Pharaoh-like Julian and Maxentius. However, we will not prescribe anything to the Lord, but rather wait for His grace, asking for patience, wisdom, help, and support. He knows how to arrange and manage everything for His honor and our salvation in the best way. Fiat voluntas Dei (Thy will be done)!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>That you have so kindly entrusted Heinrich Thomann, who speaks very highly of my gracious prince and lord, the Landgrave, and especially of you, may the Lord, the rich rewarder of all good, grant you according to your heart's desire. If I could also show you gratitude, it would not be spared. I hope you will continue to be entrusted as you have been so far, according to your love and friendship.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>To the renowned and faithful Doctor Meggenbach, please convey my and my dear son Gwalther's friendly greetings and show him all love and service from us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>After your first letter, I also received your second letter, dated November 21, last night, from which I understood well that you received my letter, sent to Mr. Georg Frölich, city clerk in Augsburg, my dear lord and brother, but have not yet received the enclosed report of my gracious lords - I think it was held up in Constance with my dear lord and brother M. Ambrosius Blarer, but now it should have reached you. However, if that has not happened, I have enclosed another copy here for good measure. I ask you to take this as a friendly gesture from me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The new news written by Heinrich Thomann, I believe, will also be shown to me today. We have no new news, except that some places have requested a day to be set (which has also happened) in Baden on Sunday before St. Nicholas.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>With this, I entrust myself further to your love and friendship, kindly requesting that if anything noteworthy occurs, you will inform me of it in the same form and manner as I previously received the copies from August 31 to October 30. I desire this for the sake of the series and truth of history. I offer myself entirely willingly to your services.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I sincerely commend myself to my gracious princes and lords, whose welfare I desire from the heart and would gladly promote with all my best efforts, even at my own expense, if I could and it were possible for me. Greet Mr. Theobald Thamer, my dear brother in the Lord, and others who have love for me. Dated Zurich, November 26, 1546. Your always very willing Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious and wise Simon Bing, Hessian chamber secretary, currently in the camp of the Holy Roman Empire, his especially dear lord and good friend.</p>
