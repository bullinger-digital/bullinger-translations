      <p>Greetings. Regarding the rest, I will consult with you sufficiently. At present, due to my current labors, I will be brief. At the table, I received letters in which it was written in these words: "You have probably heard of the grand pomp with which the Emperor's son is to enter Milan on Christmas, not through any gate, but over a bridge already made, which crosses the walls." What do you think, my dear Bullinger, does this mean? It is a matter such as you have neither heard nor read about; I do not know whether the Lord wishes for me to see the end of such monstrous insolence with my own eyes; I see in my mind that it cannot last much longer. If you have heard anything about this, I beg you, let me know. O wretched us, who have deserved both the father's and the son's such enormous arrogance. What will the Pope here, what will the Frenchman think? The father and son have surely convinced themselves that they have surpassed all heights; now that insolent "further beyond" has a place among them. O Lord, have mercy on us at last and do not allow your word to be so impudently despised; show that it is yours, and that your enemies begin to fear it, so that your name may be sanctified forever and we miserable ones may become more sensible in enduring whatever must be endured for its confirmation. Amen.</p>
      <p>The one I commended to you, I did not commend otherwise than that you should act as it seems best and as much as you are able; moved by mercy, I acted thus; for I greatly fear his impudence (to hide nothing).</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Emperor will come again to Nuremberg. The people of Strasbourg are so broken that both the older and stronger ones almost all threaten to leave; I do not know what God will finally do with them.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, whose birth we celebrate today, with the brothers and all the pious, in the year 548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother and lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
