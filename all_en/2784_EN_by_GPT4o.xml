      <p>Greetings. If you are well, it is good; we indeed are all well, thanks to God. The plague has once again invaded the house of Comander; a second maid has been taken from him; but he himself and his family are healthy.</p>
      <p>The plague continues to frighten us, but rarely kills; the day before yesterday it visited the bishop's hall and took away his concubine; he himself, having left his castle, now inhabits a very humble house not far from our walls. The royal envoy here says that Siena is surrounded in two places by the armies of his king, so that nothing can enter or leave it. We also hear that the pope has been gathered to his fathers and has expired. Furthermore, I wish to know two things from you: first, whether the booksellers have the books, about which I wrote to you some time ago, or not; second, whether you have recently received the letters from Brother Julius of Milan concerning N. The brothers greet you, and especially Johannes Tscherner, who has now been elected consul. If there is anything you wish me to do or that would be good for us to know, write to this messenger. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord Jesus, most learned man, and do not cease to love your Philippus.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 9th day of December in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most worthy of all good things. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
