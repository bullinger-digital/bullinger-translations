      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord, be with you, venerable lord and father, with the offering of our entirely willing service at all times. It is a special joy for us to hear that you and other lords and brothers, your fellow workers in the service of the Lord, are fresh and healthy. We also have no doubt that you have heard with sorrow and compassion about the passing of Mr. Johann Valentin Fortm√ºller, our dearly beloved brother and our church's long-time faithful shepherd and pastor, which departure we feel keenly in these troubled times and especially in the face of the dying multitudes, as we are deprived of his strong help and comfort and are mostly old and otherwise weak and incapable, but must learn with harm to use the present graces and gifts of God with gratitude. May God graciously comfort us with the memory of this dear man. Therefore, we now come to you as our friendly lord and father with our writing, because it has come to our attention in these days that a decision or agreement is to be made at the upcoming assembly in Baden, to the effect that the preachers in the Rhine Valley should henceforth attend a venerable synod in Zurich; we do not know exactly whether this decision concerns only the preachers who are sent by a respectable and wise authority of the city of Zurich at the request of the churches in the Rhine Valley to proclaim God's word, so that they should not leave their synods in Zurich, but should visit them no less, or whether the church servants of the bailiwick in the Rhine Valley should generally appear only at the synods in Zurich, as it seems to be the case. And if this latter opinion were the case, we can well understand that this would happen for no other reason than out of true concern to prevent the scandalous conduct of disobedient servants and to abolish disorder. However, we are surprised that the Rhine Valley is now being drawn in, although the churches of the aforementioned bailiwick have long been provided with old and established respectable and decent servants, as our dearly beloved brother Mr. Hans Koller knows well, except that after the return of the preacher from Bern, Mr. Michel, to Bern, a rumor arose that did not please us. The one who is now in Balgach is still young, and whatever was lacking here, if he were to stay (since he has taken leave), could easily be improved. What concerns us in the name of our common synod in such a matter, we do not want to withhold from you our brief friendly opinion. Until now, longer than anyone might suspect, even before in the papacy, a synod has been held annually in the city of St. Gallen, assembled by the surrounding authorities, namely the churches of the land of Appenzell, the abbey of St. Gallen, the Upper Thurgau and Rhine Valley bailiwicks, and also the city of St. Gallen. However, since the division of religion could no longer tolerate the common aforementioned synod, a separation and division was made by Mr. Bailiff Hesse, who was then bailiff in the Rhine Valley, because the synod's income lay in the Rhine Valley, so that the preachers should have their own synod and the mass priests a separate one, and the income was divided equally between both parts, and as a record of such separation, the aforementioned bailiff Hesse gave letters and seals into our hands, which were later recognized as valid by the eight cantons at a day in Baden and also gave a record of it. Based on this, we have held an annual synod in the city of St. Gallen with the utmost zeal, seriousness, diligent censure, admonition, and punishment, and whatever might serve the promotion of God's word and the well-being of the church, as much as was possible for us and we had the authority, in which a respectable council and the entire community of the city have taken a special liking and have provided place and space, and also the mayors and council members have participated with the preachers, with Christian admonition always, that we want to be concerned with God's word and his service, and also the welfare of the church, etc.</p>
      <p>If now the synod were to be taken away from the Rhine Valley and the knot, as we are bound together, were to be untied, we cannot see how we could keep the churches in Thurgau in the same way, and it would follow that a praiseworthy synod would fall apart and take on a form as if we had abandoned it, and it would bring a diminution to the servants and their service with us and could not happen without offense and wonder. Therefore, our urgent request and desire would be that we be allowed to remain undivided with our synod according to the established records and that the gracious lords and superiors of the eight cantons would otherwise assist us with their authority in the bailiwicks to remove or bring to obedience such disobedient and scandalous, disgraceful servants, and according to a decision, stating: that every church servant should attend his synod and not be absent without valid reasons, and that the churches should hold their servants, who are excluded from the common synod and reported to the church because of their disgraceful deeds, no longer tolerate or bring to obedience, in which matter we have so far borne a lack, with undoubted hope that if the authorities with their help and action and we with our diligence and seriousness admonish and punish together, there would be no need for such a change and so many pious, respectable, old and faithful church servants, who have to travel a long way because of one or two disobedient, shameless heads, and otherwise the church's income is narrow and meager. In addition, an entire province of their servants stands free at least four days in all cases, who are otherwise in the neighborhood with us at home and therefore also from the church members, as a servant behaves and they against him, can be learned more conveniently than from those with whom we have daily dealings together, as you yourself can best judge. If then something is too difficult for us and we do not reach where we strive, we would always, as before, ask and call upon your authority for help and advice, so that proper teaching and discipline may be maintained. We hereby ask that you, as we trust, understand our careful writing in the best way and do not consider it a burden, briefly, and report to us in the most beneficial way, where and to which preachers the lords' intentions extend, whether perhaps (as mentioned above) it concerns only the envoys from Zurich as your special ones or the general preachers of the Rhine Valley, in which you will do us a special favor. We are always ready to serve and comply with your fatherly and brotherly love. Please convey our friendly greetings to all your fellow workers in the Lord, our dearly beloved lords and brothers. May the Lord God keep you and them in long life, to the praise of God and the good of the church of Christ. Let us and our church and community always be commended to God in your prayers, as we are now under the hand of God due to well-deserved guilt with the visitation of death (which has somewhat subsided); may He be gracious to us.</p>
      <p>On November 18, 1566. Your always willing servants in the word of the Lord, the church and community of the city of St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor in the city of Zurich, our beloved lord and father.</p>
