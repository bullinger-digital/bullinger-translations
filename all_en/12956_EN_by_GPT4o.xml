    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas received the letter addressed to him by Bullinger from Myconius and read it together with him. He does not want to go into it here, so as not to become excessive and spiteful. However, he gratefully takes Bullinger's admonition to heart. If God wills and it seems favorable, he plans to spend the Pentecost days in Zurich. He wants to see Bullinger again and talk with him. In this dire political situation, he also needs some cheer in the company of Bullinger's colleagues. Moreover, he would very much like to experience a Zurich communion service. How unpleasant is the state of man! He must endure many things that are more painful than death!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Basel, only the hopeless situation [of the Protestants] is reported. If God does not perform a miracle, the powers of this world are doomed! In such a situation, human military forces are of little use, indeed of no use at all. There is nothing left to do but pray. Whoever remains cold in this is surely made of stone. Enzinas is deeply shaken and prays to God with all his heart for deliverance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Myconius gave me and read your letters, to which I will not respond now, lest I enter into a too lengthy and unpleasant argument. I only say that the admonition of a friendly man was pleasing to me. If the Lord grants life and it is opportune, I will be with you during these holidays; for I wish to see you and discuss many matters with you, and it would be very necessary for me to find some cheer with the brothers in such great confusion of the republic; then also, I greatly desire to partake in the Lord's Supper, which I have not yet seen celebrated in your church. Such is the misfortune of human affairs, that many things happen to a man in life that are harder than death itself.</p>

      <p>Here in Basel, we hear daily that all is hopeless, so that unless God adds a broad resolution to the disturbed play from the machine, we think the ruin and decline of all empires is imminent. The defenses of men are weak or rather none at all. Therefore, we can help the faltering republic with nothing other than constant prayers, and yet, whoever is not deeply affected by such great calamities of the church, I would indeed consider not a human being, but rather made of marble. I groan with my whole heart and ask God with burning prayers for deliverance from such great evils.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all the brothers. Basel, May 23, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
