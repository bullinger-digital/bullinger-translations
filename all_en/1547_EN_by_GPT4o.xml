      <p>Most illustrious man, yesterday I came to Chur in the Grisons and I am not far from full health, by the grace of God. Today I received your letters, in which you express your gratitude to me at length for the trivial matters of Trent.</p>
      <p>I hope to send more shortly. I am thinking of coming to you, although the mention of the plague frightens me somewhat. Here, there are many matters of religion to be dealt with. Farewell and be well; a longer letter will follow. Comander, Galitius, and Ponticella, who are present while I write, greet you. Pray for me with the whole church. Chur in the Grisons, on the day of Paul (on which the papists fire cannons against us; the Lord will mock them) 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger.</p>
