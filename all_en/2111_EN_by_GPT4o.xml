      <p>Greetings. Indeed, most distinguished Zanchi, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, you adorn that little paper gift of mine sent to you by the most illustrious lord Coelius. I attribute this to your kindness and understand how much I owe to my God, who has joined you to me as a friend and brother. I rather thank you, who interpret my matters so kindly and receive me among yours with such a benevolent spirit. With God's favor, I will ensure that you never regret the friendship we have agreed upon. I commend this my son to you, my lord and brother, as a faithful teacher. Teach him faithfully to fear God and to know the mystery of redemption; for I have destined him for sacred uses, and you and the others can do nothing better for me than to instruct him purely. I do not despair of that friend of yours, indeed of mine as well. Good men are sometimes more stubborn in their accepted opinions, and they are more tractable with gentleness and calm instruction; therefore, continue to win him and others like him for the Lord.</p>
      <p>You now have as a colleague our incomparable Martyr, and I do not know if today Italy, France, and Germany have his equal. Try to retain him in your academy, indeed make it known to all what kind of man he is. He will be useful to many peoples and nations among you, and in the meantime, Strasbourg will gain immortal praise from him. Live and farewell eternally with your most chaste wife. All my colleagues wish to greet you. ZÃ¼rich, December 18, 1553. May the crown of your learned school be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Girolamo Zanchi of Bergamo, professor of sacred letters in Strasbourg, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
