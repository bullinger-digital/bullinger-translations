    <p xml:id="regest1">Is disappointed about the willingness of the Zurich arbitrators [Kaspar Nasal and Itelhans Thumysen] to negotiate at the assembly in Aarau with Solothurn about the restitution of the property of the [Brothers] Roggenbach and the other "bandits", instead of first - like the other envoys - insisting on the fulfillment of the promises made to the Protestants; the feud of the "bandits" was ultimately only a consequence of Solothurn's refusal to hold the promised disputation. A united appearance of the mediators could, as Myconius recently wrote, induce Solothurn to give in, likely enable the reintroduction of the evangelical service, and could also impress the opponents in other places. Bullinger should influence the council in this sense; there is no doubt about the support from Bern and Basel. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Certainly, it is regrettable that your envoys, who were recently in Aarau, acted differently regarding those captives than the delegations of the other cantons. For I hear that all agreed that the gospel should be restored to the good and pious people of Solothurn, as if by right of return, but your envoys argued for the restitution of the exiles' possessions. What kind of consultation is this, when everything they did before Roggenbach was done because of the promises of the Solothurn council concerning the evangelical faith, and especially concerning the truth or falsehood of the mass? For here letters and seals were given, stating that the people of Solothurn wanted to inquire about the truth of those matters through a public disputation from the word of God by the priests. However, this has never been done, and because of this, these disturbances have arisen. And among these very disturbances, when the public deliberation of the confederates was consulted about the goods and peace was decreed concerning them, the Roggenbachs, refusing to accept the foolish document by which they renounced peace, were compelled, not for any other reason, but to see if they could achieve by threats what they otherwise despaired of. And while these things were being acted upon in the councils, your envoys were also present. Therefore, it is a wonder to all good people what the reason is why the Zurichers wanted to act on these matters, which were all in vain at Roggenbach. For good men are not ignorant that, as soon as they would yield to the letters given, it would be over for them and the whole business. Therefore, they cannot act otherwise than they have decided. Hence, the plan and all the forces of the mediators must unanimously aim to ensure that the promises, which have been confirmed by letters, are kept. This can be done if there is constant and faithful unanimity among the mediators. Now all are unanimous except for yours. Therefore, it will be your duty and that of all good people to persuade the council diligently to agree with the others. In persuading, there seems to be no difficulty; they just need to be properly informed about what we have just mentioned. If what your envoys achieved in the Solothurn tumult is added to the service of the pious, it may not be useless. But the obstinacy of the Solothurners stands in the way, who are willing to act on temporary goods, even beyond what is requested, but not allowing a word about faith. I recently wrote what I know: Such a beginning would occur if they could find even one of the mediators who would interpret what they were doing with constancy, for then they would continue in their undertaking. Otherwise, they would seek a way to peace. Therefore, this must also be persuaded to your people. For I find prudent men who are in this, that the Solothurners can be brought here with firm constancy, so that in the town the church may be opened to evangelical preaching and freedom given to hear the word to anyone, in the way it was previously granted. What they think is not without reason. They have reasons to dare to say what I have mentioned, that there are ministers from whom they have conceived hope; provided the mediators are strong. But even if they are mistaken, and we with them, is it not fitting to use such constancy in divine matters? Should we not take all precautions, lest they complain about us, as they did recently, poor souls? Indeed, lest the pious say that nowhere is there less piety, mercy, constancy, and fortitude than in cities that are evangelical in name only. Indeed, lest our enemies say that these cities believe nothing less than what they profess. Hence, they become harder day by day, even themselves. Therefore, we should act in such a way, even if everything is in vain, as befits evangelical men. It is incumbent upon us, who preside over the word, to extend the dominion of Christ as much as we can, otherwise, we are not faithful ministers of the Lord. Why should the same not be incumbent upon secular leaders, especially when only words and constant prudence are needed here? Therefore, do what you can, my Bullinger, if perhaps the matter can be brought to this point, so that the exiles, along with the gospel and many pious people, may be considered, and some fear of us may be instilled in the adversaries, so that they do not always trample us underfoot. I hear all good things about Dumisio, only he understands the matter better. The Bernese will be bears; our people will support the cause most steadfastly. If you join, what then will be lacking for the good cause? Therefore, join, I pray through Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with your people and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
      <p>Your Myco.</p>
      <p>I cannot write with true seriousness how it is in my heart. You will interpret everything better and more precisely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
