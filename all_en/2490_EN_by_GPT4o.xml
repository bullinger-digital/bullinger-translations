      <p>Nothing ever happened to me in life more pleasant than that your kindness has deigned not only to receive me into the number of your own, but also to declare this very thing most kindly in written letters. Indeed, whenever I read them (and I read them very often), I seem to observe two things in them, which are especially conducive to praise: first, your singular kindness appears in that, although you are such a person as all rightly admire, you have not been burdened to write to me, who am an obscure man, amidst your so many and great occupations; secondly, your rare prudence is evident in that you do not think that should be published which could harm as many as possible, which we had not previously noticed. Now indeed we feel that certain writings have greatly stirred up adversaries in England and that they are striving to exclude us from the generosity of those from whom we hoped for all things necessary for sustenance and culture, and nothing now seems to remain except that we English, who are deprived of our homeland for the sake of the word of God, either use the work of our hands or implore the help of good men, so that we may remain in our studies, so that if God ever leads us back to our homeland, we may be able to refute the doctrines of the papists and explain to our people and nation by what snares they have been surrounded and deceived by them. Pious men, by whom we have been assisted and supported thus far, are either all thrown into prison for our cause, or, if any are free from chains, they are so carefully watched by the papists that they can contribute nothing to us without the greatest danger. Hence it happens that we are placed in great difficulties at this time, and it has come to the point that it seems necessary for each one to provide for himself as he can. As for me, there is nothing for which I can hope to remain in my established studies, since he who has hitherto supported me is himself thrust into the same difficulty as the other English, so that he is stripped of all his possessions and cannot find where to hope for anything in such great malice of the adversaries. He is Mr. Jakob Haddon, a man worthy, for his beneficence to the poor, to be enriched with many riches. Since therefore my condition is such that I am not allowed to continue in my intended course of studies due to poverty, I would willingly follow the next best thing, to devote myself to that way of life which is most closely connected with literary leisure. In this matter, since I understand that your eminence can greatly benefit me with your recommendation, relying on that kindness which is most clearly declared in your letters to me, I boldly implore your help and assistance.</p>
      <p>Froschauer is a printer among you, about whose integrity and diligence in his printing house much is praised here, and he has advised me to work with him, if he would wish me in any way, to be a corrector and editor of the books which he himself would print with his types. I think that your recommendation would be very effective in accomplishing this. Therefore, if your eminence grants this to me, I will seem to have received a singular benefit, and I will strive to ensure that you do not seem to have recommended an unworthy person. May your kindness fare well, most excellent and most revered lord in Christ to me.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, December 9, [1554].</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, John Banks, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church in ZÃ¼rich among the Swiss.</p>
