    <p xml:id="regest1">The learned and pious Francisco de Enzinas, who comes from a noble Spanish family, is traveling to St. Gallen, and only to see Vadian! From there, he plans to go to Lindau to [Hieronymus] Sailer, then to Konstanz and back to Basel, where he will live for some time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He represents an orthodox view. However, Vadian should not give him the impression that he would support Bucer, who is so changeable in his teachings. Not that Bullinger would doubt Vadian's view of the Lord's Supper; he knows, however, that Bucer has mentioned Vadian's name to the Spaniard when listing his supporters. The Spaniard is also convinced that [Bucer] cannot think so differently than he expresses in his books.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He is also very fond of Melanchthon, lived with him until last June, and will report astonishing things about him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Furthermore, he will tell Vadian everything else and deliver Bullinger's commentary on Luke, with which the author apologizes for having written less frequently during the last three months.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Vadian should report any news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Francisco de Enzinas, a Spaniard, a truly pious and learned man, has come to your humanity, most illustrious man, for the sole purpose of seeing you. Having been stirred by the fame of your name, he has long desired to see you. He is born of a noble and great family in Spain, is wealthy and exceedingly learned. He also intends to go to Lindau to [Hieronymus] Sailer, then to return through Konstanz to Basel, where he plans to stay for some time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>He is sound and whole in the Catholic and orthodox doctrine. However, be careful that he does not understand you to favor Bucer's often changed opinion. Not that I do not know that you rightly understand the Lord's Supper, but because Bucer has magnificently and splendidly told this Spaniard how many and great men he has in his opinion, among whom he also numbered you. The Spaniard said, as he reported to me: "I do not think that such a man would feel differently than what he has published in his books, etc."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>He is very dear to Melanchthon, about whom you will hear amazing things; he was with Melanchthon until last June.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>He will be a living letter to you. I am sending my books, nine commentaries on Luke, printed and published or born this summer. These are the reason why I have written less frequently for three months. Here you have the whole writing and a just excuse, I believe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lord. If you have any news, let me know. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 1, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
