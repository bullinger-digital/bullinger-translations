    <p xml:id="regest1">Waited in vain for Froschauer. Sends his writing addressed to the people of M체nster, which Leo Jud is to read. In it, he also expresses his views on the office in the church, the only topic on which he might have a slightly different nuance than the Zurich Catechism. Soldiers are being recruited in Strasbourg. Capito is ill. Greetings, also from Matth채us Zell and Jakob Bedrot.</p>

      <p>Brothers and esteemed fellow ministers, grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I was expecting Froschauer, but his own affairs and the convenience of transport have taken him away from us. I am sending here what we have written to the people of M체nster. If he has time, let our Leo read it. For he has a patient disposition. You will read here how I wish the ministry of the church to be commended with the purity of faith in Christ, using words adopted by the Lord himself and the apostles. This is the only thing that I might seem to vary from your catechism. I am moved by what I experience daily, how necessary it is for there to be a sacred polity, and thus for the ministry to have its own authority. We must be the body of the Lord, which is restored through the action of each member, according to its portion. The book is here, not printed, but confused, although the printer here has thus deposited the rudiments of the art. If you cannot read it, you will still be able to guess what we mean. Those to whom we wrote this have encountered the example of the Vaitzhudians, except that the exiles are still trying to avert destruction.</p>
      <p>A recruitment is being held here and, as we hear, nowhere else. Where the soldiers will break out is unknown. There are various conjectures, perhaps a stronger suspicion, which aligns with the wish of the good old Wolfgang, who was present at the synod. May the Lord turn everything for the good. I would always prefer to be attacked than to attack.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Commend us to the whole choir of fellow ministers there. Pray for Capito, who is gravely struggling with tertian fever. Matth채us greets you courteously, as does Bedrot.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 14.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer, wholly yours, as much as he is.</p>
      <p>To the pious and vigilant ministers of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, esteemed brothers.</p>
