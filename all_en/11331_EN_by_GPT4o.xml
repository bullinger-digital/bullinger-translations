    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes for understanding regarding his move to Lausanne; after consultations with Otto Werdmüller, Leonhard Hospinian, and others, he decided on this place, as Konrad Geßner is also here and he has long wanted to learn French. Could not stay with Geßner, but has found a host in Béat Comte who will support him. Can pursue his studies more freely here than in Basel; he is especially dedicating himself to [the translation of the "Onomastikon" by] Pollux, and is also reading the French [New?] Testament with the help of Comte, attending theological lectures, and studying Cicero. Asks for intercession so that he may stay in Lausanne for a year; the people of Zurich and their church are highly esteemed here. It is reported that the French King Francis I is being plagued by fears. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Know, most kind father, that my situation is most fortunate, except for one thing that troubles me: I have not yet learned your opinion on my decision, which I do not think will be unfavorable, since, after considering all the circumstances well, it is clear to me that this was both useful and honorable. I now first ask you to believe that whatever happened in Basel was not my fault. For how cautious I was in this matter, let it be judged by others, whose advice I sought in this matter, which seemed very serious to me. Besides our Otto, there are good and learned men, participants in my studies, among whom Hospinian was not ignorant of my plan and the whole cause, who also supported me in this matter. There was various consultation about the place I should seek. Many suggested Strasbourg, many Zurich, some Tübingen, but none advised me to remain in Basel. Finally, Lausanne was mentioned, mainly because I knew I would find our Konrad there and hoped I could complete my study of the French language, which I had long conceived in my heart. Trusting in God, the best and greatest, I went there.</p>
      <p>The journey was successful and happy, the arrival even happier; for I was received with a kind spirit by the Count, whose humanity many had already praised to me. I could not live with Konrad due to the lack of our language's commerce and the scarcity of supplies, which he entirely lacks. I found a most honorable and no less learned family among whom I live. There are no lack of reasons why I can become both more learned and better.</p>
      <p>My studies are the same, indeed freer than they ever were in Basel, since I am not entangled by any impediments of family or other matters. However, the greatest part of my time is spent on Pollux, since it will be committed to the press immediately after the fair. I also read the French Testament for an hour or two, which my master interprets for me, and I, in turn, assist him in the study of the French language. I attend theological lectures and do not neglect the reading of Cicero.</p>
      <p>And now there is nothing else, except that I beg and beseech you with the greatest prayers I can, dearest father, since the sum of these matters rests greatly with you, that you assist me with our people, so that with their consent I may do what I most desire and is in my interest. Please ensure they grant that I may stay in France for only one year. But why did I say France? I mean Lausanne; for I do not desire this, because it resists the freedom of piety. Here, however, not only regarding the other heads of religion, but also concerning the sacrament of the Eucharist, it is allowed to live most freely. You are loved here by all; and my host, the honorable Béat Comte, loves you and often places your church above all others with the highest praises, and he loves me more profusely because I am from Zurich; our Konrad is also loved for this reason.</p>
      <p>Therefore, allow me to stay for a while among those who love our name. Permit, I beg, that I may finally complete the long-desired knowledge of the French language, which can be learned here as well as in the middle of France; for our entire family speaks it most purely. If you grant this, I will, in turn, ensure that you never experience any appearance of disobedience in me, and I will ensure that you do not seek my duty in vain in any matter. While I both ought and wish to do this, it will be done with the most grateful and eager spirit if I see that you have not failed me in this matter. Therefore, my father, since you have great influence here and have been the patron and guide of my fortunes and studies thus far, I flee to your assistance, hoping certainly that you will not deny this to me.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write, except that they proclaim the King of France is agitated by furies, and the Count says he has certainly heard this. He has forbidden anyone in the whole kingdom to bear a sword, has stored away all weapons, and does not trust his daughter or sons; he also suspects his wife's loyalty. He fears that the buildings he inhabits will collapse; before entering any house, he sends some to explore the building's firmness, and the devil miserably vexes him in the highest degree. He will finally perish with a punishment worthy of him and will pay the penalties long due.</p>
      <p>Greet my mother and your wife with the whole family most familiarly in my name, also my brother Johann, to whom I will write soon. Farewell, dearest, and hold me in your highest esteem. July 13, 1539, Lausanne, from the house of the honorable Béat Comte.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
