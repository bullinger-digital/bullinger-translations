      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter along with two sermons on the Transfiguration of our Lord Christ, etc., as well as two from your brother-in-law Gwalther, with the content of your further writings on the fourth of this month. We thank you initially on behalf of both mayors of Zürich for their entirely Christian good and friendly will, and we pray to the dear God that He may preserve and bless them so that they may be faithful and with good zealous hearts over the word of the Lord. In the same manner, we have gratefully received and understood your faithful reminder that we should serve God the Lord more faithfully and diligently for such high grace and goodness than ever before. May Almighty God grant us His divine grace so that we may grow and become more zealous in the true and undoubted word, to the praise, honor, and glory of our dear Lord, and for the benefit and salvation of our and many other souls. Amen. We ask the faithful dear God, along with your brethren, for the Lord's grace and true steadfastness, which shall also happen to you.</p>
      <p>We cannot conceal from you our entirely favorable and good opinion, as we have now been afflicted with many bodily ailments for almost sixteen weeks, for which we also sought a bath cure, and when we were at our sickest and weakest, unable to ride or walk, the reconciliation came to us without any of our doing (as we have partly revealed to you before), to the Lord be praise and thanks forever; may He also grant grace that we may see our loved ones with God-pleasing and Christian joy; for we are not yet able to fast on this day. We also bear with your weakness a very gracious compassion, and you should convey our very gracious and favorable greetings to your brother-in-law Gwalther.</p>
      <p>A cross has also visited our subjects again after the aforementioned grace with fatherly punishment and discipline, so that it has begun to die of the plague there; we have great concern for our old... heir, who is now over sixty years old.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God, if it is His divine will, grant him life for a long time; for he is truly a faithful worker in the Lord's vineyard.</p>
      <p>We would like to ask that you send us a few more sermons or homilies with the next dispatch; besides, we would like to ask Gwalther on our behalf to share with us two more booklets of the treatise from Paul, where he writes about the serviceability of God and the devil. For we have sent one of them to a very beloved and Christian man at our lord's cousin's court, who still has it at hand. With this, you are entrusted to the Lord of all lords, who will protect you from evil. Dated Göppingen, December 7th, anno etc. 52.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, you may know that several years ago we completely abolished the papal mass in Mömpelgard and the lordship of Blamont and Grogen(?) and in the county and lordship in almost all villages and parishes (by the grace of God) received preachers, truly not without small effort; many good people know this. They have preached for several years with considerable peace and quiet, which has amazed us and others by the grace of God. Our father also found them there and was thus answered by others who preached until the cursed, godless, thieving Interim broke in; then they were separated. Some willingly left, others differently, and yet some were maintained with poverty as best as could be, living in good conduct and life; they are creeping back out. But the laborers are few, and the harvest is plentiful. Therefore, by the special grace and will of God, it has come again that in those places the majority of the papal Roman mass has been abolished again (praise be to God)... to such a work again with pressing intention (as we do not doubt you are self-minded and willing out of Christian zeal) to ask and inquire of your brethren and acquaintances for a learned, God-fearing, zealous man in the word of the Lord, who may be used and proclaim the truth of God.</p>
      <p>For the honest teacher and man Thussanus, whom we brought there and now left much for the truth in Metz, is daily burdened with blood and with sillon the time of unrest and concern, so that it is to be feared he will not be able to endure much longer, so that we may have one beside him and with him in the city of Mömpelgard. So, do not let your diligent effort be in vain, whether in Bern, Lausanne, etc., or other places; we will entirely rely on you without refusal. Be entrusted to God, il.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, in hand.</p>
