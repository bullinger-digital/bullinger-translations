      <p>S. Certainly, most esteemed lord and godfather, I would have gladly informed you about your Apocalypse through this messenger, but it was not possible. Some took quite a long time to read it; now, however, everyone has read it. But I cannot convene the school authorities before Monday or Tuesday. It is also hindered by the fact that Haller, the treasurer, is again bedridden with gout, without whose work and presence nothing will be done; but he will give you and us so much that, once the school authorities are convened, he will finally expedite the matter. Therefore, I hope to give you definite information through the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Many pious people here also mourn the death of the most excellent, illustrious, and upright man, Lord Consul Lavater, and I especially sympathize with you, as I am not unaware of what kind of person you have lost, not only a relative but a brother and patron in the Lord's work. I pray to the Lord that, since today I hear the consular assembly is to be held, He may appoint another who will be useful to the church and the republic. What you sent, I shared with the chief scribe, Diespach, and some others, from whom I have not yet received a response. If I receive it before the messenger departs, I will include it here; if not, I will send it back with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>We have no news, neither from France nor from Italy nor even from Germany. As far as the running away is concerned, it is not allowed; but my lords, when they heard that the march was to begin, have forbidden it anew and have proclaimed it throughout the whole land and had it read out in the chancelleries. However, it is true that no certain penalty has been established, but it is a matter of life and property, yet it is hanged "according to the state of affairs".</p>
      <p>This indeed bothers us, and we daily trouble their ears with this matter; meanwhile, it is not true that the freedom to leave has been granted. A few have left the city, 4 or 5, of whom two are from the noble Erlach family, and with them the son of the treasurer Dilger; but they only pretend to want to see the camp and will soon return.</p>
      <p>These things I write to you in haste. Zebedee is here; what he is planning or doing, I do not know. He did not meet with me; I happened to run into him in the street. My mother, wife, and all of mine greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 16, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>January 16, 1557.</p>
