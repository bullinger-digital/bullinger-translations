    <p xml:id="regest1">They did not send Veit [Kappeler the Younger] to [Johannes] Travers, but to other delegates who are equally responsible [for the school]; Travers will inform Bullinger directly about the result. Durich Chiampell transmits the outstanding amount for the books as well as a quarter of chestnuts through Augustin Fries, who has already been compensated for the transport. Johannes Blasius' dispute with the [Chur] Bishop [Lucius Iter] has been settled by the Gotteshausbund after hearing the accusation and defense, as [Johannes] Travers has probably already reported; Blasius had to apologize and pay ten Rhine guilders as compensation for the incurred costs; however, the Papists still do not refrain from harassing Blasius by all means; some want to banish Blasius and all of us who do not preach papally, but God will stand by His own; it would have been better, however, if Blasius had not written [the dialogue (see above No. 1798)]; this cannot be undone now, and a dismissal would be absolutely unjustified in view of his merits. Gallicius forwards Bullinger's letter to Johannes Travers for review. Gallicius himself returns to church service [in Lavin]; he would have to report more extensively on the reasons why he no longer wants to bear the burden of a school office. Greetings.</p>

      <p>We did not send Veit to Travers, but deliberately offered him to the other delegates responsible for such matters and of equal authority with him. What he has achieved, he will tell you in person. My friend Huldrich Campell sends the amount owed for the books through Augustin Fries, namely eight Rhine guilders in total and 21 cruciates, two obols. Write back what you have received. Additionally, he gave the same Augustin 12 cruciates for transport, with which he was content. Furthermore, he asks you not to disdain to accept from him a quarter (if I may speak thus) of chestnuts, which he sends to you placed in a sack, giving thanks. The case of Johannes Blasius is finally settled. For the House of God, convened by the bishop, after hearing the accusation and Blasius' defense, wanted to entrust the matter to him and resolved it. He took an oath from Johannes Blasius that he knew nothing else than that the bishop and those companions were honest men. They also pronounced that Blasius should give ten Rhine guilders to the bishop for the expenses, which he had incurred much more in this matter. In summary: neither party is deprived of their honor. However, the Papists do not cease to be troublesome to Blasius, causing him trouble in any way they can; some would like to have him and all of us who do not preach similarly to them proscribed; but the Lord will be with His own. It would have been better, however, if Blasius had never written that. But what is done cannot be undone, and to cast aside a brother always useful in the Lord and of blameless life to this day for this admission would be more inhumane and cruel than Christian, I think. Finally, I send your letters written to me to our Johannes Travers to read, in which, I say, you clear yourself to that one slow to anger. I will return to my church; why I do not wish to bear this burden (of the school, I think) longer would be too long to write. You, man of God, fare well and excellently for us; whenever you wish to impose something on me and command, write. Just know that I am entirely yours. Farewell again. From Chur, on the 20th of November, the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
