    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has nothing new to report. He is eagerly awaiting Blarer's news from the Frankfurt [Diet] and the [Second] Regensburg [Religious Discussion].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- As far as he knows, the [letter carrier] Konrad [Hofherr] has studied diligently and behaved properly. Bullinger hopes that [Hofherr's] studies will benefit the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Matthias Erb reports [with No. 2333] that the Mömpelgard church is now back in its former peaceful state, and that through [the "Articles" of Ulrich of Württemberg] the holy festivals and other superstitious practices have been abolished again; furthermore, Pierre Toussain, who was expelled by the Lutherans a few months ago, has been rehabilitated. Bullinger cannot send a copy [of the "Articles"] due to lack of time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff], to the children, and to [Konrad] Zwick.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have no letters to which I have not already replied, dearest of all men, and at present, I have nothing to write or report, except that I eagerly await your letters, desiring to know what the Frankfurt Diet and the Regensburg Religious Discussion have produced.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You have a living letter here in Konrad, who, as far as I have been able to observe and understand, has conducted himself very properly and studied diligently with us. He is certainly a good man, and I hope his studies will someday benefit the church.</p>

      <p>While I write this, Matthias Erb reports that the Mömpelgard church has been completely restored to its former tranquility, and that by decree of the senior prince, the holy festivals instituted for the saints have been abolished again; some other superstitious practices, which servants of bad faith had once suppressed and then revived, have also been removed. He adds that Pierre Toussain, a man distinguished for his singular doctrine and purity of life, has been reinstated. The Lutherans had expelled him a few months ago; now the prince orders that he be tolerated along with his confession and sound doctrine, adding that Toussain's doctrine is sound. There are many other things corrected by the prince's edict. I could neither send nor transcribe a copy of the prince's edict at present, for I am scarcely able to write this.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell with your wife, children, and your entire holy family. May Konrad Zwick and all good men also fare well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 30, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Ambrosius Blarer, my most esteemed lord and brother in Christ, dearest of all. Constance.</p>
