    <p xml:id="regest1">It is necessary to portray [Johannes] Cochläus - as Luther already did - as he is, so that it does not appear as if he is a learned theologian, and so that he cannot deceive simple minds; indeed, he is not worthy of a response, but for the sake of the church, one should respond to him; Gast would write to him in Latin, not in German. [Mathias] Limberger was asked by letter to buy Luther's book ["Kurtz bekentnis"] at the Frankfurt Fair; his response is enclosed and a return of it is requested. [Johannes] Brenz wrote the following: Until now, his neighborhood was free from the madness of the Anabaptists, but now some villages located on the Rhine are sending a number of Anabaptists to Moravia, who pass through his neighborhood and infect some with their plague; but even if that is regrettable, it is nevertheless proof that God's kingdom has come and the true Gospel has been revealed; in Hungary, the situation was calm during the summer, but people suffer under the Turkish governors; last spring, the son [Mustafa] of the Turkish Sultan [Suleiman I] is said to have been defeated by the Safavid [Shah Tahmasp I]; the Beylerbey [Mehmed Pasha] was recalled from Hungary to Constantinople; friends write to him that [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa has conquered the Lipari Islands and the [Sultan Suleiman I] is gathering a huge army in Constantinople. May the Lord not darken the glory of his Gospel. Bullinger will learn the rest from Froschauer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>It will be beneficial to depict Cochläus in his true colors and to unmask him, as Luther has already done, so that he does not appear to be a learned theologian in the Christian religion and so that simple minds are not deceived by his malice. However, he is not worthy of any response if I consider his character, but he is worthy of a response for the sake of the church, which he mocks with his arguments. I would respond to him in Latin, not in German, nor would I care for the common people, who do not know how to judge divine matters, observe mockeries, and already neglect him.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Limberger, asking him to buy Luther's book for me in Frankfurt; I am sending what he replied to my letters with the condition that you return it. I do not know what to make of his letters; I see that Luther's spirit is embittered against our churches.</p>
      <p>Brentius wrote to me: "Our neighborhood has so far been free from the Anabaptist madness by the grace of God; however, now some villages on the Rhine are sending almost entire groups of Anabaptists to Moravia, and as they pass through our neighborhood, some are infected with this plague and join them. But it is well; although it is regrettable that Satan is allowed so much over miserable people, it is nevertheless clear evidence that the kingdom of God has come and the true Gospel has been revealed, etc. In Hungary, things were calm this summer, except for the misery suffered by people from the Turkish governors. This tranquility is due to the fact that last spring the son of the Turkish emperor is said to have been defeated by the Shah, and the Beylerbey with his army was recalled from Hungary to Byzantium. And friends write to me that there is a rumor that Barbarossa has conquered the Lipari Islands in Sicily and that the Turk is gathering a huge army in Byzantium." This is what he wrote.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to the Lord that He does not allow the splendor of His Gospel to be obscured. You will hear the rest from Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 30, 1544.</p>
      <p>I wish all happiness to D. Bibliander and the other ministers. I hope your wife and children are well.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast, in haste.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest teacher. Zurich.</p>
