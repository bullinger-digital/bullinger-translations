    <p xml:id="regest1">[In Basel] there is an attempt to subordinate the clergy to the university and to force Grynaeus and other teachers to accept a degree; Grynaeus is determined to resist to the end, and Myconius asks for refuge in case he himself must yield. He inquires about Theodor [Bibliander]. Sends Gwalther's copy [of the draft of the university statutes].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Now at last the situation has come to this point, that the university is seriously attempting to subordinate the pastorate of the church to itself, with the approval of the appointed deputies and certain members of the senatorial order, and then to compel Dr. Grynaeus and some others to a degree appropriate to their lectures. He, who is yours, is still exerting all his strength; for he has persuaded himself that he will achieve the highest position by this means. They have presented us with an intolerable document, by which, if they attempt to compel, they will especially expel me; for I do not wish to betray the ministry. Therefore, you will provide a place that will receive me if I am expelled.</p>
      <p>Theodor, I do not know whether he lives or not. I have entrusted Rodolph to write down in your name what you see; I did not have the leisure.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, May 3, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, in his Lord.</p>
