      <p>Scarcely can I express, my dearest brother, how much our Vogler has made me anxious, worried, and sad by explaining to me the unfortunate dispute he has with a certain nobleman, and it is not for me to discuss this matter with you at length; for I hear that you have been appointed as the mediator of this case. I sincerely pray to the Lord that you may resolve it well; for the more ardently I love that heroine for Christ's sake and for the sake of pure religion, the more deeply I am affected whenever I think of how much disgrace and offense it would be associated with if she were involved in even the slightest suspicion. How the enemies of Christ would rejoice. She would be consumed with grief, even though she is most innocent. That master of a thousand arts, our most hostile enemy, knows how to weave the most disastrous web of such carnage and contamination of a good name. But Christ is stronger, who can tear apart the unfortunate web. Therefore, pray to the Lord with me, that this unfortunate matter may be peacefully resolved.</p>
      <p>I also think it is primarily your task, with God's help, to ensure that this matter is not discussed in public judgment or reaches the ears of many. For even if the cause of the heroine is found to be good (as I know her to be most innocent), her good reputation would not be so well protected; for that vile suspicion would always linger in the minds of many. It seems to me that the matter can be resolved if she does not take a manly spirit and speaks directly with that nobleman in person (while you attempt to settle it) and openly declares to him to his face that if he continues in this way, she will also proceed to defend her integrity of reputation, so that he will truly feel what disgrace is. But with God's invoked help, I easily hope that you will quell this evil with your wisdom. You will hasten, not delay any longer; it will be easier to remedy the beginnings than when the evils have heated up through long delays.</p>
      <p>I am brief because you have a living letter here. Zurich, January 4, 1564.</p>
      <p>I am ashamed and regretful of that bird you described to me. If only he would live with us again and give no scandal to the good and the bad. I am very concerned for the heroine; for I love her and her good reputation sincerely and wish it to be preserved.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would be most gratifying if you would inform me that she is well and not involved in any danger.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I do not fully understand the case itself, etc. on the back.</p>
      <p>The matter of the Lord of Rappoltsweiler, concerning Vogler, 1564, 1567, 1568.</p>
