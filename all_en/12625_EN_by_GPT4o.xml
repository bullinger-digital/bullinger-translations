    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer [Johannes Kielmann] was appointed to potentially be tasked with the removal of Peutinger's children [from Augsburg]. However, Peutinger now feels compelled to divide his family earlier than planned, following the example of [the Patriarch] Jacob. He has instructed [Kielmann] to leave the boy [...] in Lindau and to inquire in Zurich whether he would be better accommodated in Basel or Zurich. Peutinger prefers Zurich. For a renowned university, his son is still too young and not sufficiently advanced, even though he already has knowledge of languages and can communicate in Latin. Should the use of Latin not be common in Zurich, Peutinger is willing to hire as many private tutors as the people of Zurich deem appropriate. He also writes to [Konrad] Pellikan. Bullinger is asked to help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [P.S.:] The Papists have incited the filth of this world against the [German Protestants] and have a larger army than was thought possible. Both armies have an equal number of infantrymen. The smaller number of [Schmalkaldic] cavalry is compensated by their quality. The cause of the [Schmalkaldic League] is the better one. The Imperial forces have more money at their disposal, but the [Schmalkaldic League] has at least as much as they need. Both armies are close to each other. Emperor [Charles V] remains entrenched. We will see what he will do after the arrival of the Dutch army! The [Schmalkaldic League] seeks battle, the Emperor seems to want to delay it. The [common soldiers] must pay for what the princes devise!</p>

      <p>Greetings, most distinguished man. The bearer of this letter to you is a young man whom I have chosen to potentially send away with my children. This is happening sooner than I had planned. The reason is that in the current state of affairs, I cannot attend to this matter, and following the example of Jacob, I have decided to somewhat divide my family, so that not all would fall in one calamity. I have instructed the boy to leave Lindau and proceed to you, and with your advice, determine whether it would be better for him to stay with you or in Basel. I would prefer him to stay with you. For he is not yet of the age nor has he advanced enough to be sent to more renowned universities. Again, I would not want to neglect a pupil who already has a necessary knowledge of languages for a son, frequent practice in grammar, and continuous use of the Latin language. If this is not available publicly, I would gladly pay private tutors as much as is necessary and as much as you yourself will advise. I will also write to Mr. Pellicanus about this matter. I ask you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, to provide your assistance in this matter and to have them recommended, to whom I, in turn, will be grateful as much as I can, whenever I can.</p>

      <p>Farewell. From Augsburg, September 11, in the year of salvation 1546. Yours, Cl. P. Peutinger.</p>
      <p>I suppose you eagerly await news of what is happening here. We also anxiously await grace and help from the Lord. The Papists have incited the filth of the world against us, and they now have gathered greater forces than we initially believed. Our infantry is not inferior; if our cavalry is fewer in number, the excellence of our soldiers will make up for it. Our cause is superior. Others have more money; we have not lacked as much as was necessary. On both sides, there are large forces very close by. The Emperor defends his camp; we await what he will do with the arrival of the Belgian army. Our side desires battle. The Emperor seems to want to delay it. Within the walls of Troy and outside, and whatever the kings devise, the common soldiers pay the price.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned ecclesiast of Zurich, his dearest lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
