    <p xml:id="regest1">Received his letter [No. 1015] along with Calvin's letter to Grynaeus and the confession of the Genevans; finds nothing objectionable in the latter, but warns against a new dispute over the doctrine of the Trinity. Is not informed about the conflict concerning Caroli, but intends to continue striving for unity and contradicts Myconius's fear that he will be held in low regard in Zürich and Bern. The envoy who returned from Baden will have reported on the reprehensible stance of the Five Places [in the issue of military service]; their behavior could soon backfire, but even the uninvolved are at risk of harm. Returns the letter addressed to Grynaeus, but not the confession.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most learned Myconius, along with Calvin's letter to our Grynaeus and the confession of the Genevan preachers. First, regarding the confession, I see nothing in it at present that is objectionable. It seems to clearly express the unity of the holy Trinity and the distinction of persons. As for the terms "substance" and "person," I do not think they will be so obstinate as to refuse to use them or to condemn others who use them, since there is no danger or discord in the understanding itself. Our previous dispute over the words "substantially, really, and corporally" did not go well; it will go very badly if we revive that old and much more dangerous dispute about the unity of substance and the distinction of persons in the holy Trinity. For it seems better to me to approach these mysteries with full devotion and to believe them, as Scripture simply speaks of them, rather than to want to penetrate that tremendous majesty with learned, subtle, and acute arguments. We will certainly take care that no dispute is stirred up among us in this matter and because of these terms. The Apostle Paul commands his followers to think soberly and according to the measure of faith, avoiding wordy disputes. In this, I will be.</p>
      <p>Regarding Carolus, I can neither absolve nor condemn the man. For I am equally ignorant of Calvin's accusation and Carolus's defense, except that we read some dire things appended in Calvin's letter to Mr. Grynaeus, at which I was certainly astonished, and I still do not understand what they aim at. The Bernese have written nothing to us about this. Therefore, I can judge nothing about this, nor, if I could, should I. However, I must ensure that all dissent among brothers is quelled. Since you also encourage this, I will strive more diligently. For what you add at the end of your letter, that you are equally esteemed among the Bernese and the people of Zürich, that is nothing, I certainly do not recognize, nor do I know what those words aim at. If you think you are despised and neglected by the people of Zürich, you are indeed mistaken. For the writings of pious and learned men have always been highly valued among us, and no one has ever demonstrated otherwise; so far from it, that we have ever neglected you, whose piety and integrity have been most clearly known to us for many years. And we have never understood anything from the Bernese except that they regard you as a good and learned man; and those who think so cannot despise you. I therefore ask and beseech you by the Lord to promise yourself better things from us and to wish to love us sincerely, as we love you from the heart. May suspicions perish and disappear. Among us, thanks be to God, there is no turmoil or dissension, because we handle religious matters simply and with the utmost diligence, faith, and charity, avoiding and fleeing those disputes. We have learned the truth once, we hold it in true faith. Would that we also lived according to it. We certainly strive, as much as the Lord grants grace, and we aim for this in all our sermons; for that seems to be our duty.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with Mr. Grynaeus, our dearest brother, to whom I have nothing to write at present.</p>
      <p>You surely know from your envoy, who came from Baden, the audacity of certain Catilinarians and the lamented corruption of the Five Places. All the best people think the day is near when the wicked will pay the penalty for their crimes. Here I add: Would that they do not also drag us with them into ruin. Therefore, we must be vigilant and pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>July 23, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am returning Grynaeus's letter. I am not returning the confession, as I think it is not expected from you.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, Antistes of the Basel Church, dearest brother.</p>
