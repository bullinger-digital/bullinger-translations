      <p>S. From Augsburg, one of our merchants arrived here on the 25th of this month and truthfully reported that up to now, on the day held in Augsburg, nothing has been finally decided or concluded regarding the common imperial matters or religion, and the princes are dispersing and traveling away; for it is said that this day has been postponed until some spring, etc. It is also said that King Philip is still intending to celebrate a wedding with his cousin King Ferdinand's daughter around Christmas on the Adige. The emperor is constantly ill, and the doctors are truly amazed that he prolongs his life so long. He is said to have recently contracted the warts (with decency), and in addition, he is entirely liverish and jaundiced and has severe head flux and a bad gout. And it is believed that now many councils are being held about what and how to act when His Majesty will no longer be alive, and if he passes away, it is expected that there will be the greatest discord among his closest relatives; to prevent this, some marriages are being considered.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we hope that God will continue to protect His own. Ask Bibliander to send me his book on chronology, once it is printed, at my expense. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day before the calends of November, in the year 1550. Joachim Vadian.</p>
