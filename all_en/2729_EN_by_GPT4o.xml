      <p>S. D. The esteemed man, Herr Valderanus, presented me with your letters written at the end of August during this fair, full of duty and love towards me, and attached to them was a copy of your sermon on the salvation of the faithful, a truly benevolent testimony of your mind towards me and a gift most pleasing to me. For which I indeed have nothing to repay at present; however, what I can do now, I give my utmost thanks, because you hold me in such regard that you are not reluctant to remember me and wish to be loved by me as well. By this, you make it so that I, who have always pursued you with singular favor for your many outstanding virtues, although never seen before, now love you much more ardently. Therefore, persuade yourself of nothing else about me than that I am most devoted and loving towards you, and you will also experience the readiness of my mind towards you in reality, whenever the matter and occasion allow. What you indicated about the Hebrew shekel was very pleasant for me to know, and I have included that passage from your commentaries on the 17th chapter of Matthew in my observations. However, I would like one to be formed for me from your lead, so that I could compare it with mine, since you think the archetype from which yours was formed (as far as I understood from your letter and commentaries) is genuine. For I have also seen shekels of another form at the Peutingers in Augsburg and some others, which differ from mine in size and perhaps even in weight. I can certainly affirm to you that the antiquities of the Roman prince Ferdinand's coins will soon be published (since you seem to doubt it), and to have another witness of it, Herr Johannes Oporinus, the printer from Basel, reported to me at this fair that the images and symbols of the reverse sides (as they call them) of those coins are now being engraved in bronze by the craftsmen of that matter in Vienna, Austria, and that a certain specimen of annotations or scholia, which Wolfgang Lazius and Johannes Albertus Danstetter (also known as Widmanstetter) alias Lucretius are preparing for that work, was sent to him a few months ago. I did not want to conceal this from you, to remove all ambiguity; however, it is uncertain due to the multitude of coins and forms to be prepared, whether we will have them at the next fair or not. Froschauer will pay two hundred Rhenish florins to the humanity of Herr Waidner, namely the Basel and Zurich pension due and paid to him at this fair. Furthermore, he will present the original diploma itself (as it is commonly called) concerning the Zurich income and capital, long ago prepared for caution, in a capsule sealed by me and inscribed with my hand for you. What the aforementioned Herr Waidner wants to be done with all these things, he himself (I suppose) writes to you in his letter attached to this; for he enjoined nothing else upon me than to transmit these along with his letters to you through Froschauer. But you will be able to learn from Froschauer how the excellent and reverend old man is doing, who has decided to visit him on his return. Our Jodocus Glaser, a man, while he lived, upright and honest, passed away piously and Christianly this past summer, having been consumed by a long illness. Those who still remain from those whom you wished to be greeted in your name through me, Herr Nikolaus Bromius and Heinrich Lautensack, send their greetings back both dutifully and lovingly. May the Lord keep your excellence safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt on the 17th of September in the year 1555. Yours, Hieronymus Agninus, Doctor of Decrees.</p>
