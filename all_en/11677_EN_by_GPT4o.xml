[Martin] Bucer writes from Strasbourg that a few weeks ago, 100 horsemen and 500 foot soldiers set out from Strasbourg; Bullinger has no news from Basel regarding Myconius' health condition; it is said that the Turk [Suleiman I] is marching with a huge, well-equipped army to Hungary. It is clear that the inner Swiss cantons are siding with the French [Francis I], which poses a great danger to the Confederation; the Zurich council is very concerned; what they opposed to the inner Swiss cantons in Baden through [Johannes] Haab is probably known to Vadian; may the Lord free us from the shackles of the "blood men"! Tomorrow, a new mayor will be elected in place of the [deceased on April 7] [Heinrich] Walder; most are in favor of [Johannes] Haab or [Hans Rudolf] Lavater; may God, who knows the hearts of men, give us a capable and virtuous mayor who leads both the church and the community peacefully, wisely, and in a godly manner! Vadian should write more often and not forget [Rudolf] Gwalther, to whom he promised to write. Greetings from [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Kaspar] Megander. Request for news regarding the Turkish war and the events concerning the Emperor [Charles V], the French [Francis I], and the Pope [Paul III].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. If you had as much leisure to write as I have the desire to read your letters, you would certainly write more often. We have recovered, along with Bibliander, Pellikan, and Megander; only Leo is still seriously ill. Therefore, pray to the Lord to restore him to us for the benefit of our church. We have nothing from Strasbourg, except that Bucer writes that a week or two ago, 100 horsemen and 500 foot soldiers sent by the Republic of Strasbourg have departed. Myconius has not written from Basel for some time due to ill health. I have little else that is pleasing. Everyone writes of mournful things, full of fear and terror. They say that the Turk is hastening with a huge, well-equipped army to Hungary. What is true, I do not know. However, I know that our inner Swiss cantons, siding with the French, are putting the whole of Switzerland in great danger, and I do not see how we can be freed from such a great evil unless divine goodness delivers us. Our magistrate is very anxious and is considering various options. You are probably not unaware of what was expressly opposed to the inner Swiss cantons in Baden through Haab; but they, like blind and insane men, rush to their own ruin. May the Lord deliver us and free us from the bonds of bloodthirsty men! Tomorrow, another consul will be elected in place of the deceased Walder. Most think either Haab or Lavater should be chosen for this dignity. May the Lord, who knows the hearts of men, give us a man endowed with heroic virtues, who may please God and govern our church and republic peacefully, wisely, and holily. Pray also to the Lord for us. Farewell and love me, write more often and do not forget Gwalther. You promised to write to him, which he anxiously awaits. Zurich, June 1, 1542. Bibliander, Pellikan, Megander, etc., greet you. Please, if you have any news about the Turkish war or the affairs of the Emperor, the French, and the Pope, share it; for you could do nothing more pleasing for me.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed and dear lord.</p>
