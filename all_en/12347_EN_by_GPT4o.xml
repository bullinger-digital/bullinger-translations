    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast has good reasons to hope that a religious discussion will not take place. The Spanish bishop [Pedro de Malvenda] spent three days in [Basel] with his court. Gast learned from his confidants (who do not approve of all the actions of the bishops) that [Malvenda] was sent by [Charles V] to Regensburg as his precursor to prepare the negotiations. However, the Emperor will soon end the Diet because the Spaniards are being attacked by Algerian soldiers and need help. Furthermore, after the capture of the arsonist [Duke Henry of Brunswick], all of [Charles V's] plans are coming to nothing. - Here are some details about [Malvenda] to illustrate to Bullinger what kind of concord the bishops are striving for: [Malvenda] rode on a donkey to the Carthusian monastery [in Klein-Basel] on Sunday, November 22, and wanted Brother [Thomas Kress] to allow him a mass celebration. He refused, even when [Malvenda] tried a second time with the help of an interpreter [...]. The bishop then went to the countryside and celebrated the mass there. He only returned hungry at night. As for the piety and chastity of the bishop, just this: He leads two girls from the Netherlands dressed in men's clothing with him. Had the [Basel] council known about this, they would certainly have intervened. [Malvenda] is pious because he has a monk [...] with him who holds the hourly prayers for him and goes to the scum (inferna loca) [of society] for him. - The Protestants will soon consult at the [Schmalkaldic League] meeting in Frankfurt on how to deal with the prisoners and how to respond to [Charles V] regarding this and a future council (such a [proper] council will probably never happen unless the miracle-working God has mercy on His own). The Protestants have allegedly decided to maintain their army gathered from Upper Germany. - That Cologne has been occupied is a rumor, but the city has equipped itself with bulwarks; the population is rebellious. The people of Cologne have greatly helped [Duke Henry]. In the house of his brother, the canon [Georg of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel], 300 guns were set up. - The castle [Rietberg] was besieged, but [Count Otto IV of Rietberg] managed to escape during the truce. - Bullinger should share the contents of the letter with, among others, Theodor [Bibliander], [Konrad] Pellikan, and Rudolf [Gwalther]. - [P.S.:] Bucer responds to [Bartholomäus] Latomus. He believes that he can win over the Trier bishop [Johannes IV Ludwig von Hagen] with this. For he has become much milder and more pious due to his illness, even though many at his court are more interested in gold than in concord.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have little hope that a colloquium on the Christian religion will take place at this time. I have many reasons that move me. The Spanish bishop, the emperor's envoy, equipped with a large cavalry and courtly retinue, spent three days with us recently, and from his close confidants, learned men, I gathered (who do not approve of everything that is done by the bishops, who always pour cold water on any good initiative) that their lord was sent by the imperial majesty to Regensburg to prepare what is to be done, and as a precursor of the coming emperor. For the emperor will soon conclude those assemblies because the Spanish nation is imploring his help. They are being attacked by Algerian soldiers. Furthermore, all his plans are coming to nothing with the capture of the arsonist; he sees that almost all of Germany has conspired and no longer dares to trust the German soldiers, since those veterans, joined with the arsonist, were defeated with such ease and so many nobles were captured.</p>
      <p>But, hey, to give you some insight into the Spanish bishop, from which you can easily infer what kind of concord the bishops desire: On Sunday, November 22, he visited the Carthusian monastery, surrounded by many foot soldiers, himself riding a donkey (if only he had been sewn into it!), asking the brother of the monastery for a place to celebrate the holy mass. The brother immediately replied: "Tell your lord to go with his mass wherever he wants, and not to trouble me, or he will endanger his body and his fortunes." He tried a second time through an interpreter to achieve his wish, but achieved nothing. Then he went to the countryside and celebrated the sweet mass. He returned at night, still fasting, with his servants cursing. Do you want to hear something about his piety and chastity? He has with him two very beautiful girls dressed in men's clothing, whom he perhaps bought in Lower Germany or persuaded with gifts to go with him; they are dressed in silk and follow him from behind. If only our council had known in time! Certainly, this crime would not have gone unpunished, I know. He is pious because he has a monk who prays the canonical hours for him daily and will also descend to the infernal places for him.</p>
      <p>The Protestants will soon hold a meeting in Frankfurt on the Main, namely to decide what to do with the captives, who are to be punished, what to respond to the emperor both because of this act and because of the future council, which will never happen unless the Lord from the machine wishes to look upon us. The Protestants, as I hear, have decided to keep their army gathered from Upper Germany intact until they see what will happen.</p>
      <p>The rumor that Cologne is besieged is false, but they are very afraid and are surrounding themselves with a rampart; they have a disobedient populace. However, it is certain that the people of Cologne greatly assisted the arsonist and that 300 cannons were cast in Cologne in the house of the canon, the brother of the arsonist.</p>
      <p>The castle of a certain baron was stormed; but the treacherous baron secretly fled while a truce was held for a few days. More soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, December 1, 1545.</p>
      <p>Share this with Mr. Theodor, the best man, Pellican, and Rudolf, and the others, if you please, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Bucer responds to Latomus. He thinks he can win over the bishop of Trier. For his illness has made him much milder, more gentle, and more devoted to religion than he has been so far. He has many rascals at court who are more devoted to gold than to concord.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and most esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
