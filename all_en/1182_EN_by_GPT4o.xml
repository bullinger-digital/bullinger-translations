      <p>Most illustrious man, I translated your little book in two days and indeed with great pleasure of mind. For I see that you have hit the nail on the head. I have added some things, which I know you allow me to do for the cause of Christ, and I will soon have it printed. I hope it will be in the hands and mouths of our Italians before 15 days. If you have anything else that you think should be spread at this time, send it to me; for I can serve my people here beautifully. I have written another book, which I now send to you on this matter of the council, but in Italian. If only you could understand it; but the most learned Walter can interpret many things. I expose the impostures that the pope now uses in Trento; then I advise, as much as I can, what we should do so that the execrable council does not harm our cause. If you can conveniently, send my writings to the king and adorn the gift with words for your piety. I am expecting your little work on the church. I wholeheartedly commend to you this good man, one of the refugees, who is now returning to Geneva, where he has stayed for several months. See that he can reach Bern safely, and commend him to the brothers, who will take care of him from there to Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet the whole church and school for me, especially Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Lavater. May Christ keep you from evil.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, 20th of February, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
