      <p>Greetings. The person delivering this note to you, Johannes Helmichius by name, a native of Utrecht, is a most learned and pious man who has taught Hebrew letters publicly for almost three years in the school of Lausanne. Now he is called by the church of Antwerp to its ministry, a calling he follows, although it is fraught with great danger and he was reluctantly released by us. However, he desires to see you first; therefore, he travels to Zurich together with Mr. Beza and has asked me to write a private note to you, so that he may have freer access to speak with you and approach you. I could not deny this to a man most dear to me, and who was very close to my Blasius. He also has with him some other Belgian students who have devoted themselves to letters in Geneva; I commend them to your piety and charity. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 27, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>After I finished this, it was decreed by the senate that Mr. Treasurer and I should also travel to Zurich to deliberate together with you and the Genevans (whom I wrote yesterday have come with Dathenus, Beza, and Roset) on the Erfurt matter. Beza may perhaps precede us; for on Monday we must still be present before the senate. The Schaffhausen people are also being written to, so that they may be present. I wanted to inform you of this in advance with this letter. More in person or through Beza.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my most esteemed father and compatriot.</p>
