      <p>The noble man and most zealous of true religion, Mr. Stanislaus Szilniczki, who will bring you this letter, most esteemed lords and most revered brothers in the Lord, is about to set out for those restored churches and has urged us to adorn him with our testimony and commend him to your piety. Although his piety and truly Christian morals do not need foreign ornaments or praise, we nevertheless beseech and implore you by the common love of Christ, that if he requires your help or advice in any matter, you assist him as a true member of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Even though we do not doubt that you will do this out of your piety, we still ask you to let him know that our recommendation has been of assistance to him. Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Pincz√≥w, March 10, 1560.</p>
