      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Having found a suitable courier, I could not bear to let him visit you without my letter, nor would it have been proper; not that I have much to discuss with you, for I wrote at the last fair about what I had; in the meantime, nothing more worthy of writing has occurred, especially since Tscharner, one of the most well-known senators and merchants, knows better how to discuss each matter than I do to write. That courier, who delivered my latest letters to you, Haim's son-in-law, did not bring back either letters or any word, nor could I find him at his home or anywhere to inquire, etc. Farewell. From Chur in Rhaetia, 13th of September, 1552. The pious brothers Haim, Philipp, and Pontasella greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
