      <p>Greetings. I received your letters along with those of Peter Martyr. I wrote diligently and clearly enough to Clavenna to Augustin Maynard and to others, as you instructed, through certain messengers. I am sending back Peter Martyr's letters to you, as you see. I am also sending 12 batz for the book here. I have no news, except that yesterday it was reported that the Roman pontiff is enlisting soldiers as well as the Duke of Urbino. The lords themselves will write about the schoolmaster on the next Tuesday; for they were pleased with what you sent to me. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord Jesus, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 5th of February, 1556.</p>
      <p>Of your kindness, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
