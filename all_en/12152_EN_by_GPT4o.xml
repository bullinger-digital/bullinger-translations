    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Bullinger knows that Amerbach dislikes the ecclesiastical disputes, he sends the Zurich Confession [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] against Luther's condemning and reviling [“Kurtz bekentnis”]; this could not be ignored in silence by [the people of Zurich]. They defended the innocence of their churches as well as that of all excellent people. Amerbach should read the writing and receive it favorably. Greetings from [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, and the others.</p>

      <p> Greetings. I know, most illustrious and much esteemed sir, that you do not delight in disputes within the Church of Christ. Nevertheless, I send to your kindness the example of our confession and apology written against the condemnation and slanders of Dr. Martin Luther. He rages so fiercely against the living and the dead in a public writing that we could not ignore it. We have responded to him modestly, I believe, and defended the innocence of the best men, especially of the churches, whose ministers we are, as well as our own, to the best of our ability. If you read it and are able to do so amidst your affairs, you will have done something most pleasing. I kindly ask you to receive this from me, your most devoted and favorable supporter. Continue to support studies and piety. Farewell. Zurich, March 14, 1545. Dr. Konrad Pellikan, Dr. Theodor Bibliander, and the others greet you. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
