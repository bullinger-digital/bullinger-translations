It is said that he is from Eisenach. He neither comes from a significant family nor is he well-connected. Consequently, there is not much to fear from him. - The Bishop of Trier [Johann IV Ludwig von Hagen] is said to be seriously ill and, according to other rumors, already dead. - Bullinger has probably heard about the 20,000 confiscated arquebuses in Kempten. Someone [...] wrote to Gast that for [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse, the victory [over Heinrich] was easy. It is said that no more than 400 [men] fell on both sides.</p>

      <p>S. So far, I have been unable to write anything certain about the Duke of Brunswick due to the uncertain rumors spread by the Papists. They boasted that [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse was completely destroyed with his entire army; but it was seen quite differently by the Lord, who never abandons His own.</p>
      <p>The plans they have been working on for many years are now becoming evident. The Papists walk with a sad face since their redeemer has been captured. Read the enclosed document and return it. However, I believe that the essence of this matter has already been written to your council.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not want to hide from you that a noble and learned man has been elected as the Archbishop of Mainz. They say he is from Eisenach. He is not from a significant family, nor does he have a large following (supporters, entourage), and thus there is less danger to be feared from him. There is also a persistent rumor that the Bishop of Trier is seriously ill; some assert that he is dead, but these are of uncertain credibility.</p>
      <p>You know about the 20,000 confiscated arquebuses in Kempten. Furthermore, someone wrote to me that this victory was very convenient for [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse. It is thought that no more than 400 men fell on both sides.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and be safe. November 2, 1545. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned gentleman, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord and friend.</p>
