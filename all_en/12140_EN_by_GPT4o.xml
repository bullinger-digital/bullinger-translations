    <p xml:id="regest1">[Vadian] did not receive [Bullinger's] letter along with a part of the German response ["Warhaffte Bekanntnuß", HBBibl I 161-163] to Luther's ["Kurtz bekentnis"]. - The Wittenberg messenger [...] also brought a letter from Bucer [Vadian BW VI, No. 1384], in which Bucer praises the steadfastness of [Hermann von Wied] and asks [Vadian and the people of St. Gallen] for supportive prayer for him, for even the apostolic men need prayer and intercession. For Bucer, the [intra-Protestant] conflict with Luther is exceedingly painful; yet he neither accuses the [Swiss] nor justifies Luther; his concern is solely the resulting offense: The minds of those not sufficiently steadfast are disturbed, and the [Catholic] opponents are strengthened in their certainty of victory.</p>

      <p>I received your always wonderfully pleasant and most welcome letters promptly, along with part of the German response to Luther's slanders regarding the doctrine of the Eucharist. The Wittenberg messenger also brought me a letter dictated by Bucer, in which he praises the exceptional and singular steadfastness of that hero from Cologne, Hermann von Wied, and asks that I depict him to the ministers of our church in his true colors, so that, aided by the prayers of our communion, he may continue to act as he has done so far. For even apostolic men need the prayer and intercession of the faithful and saints of the Lord, so that they are not led into such great battles and violent temptations. Regarding our dispute with Luther, he expresses nothing but pain, and indeed very bitter pain, neither accusing us nor exonerating Luther; his sole concern is the offense, the σκάνδαλον, which undoubtedly greatly disturbs the minds of those not firmly grounded and strengthens the efforts of the adversaries with a firm conviction of victory. March 6, 1545.</p>
