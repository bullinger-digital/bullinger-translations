      <p>S. I truly (my venerable father) greatly wonder what the reason is that in Chiavenna it is unknown that the council has been concluded.</p>
      <p>I am sending the letters of Mr. Martinengo for you to read; there is no need to return them. Either they are involved in some great and notable error, or we are being deceived.</p>
      <p>But I believe the council is entirely dissolved.</p>
      <p>The reason Martinengo is unaware of this is undoubtedly the sole and most important reason, which is that journeys are less frequent because Rhaetia is avoided by Italians due to the plague, as you will understand from Martinengo's letters.</p>
      <p>I am writing this in the evening.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow after the sermon, if I live, I will make an effort to meet someone from the bishop's household to extract some information from there.</p>
      <p>I barely finished these sermons; I was scarcely understood because of my cough and hoarseness; but I hope by God's grace to fully restore my health.</p>
      <p>I know that I am gradually aging and must contend with many other difficulties until my ship is finally brought into port.</p>
      <p>In this miserable and troubled life, no station appears; the heavenly homeland is where we both long to be.</p>
      <p>The plague here in Chur is not indeed raging, but it does infest several houses at intervals; it would be surprising if it does not worsen.</p>
      <p>Some had attempted to obstruct the business of the Pellizzari with their practices; but by God's grace, they were thwarted beyond expectation, and we hope for a quite successful outcome.</p>
      <p>But since everything is slippery, I can affirm nothing certain until we have everything resolved.</p>
      <p>It is written from Venice that it has been announced to our people there that the Pope's health is very much afflicted; if anything more is written about this, I will let you know.</p>
      <p>I wrote this yesterday, and today, to learn something certain about the council, I wrote to the bishop asking if he had Epiphanius, he would send it on loan; I added that I heard the council was dissolved and its acts compiled in a book sent to him; he should allow it to be read for one or two hours.</p>
      <p>He himself replied, which you see here; for this is also his handwriting.</p>
      <p>Thus you understand the acts exist, but they could not yet be obtained.</p>
      <p>If I receive them first from friends, I will send them; if the bishop receives them and lends them, I will note the headings and summaries until we have obtained the complete volume.</p>
      <p>These are (reverend father), what I currently have. I give you immortal thanks for those new wonders.</p>
      <p>I did not return Mr. Blaurer's writing, because he uses soft and fluid paper, and it was largely worn from handling; however, it was still readable; besides, I considered it not to be returned as it was addressed to me.</p>
      <p>We all wish you well, and we pray to the best and greatest God that this year may begin and end most happily for you and yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the day of John, in the year 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
