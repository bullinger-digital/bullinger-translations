    <p xml:id="regest1">Has long regretted that their friendship, mediated by Berchtold [Haller], suffered under the conflict [about the doctrine of the Lord's Supper], and is pleased about the renewed contact. Wonders why Bullinger believed the slanderers, after he had expressly approved Kunz's position on the question of the Lord's Supper at the Zurich meeting [1538]; professes adherence to the evangelical truth, to the [First] Helvetic Confession, and to the Bern Disputation, and not just recently, as his opponents claim. Fully agrees with the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in Bullinger's [Matthew] Commentary, which he was gifted by Bullinger: The spiritual gifts are received in faith; Christ sits bodily at the right hand of God, but is present in his church and feeds the believers in a spiritual manner; he is received as life-giving nourishment through the faith that he himself works; the Lord's Supper must not be reinterpreted as a mere memorial and love meal, neglecting the gifts of Christ; the accusation of the opponents that such a doctrine would establish a bodily presence of Christ is absurd. Bullinger's [Matthew] Commentary, the Helvetic Confession, and the letter [from the reformed cities of the Confederation] to Luther [from January 12, 1537] do not contradict each other when they sometimes designate the forgiveness of sins, and at other times the body and blood of Christ as the true subject of the sacrament; the assertion of a bodily presence of Christ is not at issue here. From this explanation, Bullinger will be able to see that Kunz's view agrees with his own. Greetings. Eberhard von Rümlang did not promise too much to Bullinger regarding Kunz. Request for a response.</p>

      <p>Greetings. For the entire past three years, I have been in constant sorrow, most learned Bullinger, because I have observed such a long, not to say stubborn, silence between us in writing and greeting, even though we had previously formed a friendship under the auspices of that excellent man Berchtold [Haller], inaugurated under a very fortunate star, as I thought, never to be regretted. Moreover, even if this very discord between us could somewhat weaken the spirit, you should never have completely fallen from my heart, as all good men continually praised your candor and sincerity to me, giving hope that the friendship, somewhat forgotten, would return in due time. Therefore, if you now intend to restore it with me, here I am, ready to return whatever it is, accepted as a benefit from Christ.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters: You say that I have seemed to you, until now, to think and speak rather perplexedly about the sacred Lord's Supper. It is not surprising, my excellent Bullinger, if perhaps such a thought has come to your mind. For I know how maliciously certain perplexed and indeed most deceitful men have imposed upon you and others about me in this matter, always most vainly, and not yet satisfied, they spread their poison according to their nature, corrupting the ears of my friends everywhere. But with what fairness could you suspect such a thing about me, my most sensible Bullinger, who long ago heard me openly profess my opinion on the Eucharist at the Zurich meeting? So much so, I say, that you yourself soon testified with a clear voice that the same would be rightly approved by you. Therefore, I stand firm today in the same opinion. First, relying on the truth of the Gospel, then on that orthodox confession of the Swiss churches, published in Basel some years ago in the Holy Spirit, along with the most truthful axioms of our disputation. Indeed, I not only receive and acknowledge those axioms as orthodox without reluctance, but I will also steadfastly defend them with you, to the best of my ability, against the incursions of any enemies, even to the altars. However, I do not want anyone to understand these things about me as if I have only recently or, as it is said, just three days ago come to this very opinion. Not at all, Bullinger, for according to this knowledge of the truth, I have both thought and taught for many years now, always undaunted. Nor did it escape me how, meanwhile, certain people, with their monstrous trifles, dared to slander me and mine no less boldly before your humanity, who, if they had been brothers, should have been witnesses rather than slanderers of my innocence. But the Lord will judge my cause.</p>
      <p>The gift of your commentaries, which you sent to us, I received with a joyful heart, kissing it as a pledge of a dear friend; if only I could someday repay you with something worthy of your gift! So, as I was reading through the volume, I came upon the sacred Supper of Christ, which detained me for a while as I was eager to read. I read it, however, not without desire, applying my judgment, if I had any, diligently.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I say that I found nothing in that commentary, which you prepared on the Lord's Supper (for the rest I have not yet been able to read), that I do not rightly understand to be in harmony with the truth of the Holy Scriptures and indeed with our orthodox faith. I wish, therefore, that it may be received rightly and soberly, especially by the contentious ones, whom I often see swelling with insolence on both sides, Bullinger, who immediately seize upon what was otherwise said chastely by the greatest men to arm their fury of contention more impurely. For I both believe and always teach with you that spiritual gifts in the administration of the symbols consist in no other kind of union than the sacramental reason alone. Not that we, senseless, attribute such a thing to the symbols themselves by any local inclusion or mathematical dimension, but that such heavenly gifts are received in faith by a pious heart trusting in the divine promise. I also confess with you that "Christ is bodily in heaven at the right hand of the Father and therefore in one place in heaven because of the nature of a true body," and again that "this same Christ, true God and man, is nonetheless present to his church, feeding, satisfying, and vivifying his faithful who celebrate the sacred Supper on earth not by bodily presence," but by spiritual and entirely heavenly presence, by which alone "he offers himself to be enjoyed by his own spiritually, effectively, fully, and in that very way in which he can be saving and sufficiently effective for his faithful to life," "and he himself lives in his own and his own in him," none of these mysteries being understood by the blind reason of the flesh. Therefore, he offers himself to us and presents himself with all his goods, since not faith alone, but Christ himself is our vital refreshment unto eternal life. Furthermore, I am greatly pleased that you teach that, just as with the bodily mouth they eat bread and drink wine, so with the mind and soul the guests eat the body of the Lord and drink his blood; the instrument by which they eat the sacrament is the bodily mouth, but the instrument by which they eat the very thing of the sacrament is the faith of the soul. And lest the faithful be refreshed in this Supper by mere and bare speculation alone, but also by the exhibition of spiritual things by the Lord, you rightly and necessarily add, Bullinger, saying "by faith we do not understand mere speculation, knowledge, or understanding, but at the same time the effective operation and vivification of Christ in us." For if these things were not true, how could it be believed that he offers himself to us to be eaten in the mystery, so that he might live in us and we in turn in him? For concerning the understanding of this place, where the manner of Christ's spiritual presence in the Supper is discussed, many indeed among us, inflated with too precocious knowledge, have vanished with this thought of theirs, so that they seize upon that speculative faith alone, admitting no kind of presence of Christ in the Supper. For they imagine that the Lord's Supper consists solely of this imaginary or commemorative faith among his own and is therefore only a commemoration with thanksgiving and a protestation of brotherly love.</p>
      <p>Since such people still seem to me unlearned in divine mysteries, they are accustomed to boast only of the duties they offer to Christ in his Supper, recalling too little how great the benefits of salvation they receive from him. Therefore, when they have heard something deeper about the presence and efficacy of Christ himself spiritually, they immediately twist it to that bodily presence, as if truly dragging Christ's body from heaven to earth, we bodily place it in temples, which, however, we continually profess in our public sermons to sit at the right hand of the Father according to the mode of a true body. Hence certainly and not otherwise do the most vain trifles and more than sufficiently monstrous metamorphoses fly to you, born of these authors. However, I trust that the truth will also be the daughter of time for us, when once the most wickedly idle mice, who are accustomed to obscure us falsely and wickedly before your humanity and other excellent men, will be revealed.</p>
      <p>Finally, lest anything remain rough between us anywhere or worthy of any slight cavillation, I wished to add this: Perhaps someone might say: "Can these things be consistent with themselves, while Bullinger has left it written in his commentaries: 'The sign and corporeal thing is the very action of the Supper, the bread and wine, but the signified and heavenly or spiritual thing is the very remission of sins.' But in the confession of the Swiss churches, it is read thus: 'In the Eucharist, the bread and wine are signs, but the thing is the communication of the body of the Lord, obtained salvation, and remission of sins.' Also to Luther: 'The principal thing in this sacrament is the gift of God, namely the body and blood of Christ.'" To this, I will respond thus: All the aforementioned things are consistent with themselves rightly and truly. First, who of sound mind would deny that heavenly and entirely spiritual thing, which Christ has set before his own in the Supper, to be the remission of sins, if you consider the ultimate end and fruit? For thus he says: "Which is given for you" [1 Corinthians 11:24], "which is poured out for you and for many for the remission of sins" [Matthew 26:28], which the confession rightly added, saying "obtained salvation and remission of sins." But thus again, no less orthodoxly, elsewhere with the apostle, the churches confess that the thing of the sacrament is the communication of the body of the Lord, also that the principal thing in this sacrament is the gift of God, namely the body and blood of Christ. For confessing this very thing, we do not speak so grossly of the body of Christ, as if it were present in a local or bodily condition, since under this natural habit of the body it now possesses the royal seat of heaven; but to that extent, we teach that the body of Christ is the thing of the sacrament or its communication in this assembly, as far as it was broken for us on the cross, now indeed contemplated and eaten in the mystery of faith by spiritual communication alone, "in that way," I say, "in which it can be saving and effective for life for his faithful." Therefore, in this way, there can be no controversy, in my judgment, for us, whether you say that the thing itself of the sacrament is the remission of sins as the price for sins perfected and the most consummate end, or also the very body of the Lord as the medium and preparation of eternal salvation prepared for all believers through this broken body and shed blood.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you have here my opinion in a certain simple profession, but yet sincere in all respects, so that you have nothing to fear anywhere of deceit or trickery.</p>
      <p>I also trust that I neither think nor teach anything obscurely or more perplexedly, nor more grossly, but stand with you in this matter, feeling the same in the Lord Jesus and his Holy Spirit, in whom I wish you to prosper happily always.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 20, 1542.</p>
      <p>Master Eberhard von Rümlang, as he is of discerning judgment, has acted excellently in faith between you and me; for he promised you nothing about me that you do not see declared from the heart in my letters.</p>
      <p>P. Kunz, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Write back.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurichers, most esteemed brother and friend in the Lord.</p>
