      <p>On the second day of November, envoys from both sides departed from the assembly to report to their kings what had been done and were to return after two days. All the tension is in Calais, for which both sides are striving greatly; however, the Frenchman cuts off all hope of restitution. He was dealing more gently with the Duke of Savoy, and it already seemed that the marriage was settled, so that he would receive an annual 80,000 francs in France, and the king, besides the territories of Montferrat and Saluzzo, which do not pertain to the Duke of Savoy, would retain not all the fortresses as had been negotiated, but only five. The armies on both sides had already been disbanded, and the Duke of Württemberg had led the German cavalry to safety with the Saxon; from there they had returned to France, and it was hoped that an alliance would be contracted between them, so that the Saxon, already the son-in-law of the other, would reside in France, being very dear to the king and to be co-opted into the highest order, unless some unknown sacred matters impede. With the French captive princes, it was already settled regarding the letters, that the fleet commander, called the admiral, would pay 25,000 gold coins immediately, and 20,000 within a year; the cavalry commander, the marshal of St. André, fifty thousand, and the constable himself, if peace follows, would add one hundred thousand, but if peace does not follow, fifty thousand. In Milan, justice was done for Charles V; for this purpose, 20,000 gold coins were spent or at least collected from the people for this reason.</p>
