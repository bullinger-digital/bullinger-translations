      <p>There is no news with us except for many flying rumors, of which I cannot write or bother you with. Recently, someone from Gottlieben told me that on the last Sunday, the boys from Hemmenhofen went to Steckborn on the ice over the lake and played the drums or trumpets in the manner of landsknechts. Since the boys from Steckborn heard this, they also went against them, wrote to them that they should not beat the drums in such a manner on their ground, to which the others responded with harsh words, challenging them to come to them and fight with them, etc. Thus, the boys from Steckborn finally dared to cross the frozen ford and attacked the others, beat them badly, and put them to flight, so that one boy was left dead on the spot. They had nothing but sticks, etc. These are wonderful things and strange omens, etc.</p>
      <p>A very good, honest, and distinguished man writes here that the Pope has rejected all articles from the Emperor, which he had proposed to him, namely that he should 1. come in person to Trent or Bologna, 2. submit to the council, 3. agree to elect another Pope, so that if he were to die during the council, a new pontiff would be immediately available, 4. send his scholars immediately to Augsburg, so that they might confer with the other scholars before the council.</p>
      <p>The Emperor continues to gather many people. What he has in mind cannot be known for certain, as there are so many different and unequal things said about the matters; however, it will not remain hidden for much longer.</p>
