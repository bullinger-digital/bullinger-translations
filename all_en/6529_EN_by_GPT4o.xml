      <p>Greetings. I have just now received your letter from the inn "Ciconia" and I am handing it over to the most honorable Mr. Orbesius, the royal envoy in Solothurn, who promised to send it via the post or an Italian, who walks with a staff, otherwise a handsome man; you will write from whom you received it. I am quite well now, I do not know for how long; but it is well, I am in the hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Do not let your business be a worry for you; I hope it will be successfully completed soon. There is no plague among us except hidden; one or two have been consumed by it; in the neighboring fields, many are dying.</p>
      <p>Dr. Thomas Sch√∂ppffius, the chief physician in Bern, wrote a few days ago that there is hope for Haller, that with God's help he will overcome the disease.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord to preserve him for the church and his children. I am very sorry about the unfortunate episcopal matter, both because of you, who are tormented by it, and because of the church.</p>
      <p>Let us pray that the Lord does not punish our ingratitude and our inability to repent of our lives on this occasion. You watch and do what true piety suggests; we will support you with prayers as you struggle.</p>
      <p>I know, I know, what kind of people you are dealing with, having experienced it more often than I would like. Endure and persevere.</p>
      <p>You will have them as friends again in due time or, if not, have the best friend in God, etc. You report a strange, but not unexpected thing about the discovered letters of the bishop.</p>
      <p>These experiences teach us that we should not trust people further than we can see them, and that we should pray: deliver us from visible and invisible evil. I could not obtain any certainty about the Lucerne assembly from the royal envoy; from the Five Cantons themselves, I have that a treaty with the pope has been concluded in the name of all devils; for in God's name it cannot be well.</p>
      <p>Lussius was there, returned from Rome.</p>
      <p>About this matter another time, just this now: Peace cannot be maintained where the pope's counsels are heard and received, because he is the worst, etc.</p>
      <p>That treaty will also benefit the Beatenberg parties, unless the pulpifex has contributed his vote to Saliceo. Friends in Augsburg write that things in Hungary are going badly against the Turks.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere letters are written about victories as well as about Malta; I hope we do not hear very different things soon. I also gave the example of Daniel and the Epitomes to your relative Rudolf; I hope he has taken good care of everything. I deposit this pledge with you for the sake of friendship; I have never written a book with greater labor, and yet it is not copious.</p>
      <p>If it pleases you and all good people, I thank God, if otherwise, I will ask for forgiveness, etc. I write this hastily with the messenger waiting, who almost snatched this from my hands.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and friends, and also the consuls. Ask the envoy to share with you what I give to him.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 8th of September 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
