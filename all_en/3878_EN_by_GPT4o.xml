      <p>Greetings and Peace. I received your letter dated December 22 of the last year, my esteemed lord, with a willing mind. However, I received with displeasure what I read therein; that is, that some have written to you once and again, claiming that I disdained to receive your letters. Indeed, I never disdain to read anyone's letters, especially yours.</p>
      <p>For it would be arrogance (in my judgment) to despise the letters of such a learned and serious man. However, as long as our Queen Mary reigned here, who was quite fierce and superstitious, I feared so much for my possessions, my dangers, indeed even my life, that I scarcely dared to write to those like you, or to receive writings from them. You say, man's fall is easy, and we all err in many things.</p>
      <p>It is therefore not surprising if I too have stumbled, and began to revere and fear men more than was proper, and even to accept certain things from which I had greatly recoiled many years before. I was led to this by the reading of certain volumes of the holy Fathers, in which, if I am not mistaken, there are some doctrines that are handed down by the consensus of almost all of them, which are not at all consistent with your doctrine and that of similar minds. However, I do not wish to write more about these things, because if you were to respond to my writings, I hardly have the time to reply, nor does it please me. It is so troublesome for me to write in Latin, and now almost obsolete.</p>
      <p>For I am not now among learned men who express themselves in the Latin language. I am certainly very grateful to you for deeming me worthy to be reminded of how I have known that grace and mercy are most abundant with the Lord, who does not reject those returning to Him, but kindly receives them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I confess to the Lord what has been sinned by me so far; I give glory to the Lord, I implore the Lord's mercy as you advise: nor do I doubt that I will obtain it. I will see to it that in the future I am faithful, and that I promote true religion (the greatest part of which is contained in the confession of faith presented to the most invincible Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530) with all my strength, as you advise. I pray that you commend me to Master Peter Martyr, to Julius his servant, and to your most honorable wife.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her heartfelt greetings to you and all of them, and prays for much health for you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>London, the last day of February, 1559. Yours, Richard Hilles, Englishman.</p>
      <p>As for religion, by royal mandate, silence has been imposed on the Catholic (as they are called) preachers, and ample liberty has been granted to the Evangelicals to preach three times in each week of this Lent before the Queen herself, and to prove their teachings from the Holy Scriptures. Also, for almost six weeks now, a public assembly, or the common council of this kingdom, or (as our people call it) parliament, has been convened. However, nothing certain has yet been publicly done about abolishing papal superstition and restoring purer Christian religion.</p>
      <p>There is, however, great hope among all our faithful citizens of the aforementioned parliament, and other pious men, that all sacred matters will soon be reformed either to the form that was recently in the time of King Edward VI, or to that which is in the aforementioned Augsburg Confession, presented by the Protestant princes of Germany. The letters will be delivered to the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed friend. ZÃ¼rich in Switzerland.</p>
