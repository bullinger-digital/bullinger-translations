      <p>Greetings. You are very blessed, my Bullinger, as the Lord has adorned you with the unique gifts of great skill and craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I saw your younger son, and through his familiar conversation, I was so refreshed by a certain singular sweetness and piety that I can scarcely express it. I pray to Christ that He may preserve and promote this branch of His church and that it may be declared in him that the saying "the sons of heroes are a disgrace" is not true. I hope that even after your passing, you will live on through him; therefore, I also wish to be his friend.</p>
      <p>From France, we hear that under the auspices of the Guise family, 20 banners of infantry with a proper number of cavalry are set to depart for Scotland to bring the kingdom under full control and undoubtedly to oppress the Christians and extinguish the seeds of emerging piety there. But the Lord is the Lord of Hosts, by whose mere nod great schemes can be scattered.</p>
      <p>The people of Trier have acted with their adversaries in such a way that they demonstrate by their actions that they seek nothing beyond Christ; six of the city's leading citizens have offered themselves as hostages to the adversaries to solidly confirm that nothing seditious will be done or has been done on their part, and although two keys were assigned to each side, they willingly granted one to the adversaries. They affirm that this has been done so that they may obtain the requested freedom of religion even without bloodshed. It is said for certain that Emperor Ferdinand has restored the former rights to the Swabian cities regarding the guilds and the election of magistrates; however, they should be called quarters, not guilds. If you have any news from Italy, I beg you to let me know.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with your wife, children, and all your household. Basel, October 29, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed and beloved lord and colleague.</p>
