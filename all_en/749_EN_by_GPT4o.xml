      <p> Greetings. At this hour, after I received your letter, dearest compadre in the Lord, Bullinger, I approached the treasurer Haller regarding the matter of Mr. Haller, our compadre, to finally resolve it, and I explained to him what you wrote to me. He responded in this manner: "In his opinion, he thinks that in this matter nothing can be done here in a council unless he himself is present in the council; however, he cannot yet. Therefore, he knows nothing to handle here until he is back on his feet, but he hopes soon; because even if he speaks with Mr. Haller about what his will and opinion are, it is only half done, since he cannot yet personally handle it in the council. But if you have a way that you prefer, you can write to him with a special messenger; he will pay the messenger his fee, etc." This is roughly the summary of what that man responded to me. He added that he has not yet forgotten what you wrote to him. As for me, I cannot sufficiently marvel at this delay and negligence in the cause of the Church of Christ; I anxiously fear that what happened to our churches by the most just judgment of the Lord of all may also happen to yours. Otherwise, my house is still peaceful after the passing of Judith, my daughter, about whom I wrote earlier. Regarding Eusebius, whom I sent, there is no need for you to give such great thanks. If only I could respond to the kindness you and yours have shown to the exiles. Very sad news is being written about English affairs. If you receive any certain information, I pray you share it. Farewell excellently, most esteemed of men. Greetings to all yours and the brothers and lords, to Mr. Pellican, the most venerable elder, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gualther, and your entire [Greek], also to our Gervasius, for whom I earnestly wish to finally be consulted in some way. All of mine greet you. </p>
      <p> Bern, December 2, 1549. </p>
      <p> Greetings also to Mr. Butler and the treasurer of Neuburg. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your compadre in the Lord. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest compadre in the Lord. </p>
