      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, I have received your friendly letter with delay, and I thank you for it and all good things most dutifully. The letters to Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Kempten I dispatched on January 30th. I hope that what I sent to you on Will has also reached you; for the captain is here today, who informs me that it has been delivered with certain dispatch. I should write you a reply, but I have not been able to; for I have been busy all this morning in the monastery, which I cannot avoid.</p>
      <p>With God's help, it shall happen hereafter; for I am waiting for letters from Augsburg as of today. May the Lord grant all good things. Amen. It is otherwise certain that the Spaniards have slipped before Haarlem, both commanders shot dead. The princes and electors of the Evangelical confession are to come together again. On Monday, I will see that I write to you at length, with a request to take it kindly. How it goes with the pious Bishop of Zell, you will have heard before. I commend you and yours to the protection of the Almighty. Our dear Lord preachers send their greetings to you and all known gentlemen. In ill.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my honorable, beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
