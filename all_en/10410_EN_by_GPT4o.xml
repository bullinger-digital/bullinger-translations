    <p xml:id="regest1">The events of the time are certainly known to Bullinger; Duke Ulrich of Württemberg must be cautious in his campaign against his strong opponents. Seger would like to move to Zurich and asks Bullinger to secure him a minor position as a convinced Protestant; he does not want to accept anything in the Five Places, even though he would have the opportunity to do so.</p>

      <p>Learned and beloved brother in the Lord, the unusual events currently unfolding are known to you, etc. Also, the Duke of Württemberg is in the field, he must be cautious, his adversaries are becoming too strong for him. May God let His will be done; He can help His own.</p>
      <p>As for me, I would like to move to Zurich. Consider that it is based on God's word. It is no less: My property might not suffice, although I still have 600 gulden of my own goods. I would like to approach you as a convinced Protestant, considering, also in terms of morals, as I am a special case, to see if perhaps my gracious lords of Zurich might offer me a small position, so that I might have sustenance there for myself, my wife, and a child. For I tell you this: If I were to hold to the devil's morals, I would easily find a place in the Five Places; it is settled with me. I ask you, as my gracious, dear lord and brother, to consider me and send me a reply with this messenger.</p>
      <p>Given in Maienfeld, 19th day of May, in the year 1534. Your willing</p>
      <p>Martin Seger.</p>
      <p>To the learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious, dear lord and brother in the Lord, to be delivered.</p>
