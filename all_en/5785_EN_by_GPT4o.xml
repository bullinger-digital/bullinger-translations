      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>If ever I learned from reading, meditation, and preaching what the Catholic Church is, now certainly I have learned more from experience than from knowledge.</p>
      <p>To get straight to the point, what reason did you, along with your fellow ministers, have to assist us here in Poland in these struggles, which we eagerly engage in, if not this common kinship we have from Christ?</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue not only to encourage your own people but also us and ours through sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.</p>
      <p>As for me, my dear Bullinger, I am especially grateful to you above others, for allowing yourself to be persuaded by my letters at the beginning to take up our cause and the common struggle by the grace of God without hesitation.</p>
      <p>For this care for us, which has kept and continues to keep you concerned, we acknowledge that we owe you much, and future generations will owe you as well.</p>
      <p>Now, when the matter is of utmost importance and we see that not only the words, which the church has used without contradiction until now, are in dispute, but the very doctrine of God and therefore the Christian faith is also called into question, who would want you, my Bullinger, to be granted a rude dismissal, so that you withdraw from these arduous and harsh struggles? Indeed, all your training, to which you have been devoted throughout your vocation, must be directed here, and all your strength and counsel must be brought to bear, so that you, along with other most excellent men who have received the firstfruits of the spirit in these times, may be present for the exceedingly endangered Church of Christ, especially here in the Kingdom of Poland, where apart from the Holy Scripture and the authority of the Word of God, no other defense remains for us.</p>
      <p>For, to inform you of these matters once, know that we, who strive to publish the Gospel of Christ, are not recognized by our king and his officials as their own, and therefore, whatever injury we are provoked and affected by, they consider it not to concern them, so if the nobility did not take us in, no place would be left for us in Poland.</p>
      <p>You can easily imagine how we must act with our people in any controversy about religion.</p>
      <p>However, although I do not doubt that you know what this doctrine is, which has disturbed our church in these times, yet so that you may know the matter more deeply, I could not refrain from informing you of everything that is happening here.</p>
      <p>Two synods were held by our people almost at the same time, one in Kraków in Lesser Poland, the other on the borders of Lithuania in the town of Prince Radziwiłł called Mordy, I attended both synods.</p>
      <p>Those who follow Blandrata, although they conceal their author, in the Kraków synod refused to acknowledge or issue any confession of faith other than the Bible and the Apostles' Creed, about which we are in perfect agreement.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they did not want to subscribe to these articles, which their leader, a certain Gregory Paul, issued, along with the author himself, and thus they cut off all opportunity for us to proceed further with them, refusing to acknowledge and embrace the words commonly used by the fathers and the church.</p>
      <p>Again, in Mordy, they indeed reject the words but embrace these creeds, namely the Apostolic, Nicene, and Constantinopolitan.</p>
      <p>However, they say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not one God, but only the Father, and that Christ is God, namely the Son of God, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, but is sent by both and is therefore the spirit of both, because it is sent by both, not because it proceeds from both.</p>
      <p>This is their opinion.</p>
      <p>To give my judgment on these matters, I am inclined to think that those who follow Blandrata's opinion rightly resolve the doctrine of the Trinity, but err greatly in composing it.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Stancari's composition could be tolerable, even if he poorly arranges the construction of the words, but he errs excessively in resolving it.</p>
      <p>They distinguish substantially when they say the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, but they compose in an accident, as they do not dare to acknowledge three gods, even if they intend this, nor do they want to confess one, but say there are three, that is, unanimous and concordant.</p>
      <p>Stancari, in his composition, arranges the sentence so that God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that he is one, but when the sentence is to be resolved so that three persons shine forth, he falls back on an accident and leaves nothing to distinction except the relations, which he acknowledges as persons.</p>
      <p>What drives him astray is that he does not want to acknowledge the Son of God, true God and man, as our intercessor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he establishes invocation so that he invokes God the Trinity in the name of Christ the mediator only as a man, and prays to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Now we see here the divine nature being extended to five quite impiously.</p>
      <p>They, in turn, establish their invocation so that when they invoke the Father, they deny that anything pertains to the Son and the Holy Spirit, even if they admit that they ask through the Son in the Holy Spirit, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I conclude that both those who think that Scripture always speaks distinctly of God and those who always urge composition so that they admit no resolution or distinction of doctrine, err.</p>
      <p>For it is certain that God did not reveal himself from the beginning in such a way that no place was left for clearer revelation, as God himself testifies that he revealed himself to the fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in this name, God Almighty; but in his name Jehovah, he was not known to them.</p>
      <p>And yet they had sufficient knowledge of God, so that it entirely sufficed for their salvation.</p>
      <p>However, since the knowledge of God consists for us from creation and from the revelation of the word, I see that we are first naturally led to this, and when we hear a discourse about God, we immediately understand the Father, then by proceeding we are led to the knowledge of the Son, and with both known, the spirit of both shines upon us.</p>
      <p>Now if we seek testimonies about each person, the Scriptures abundantly teach us that this is due to each, that they are God.</p>
      <p>Now to conclude that there are three gods, as you truly say there are three, is impious and can be proven by no example, it remains therefore that we acknowledge that the three are one God, that is, the divine nature and majesty, which consists eternally without beginning and without end.</p>
      <p>But when there is a discourse about justification or any other doctrine of salvation, the Father is God, the Son is the mediator, the Holy Spirit is the perpetual comforter of God's elect.</p>
      <p>The holy fathers, beautifully imitating Paul, called this treatment of doctrine a dispensation.</p>
      <p>What I think about the doctrine of mediation, although it may already be easily apparent from here, I am sending you my latest response against Stancari's letters, with which he constantly urged me to follow his camp, from which I was freed with great loss of my possessions.</p>
      <p>This response will be delivered to you by the noble Hieronymus Makoviczky, the captain and curator of the younger Radziwiłł, to whom I also ask you, my Bullinger, to show yourself accommodating.</p>
      <p>I especially commend to you my relative Nicolaus Kula and wish you to show him how much you value my love for you and mine.</p>
      <p>I will write to you about other matters when I have a more convenient opportunity.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May God keep you and your household safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given in Oransko, June 24, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, Alexander Vitrelinus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and upright man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich [...] and most esteemed brother in Christ, to be delivered.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
