      <p>Greetings, Brother Heinrich Bullinger. What I promised to do, namely to write to you once more before I leave, I am doing. Farewell then, pray for me with the whole church. The reason for my departure is that the Duke of Prussia is at odds with the majority of his own court, I mean his intimate advisors, and therefore he requested from my duke to send me there; for he hopes for something, I know not what, from such a small man. But there is also another reason of no less importance, which will not be entrusted to letters. The Duke has read, as I know, your book; nothing with me but good words, with others as well. His people also praise it, especially Sebastian Koch, the tutor of the young prince.</p>
      <p>Regarding your other booklet, namely on the Eucharist, they say it is very moderate, Calvin's is too sharp, Ochino's is urbane. But listen to the rest in this genre. A Lasco came to the court, directly to the prince, and requested to be admitted to confer with Brenz and the other theologians. He was admitted, and they debated for almost four hours with utmost modesty on both sides. The prince received the man with all clemency, and soon also gave him a not insignificant gift. But from the debate, no fruit has appeared so far. I was not present at the debate, because I had arrived late from Tübingen, but afterwards, I assisted that most venerable man with whatever services I could. I will see him again now; for I am traveling through Frankfurt, then directly to Melanchthon, then to Augustus, and furthermore to the Elector of Brandenburg; I have business with all of them. Through these places, I once traveled with the pomp of the Antichrist, now I will proceed as if led in triumph by Christ, to be a spectacle to all those peoples. Give thanks to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Five Germans have been captured by the Elector Palatine, who were Turkish spies; they confessed, when asked if they have more companions, they deny it, if in Italy, they deny it, because, they say, the Turks boast that the Pope is a good friend of theirs.</p>
      <p>The play is beautifully adorned: From the diet, all the Protestant princes want to complain most seriously and remonstrate with the Venetians, who allow such books to be printed in their republic (I am sending some to you). There are those who think the play is being acted at my instigation; perhaps it is so, and I am not ashamed.</p>
      <p>I am sending annotations on the Catalog; please read carefully; there will be something that pleases, I suppose.</p>
      <p>I command you to hope for the best; for except for the Turkish cause, there is no suspicion (among those who understand the matter) of any military inconvenience. Frederick is entirely occupied in defending Pannonia, indeed Austria, the Emperor is to migrate to his Spain in the month of July; for he is thus compelled. Maximilian to him, before he leaves the Netherlands, together with his wife. All is peaceful, I say, throughout Germany, thanks be to God.</p>
      <p>I have no more to write in this farewell. Pray to your three sons-in-law, that they may pray for me, indeed also to Mr. Rudolf Gwalther and the remaining colleagues and brothers. Meanwhile, you have taken Martyr to the Elector Palatine. O good men, may it be beneficial! But indeed it would have been more beneficial with this one; so I feel. He writes to me that he will go to restore the school, if he is summoned; but he will hardly be called, if the prince knows he will not remain with him, or he will not return him to you, if he comes. May the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ increase heavenly gifts to you all.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, June 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger</p>
