      <p>S. I recently promised, most reverend father, that I would write to you more fully about everything. But why should I so impudently trouble you, who are so greatly occupied with our affairs and little matters?</p>
      <p>I will write a few and more important things. I have certainly taken up the cause of Mr. Froschauer, as it is both yours and mine; I am very ready to serve him and I am glad to have found the opportunity to serve, although I would have preferred that he had already recovered his property without labor and danger. However, I am certain that he will not suffer any loss regarding this debtor. We have arranged matters so that all the booksellers' goods are examined, noted, and the bulk of the books placed in a barrel, brought back to the court, and kept there until we know whether Mr. Froschauer, having received the books, will be satisfied; for there is a great abundance of them, and without a doubt, both Mr. Froschauer and Mr. Gesner can be satisfied from them, if they wish; otherwise, the house will be sold or something else, until everyone is satisfied. But I have written everything to Mr. Froschauer. - Our synod recently succeeded happily with a great gathering of brothers. I proposed to them the danger and cunning of the enemies in expelling the exiles from Mesocco. It was concluded to make it known to the lords of the Three Leagues. I did so. We obtained from them that the old decree concerning the reception of pious exiles driven from Italy should be observed, renewed, and confirmed. Everything was done. Meanwhile, there is no one who takes action against those authors who rashly and improperly attempted to exterminate the Mesocco people against the manifest sanctions of the lords. All are silent and do not even murmur; such is the power and tyranny of certain men. May the Lord destroy them and deign to confound their plans.</p>
      <p>We also obtained from the lords that all throughout Rhaetia, who refuse to join either religion, evangelical or papal, should be expelled from the Leagues. Thus, I think, the way will be closed to heretics and Arianism, which seemed to be sprouting in Chiavenna. We also petitioned on behalf of the people of Gardun, about whom I wrote to you before, that the Tyrants might remain.</p>
      <p>But all in vain. They are forced to withdraw from the Tyrant and conduct their affairs elsewhere in Rhaetia, wherever they wish. If the whole synod had not intervened, they might perhaps have been expelled from the Leagues. But that wolf, whom I mentioned recently, was forced to hide his poison and restrain his rage somewhat, lest he make himself more manifest and gain credibility for his tyranny, which he wished to exercise over the Mesocco people. - The royal legate was admitted as an ally and confederate in these assemblies and previously as a citizen of Chur. Now many Italians are present in the name of the entire Valtellina Valley, who, with the consent of the Rhaetians, unload their grievances, with which they are burdened by the presidents, into the bosom of their compatriots and seek remedy and assistance against such oppressors. It is a strange thing that these burdens are imposed by the magistrate and then those burdened are allowed to lodge a complaint against the magistrate with the communities. Indeed, by this very thing, they abundantly testify what kind of benefactors and shepherds they are. - From Italy, there is nothing particularly worthy of writing. It is widely rumored that the Venetians have been not insignificantly harmed by the Turk; however, the famine, which has so far miserably pressed Italy, is now said to be easing and being alleviated, as this year's grain is arriving from the Kingdom of Cyprus. About other matters, another time.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your faith and fatherhood, O golden star and most splendid light of the whole world. All the brothers who were at the synod also greet you singularly, and they wish you all healthful things, and that you may be able to provide yourself as a father and leader to us all for a long time, they earnestly and ardently pray to the Lord with common prayers. Mr. Consul, Pontisella, Charles, etc., also greet you. - I almost omitted what happened with colleague Gantner. It is true: he has now publicly resigned from his office four times impudently and has resigned his function; but so far he has always wanted to be brought back to the pulpit with many entreaties.</p>
      <p>However, this last time the senate decided not to ask him anymore; but they wanted to explore what I would advise them, having been called. I replied that I was unaware of the reason he pretends for his inconstancy; therefore, I said I could not respond or advise anything certain, but I would be prepared to admonish him once more about his duty and to explore more deeply what reason he has for acting thus. So they chose Polytarch and Pontisella, who, with me, would handle this matter with him, though without entreaties. We admonished the man; but he pretended nothing else except that he was accused and charged with avarice by everyone; therefore, lest anyone think he receives a stipend out of avarice, he would rather forego it, so that all may see and experience in reality how content he wishes to be with his own affairs. Then he also criticized the ways of this world at length and how in these four years, during which he has labored in the Lord's vineyard, he has accomplished nothing at all; therefore, he would cease and let another cease, who might perhaps reap more abundant fruits from this office; he would not at all close the way and access to them. The sum is: he imagines for himself, in the manner of certain fanatics, a new land, in which a new justice should reign, and he promises himself such perfection, which he will never find in this old age of the world. It is strange, however, that he can reach this point, who, if he were to examine his own bosom and the recesses of his heart, would perceive much imperfection; but he has this in common with other Anabaptists, who, not acknowledging or seeing their own sins and errors, always have the sins of others before their eyes. I am not alone, but many other brothers and among others Mr. Campell, Mr. Concius, very learned men, think that he contracted this vice from the excessive familiarity he contracted with the bookseller. For on the very day when, by decree of the senate, that seducer was to be eliminated and banished by the oath of allegiance, the colleague met him in his house, conferred with him, lamented his fate, and immediately the next day, which was Sunday, openly contradicted the decree and senate's decision from the pulpit, as if they were expelling holy men and harboring scoundrels. But however these things may be, having departed from him, we hoped for a response the next day. Behold, however: when everyone promised themselves that he would respond modestly, he finally sends a note through his girl from his estate to me, in which he affirms that he still persists in his purpose and wants to demonstrate by deeds that he has done nothing out of avarice so far. I presented the response to Mr. Consul; the senate asked me to be occupied with appointing another colleague for myself. I replied that I would do nothing here without your advice, and since three from our Rhaetia were present and among them Mr. Campell, who would have taken up that function, we decided to act, having invoked your advice, as to which one should be chosen. Meanwhile, Gantner omitted two sermons, which he should have delivered in the required order; which I was forced to deliver in such great turmoil, with such a great gathering of brothers. But when the wretched man saw me nevertheless proceeding so vigorously in my office and perhaps had learned from his own that the church had also been entrusted to me by the lords to be fed, until either Mr. Pontisella or Mr. Campell or someone else by your advice had been appointed by us, he came to me of his own accord a few days later and asked for new advice on how to act. I replied: 'You are a strange man, my Gantner; did we not sufficiently admonish you in the previous days about what you should do; why do you not do your duty? Proceed, etc.' Thus he made himself suitable again of his own accord, who had just decided to live a private life. It was permitted to him by the lords; but let him see to it that he is not found such further.</p>
      <p>For I would not want to bear him any longer, but rather, etc. I have written these things to you more prolixly than was necessary. I beg you, forgive me; for I wrote everything in great haste and did not reread it. June 5, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most submissive and obedient Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary and most faithful bishop of the renowned Church of Zurich, his most honorable father.</p>
