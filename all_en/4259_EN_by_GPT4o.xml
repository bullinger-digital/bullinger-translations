      <p>Greetings. I received the book against the Anabaptists published by you, for which I thank your kindness and send what Jakob Andreae wrote against Staphylus; they are grieved by what you wrote about the WÃ¼rttemberg visitors. Indeed, what you stated about the corrupt state of all orders and the true consolation in all adversities, the same opinion stands with me regarding these matters and will stand, with God's favor, perpetually. Theobald Schwarz from Strasbourg informed me of some joyful news from France, namely that letters from France were brought to Johann Sturm and others, in which it is reported that many thousands of nobles presented petitions to the king, asking him to allow the free preaching of the Gospel; hence, soon all captives for the sake of religion were released and the tranquility of that kingdom is hoped for; however, the Cardinal of Lorraine with the Parisian Senate complained that they were too harsh on the Lutherans (as if everything was not done by his command). Furthermore, the King of Navarre has established the preaching of the Gospel throughout his entire kingdom. Our merchants say that there is considerable turmoil in France because of religion, so much so that even the king fears for himself. The most atrocious war rumors were being spread a little while ago, but now they have completely fallen silent.</p>
      <p>It is certain, however, that the Papists attempted something, but several obstacles intervened, so that they could not accomplish what they wanted, as they wanted. Indeed, when I consider the state of the entire republic and even the church everywhere, it seems to me that the mass of Nebuchadnezzar is clearly subsiding in itself as if it is about to vanish. You advised C. Singer to delay the comparison of icons for a while, and you did well; however, I think he will send something to me as soon as he has acquired it; I ask you to greet him very much in my name. What you mentioned about our emperor is also being said among us for a long time, but not openly. Indeed, by inquiring, I have not yet been able to ascertain for certain where or what the king is doing; however, I am expecting news from the one who brought your last letter (for he has now gone to Vienna, Austria), to see what he will bring about this matter. I hardly think such a thing could have been concealed for so long.</p>
      <p>The same messenger reported to me that a large part of the Appenzell region was burned by some accident; I am not glad about anyone's misfortune, as it is not fitting; however, I see that everything is being sent in such a way that those willing can benefit from it, while those resisting, blinded, bring destruction and ruin upon themselves. Farewell, venerable man, whom I wish to serve from the heart, if I can in any way. Given in Augsburg, April 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Georg von Stetten the Younger.</p>
