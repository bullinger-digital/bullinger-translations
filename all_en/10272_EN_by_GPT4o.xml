In the second session, the pastor-judges of marriage were also heard; the result is still unknown. Haller sends Bullinger a letter from Sebastian Meyer, in which Bullinger is praised. He learned what Megander Leo Jud wrote about the people of Constance. Haller urges Bullinger to visit.</p>

      <p>On July 13th, which was a Sunday, the citizens were gathered; nothing was decided. Mockery and displeasure were shown because of the decision. On Monday, July 14th, we came before the council and citizens, urging them to consider the matter. What was decided, I do not know at this hour.</p>
      <p>Herewith I send you a letter from Doctor Sebastian Meyer, who was my first assistant in Bern and was expelled from there, from which you will understand the judgment of others about you, so that I may not seem to flatter you, provided that you are not offended by those who speak the truth about you. If you wish, return this letter.</p>
      <p>We have received from Constance what Megander Leo Jud wrote. In summary: God let me live to see the day that I see you, hear you, and speak with you. Make time for yourself, not just to stay with me for one day, but for 4, 5, or 8 days.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>July 14th, at the eleventh hour before noon.</p>
      <p>Your same B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
