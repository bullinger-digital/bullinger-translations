    <p xml:id="regest1">Is disappointed with the outcome of the [Frankfurt] meeting, but confident about the stance of the people of Konstanz and some others. [Martin] Bucer considers the result shameful for all involved and believes that the Peace of Nuremberg, the threatened fellow believers, and the legal claim of the [Protestant] churches have been betrayed; however, the announced religious discussion could expose the dishonesty of the opponents and strengthen the cause of the [Protestant] churches. Blarer does not share the confidence regarding the religious discussion and will express this opinion [together with Johannes Zwick] in writing to the council; Bullinger should prevent [Joachim] Vadian, [Simon] Grynaeus, and others from getting involved in the opponents' intrigues. Grynaeus has written to him, hoping for advantages for the Protestants from a public religious discussion, and Blarer knows Vadian's opinion from his letter to Zwick. Will reluctantly travel to Augsburg the following day. Zwick will send Bullinger a copy of their [submission to the council]; asks to return it to Gervasius [Schuler], who also has news from Leipzig. Greetings. Urges confidential treatment of their writing; has also sent a copy to Grynaeus. The council will probably hear them the next day.</p>

      <p>It is as you write, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, our great expectations of our heroes have completely deceived us; however, the most certain promise of the heavenly Father does not deceive, who will not allow such a good cause, truly His own, to fall, no matter what unworthy things these people may have planned in the meantime. I am led by many arguments to hope that our people of Konstanz will never fail their name or honor, although we receive with great joy that not only they, but also some others, whose hearts God has touched, are contemplating Christian steadfastness here. However, I do not doubt that you have recently learned everything from my brother. I would not dare to rashly suspect who the authors of this foolish plan, or rather betrayal, are, because this lamentable and shameful outcome of the assembly and the somewhat unmanly spirit of our people, to say nothing more severe, pains everyone or seems to pain them, which indeed, as I could most truly, I would most gladly say.</p>
      <p>Bucer recently wrote to me among other things: "The outcome and the sum of the actions were such that it shames and embarrasses both the emperor's orator and the conciliating princes as well as us. But all this happened so fatefully that you could clearly see the Lord had decided to humble us but not to abandon us." And after a few words: "As far as we are concerned, we have betrayed the peace given to the states of the empire at Nuremberg, since we received these truces through the intercession of the king and the conciliating princes as a free and new gift, which were expressly sanctioned and confirmed to us in that peace of Nuremberg by the emperor and the states of the empire at Regensburg. We have betrayed our brothers the fraternal help and the common aid of the empire, which we owe them by the pact of public peace, 'des landfridens', by admitting the condition that we should not receive anyone into our league. For even if the orator promised that no one should be harmed or burdened for the sake of religion, we know, however, what they will do. And we, while we are not strongly urged by the society of the league to help our brothers with some risk to our affairs, what will we do when no special obligation of the league incites us? And our league is nothing else than a more certain pact to provide that help to those harmed or endangered for the sake of religion, which we owe to every Christian and citizen of the empire from the society of Christ and the common empire. Finally, we have betrayed the churches their right and confirmed to their enemies their sacrilege by accepting that we will take nothing from them of their sacrilege. However, although all these things have been done miserably and impiously, it will be ours to consider the Lord's counsel in this our fall and to grieve over our sins in such a way that we do not accumulate them. Christ will raise those who have fallen and will strengthen those who have wavered [...]. That about the assembly, if we do not fail ourselves, could both greatly increase our spirits and greatly depress those of our adversaries. For whether they try to evade this promise or prevaricate during the proceedings or whether the assembly and the just action succeed as agreed, the cause of the churches will be better, the cause of their enemies worse.</p>
      <p>For if they evade or prevaricate, they will drive many to us; if they act, many will be brought to us by the truth heard and explained. For we can easily defend our own, with which intact, it will be a gain whatever they add to us" etc.</p>
      <p>This is Bucer, from which you can easily gather how badly the affairs of the church, so unhappily conducted, affect him. However, regarding the assembly, I fear that I cannot subscribe to his judgment, for this dilemma of his can easily be turned in the opposite direction, about which you will soon understand our opinion. For what we think about this whole assembly, we will declare to our senate in a written document in the next few days; which I will then take care that you also read. Here, move every stone, so that Vadian, Grynaeus, and whatever there is of the best and most learned men among the Swiss, do not allow themselves to be deceived by these tricks. For the adversaries are entirely focused on this, that having explored all the talents and opinions of everyone, they may have more prepared means of oppressing and extinguishing us, however much they may dissemble and with one hand show bread, which our people do not understand well enough, and it is to be feared that they may someday pay heavy penalties for their imprudence.</p>
      <p>Our Grynaeus, among other things, responded to my letters sent to him in this way: "While I did not very much approve or disapprove of the other conditions, it nevertheless seemed most useful that if ever we were to contend with the adversaries about religion in the presence of those present and in the sight of those who should have recognized these things long ago. Thus it can be known whether they are held by error or whether they intend to oppress the good cause obstinately. But what dangers and inconveniences there are in this matter, I certainly did not consider." At the end, he adds: "It seems to me thus: If we will confer, we will make this public and final testimony before kings and princes, then, with God giving and the consent of men, we will pursue our cause better." I clearly understand what our incomparable Vadian thinks here from his letters given to our Zwick. May the Lord, whose business is being conducted here, grant us such spirits by which His name may be sanctified in this world.</p>
      <p>I am preparing myself for the journey, setting out for Augsburg tomorrow. You intercede with the Lord for me, that He may prosper these efforts, to which I am so unwillingly drawn, better than according to the conceived hope.</p>
      <p>Our Zwick is sending you a copy of our document, which you will return as soon as possible, that is, through this very Gervasius of ours. Gervasius also has news from Leipzig, which he will tell you; otherwise, we were going to write to you about them. Greet very lovingly and honorably in our words the best men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, Erasmus Fabricius with the others, all of whom I greatly desire to be commended to Christ by their pious prayers, especially by yours, my Bullinger, my soul, whom I love not as another, but as the same myself with all my heart in our one and common Savior, which I wish I could testify with some clear evidence as much as I wish. I humbly beseech the Lord that it may be allowed sometime through some occasion; I have nothing more in my wishes. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. We and our brothers and sister Margarita greet you and your wife.</p>
      <p>Again, we earnestly entreat you by our friendly faith, that it may not be to our detriment that we have sent you a copy, but that you read it to yourself or to very few others (if it seems good) and then take care to have it diligently returned to us through Gervasius.</p>
      <p>You know how everything today is seized upon for calumny, especially ours, who otherwise are ill-spoken of for this reason, that we are accustomed to differ from the common opinions of others. Four days ago, I also sent a copy to Grynaeus, written by my own hand, through a courier going to Basel, but with this very condition, that he should return it immediately after reading it through the same messenger. The Lord knows how we do nothing here out of a desire for change, much less for faction, but do everything simply from a pure conscience before Him, gladly following whatever we have judged to conduce to His glory and the certain edification of the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, June 17, 1539.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, I think, our senate will hear this document, with which we will also deal in person. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
