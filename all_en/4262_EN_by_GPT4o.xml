      <p>That you keep your young men in check with stricter discipline pleases me greatly; for in the future, they will be all the more cautious and humble, although certainly the majority have conducted themselves in such a way that I have desired nothing at all. What greatly displeased me was that upon their departure they used pipes and drums, and I forbade them; but having obtained the consent of Hyperius, they thought they should not obey me. I also gather that our most illustrious prince was displeased, as he wished to know from Lord Pincier the reasons for the departure of the Swiss, and why they left with drums and pipes, and I believe that if you send no more to us, it will cause some offense to the prince, especially since now the study of theology is doubly better provided for; for the prince has added to Hyperius a certain Frenchman, a distinguished man, who indeed teaches with great benefit and praise, and he was the tutor of Prince Wilhelm in the French language and a French preacher in Strasbourg, whom our Martyr can describe to you, and our prince has also begun and is contemplating a beneficial reformation of our entire school. May the Lord grant that it achieves a successful outcome.</p>
      <p>Within a month, the wedding of the son of the Elector Palatine and the daughter of the Landgrave will be celebrated in Marburg, to which about three thousand horsemen will gather, and they will hold a public tournament. May the Lord grant that no harm or misfortune arises.</p>
      <p>I could not refrain from writing these few things because of my love and respect for you. Farewell with all good and learned men.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt on the 9th of April in the year 1560. Your Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, my esteemed teacher.</p>
