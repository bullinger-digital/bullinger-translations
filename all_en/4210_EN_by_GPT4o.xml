      <p>Praise be to God always, 1560, on the 7th of February in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>My heartfelt loyalty and love be with you, beloved sir, at all times. Also, on the 28th of January, I received a letter along with 21 guilders from you; I will ensure that everything is diligently arranged, paid, and settled by my servant Bernhard Widmann at each place according to what you have written to me. You have sent me quite a lengthy letter; it is quite inconvenient to open; the messengers are reluctant to take it, etc. However, I will make sure that it is answered, no differently than if it were my own matter.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, beloved sir, I have heard how your son Christoph has returned from France so miserable and weak; I am sorry. However, my lord, I think he will remember the suffering he endured and now be more domestic at home, although I commend him for not sparing his young and weak body. I also think that if illness had not forced him to leave, he would have stayed longer in France, as I had entrusted him to my aforementioned servant in loyalty.</p>
      <p>Since God has foreseen it differently, we must let all things happen for the best. Also, regarding the six books concerning the Anabaptists, I have something; it was confidentially given to me, and I do not like many things in it; you may look into it and then send it back to me. I had to write in great haste because of the messenger.</p>
      <p>Commended to God.</p>
      <p>Konrad Semly, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
