      <p>S. P. Therefore, at last, an end will be put to this our tragedy, venerable father and teacher in Christ, under this condition, that I, together with our entire French church here, approve and accept the Augsburg Confession, and that simply without the interpretation of this or that. Now our senate does not compel me to any interpretation, but simply to the confession itself. Now it remains to see whether we can do this with a clear conscience, whether the aforementioned confession is pure and sincere. I have indeed read it, but since I do not trust myself, I wrote to my teacher Mr. Calvin about this matter, who replied to me in these words: "I do not see why you hesitate to subscribe to the Augsburg Confession. If they present the Saxon churches to you, the answer is ready, that there are many in Saxony who are no less turbulent than coarse men, it is enough for you if you agree with Philip and the like. For although he timidly conceals his mind, he is entirely ours: I think it will shame those who trouble you to press further," etc. I do not disdain the advice and judgment of Mr. Calvin, indeed I hold it in high regard. But since every word is established in the mouth of two or three, and I have always held your Zürich church in the highest esteem, I also seek your judgment and advice in this matter, first and foremost, and then that of all your fellow ministers, and that not only in my name but in the name of all of us, for your judgment will not be of little weight with us, since we do not doubt that you are led by the spirit of God. Therefore, through the same spirit that has united us, and through our savior Jesus Christ, we ask that you deign to signify to us your judgment, whether the aforementioned confession, namely the Augsburg, is approved by you, and what we should do in this matter, and that as quickly as possible, so that help and remedy may be provided in time to this our afflicted and failing church, and thus it will be, that you will make us more bound to you. Farewell, perpetually happy. Pray, I beg, for the safety of this church: we will also in turn pray for all of you. May the Lord God keep you together with all your fellow ministers long safe for his church to the praise and glory of his most holy name. Amen. Strasbourg, December 10, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Jean Garnier.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in true piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher and superior in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
