      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I do not doubt that Mr. Myconius has sent the writings of the Council of Trent. However, I have several letters that you perhaps have not yet seen, namely from the King of France and the King of England, Joachim of Brandenburg, and some others that have been seen by few; if you do not have them, let me know.</p>
      <p>Lord Schertlin is perhaps going to depart next Tuesday; he is waiting for the cavalry that will escort him to the fertile land of the bishops; for they are worthy, finally, to perish after so many most bloody murders they have committed against the pious Christian faithful martyrs.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that the chancellor of the Archbishop of Mainz has been captured by the Hessians, and if they had waited a little longer, they would have captured the bishop, who barely escaped after being warned by a peasant. The Council of Trent has come to an end; all the bishops are flying away, seeking other safer nests. In Augsburg, it was proclaimed by trumpet that there will be no fair in Frankfurt. The Pope complains that the Emperor is lenient with the Lutherans; he wants to adhere to the French. Maurice is in arms. What do you think will happen? All of Germany will soon be turned upside down and is worthy to perish, having destroyed and devastated other nations. Lord Schertlin will soon receive, that is, on the 18th of this month, 200 horsemen, whom he wants to have for defense against armed enemies, to prepare a suitable place for the army.</p>
      <p>But where do you think Schertlin will lead that army? The peasants of the Sundgau are all watching day and night in the woods, in the small towns, and in the villages; the soldier is reluctant, preferring the enemy to friends. They are burdened with various things, so that they cannot sow; a heavy tax has been imposed by Ferdinand. They fear the Turk and nonetheless these men incite various tragedies.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, March 17, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
