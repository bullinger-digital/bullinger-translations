      <p>My friendly greetings and all good things beforehand, friendly, dear cousin, I am surprised that you have neither sent a message nor written since your written request and my response, about how you are doing or what your condition is. As for father and all of us, we are well by the grace of God. Father was here with me 8 days ago for a day or two, still having pain in one of his thighs. Last Sunday, our dear Anni Keller from Bremgarten passed away peacefully. All my people send their greetings to you. Don't be so lazy and do write about how you are doing. God be with you. Dated Zurich, February 4, 1551. Always remain God-fearing, pious, truthful, loyal, and humble.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious Josua Bullinger, furrier journeyman in St. Gallen, his dear cousin.</p>
