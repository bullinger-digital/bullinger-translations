      <p>Highly learned, pious, faithful, especially trusted lord and beloved brother, my willing service, etc. I wrote to you in recent days regarding Mrs. Göldlin with some good and trusted opinion, to which you replied that it is not very difficult, as the matter can be well accomplished. However, she remains in Basel, not with the consent of her young lord and husband, to whom she owes no cohabitation, as would be right by divine law, that she should not be away from her husband for so long. Therefore, some prominent, very honorable people here have deliberated on the matter and have written to her kindly, that she should now return to her lawful husband and provide him with proper cohabitation, which is why this message has been sent down to you. Since it is my duty as a pastor to both of them, where I hope to recognize myself as such, especially in such a matter, to act particularly and faithfully, I have nothing better than through you, who was formerly her pastor and I believe that she still recognizes you as a servant of God and His church, to inform, ask, and admonish you as my dear lord and brother, that you would take this matter seriously and kindly take Mrs. Göldlin in hand and admonish her to show her lawful husband proper cohabitation, which she, without your admonition, well knows she is obliged to by divine law. Even if she has some reasons for her long absence, I still believe that they are not valid reasons that any authorities or reasonable, God-fearing people could excuse her absence. If it concerns bodily and temporal goods, it will, God willing, be found and settled well. The honorable woman should remember that the bond of marriage cannot be easily dissolved, that such separation brings harm to the soul and honor. We are all mortal, that a deadly illness could befall her and she might then be severely attacked in her absence from her head (husband).</p>
      <p>Without that, the long absence brings all sorts of thoughts and talk, where the evil one strikes and makes worse out of bad. And if we then live in such adverse life, that no part of our life is sweet and peaceful, where we otherwise have much discomfort and suffering in our life, we should not first lay such burdens upon ourselves. The holy Paul also strongly admonishes the married people to guard themselves, that they give no place to the evil one, and also threatens severe, heavy punishment to the disobedient.</p>
      <p>Since then the mentioned Mrs. Göldlin looks to God, loves His word and does not despise it, admonish her to do the best, and even if she thinks she has encountered something that she would not know how to suffer, that she still hopes and thinks better, when God lays a cross upon a person to bear, that he will not escape the burden with impatience and withdrawal; for God finds us everywhere. Thus, honorable wife and husband suffer much and often heavier in the state of marriage than her young lord and she have yet suffered, but nonetheless do the best for each other; if they are sometimes at odds, they become one again; for the bond of marriage does not allow itself to be torn apart for every reason. So she should act rightly as an honorable woman, willingly, as she might later be called when the matters should come further. Spare rightly her and her young lord, come home, provide him with cohabitation, while he also desires such and offers all honor and propriety.</p>
      <p>Such will also be before many words and unrest. I, who also formerly admonished her to do the best for her husband, admonish her again, and would also like to speak with the young lord, that he also behaves properly, only that the discord, which grieves me, is resolved, all occasion for evil is removed, and they are reconciled with each other in God. I mean well with the matter, desire that you would greet her from me, also take with you Mr. Johann Jung and Mr. Züger, her old bailiff, who also greet from my side and earnestly ask to do the best in this matter, so that little clamor and displeasure is caused. If I can then also serve you, as well as the other two my lords and good friends and brothers, I will always be willing. God be with you.</p>
      <p>January 8, 1558.</p>
