      <p>Greetings. Since I cannot express, most illustrious and much esteemed in Christ, how much your letters have delighted me, I will leave it to your charity, with which you pursue me, to consider. Regarding the efforts you have undertaken to have my book printed accurately, although I have already given thanks, yet at present, when I hear the work is completed, I thank you again, and I feel so indebted to both you and the excellent Gwalter that I despair of ever being able to repay. Therefore, I will pray to God that He may deign to repay you on my behalf, which I am unable to do. The book has not yet been brought to us; however, we trust it will be delivered daily. That it pleases you so much, as you write, cannot but be most gratifying to me, because, although I understand well that no praise is due to me from it, yet when it is commended by you, such a great man, I greatly rejoice in this agreement in religion with you; which I pray to the immortal God through Jesus Christ our Lord, that He may increase more and more daily, and cause it to grow stronger. And since you encourage me, I will now prepare my commentary on Romans, so that it may be sent there as soon as possible. However, I would not want you to accuse your young men so severely in the future, as if it were their fault that so many errors crept into my book. They indeed helped me in writing, and I owe much to their charity, and I am grieved that such gratitude is returned to them for the benefit conferred upon me. Therefore, hereafter, rather accuse me myself of negligence in writing, whom I will then take care that you may find more diligent.</p>
      <p>Regarding my other commentaries, which you request, I do not see how it can be possible for them to be published so soon: for what I wrote on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and the minor prophets, I noted down concisely and tumultuously; therefore, leisure is needed to review and rewrite whatever I consigned to letters for myself alone, not for others, from the beginning. But if God grants me age, and I obtain some leisure, I will not hesitate to publish them; not because I persuade myself that there is anything of mine, but so that I may not seem arrogantly to disdain friends who demand it.</p>
      <p>The business of Bishop Vergerius, which you would like me to take care of, cannot now be either handled or promoted by me, partly because I am far from the court and the nobles, (for I reside in Oxford, as you know, where I have commerce only with scholars;) then there are some great disturbances stirred up in the republic, which, although they do not pertain to religion, yet occupy the minds of even the lesser ones, so that they cannot either regard or think of these things: but when the occasion arises, I will not be forgetful of duty. Meanwhile, I beseech you with all your fellow ministers to pray to God, that He may grant us peaceful times, so that the gospel of Christ may be able to take root more conveniently.</p>
      <p>As for the Bishop of Gloucester, know that he conducts himself excellently in his ministry, nor has his calling been unfruitful thus far. However, he cannot do whatever he would like for the glory of the Lord, since here nothing can be imposed on the unwilling superstitious, which has not first been provided for by public laws. We hoped that now in this (so-called) parliament many things would be established; but I do not know by what means it happened that it was postponed to the month of January. However, that I may favor that bishop most earnestly, both his integrity and zeal for religion cause; moreover, there is an old bond of familiarity between me and him, and finally, what should have great weight with me, your singular commendation; therefore, there is no doubt that I will do whatever I can in his favor. Your young men here, by the grace of God, are well, and they give hope of themselves, that they will not waste their efforts in studies. Two are now departing from here, Andreas Croarius of Constance and Stumphius of your place, truly upright young men, who, if they conduct themselves with you as they have behaved here, I think you will not regret them. And since I do not think it necessary to commend them to you, I will not write more extensively about them: I will only pray that you may embrace them with the favor with which you have pursued them absent, also present, since they are not unworthy of your grace and benefits.</p>
      <p>I am indeed in good health, and have been well so far, and although my household has suffered most dangerously from the English sweat, I am nothing; and that you were gravely afflicted by the false rumor of my death is a most certain indication of your charity towards me. Therefore, I give you as much thanks as I can for such benevolent and friendly affection: and if you judge that I can do anything for your sake, just let me know, and you will find me ready and prepared to fulfill your wishes. I ask you to greet Gwalter very much in my name, and also all your fellow ministers; whom I wish all together with you to be well in the Lord. Oxford, October 26, 1551.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God, to be greatly respected by me.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
