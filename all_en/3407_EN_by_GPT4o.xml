      <p>Greetings. I have often wished for the opportunity to write to you, most kind sir, for two reasons: first, because 13 years ago, I greeted you with Johannes Hospinianus in your home, and I have not seen your face since; second, because last summer, a rumor spread among us about your passing to the eternal homeland. Indeed, we would not have begrudged this to you, now a well-deserved and distinguished servant of Christ, if you had left us many veterans in the evangelical religion. But while we were thus in suspense, indeed while we were already lamenting your death, behold, a good messenger with your letters restores our spirits and announces that you have returned from the cave of Trophonius, accompanied by the Revelation of St. John the Apostle.</p>
      <p>You will therefore be much dearer to us hereafter, you who were dead and have risen again with great interest, let the bowels of the Pope burst. Regarding Matthias Erb, my colleague, I would tell you many things if my unskilled pen were not ashamed or if you could bear a donkey braying unaccustomedly. He himself would have written many things that you might wish to know; but since, unexpectedly, Lord L. Hospinianus, through his wife, bid us farewell, intending to depart for Basel the next day, and since the good man was hindered by illness, he imposed upon me, unequal to the task, the duty of greeting you in many respects and transmitting to you those new things which he recently received from Isemannus; you surely have more certain and better information. Receive today's news as I write this: We were in fear and danger throughout the night because of foreign soldiers, who, having achieved nothing and with their pay withheld, were dismissed from Bollwiller and are moving through the Alsatian fields towards the lower parts of Germany, gladly attempting some mischief. Our citizens, along with neighboring towns, were armed throughout the night, and finally, without the shedding of human blood, though with some loss of sausages and other delicacies, they allowed the ancestral homes to remain untouched. Our prince came to us today with his wife and son Friedrich.</p>
      <p>I hear the prince is courting Conrad Frick, to act as court preacher, whom he will easily obtain from the people of Mulhouse because of his odious "kronenfressen" (a term of contempt), which he so often repeats to those bloodthirsty ones.</p>
      <p>Farewell, best father, in Christ.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, November 18, 1557. (18 or 28 legible).</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Rietmüller, colleague of Erb. To the man of exceptional learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
