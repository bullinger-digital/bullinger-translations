      <p>My friendly greetings and all the good I can offer to you, dear Mr. Heinrich.</p>
      <p>My husband has informed me, as he was instructed, to find out from me whether my wine is for sale or not, and to let you know shortly. We have agreed among ourselves, and want to let it lie together for a longer time until around Christmas; when I then come over myself, I will show him how I deal with it.</p>
      <p>Nothing more than may God be with you always, and greet your wife and children and whoever is dear to you for me.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday before Michaelmas in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>From me, Barbara Zehnder, in Aarau.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
