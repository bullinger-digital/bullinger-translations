      <p>Greetings. I feared, most esteemed and eternally revered sir, that you might not have received my letters due to the negligence of the people to whom I entrusted them; but our Kobler has relieved me of this concern. Now (which I could not do recently) I will add some singular and sad matters to the previous ones. The Synod of Surselva has ended.</p>
      <p>We still do not know what they have decided; however, they could not confirm anything without the common seal of the brothers, which our most esteemed magistrate wanted to retain. Nevertheless, I will report other unfortunate outcomes that have emerged from that conspiracy. Firstly, they have altered and undermined the ancient state and order of the synods in the Engadin. Then, with this new invention of theirs, they have left all good people suspicious and have also innovated secular matters against the customs of the Three Leagues.</p>
      <p>For indeed, how obstinate and factious they have been in recent years, the entire Swiss republic can testify.</p>
      <p>By whose counsel, with what instigators and supports the Upper League attempts this new matter and wishes to abolish and destroy those smaller assemblies that have been held in our city until now, will be revealed in its own place and time. Thirdly, that assembly has harmed many churches, and those very distinguished ones, not a little; for some brothers, who had decided to return home for the celebrated feast of Pentecost, could not overcome the Albula mountain due to the heaviness and inclemency of the weather. Thus, many churches, meanwhile, while the feast lasted, were deprived of their pastors and other things necessary for the salvation of souls, to the great complaint of the pious and (to use a Plautine term) discipline. Some, also due to the inexperience and difficulty of the journey, are so exhausted and worn out that they now labor most perilously. Lastly, in place indeed, but first in estimation and far the saddest, it happened that the best brother, Franz Keller, minister of the church of Morbegno, which is in the Valtellina, while he wished to return to his own, was intercepted on the journey from the territory of the Three Leagues by ambush, tied to a boat (which was prepared for this prey and hidden in some rushes around the borders of Rhaetia) and transported to Como and perhaps from there to Milan or finally to Rome. This happened on the 5th of June, on the eve of the feast. This violence and tyranny occurred due to our monks, who are rather spies or traitors, to whom they say nothing is forbidden by the Rhaetian lords, since they are so wealthy, being indeed the pupils of the Antichristian treasury, but with the loss of the Rhaetians and the squandering of their goods. I grieve for the calamity of the best brother, who has lived in Morbegno with his wife and several children in the greatest distress, so that no good person ever had anything to complain about him.</p>
      <p>He was dearest above others to Mr. Fabricius of blessed memory, as a learned, gentle man, pleasing to all except those most pestilent monks of Morbegno, who, as if watching from a lookout, most vigilantly plot against the liberty of the homeland. I am sending you, however, the writing of the Italian brothers on this matter, which we presented to Mr. Consul yesterday; today it was reported to the senate. Meanwhile, letters are also being brought from the prefects of Plurs and Chiavenna of the republic, who were sent there by the order and appointment of the lords of the Three Leagues, to sit at the helm. They write to the senate about the same cause of the brother, how it happened. In response, they answer our magistrate that they have diligently exhausted their mandate (which I recently informed you of); however, this was not actually performed. For our lords wrote to the prefects and commissioner of Plurs and Chiavenna to suddenly seize two monks, one from Plurs, the other from Chiavenna (as the leaders of all disorder), reserve them and present and deliver them to our future assemblies. Now the prefect of Plurs writes that he has not yet been able to find his monk, to whom, however, in recent days (as I sent you an example) he was present after receiving money. The other writes that the monk of Chiavenna promised bail; but our intention was different, that he be suddenly seized, not that bail be accepted, and thus a way be paved for moving and escaping. But the accursed hunger for gold, what do you not compel mortal hearts to do! The prefect of Morbegno, a papist, was here in our city when the wretched Keller was seized; his arrival was suspicious to me.</p>
      <p>Our people have decided that they will write to the magistrate of Milan, the Three Leagues, and the prefects of those places without delay, to move every stone, lest anything unjust be decreed against Keller, wherever he can be sought; then, without any delay, to lay hands on the monks, etc.</p>
      <p>We advised that they send an envoy; but they did not want to precede the allies in this matter. Unless they suddenly rush into the monastery of Morbegno and lead the chief monks here as captives, Keller will never be freed. Our people fear that something more serious and harmful may lie hidden in the grass.</p>
      <p>These things quickly, on the 9th of June, 1568, in Chur.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your eminence, Tobias Egli.</p>
