      <p>S. Your letters were most welcome to me, however rare they may be.</p>
      <p>I accept all your excuses, as I always consider them valid; for I know how immersed you are in your affairs. But the reason I urged you to write is this: The enemies of Christ write whatever they please with impunity; what they spew against the common people is available everywhere, read, repeated, and learned by many, and there is no one to do anything against it; hence they boast of having won, for they claim we have all been made mute by their truth. This is what pains me. Among those who write is Wicelius the apostate, a man who openly denied Christ; and your friend and Calvin's, Cochlaeus the most mendacious, who wrote a book titled: The Acts of Luther; in this book, he inserted the most unfortunate war between us so mendaciously that, unless someone responds, we will be ill-regarded by posterity, and even now, wherever the book reaches. And although what each writes is such that they refute themselves when read by good people, because the number of the wicked is infinite, it would be worthwhile for their sake not to remain silent in the face of such foul lies. Dr. Michael of Constance has the first volume; he offered it to me to read; but I replied: "Not even if someone gave it to me." He immediately added his judgment of the whole book; "The mountains labor," he said, "a ridiculous mouse is born." "In the meantime, however," I said, "the lies remain to the disgrace of the country." You have the reason why I urged you so.</p>
      <p>A magistrate from Zürich, to whom the matter pertained, told me that he had equally prohibited, as ours did, that anything be said publicly against the Interim, that nothing be written, that nothing be sold, etc.</p>
      <p>The rest is: Count Georg recently communicated to me the following: priests in England are being hanged if they do not flee to the Scots.</p>
      <p>There are threats of war in Hungary.</p>
      <p>In Saxony and Meissen, the Interim is beginning to die; the Emperor cares little for it; here, however, the evil lies hidden.</p>
      <p>There is discord among the learned Saxons and some others because of the Interim, as some think it should be accepted in part, while others reject it entirely.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has allowed the papists and learned Lutherans to meet in Erfurt; but the count thinks this is in vain.</p>
      <p>In another note, the following was included: spies have recently come to Landau and Wissembourg, openly sent to prepare lodgings, food, and drink for the Emperor's soldiers, and the Emperor is to convene in Speyer within a month; the number of soldiers is estimated at six thousand.</p>
      <p>The Emperor will hear the princes and lords with whom no agreement has yet been reached.</p>
      <p>He has three cardinals at court, sent by the Pope, to reform the German churches together with the Archbishop of Mainz. In this matter, they have such clear authority, also to inquire into individual persons who are still devoted to Lutheranism, of whatever condition.</p>
      <p>To this last point, I add from other sources: the cardinal legates have a rather brief booklet, in which the articles are contained according to which the reformation should be made. The articles are so antichristian and foolish that it would be beneficial for them to be published. The Emperor will be a violent executor of what they cannot settle.</p>
      <p>One of the articles is as follows: the most holy father, with a truly paternal heart, which he has towards Germany, permits preachers who return to the Catholic Church to remain in parishes, provided they are anointed if they are not anointed, shaved if they are not shaved, and dismiss their wives if they have any. Behold the grace and paternal love.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus destroy the antichrist along with his artificer. This is the council, as long as the Interim was supposed to last; this is the removal of the Interim made by the Emperor. It is clear that the Emperor is such a man that he is worthy of being used by God to persecute His Christ.</p>
      <p>The alliance against the Emperor is the one made with the French. Pensions will not have a place; this is what the old consul told me, nor will the French invade our freedom or the justice of the gospel, both of which the Emperor will try to violate, indeed to take away. These things have greatly moved our people to obey the Confederates.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all good people. Basel, October 9, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>There are rumors here that the robber of Mussen is attempting something against the Valtellina and Cleves; if there is any truth, I beg you, do not keep it from us, etc.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, in his Lord. Zürich.</p>
