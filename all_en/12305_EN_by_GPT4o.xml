      <p>Greetings. I ask my friend, that you compose this distich for me as soon as you have time.</p>
      <p>You will do a most pleasing thing.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Do not follow God, makes poor people, God's word does not need our lifting.</p>

      <p>Why, oh miserable ones, does it please you to despise the word of the Lord?</p>
      <p>It does not seek help from your strength.</p>
