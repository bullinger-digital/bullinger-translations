      <p>Greetings. Since Musculus is writing to you, dearest compater (godfather), I have nothing to add to his letter, except regarding Bindschedler, who, along with Hala, is returning to your calling, do not think that he has transgressed as much as the other. From Tobler's account and the testimonies of others, I find nothing greatly blameworthy in him, except that once at night he wandered through the streets with Hala and was involved in some commotion, but without a sword or any other instrument for causing a disturbance. Concerning the other, astonishing things are reported, which, since you will learn from their testimonies, do not require my account. Tobler will remain with me in the meantime, until you decide something else about him; he is indeed a modest and studious young man, who will someday be a considerable ornament to our/your church. Farewell. My wife sends her greetings to you and yours; you will also greet them from me. Bern, May 14, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>It is reported here that the pope himself is seeking to postpone the council until the first of September (I think the Greek calendar), and also asking the Emperor to return Parma to the apostolic see; the Emperor is unwilling to promise him anything; meanwhile, 16 cohorts of soldiers are being sent to Italy by the Emperor. But how certain all this is, I do not know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable compater (godfather).</p>
