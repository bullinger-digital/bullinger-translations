      <p>Yesterday morning, I wrote a brief letter to you and Mr. Haller, in which the hope of solid peace was revealed. But things keep arising one after another, so that I am completely uncertain about the future of our affairs. Over a hundred black and flayed peasants from Sondrio are here, imploring help against the noble Beccarias, by whom they are severely burdened beyond all humanity in the collection of tithes, which are demanded most rigidly and beyond what is due. But since the judges have already referred the first sentence to the governors of the Valtellina to be carried out, today they have ruled in favor of the Beccarias. However, the oppressed will appeal to the communities, and what will happen by their judgment, God knows. The wretched are angry, the oppressed complain; there is no one to help. - Yesterday evening at 6 o'clock, Conradin Planta, the brother from Graub√ºnden, entered with a large entourage, as he was granted safe conduct by our syndics against the decrees and sentences of the communities, allowing him the right to come and go safely and with impunity. Almost all the wise and pious murmur, and not all of the syndics wanted to assert and define this. I fear that disturbances and new troubles may follow unless they are averted by the grace of God through those who are peace-loving and upright in heart. - The supporters of the monks have anxiously labored to have the foreign monks expelled from the Valtellina readmitted; for they claim to be suffering from a lack of preachers to educate the people during Lent, etc. This was denied to them by the lords, who wish to adhere to the decrees already established on these matters. - My wife gave birth today and has increased my family with a new son. Thus, my labors, misery, and poverty continue to grow.</p>
