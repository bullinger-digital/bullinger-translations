    <p xml:id="regest1">Considerations on the different interpretations of the concept of homeland. Euander thinks of Zurich, which has become his homeland, where he hopes to return. Bullinger's letter of recommendation has been very beneficial to him. The official Zurich recommendation, drafted by Utinger, was not even reviewed by the council in light of Euander's good reputation. What tasks await him in Isny will be learned by Bullinger from the letter to Georg Binder.</p>

      <p>Once, one of the wise men steadfastly declared that every land is a homeland to the brave. But since it has been said in a most celebrated proverb of all ages that one's own homeland is most dear to each person, I believe he measured the homeland not by philosophical apathy, but by sense, and wanted to demonstrate not what should be, but what needed to be done. For I do not think that the apathy of any Stoic, however severe, has progressed to the point of believing or feeling that any homeland is equally dear to everyone. For even to Lucian, the smoke of one's homeland seemed brighter than a foreign fire. And indeed, Ulysses, who wandered much and saw the customs and cities of many people, as I may use the words of poets, finally longed to see the rising smoke of his homeland.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Homer himself exclaims as if with an epiphonema: "There is nothing sweeter than one's homeland and parents." I truly judge that homeland to be the real one, not which bore us, although even that, but which nourished us more and where you have spent almost your entire life. Hence, although everything I wish for happens here, Zurich draws me with a wonderful sweetness and love and does not allow me to forget it. If there were not such a great hope of returning, and that with your and others' support, by your faith, how ungrateful everything that happens here would be to me. But since I know that you and indeed all good people support my wishes, I do not doubt that I will soon return to you. Nor do I now care about the envy of some, if there are any, who immediately bark at me with that line from Terence: "You should have stayed longer," since I alone know with what feeling and how unjust a fate I was torn away from there. About which I prefer to remain silent rather than say little. But because you, when I was leaving, induced me with letters written in your and many others' names, in which you both praised me exceedingly and recommended me most amicably, you did something not less pleasing to me than most necessary, and most worthy of you. For those letters alone came into the hands of many and, with our Conrad showing them everywhere, they were open to the reading of all. However, this public document, which Utinger, the singular patron of all students, had written most accurately, with the authority of your college, although I wanted to present it to the council, nevertheless, because of your authority and my good reputation, they refused to read it - considering it unworthy to demand an account of life and learning from someone of whom they had such good hopes and whose faith the people of Zurich themselves had tested for a whole decade.</p>
      <p>Farewell, glory of Zurich, my Bullinger. For I am not allowed to write more now, nor is it fitting to trouble you with more. Otherwise, there would be no lack of material. Do, as you do, I know, commend me to the people of Isny, whenever you can conveniently. I wish your entire family well. You will learn from Binder's letters how the people of Isny have received me.</p>
      <p>5th day of April.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Euander.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of Zurich.</p>
