    <p xml:id="regest1">The difficult times prevent him from responding appropriately to Bullinger's letter; the death of faithful servants of Christ relieves them from suffering but represents a significant loss for the Church. He asked Vadian [on December 4] to forward [news] to Bullinger; now the Zurichers returning from Nuremberg have finally arrived, whom he already thought were at home. Through [Johannes] Brenz, he received a writing from Sebastian Coccyus, which opposes a booklet by Schwenckfeld; Bullinger's defense of the [so-called by Schwenckfeld] "Creaturists" was somewhat brief; Frecht wants to send Vadian's writing about 13 errors of Schwenckfeld to Nuremberg and Wittenberg and praises the [excerpt from Vadian's anti-Schwenckfeld writings published by Bullinger], which he sends to Brenz; Schwenckfeld declared at the table of Ludwig von Freyberg that this booklet strengthens him in his stance, yet he lacks education and common sense, as Luther also says. The [Habsburg] army was not defeated by the Turks in Hungary; rather, external circumstances, incompetence, betrayal, and profiteering are to blame for the heavy losses. [The Dutch regent] Maria has reoccupied Jülich and Kleve, executed the defenders, and expelled the inhabitants under humiliating circumstances. It is said that Emperor [Charles V] has arrived in Genoa and intends to visit the Reichstag in Nuremberg and renew the war in Hungary; it is suspected that he seeks the support of [Philip of Hesse] less against the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] than against the French [King Francis I], whose friendliness towards the Turks is described in a pasquinade. In the war over Jülich, an involvement of the Saxon Elector [John Frederick] and the Danish King [Christian III] is threatened. Duke [Henry] of Brunswick is said to be staying in Landshut. Greetings, especially to Pellikan and Rudolf [Gwalther]. Schwenckfeld rejoices over the disunity of the theologians, as shown by two pastors in the domain of his host [Ludwig von Freyberg]; the Zwinglian [Georg Keller] disputes the Lutheran [Anton Örnberger] the legitimacy of speaking about the "offering" of the body of Christ, although it was agreed upon in Basel [1536]; since the Zwinglian places much value on the writings of Bullinger and Calvin, Frecht requests a written statement from Bullinger. Bernhard Besserer has died, as has Martin Fuchs, who returned sick from Hungary. Thanks for the sent booklets.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>How I wish I could respond to your letters, which are full of love and learned generosity, in a manner worthy of them! But partly my own stumbling speech holds me back, and partly the public calamities and extreme perilous times hinder me, which are such that it is scarcely pleasing to live, let alone write. As you write, even a private individual, happy in himself, must consider himself more than unhappy due to such mournful common calamities. For who would not, with that excellent author of the Lamentations, cry out lamenting: "Who will give water to our head and a fountain of tears to our eyes" [Jer 9, 1], so that we may mourn the death of such faithful ministers of Christ as over the death of only-begotten sons and Josiahs. For you rightly write that many are taken away from here, so that they may not see the evils to come. We will therefore congratulate them on this most blessed fate of theirs, that now, placed beyond the pressures of mortals, they securely enjoy the one in whom they believed and for whom they fought the good fight. But we grieve for the Church of Christ, which is deprived of so many chosen instruments of the Lord, a loss that, given the current times, is scarcely repaired.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in these days I wrote to the most illustrious Mr. Vadian, asking him to share with you what I sent to him. I thought your people had long since returned home from Nuremberg, and beyond expectation, I was told last night that they had returned here, intending to set out for you early in the morning.</p>
      <p>Brenz, who has not written to me for a year, nevertheless wrote quite amicably yesterday and sent a refutation by the schoolmaster Sebastian Coccyus against Schwenckfeld's booklet dedicated to the Prince of Hesse. You defended the poor "Creaturists" from the insolence of that noble "Creaturist" Schwenckfeld quite solidly, but too briefly, if I may write this with your permission. Vadian sent me 13 errors selected from the books of that seed-picker, which I will have copied and sent to Nuremberg and from there to Wittenberg. You, esteemed brothers, have rendered the best service to the Church of Christ by publishing a booklet skillfully compiled from Vadian's books in German. I am sending this booklet today to Halle in Swabia to Brenz, and all the pious and learned greatly approve and celebrate it.</p>
      <p>Continue and give more, even if that babbling chrestologus belittles this booklet and looks down on it as if from on high. For it is said that in Öpfingen, a village on the Danube, at the table of the noble Lutz von Freyberg, he said he would rather lack a myriad of gold than this booklet, from which he is more confirmed in his own opinion than weakened. Oh, the impudent insolence of a man lacking any education and common sense! For I hear that Luther calls this chrestologus.</p>
      <p>What should I write about the Hungarian affairs? Our army was not disgracefully routed or cut down by the Turks, but suffered intolerable damage either due to the negligence of the leaders or collusion with the Turks. It is consistently reported that no more than 600 of our men fell in the assault on Pest and frequent skirmishes with the Turks, but partly due to cold, starvation, diseases, and partly due to the cruel arts of the Hungarians, 20,000 are missing. They miserably afflicted our men by exercising their monopolies and hunting rights, as they call them, even in war. But more on these matters another time.</p>
      <p>Queen Maria has again recovered the territories of Jülich and Kleve and ordered all soldiers placed in the garrison to be slaughtered, with the citizens proscribed under this ignominious scheme: Clothed only in their undergarments and carrying a staff in their hands, the citizens were forced to leave the cities and change their soil.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Emperor has arrived in Genoa and intends to proceed to Germany to preside over the Diet in Nuremberg and renew the war in Hungary. Many suspect that the Emperor wants to use the services of the Prince of Hesse more against the French than the Turk, even though a pasquinade paints the French-Turk in its own colors.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain this storm in the Jülich region, lest the Saxon Elector and the King of Denmark, who perhaps will not easily abandon their relative and ally, become involved.</p>
      <p>Duke of Brunswick is said to be staying in Landshut with Bavarian Louis. I cannot write more. Therefore, kindly consider these things, whatever they may be, and respectfully commend me to your dearest fellow ministers, whom ours also greet with me, especially the venerable old man Pellikan and Rudolf, the successor of the saintly memory of Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>If it is not troublesome, I would earnestly ask you not to hesitate to write back to me about the concord reached in the sacramental cause. For Schwenckfeld, the disturber of the church, hates syncretism and the holy agreement of the doctors in the church worse than a snake and a dog. A nobleman, a host of Schwenckfeld, has two preachers, one of whom seems to us to be a very crude, as they call it, Lutheran, while the other is a crude Zwinglian, who seems to deny what was nevertheless agreed upon in Basel by the grace of God, that the body of Christ is offered to believers in the Lord's Supper through the ministry of the church, constantly urging this: Christ said: "I will give" [John 6, 51 (Vulg. 52)], etc., as if these things were contradictory.</p>
      <p>Christ as the author gives and indeed alone, yet through the ministry of the church. From this dissension, Schwenckfeld seizes the opportunity to defend and feed his Silesian opinion and the dissension of the ministers his mind and eyes. We are burdened with envy, as if we disagree on the greatest mysteries. I therefore ask you to write something that I may show to the senior who is too, if I may say so with his peace, crudely Zwinglian. For he is a student of your name and an eager reader of your writings. Thus he also rightly respects our Calvin, whose writings he also testifies he wishes to stand by.</p>
      <p>Our consul Bernhard Besserer, who served our republic well, has fallen asleep in the Lord, and Martin Fuchs, returning sick from Hungary, where he preached Christ, has departed to the Lord from here.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed Bullinger, to whom I give the highest thanks for the sent booklets; it will finally be mine also to repay and do equal or greater things according to my will.</p>
      <p>In haste, Ulm, December 9, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Martin Frecht, with all my heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Antistes of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
