      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I sent you a letter through the surgeon Buwman, a citizen of Zürich, in which I thanked you for the booklet written against Brentius, which you sent to me, and I earnestly requested you to kindly send us a minister of the word of God, who is so distinguished in doctrine and piety, that we can safely entrust the church of Betschwanden to his faith; for he will receive annually 80 gold coins from the church treasury.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that I have not yet received a response from you; perhaps your affairs or the courier were the cause.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish to ask you to respond to me without delay this week, if your affairs permit.</p>
      <p>Everything is somewhat disturbed here; however, I do not doubt that the minister of the word will be safe; for we hope that, since everything in France will be peaceful, everything here will also be peaceful and safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen your life and make your old age happy for the benefit of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Dated the 20th day of April.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, minister of the word among the people of Glarus, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word among the people of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
