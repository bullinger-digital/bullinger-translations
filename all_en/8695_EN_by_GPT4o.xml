      <p>Greetings. So that I do not write nothing, since I have otherwise been silent for a few days, I at least wanted to greet you, my brother, and to indicate that we are variously affected and cannot do as much as we would like. Our Simler is tormented by great pains from gout and is completely confined to bed; Gwalther has scarcely recovered from a three-month illness, if he can even be said to have recovered; for he still seems weaker than I would like. As for me, worn out by long and excessive labors along with old age, which is a disease in itself, I nonetheless struggle, burdened with private and public affairs, and repeatedly, in vain, implore for relief.</p>
      <p>But also the stone afflicts me miserably, and my urine, honor be to the ears, burns me and flows impetuously and continuously, indeed it drips, so that I scarcely have an hour of peace. I am therefore compelled to remain at home for a good part of the time. But these are the inconveniences of old age. However, I willingly endure these from the hand of the almighty and benevolent father.</p>
      <p>I believe I have sent to you what news I have from England, Saxony, Poland, and elsewhere brought from the Frankfurt fairs by Froschauer, yet I doubt it; for my memory begins to fail me. From France, it is now reported that the king is keeping the peace sacredly and has punished his brother's secretary for treachery. Many other things of this kind are reported about the admiral, who is said to be in the highest favor with the king. We will await the outcome; for the minds of kings are varied and like the plates of roofs, unless they are solidified by the Lord.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that he himself may temper the affairs of his people and preserve his own. But what about you, my Tobias? Is there anything you are doing? For I do not think that the Marios and Ganthners will cease. The Lord gives such tormentors to his own, so that they may be variously exercised and meanwhile experience the presence and help of the Lord. Therefore, be strong in the Lord; God will also put an end to these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household and brothers. Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Gregor, Pontisella, Bonet, and especially Mr. Campell, the beloved brother, and other acquaintances and friends of ours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 26, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your Aernius greets you most amicably. To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his honorable lord and very dear brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in the city of Chur.</p>
