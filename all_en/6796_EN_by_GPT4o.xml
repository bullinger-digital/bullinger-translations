      <p>Greetings. Recently returning from the countryside, I found letters written to me by the Bernese mayor. They were brought by two envoys who have set out to you. From them, I understood that they have the same instructions as ours received; but now I want to hear from you what has been done and achieved. I hear that the Five Cantons have preceded ours, evidently because they learned too early of our arrival from their spies. Therefore, those who complained that it was a grave sin that the Five Cantons or Seven Cantons were not especially invited to these assemblies were worried in vain; for we hear that they come of their own accord and have been with you twice before. May the Lord thwart evil plans and support good ones. I learned from a reliable person that the mayor of your city, the envoy sent to the emperor, achieved nothing, but was given sealed letters, in which it is contained that if Battus is received, the emperor will confirm all your privileges, and so on. I wrote this hastily, lest I write nothing. I pray to God to bless our business and to keep you and the church from evil and protect you from absurd men. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 24th of May, 1566.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely.</p>
