      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, I am writing this letter in great haste on Saturday night, very late; you must forgive me. The situation is as follows: the messenger has been delayed for a long time; with what dangers, you now know, and you will also understand something from the messenger himself. You must therefore apologize to my gracious lord; for the people here are to blame for this delay. Those in the Upper League arrived yesterday; however, those from the courts did not appear upon their writing. The companions lacked a peasant's step, and as three were appointed by the God's House, two protested against the third, the consul Tscharnner. The Senate here is mostly good. Thus, these two and Tscharnner together are now writing again to yours, so that they may come; for consul Tscharnner cannot do otherwise. But these things must be concealed if the envoys come here, etc. Thus, from these beginnings, I hope for better things. They lacked at the beginning. Furthermore, this is what I would like you to communicate with the French envoy: he should consider who helped him make the alliance, whether it was the Papists; if he cannot think, when the Papists have the upper hand, that the Spaniard is the executor of the council. And if the pensioners thus want to misuse my service and loyalty, then he should consider whether I will remain silent in the future. He surely does not want to be guilty. Why does he not defy his pensioners, whose conspiracy and plot this is? Believe me, power offended becomes fury. But you will modestly insinuate these things to him either by letter or in person, not as if from me, but also as if from me; I do not dissimulate. If the French ruin their own cause, they will not blame me afterward. In this whole matter, nothing harmed me more than that I was too modest at the beginning. Meanwhile, the other party acted with lies. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>At Chur, on Saturday night, in great haste. Forgive me.</p>
