      <p>Your letter, addressed to me, honorable lord and father, I have received and understood its content, hereby also sufficiently noted what has been dealt with regarding Doctor Peter Martyr, which had been hidden from me until now; for among us, nothing else was spoken of it than as if the matter in France had been maintained and led to a conversation; so I understand from your letter that it still hangs thus. As much as our matters in the lands are concerned, I can well assess that it is not well situated; for the honorable man, who has written to you about all dealings, has also written to both my lords mayors and me with the same substance, though somewhat more extensively, for which reason I have spent this whole day writing letters; for it is of great necessity that the good-hearted are informed of these things as needed. As much as I can see at this time, all matters are very unfavorable; for we are not united in the lands, and it is to be feared that a confused affair will arise from it, and if God does not particularly intervene, it will concern the pious preachers in the Valtellina; for the malicious will pretend that they do not want to involve their land in the entrenchment for the sake of some bandits, of whom (intelligis) it is to be feared that all this is related. Moreover, it is good to consider that this game was not started for our sake; for the Pope together with Philip could not under a better pretense bring foreign troops into the 5 places; for what purpose, you may think; for with a thousand men he can plague ours and keep them close. And I would assume, if Philip received a desired answer from our lands, it would still depend on him using the troops that are now gathering in the Duchy of Milan, at place and end, as you know. I thought to myself, since it has been so quiet, they were brewing a storm in between. For I well consider, you now know that they are secretly arming in Milan and are expecting supplies from elsewhere (this was what I wrote about Florence and Siena); the Venetians are also fortifying their frontiers. May God turn it all for the best.</p>
      <p>For if I did not trust more in His grace than in human help, I would consider the matter lost; for you see what can be built on humans. As much as our office is concerned, we are willing to risk it with God to the last. You should therefore promise yourselves this from us and also confidently assure yourselves of us, that in all this, as much as God gives us grace, we will spare no possible diligence and earnestness. If then nothing else happens, what God wills is; for we have well deserved it and have nothing to complain about on His part. May He have mercy on us and not punish us in His anger, etc.</p>
      <p>Herewith entrusted to God; may He keep you together with your honorable housewife and yours in His fatherly protection. Amen. Given at Chur, the 11th of August, in the year of our Lord 1561. Your honorable, willing servant Hans Schmid.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned, pious, and faithful lord H. Heinrich Bullinger, his honorable lord and godfather, to answer.</p>
      <p>Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
