      <p>A great rumor has been spread these days about the increasing pestilential contagion among you, which I pray to the Lord to subside. I do this not as one ignorant or forgetful of the apostolic saying that all things work together for good to those who are at peace in Jesus Christ, and that otherwise, Scripture is a sure witness that those who die in the Lord are blessed. But in these harsh times, I would wish that the flock of the Lord, especially in your city, would be afflicted as little as possible, so that you may be more freely present and able to counsel other churches. We hope, however, that everything will soon be better and that the Lord will have mercy on us, as Scripture testifies that He does not usually impose unbearable burdens of temptation on His own. There is a persistent rumor that the Emperor will winter in Augsburg, and our people, who have recent letters from Italy, report that it is greatly to be feared that when spring approaches, he will prepare a hostile army against the Pope. Besides this, they think there is also a fear from the Turk against Charles, etc. Incidentally, I ask you in our faith, to speak in secret with my kind and beloved Lord Lavater and, on behalf of our common city, to kindly request: that he may do well, so that when the Lord Chancellor or his representative comes to Zürich regarding the sealing, he will examine and read all the sayings, so that they may stand as they should, and if there should be any great case, to report the same to the Lord Chancellor (or otherwise, being burdened with many affairs and all sorts of distractions), so that what is right may be accomplished. I suspect nothing bad of the scribe; but I have learned how easy it is for a man distracted by various cares to slip.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, October 21, in the year of our Lord 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the best and most pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most magnificent city of Zürich, his lord and as a brother.</p>
