    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The following case is discussed: A woman [Elsbeth Huber], who behaved as the wife of a man [Jakob Kundigmann] for six or seven years, publicly declared this and never complained about him, suddenly left the marital home and took everything she could with her. When she had to justify herself before the authorities, she said that her husband was impotent and that she was still a virgin, and therefore requested a divorce. However, an examination of the woman by midwives revealed that she was no longer a virgin. She was then imprisoned and questioned. She confessed that during her marriage another man [...] (whose name she mentioned) had taken her virginity. However, she insisted that her husband was impotent and, unlike the other man, could not have sexual intercourse with her. The husband denied this and demanded a divorce, especially since the wife had committed adultery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The question now arises whether the woman's offense, in the case of her husband's impotence, should be considered adultery or merely a sexual offense. If it is adultery, she would have to leave her dowry to the man by law, but not if her offense is considered fornication. Some councilors believe that if the man is impotent, it is not adultery; others, however, believe that it is a legitimate marriage, as the woman remained silent for many years, tolerated her husband's impotence, never complained, and did not request a divorce. The basis of a marriage is not potency. Therefore, it is irrelevant in relation to a divorce, except if the wife can no longer cope with it. After all, there was a legitimate marriage between Joseph and Mary, as well as among many other couples!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Suppose an impotent man would confess his impotence and request a divorce for that reason alone, but his wife would respond that she wants to continue living with him because his impotence does not bother her at all, in such a case, the husband would be urged to stay with his wife! If he did not want to, he would be reminded of the binding nature of his marriage vow and forced to stay with the wife. This proves that even in the case of impotence, the marriage is legally valid!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] This also applies here. Since the woman has put up with the man's impotence for six years, their cohabitation is to be regarded as a legitimate marriage, and her fornication as adultery. The man's impotence does not excuse her behavior. For if she had concluded that she could no longer endure it, she should have taken a legal path to be allowed to divorce.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] No one would be allowed to enter into another partnership on their own without first obtaining the judgment of the authorities; likewise, no spouse would be allowed to sleep with another without it being called adultery!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If such a thing were tolerated, terrible precedents would arise: Women with impotent husbands would be allowed to fornicate at will, and if their relationship were exposed, they could blame their husbands to avoid being punished for adultery and thus not suffer any disadvantages from imperial law or other laws.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer has just learned that the city messenger [...] has already set off with the council letter addressed to Bullinger [No. 2938], as Blarer's brother Thomas assumed he had already been with Blarer! It is important that Bullinger considers the matter carefully. Blarer does not want to influence his judgment or force him to judge differently than he sees fit. However, a differing judgment from Bullinger would be difficult for both Blarer and his colleagues, as it would weaken their authority and have serious consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The councilors of Konstanz have also sought advice from other legal scholars. However, Bullinger should not let it be known in his response [No. 2941] that he is aware of this and has received a letter from Blarer. Since the woman initially lied and only later confessed her fornication with the other man to avoid admitting her husband's potency, she can no longer be believed. The man should also not be forced to undergo a medical examination or swear to his potency, even if the law provides for this and it is prescribed and still customary in papal [canonical] law. Blarer and his colleagues find the examination of the man indecent and unchristian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] There was disagreement in this matter because the woman's dowry is at stake: If the woman's fornication is not considered adultery but merely fornication, she may keep her property. Therefore, some demand the medical examination of the man, although he has continued to assert his potency in prison and despite the threat of torture. Blarer and his colleagues believe that the woman's fornication should be considered adultery in any case, even if the man's impotence were proven. After all, she lived with her husband for years and did not request a divorce.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The case was presented to Bullinger in writing [with No. 2938]. He should be cautious and not hasty in his response. He can dismiss the messenger of the Konstanz council without a response, pretending that he is currently very busy, unless the response to be given is as clear to him as it is to Blarer and requires no long deliberation and extensive explanations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] In great haste. Blarer's messenger [...] wants to depart.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] [P.S.:] The Konstanz councilors have sought the opinion of the Konstanz pastors, but most councilors (except for Blarer's brother Thomas and their cousin Konrad Zwick) do not agree with it. Therefore, they are now turning to Bullinger, hoping to receive a different judgment from him.</p>

      <p>The case: A woman lived with her husband for six or seven years. She was considered his wife, went to church and social events with him, and never complained about him. Later, she left her husband of her own accord, taking with her whatever she could. When summoned by the authorities, she claimed she left because her husband was never a man to her, and she was still a virgin. Therefore, she requested a divorce. It was later determined that she was examined by midwives and found not to be a virgin, but rather deflowered. She was then imprisoned and questioned. She confessed that another man had taken her virginity while she lived with her husband. However, she insisted that her husband was not a man because he did not treat her as the other man did, whom she also named. The husband denied all of this, accusing her of violence and injustice, and demanded a divorce from her since she admitted to adultery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The question now is whether the woman's fornication should be considered adultery if the husband was impotent, or if it should be regarded as mere fornication. If it is considered adultery, she would forfeit her dowry to the husband according to the law, which would not be the case if it were mere fornication. Some argue that there was never a marriage if the husband was impotent, and therefore it is not adultery. Others argue that it should rightly be considered a marriage since the woman remained silent for so many years, tolerated the impotence, never complained, and did not request a divorce. Marriage is not based on the husband's potency. Therefore, she cannot be divorced for that reason alone, except if she no longer wishes to tolerate it. There was a marriage between Joseph and Mary and many others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Suppose the impotent husband himself came forward and confessed his impotence, requesting a divorce because of it, but the wife said: I want him to stay with me; he has promised me marital fidelity, and his impotence does not bother me; I do not care about it. In such a case, it is considered that the man would be compelled to stay with the wife. And he could not be forced to leave because of the marriage he promised her. If it were not a marriage due to the husband's impotence, which the wife is willing to tolerate, such a man could not be forced to stay with the wife if he wanted to leave, as it would not be a marriage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Similarly here, since the woman consented to the husband's impotence for six years, their cohabitation is rightly considered a marriage, and her fornication is rightly considered adultery, and the husband's impotence does not excuse her. If she wanted to change her mind now and no longer tolerate the husband's impotence, she had a legal path to divorce: She should have taken it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>No one is allowed to take another partner on their own due to such impotence without prior recognition by the authorities, let alone engage in fornication in such a case without it being considered adultery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Such bad practices and bad examples would arise, where women with impotent husbands would remain in such a marriage as long as it pleased them, secretly fornicating as long as they could, using their husbands only as a cover, and when it eventually came out and became public, they would know that they could not be punished as adulterers and therefore would not suffer any disadvantage under imperial law or other regulations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Ah, dear brother, I have learned that the messenger has already left with the letter to you for advice, and my dear brother thought he had already been with me! See, dear sir and brother, and give good advice, as it is important to me. I do not wish to corrupt your judgment or have you advise differently than is right. At the same time, I would not like my and the other brothers' authority to be diminished in cases where it can be upheld. Much harm comes from people thinking that our judgment does not align with others, which then leads to great discord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Our lords have also sought advice from jurists elsewhere and found it. Do not let it be known in your writing that you know this, nor should you act as if I have written to you about it. Since the woman was found to be false and not a virgin as she initially claimed, and later confessed her impurity with another to avoid admitting her husband's potency, she is not to be believed. The man should also not be examined or made to swear, as such is prescribed in the laws and similar cases, although we consider the examination of the man to be unfounded and against Christian discipline and compassion, despite it being printed in papal law and still in use by the papacy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>But the whole dispute lies in the fact that some want the woman to keep her property and interpret the matter so that her impurity is not adultery but mere fornication, so she would not have to endure the punishment of an adulteress and would not have to forfeit her property. Therefore, they insist that the man should be examined, etc., although he has maintained in prison and under the threat of the executioner that he is a man; yet I and we all believe that even if impotence were found, the woman's fornication should be considered adultery, as she lived with the man for so many years and never requested a divorce.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The case in its terms, as they say, has been written to you and will be recorded. I ask you for God's sake, be well considered and do not rush. You could dismiss the messenger of my lords and conduct business, as you have been given tasks; it is then as clear to you as it is to us: it does not require much difficulty, and you can answer it with few words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In great haste to an hour after noon, July 3, 1547. The messenger does not need to be summoned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>My lords have also sought the advice of the church ministers, but the majority do not agree, although brother and cousin and the best among us agree with us. Therefore, they also seek your opinion, hoping you will change it.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved lord and brother in Zurich.</p>
