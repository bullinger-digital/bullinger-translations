      <p>God with us. I wrote to you the other day via Josen, who traveled to Schaffhausen for belt-making. Previously, I also wrote to you a little, as I do now. But you do not write back. Enclosed herewith, I have sent you some news that was sent up to me from Strasbourg; I would be pleased, if possible, if you could send it back to me by Friday; however, if it is not convenient, then let it be. God be with you. Greet Susanna and Elisabeth for us. Last night we had dinner at the mother's house with JÃ¶rgen, and we were in good spirits.</p>
