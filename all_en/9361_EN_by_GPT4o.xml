      <p>Greetings. I am sending back, most esteemed lord, those things which you recently entrusted to me regarding the Acts of the Apostles through a reliable, as I hope, courier; he is Caspar Fry, the son of the late Leopold of pious memory, who has a lawsuit in Baden before the Swiss with the pastor of Baden, Jodocus Fry. I could not send them back sooner, although I copied them long ago, because I was waiting for a reliable messenger who would safely deliver them to you. For those things, I give you the greatest thanks, as I have deposited them with me as if they were a most precious treasure. Regarding French affairs, there is indeed great silence among us, except that 14 days ago a large sum of silver, namely the load of 15 mules, came to Solothurn, from which some conjecture a new expedition; others, however, think it is owed to the king's creditors. The Spaniards and Italians, traveling through Lorraine to Belgium, are said to have a large number of sick people with them. Neighboring Burgundy, like us, suffers from the high cost of grain. Our vineyards are just beginning to bloom due to frequent rains, yet they still give great hope for a moderate harvest.</p>
      <p>Lord Consul Wyttenbach, my colleague, and Conrad Curio send you many greetings. I commend myself and mine to you, most esteemed lord, very much. May Christ, the best and greatest, bless you and all yours, whom I wish to be safe, more and more and keep you unharmed.</p>
      <p>Biel, June 21, 1573.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] f[ully]</p>
      <p>J[osua] F[insler] of Z[urich].</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and father, to be greatly revered.</p>
