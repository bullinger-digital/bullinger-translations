      <p>Greetings in Christ, our true and solid salvation. I wrote to you yesterday through Marcellus's servant, earnestly asking him to ensure that our letters are delivered to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Now, my dearest nephew from my sister has delivered yours, who also confirms that on the journey he was informed about the return of that messenger sent from the Swiss. What our envoys have done with yours, I am completely unaware, except that brother VIII.</p>
      <p>On the 7th of September, among other things, he indicated that those were sent for the sake of exploration, now what the Swiss have achieved; for it is their concern to find out, especially since those across the Rhine, the Abbot of Weingarten, Count Friedrich von FÃ¼rstenberg, Lord of Meersburg, and Lord Johann Jakob von Andlau wanted to know from the senate whether they wish to accept all the conditions proposed to our envoys in Augsburg or not, since the Swiss have only obtained two of them. Furthermore, neither brother nor anyone else has said anything. Indeed, I have received nothing about these [Greek] from anyone, so I owe you great thanks for this writing service. It happens to me now, as it often did before, that while others think many are writing to me about the state of our city and church, I receive almost nothing of these matters, which it was most necessary to know. But I will urge persistently that, unless I myself soon return to the city, they will never cease in this manner. Would that it were not too late, what [Greek]. I heard yesterday that certain things were asked of our citizens; but what kind they are, no one could indicate; however, I expect letters from either brother or Zwicky at any moment.</p>
      <p>What you write about the Emperor, the Elector, the Landgrave, and some others, I have received more fully today, which I also wanted to send to you through my Gwalther. You, my dearest and best brother, farewell eternally in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>They have ordered [Greek] that I stay here for a while until they call me back. Among ours, there are not a few very [Greek], from whom much danger is to be feared by good citizens, certainly more than from the enemies themselves. My sister and best sister sends you her dutiful greetings. Greet your household with brothers and friends, with whom commend our cause to Christ Jesus, to whom the Father has given all judgment, diligently.</p>
      <p>Now carters have come from the city, traveling in my sister's mill with grain to Bom...; saying that yesterday and this morning all guilds were held and the fishermen and others have become very good Swiss.</p>
      <p>But they are simple, coarse people, I cannot rely on their words, as I have nothing in any writing about it. But perhaps everyone thinks the other writes; with that, I get nothing. But I will insist more strongly. Pray for us.</p>
      <p>Would that soon one could announce more joyful things to the other in the Lord. Pray for us, more diligently than ever before. Farewell again. 10th of September late at night, when it was also necessary to write to Constance.</p>
      <p>Yours as most yours, Ambrosius Blarer. Gwalther arrived yesterday around the fourth hour.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
