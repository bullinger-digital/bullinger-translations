      <p>S. D. None of your letters or those of Beza have been lost at all.</p>
      <p>For two of your letters were delivered to me, the earlier ones written on June 3rd, the later ones on the 6th of the same month.</p>
      <p>I see, however, how much you value me, who, oppressed by illness, nonetheless continue to send me letters even from your bed.</p>
      <p>For which I give your kindness the greatest thanks and pray to the Lord that He may restore you to us and keep you safe for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>I do not advise you to undertake any work now, but I urge you to keep yourself at rest for better times.</p>
      <p>You have already been exercised enough and too much by illness.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to think even a little about refuting the impious disciples of Blandrata now.</p>
      <p>Let us rather wait and see how they wish to receive your admonition.</p>
      <p>Matters and time will suggest what needs to be done at the right moment.</p>
      <p>And may you recover in the meantime.</p>
      <p>What you write about Tertullian and Hilary is very true. I have always been averse to reading the latter.</p>
      <p>I read the former not unwillingly because he says much in few words, and his speech is dense and vigorous with arguments, though harsh and rough.</p>
      <p>An example of the letter written to Tretius through Sarnicius will be presented to your kindness by our Ionvilleus.</p>
      <p>Not without great joy did I read that the most serene Queen of Navarre requested ministers from you.</p>
      <p>May Christ grant that they perform their duty with much fruit, and that most afflicted France may at last submit its neck to Christ the Savior in peace.</p>
      <p>You have advised well not to believe what some spread about the prince.</p>
      <p>There are those who boast that he is indeed at court, but despised and private, and so much not the first governor that he is not even among those who govern; they add that he submits himself to the decrees of the Council of Trent and confirm these things with great confidence.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will have done well if you ensure that either Beza or Ionvilleus write diligently about the affairs of France (I would not otherwise wish to trouble you with these), about which we can have nothing certain except from you and can oppose to adversaries.</p>
      <p>See, my brother, that you diligently watch, lest Lutheranism with Brentianism be sown in France.</p>
      <p>Paulus Eberus has published a book on the Lord's Supper against our doctrine.</p>
      <p>It differs in no way in opinion from the dogma of Luther, it varies in presentation; for he is flattering and tries to attract readers with his flatteries.</p>
      <p>He has many absurd and most inept things.</p>
      <p>He mentions you in the German book, in the Latin he names Zwingli, omitting your name.</p>
      <p>I do not know why he did this.</p>
      <p>At the end, he testifies that he does not wish to depart from this his opinion even a straw's breadth, etc.</p>
      <p>This book Sulcerus commends to many and thrusts upon them; but he also subscribed to those articles composed at Strasbourg in the case of Zanchi and accepted the Augsburg Confession together with the apology, which our churches, for reasons you know, have never wished to accept.</p>
      <p>Would that he does not think to unite Basel, abstracted from our churches, with the Lutherans! He has Coccius as a fellow conspirator and helper.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain them! But I cease to trouble you; if I were wise, I would be briefer.</p>
      <p>But forgive me this my sin.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus restore you to us and grant you strength, so that you may long be able to benefit the church of God! Zurich, June 12, 1563. Your fellow ministers greet you with all yours, especially my sons, sons-in-law, and relatives, all wish you happiness.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
