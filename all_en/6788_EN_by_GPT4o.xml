      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, in such wickedness and treachery of men, I can hardly write anything certain to you. You know that both consuls recently wrote to you, as well as to the House of God. But on that very day, when they sent their letters, believe me, no other day, I swear, Consul Tscharnner, who has so far deceived me excellently, prevailed in his tribe to agree to the election of Beatus. You say: [If he was planning this, why then did he write to us?] I answer: "Because greed blinds these men so much that they are extremely shameless." Although he indeed pretended and concealed many things, he always secretly supported the party of Beatus; but fearing the peasants, he gradually undermined the citizens' spirits with cunning, even though he had the senate against him. Now, however, he has revealed himself, and yet he does not hesitate to persuade me, who sees all this in person, so many times that he agrees with me in everything. Here, a summary of the given judgment was presented to the guilds; it demands that Mr. Batt should adhere to the 6 articles with us, as the previous bishop did. This is tolerable and apparent to the common man, etc. But when on the same day in the evening the sealed judgment letter was delivered to the House of God, the 6 articles and the freedom of the House of God were not mentioned with a single word. Is this not an unworthy crime? You say: "Who is so audacious to commit such a fraud?" They know that no one is ashamed anymore, etc. Many good men, even of the senatorial order, cry out; but that man has hardened his face, and it has harmed greatly that he does not want to appear to do anything for Beatus and yet does everything in the meantime. I understand the reason fundamentally as follows: the one from Rozins, who is the author of this evil and is most papistic, has a daughter; she desires Mr. Tscharner's son; then the companions are in pain(?). But what results from those unequal marriages, you know. Now I am very pleased that yours are sending a delegation; but in turn, I fear that in such treachery of men, they themselves might be deceived. Thus he, whose ancestor was the first to assert the freedom of the people of Chur, who did everything for Christ, is also the first to bring this city into such straits and miseries. For if he had been an upright man, the other Two Alliances would never have opposed us, etc. Keep this to yourself, and yet you can warn your envoy; again and again, let him see with whom he will have to deal. You will carefully see to whom you give your letters in the future; for I trust few more, the longer, the less. If only the delegates of the 6 Cantons are strong! Without a doubt, they could do much. But what do you think is dear to my heart, who am among such people, for whom lying and deceiving is customary (I always except the good ones). I am not a Rhaetian; but I am ashamed and disgusted by them. If only the people of Chur were not afraid that they would have to give back the priests to the ZÃ¤cher (a group), I find otherwise: the sea, the measure would also be gathered; for the good are timid, the others are fierce, shameless, and reckless. It could also be adorned and ringed. Beatus has 4 inns; there, whoever wants eats and drinks at his expense. I begin to fear more and more that the Pope would give money, etc., for it is very important to him and the 5 Places at the pass. But it is in vain. Chur does not accept the measure, fears they would have to return their priests, and so there will be Samaritan confusion, and it is in the Alliances. These are the fruits of the pensions. If anyone wants to correct these things, he would be mad with reason, etc. Therefore, they must be allowed their ways. God does not slumber, who will certainly take care of his church.</p>
