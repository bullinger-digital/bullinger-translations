      <p>S. Many dangers are threatening the evangelical churches from all sides; may God graciously protect them. Our own church is in particular danger; for those who present themselves as evangelicals do not dare to openly say: we no longer want the gospel, but rather the papacy. Instead, they attempt to gradually extinguish it through strange practices; and I fear that there may be some among us or ours who are tempted by the pursuit of private gain and advantage, which they hope to obtain from this. This is already being discussed among us. The French envoy wrote from Solothurn to our magistrate, urgently requesting permission to move to us, I mean to reside in our city; he claims many inconveniences that he faces there, but here he expects to have many advantages to carry out the tasks entrusted to him by the princes and the states of the empire. Here, many fear or suspect nothing bad at all.</p>
      <p>It is openly and plainly presented, especially by those who otherwise favor the French; there is no one or very few who suspect that this is the very opportunity to overthrow the gospel and its ministers. But we suspect nothing else than that once Pilate has entered, Christ will be demanded to be crucified. I wanted to inform your kindness of this, so that you may indicate what you think; for surely it has not yet been forgotten what happened in Solothurn when they admitted the French envoy, and what gradually occurred; we fear exactly the same, and all the more so because we hear that the evangelical preacher was expelled in Frauenfeld, even though Wegmann is the governor there; for when one is so accommodating where the Frenchman does not reside, what would happen if he were with us. Our people are trying to prevent us from criticizing the French, the French alliance, and mercenary service in sermons; what would they do if he were present himself? I have the names of the fallen, but not yet those which I most desire to have; the grape harvest has prevented me from obtaining them from those I could inquire from; but I will collect them soon. Farewell in the Lord with all your fellow believers and professors.</p>
      <p>Simpertus greets you all.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 16th October 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Jakob RÃ¼eger. Blaurer sent us all that you had communicated to him.</p>
      <p>If the wishes of some succeed, I would like to be in Russia, etc. To the most distinguished man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother in Christ, to be greatly respected. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
