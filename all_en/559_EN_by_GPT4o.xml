      <p>My friendly, willing service with the offering of all honors and goods to you, dear lord and good friend. After Mr. Ulrich RÃ¶st has given up the deaconate in the Thurbental, I have been very highly requested by the Landaman (chief magistrate) of Frauenfeld and other good, pious honorable people to present the honorable and learned Mr. Paly Berner, native of Scherzingen, here, to accept and promote the aforementioned deaconate, etc. Since I have been informed by many pious honorable people that he is a pious, learned, and also capable man, and his person and nature are pleasing to me, and since he is to be examined according to your commendable custom before you and other my lords, therefore, my very friendly request to you is that you would examine him for the mentioned deaconate and promote him in such a way that he may be found worthy of this my recommendation. If he then brings me written testimony that he has passed the examination with you, I will then proceed to deal with him accordingly. Therefore, I show you my good trust. Whatever I can do for you in return, I am willing.</p>
      <p>Given at Altenklingen, Tuesday after Trinity Sunday, in the year etc. 1549. Ulrich von Landenberg at Altenklingen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher and examiner of the city of Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
