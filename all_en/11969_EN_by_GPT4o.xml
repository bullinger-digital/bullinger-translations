The Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is said to have taken Blindenburg [Visegrád] and either abducted or killed about 24,000 people; thus, God punishes us for the discord [among the Christian princes].

      <p>Greetings. These arrived to me yesterday. I will tell you what the rumor is here: Luxembourg was captured eight days ago by Duke Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, with the soldiers stationed in the town being spared their lives and allowed to leave, leaving behind their weapons and all military equipment; they were unable to withstand the siege any longer due to a lack of supplies from the French. The citizens of the place, who remained in the town, are almost all in a state of fear, as they have revealed all the secrets of the defeated to any victorious enemy; for within a few years, they have surrendered now to the French, now to the Emperor, four times. Their land is devastated for several miles around and has been reduced to a kind of wilderness.</p>
      <p>The Turk has taken Blindenburg, a very fortified castle, and other places, abducting and killing about twenty-four thousand people. Thus, God punishes us so that we fall upon each other. June 5th.</p>
      <p>I also hear that there has been another conflict in the Piedmont region; the imperial troops have again succumbed. Perhaps you know these things better than I do. Farewell. The spirits of Karlstadt trouble me and Oporinus. June 8th, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the eminent theologian.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
