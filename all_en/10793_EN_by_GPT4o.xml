      <p>Doctor Melchior Volmar recently wrote to me from TÃ¼bingen with these words, that besides the pleasantness of the place, which greatly delighted him, he has nowhere yet found more learned, more pious, and more sincere men than in Zurich, nor a church better established, and he wishes in any way possible to insinuate himself into the friendship and familiarity of you, Leo Jud, Pellican, and Theodor Bibliander. If this is achieved through my assistance, I will now gain the greatest and newest favor from him. He also, in the meantime, will leave nothing undone that pertains to forming this connection, and he will provoke you with his letters, if I hope that his letters will be pleasing to you. And although I think none of this is necessary, since you are more humane than to exclude anyone (I think worthy) from your company, and I am more inept than to either owe or be able to recommend such a man to you, yet, because he so earnestly requests this of me and thinks it will be doubly pleasing to him if he is received into your circle through my benefit, I earnestly beseech you with the most diligent prayers, that you allow me to obtain this favor, which I see he desires, from him, and that you anticipate the man, otherwise most humane, with the duty and humanity of letters, so that he may at once recognize you to be truly those whom he judges, and at the same time, that I have not in vain performed this duty with you. For that man does not doubt (which is also most assuredly persuaded to me) that I am not only most dear to all of you, but also have much influence with you, who each of you so diligently recommended me to him when he was returning from France.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Isny, on the first of March.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Euander, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
