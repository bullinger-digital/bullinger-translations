      <p>Greetings. Recently, I wrote to you about matters I deemed worthy of knowing.</p>
      <p>In France, priests and church officials, so that nothing diminishes their profit, are causing great disturbances and inciting the people to rebellion in many places, and the laws are ineffective. Therefore, many good people fear some kind of ruin, and there are no more certain remedies in use; you can infer the rest without me saying it. I wish to write about this matter when you have time, to see what you, with your sound and prudent judgment, would consider better to do. Please greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, May 2.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
