      <p>My venerable and dearest Bullinger. You have received, if I am not mistaken, my latest letters; I now have nothing nor do I know anything to write to you, except that our most afflicted Mr. Melchior here has moved me to great compassion for reasons which he himself will explain to you in person. I implore you, by Christ, to assist him; he is indeed worthy of the help of all good people.</p>
      <p>Consider what he says to be very true, and he is also worthy, due to the inconveniences of old age and his sick wife, that someone else, more robust in body, be appointed as the pastor of that mountainous and rugged place of Kappel. But there is no need for me to commend him to you at length, as even Hisgarter and our Lutius commend him to you; however, because he entirely wished that my recommendation also be added to theirs, I could not deny the man whatever this duty is. You will consider yourself to be doing a most pleasing thing to Christ himself if you show your presence here; if my advocacy holds any weight with you, come, act, so that the thrice-miserable Melchior is not disappointed in his hope.</p>
      <p>The nobleman from BÃ¼lach openly boasts of letters written to him from the camp that the Magdeburgers, utterly broken in strength and spirit, have all submitted to the will of the Emperor and will accept the previous conditions, which seemed so unjust to them.</p>
      <p>But I am not persuaded to believe it.</p>
      <p>There was someone here who was recently in Trento, affirming that no one is there except a few bishops and abbots and that it is a very common rumor that the council is to be postponed to another time. Farewell and commend me to Christ. A rather acute fever has seized me, which I expect to see whether it will return today or tomorrow, whether it will be a tertian or quartan fever. Greet the brothers and friends, especially your household. Again and again, my brother, farewell. Winterthur, May 22, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and holy man of God, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
