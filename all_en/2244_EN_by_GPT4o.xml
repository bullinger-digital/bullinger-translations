      <p>Grace, peace, and constancy in these troubled times I pray for you, most learned Bullinger, from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I wrote briefly to the reverend father Pellicanus through the noble Frenchman Jean de Qecellis, who came to us from England, whom we would have gladly kept if he could have endured the climate with his wife.</p>
      <p>But since three days ago I heard with great sorrow from a certain person that Lord Pellicanus, whom I have always revered as an angel of God for his integrity of life, has fallen asleep in the Lord, I will take you, an outstanding man, in his place and will not cease to write to you, and I pray that you will not disdain to respond to me with your innate candor and consider me as a son, since I no longer have my dearest father Pellicanus in Zurich. And I ask the Lord to provide you with someone in his place who can be compared to him in both doctrine and innocence of life, and who will adorn your church and benefit all Christians with his teaching. I wish Peter Martyr were with you; for I see that he is an excellent instrument of God in the church of Christ; but I hope the Lord will provide sound counsel. As for us, we all live and are well by the grace of God, except that the Lord has taken from us the most faithful minister Thomas Bram, a venerable old man, who suffered exile twice because of the Lord's Supper from the Lutherans. But the Lord in his pure goodness has restored to us in his place Lord a Lasco with Lord Utenhovius, Mycronius, and other learned and very pious men, indeed with the whole church, whom the Danes and Saxons have treated so badly, I think you have heard, and I cannot remember without sorrow. Indeed, they pursue us with implacable hatred; yet our people have dealt with them consistently, plainly, and modestly. And let us strive to overcome or finally confound them with the power of the word of God and the innocence of our lives and our modesty, and not flee from the light, if it is possible, that a just dispute from the word of the Lord about the sacramental matter may be instituted sometime.</p>
      <p>Westphalus, the preacher of Hamburg, has written two or three books against the sacramentarians and in them pursues no one with greater hatred than Lord a Lasco, who is now on everyone's lips in the East. The prince has granted our Lord a Lasco and the exiles from England hospitality and has allowed the French and English their own preacher; but there are many who envy this happiness to the foreigners, and this also greatly displeases all our neighbors, both Lutherans and Imperialists.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would wish for help to be brought to us in this matter through you; for I have understood that Peter Medmann secretly, with this nobleman, who is the brother of Ludolph Manninga or Luzeborch (who was present with Lord Pellicanus after my departure), will go to you after they have escorted our two young princes to Strasbourg for the sake of studying. Therefore, we would wish that you act with the utmost diligence with Medmann especially, who is held in the highest esteem by our princess, so that he understands that it greatly pleases you that the prince receives the refugees, and ask him to also take up the patronage of the exiles in the name of Christ. Then I would wish that you would write to our princess in the common name of all of you and praise her deed and ask her not to allow herself to be deterred from this purpose, and furthermore to hold Lord a Lasco in honor and to be in this, that ecclesiastical discipline may be restored to our churches. But I would wish this to be done in such a way that Medmann would not notice that it originated from us. Medmann is not an enemy of our opinion about the Lord's Supper, but acts like Bucer; therefore, act with him most humanely and candidly according to your candor.</p>
      <p>In sum, whatever you know will benefit us, that is, the church of Christ, strive for this. We, in turn, will undergo anything for your sake. Please greet in my name Bibliander, the most learned and fortunate interpreter of the sacred scriptures, then Gwalther and all known to me. May the Lord Jesus keep you all for the glory of his name, the edification of the churches, and your salvation. All our preachers greet you in the Lord. Hastily. Emden in East Frisia, March 30, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Gerard zum Camph. To the most excellent in piety and doctrine Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the renowned church of Zurich, his brother in the Lord, most dear and most esteemed.</p>
