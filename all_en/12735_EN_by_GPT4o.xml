    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bing acknowledges Bullinger's letter from November 5 [not received]. Previously, he had also received Bullinger's previous letter [not received] well and had responded to it [with the partially preserved letter No. 2666]. He had asked Heinrich Thomann to deliver this response [with his letters] to Zurich, where it will have arrived by now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] However, he did not receive the attachment to Bullinger's letter [from November 5]. In the haste, Bullinger probably forgot to attach it to his letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger will undoubtedly have been informed by Thomann about the course of the war. There have been no significant events recently. What the future holds remains to be seen. Bing is still willing to keep Bullinger updated.</p>

      <p>My willing service, and whatever I can do in honor, love, and goodness, as always before, venerable and highly learned, especially dear lord and friend. I have received your letter, dated the 5th of November, read its contents, and I will not withhold from you that your previous letter, which you sent to me, has also reached me. I have responded to you, and such a response was delivered to your fellow citizen Heinrich Thomann, to send it to you. Undoubtedly, it will have reached you by now.</p>

      <p>As for the matter you wrote to me about, I did not find it in your letter, and I assume that in your haste, you may have overlooked it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for the state of war matters here with us, you will undoubtedly have learned from the aforementioned Heinrich Thomann's letters. Nothing significant has happened here for some time. What will happen further, time will tell. I did not want to withhold this from you, and I am always inclined to serve you as a friend. Dated in the field camp near Giengen, the 21st day of November, in the year, etc., 46. Simon Bing, chamber secretary of Hesse.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scriptures in Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend.</p>
