<letter xml:id="file12426"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's communications [in No. 2375] from [letters] of others were welcome to Myconius. However, he cannot believe that the council has the power to summon the colloquents [from Regensburg].</p><p xml:id="regest2">- The report about Luther's death is also doubtful because it has been spread by the papists for a long time. However, Luther is already old.</p><p xml:id="regest3">- The emperor's [Charles V] raging is nothing new. His hard-heartedness is frightening, which is no less than that of Pharaoh. Yet, given his evil [advisors], it is not surprising. When Myconius recently asked a Dutchman [...] whether the emperor was leading an army, he received the answer: No, only priests and monks. Myconius wonders why the princes and cities do nothing to preempt the well-known plans [of Charles V], even though they could and the emperor is in their hands. If Myconius had a house servant who threatened him, it would depend solely on him to prevent this servant from becoming violent! If he were in contact with [influential] people in Swabia and Lower Germany, he would try to persuade them to protect Christendom. Bullinger, who has contacts with influential Swabians, will already know what to do.</p><p xml:id="regest4">- Regarding the communications in Bullinger's letter: The plans [of Charles V] must be made known. Therefore, Myconius shared them with Bernhard Meyer [zum Pfeil]. He did not mention any names, not only in accordance with Bullinger's wish but also because Meyer would otherwise wonder why the people of Zurich or the mayor [Vadian] did not report this [to him] [directly] themselves.</p><p xml:id="regest5">- Bernhard [Meyer] could not report anything new about the negotiations in Cambrai. Presumably, [the envoys] have not yet departed. Henmann Offenburg reported that the French [King Francis I] had sent two armies, one against the English [King Henry VIII], the other into Piedmont. This is also claimed by the new Basel guild master [Blasius Schölli]. Unfortunately, the terminally ill [Ludwig] von Reischach cannot be questioned about this.</p><p xml:id="regest6">- Duke [August] of Saxony and [Duke] Franz of [Brunswick]-Lüneburg came to Augsburg on January 31, possibly for a secret reason.</p><p xml:id="regest7">- In Basel, people would like to know more about the devil that appeared in Rottweil and the storm in Radolfzell on the Untersee. If Bullinger knows anything certain, he should share it.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>S. What you have written from others and others, it is amazing how pleasing they have been to me, although there are some things with which I do not entirely agree, such as the summoning of the colloquents to the council. For neither is it their place to summon nor theirs to obey. Although in the meantime, I am not unaware that the Tridentines have power even over God.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>Regarding Luther's death, it is equally doubtful because it had been both foreseen and announced by the papists long before, even if in the meantime I do not argue, the man is indeed old.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>What has been indicated about the emperor's fury, as it is not new, except for what you specifically pointed out, I shuddered, because the evil mind of such a high position is not changed, even after the hand of the Lord has touched the man so many times. He seems no less hardened than Pharaoh; which, however, is not to be wondered at, since he is constantly in conflict with far pestilent minds. Recently, someone came from Lower Germany; when I asked him whether the emperor had soldiers with him, he replied: "No one but priests and monks." However, I wonder how it happens that, after his evil plan is known, why neither the princes nor the cities attempt to preempt, since the matter is in their hands, indeed the emperor himself. I have a domestic, indeed, who threatens me; how would it happen that his threats, if I wished, would not come upon his head? If I had any acquaintance with the learned and prudent men of Swabia or Lower Germany, I would attempt what would seem to be in the interest of the Christian republic; what you should do, in my judgment, who have the Swabians in your power, as if by divination.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>What I have done with your communications, I will briefly say: The plans of the emperor seem to me not to be concealed. Therefore, I showed what you indicated to Lord Bernhard Meyer, with the name of the author and writer suppressed, and I asked him to use them for the benefit of the Christian republic. He, promising to do so, departed. I think I have acted neither against you nor against Lord Vadian. I would have indicated the author, had you not forbidden it and had I not feared that he might have thought, why did not the people of Zurich or the consul report this to us?</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>Regarding the Cambrai convention, the same Bernhard said, but nothing to the point. I think they have not yet departed. From Hemmann Offenburg, I understood that he had heard the French had already sent two armies, one against the English, the other across the Alps into Piedmont. The same was asserted by the new tribune, but it does not seem likely to me. Lord von Rischach is lethally ill; therefore, I could learn nothing from him.</p></div><div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6"><p>Duke of Saxony and Franz of Lüneburg came on the day before the Kalends of February to Augsburg for the sake of visiting the city. It is strange if they had no other business.</p></div><div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7"><p>We are amazed here about the demon of Rottweil, also about the dark cloud finally spewing fire above Radolfzell on the Lower Lake. If you have anything certain, let it be known.</p><p>Farewell with yours in the Lord. Basel, March 14, 1546.</p><p>Yours, Os. Myco.</p><p>To the most learned and vigilant bishop of the Zurichers, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord in Christ.</p></div></body> Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
