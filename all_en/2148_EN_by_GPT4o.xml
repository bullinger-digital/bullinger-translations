      <p>S. D. P. Today I received your most welcome letters and those of Mr. Vergerius. The Frenchman has indeed raised his crest due to frequent victories; but whether these are pleasing to God or how long they will last, since they are almost violated, let him judge who can or knows.</p>
      <p>As you wish to know who that good man is who promised to attack the heresiarch in writing, I will tell you, to whom I would say and entrust anything: he is Mr. Peter Martyr, an Italian residing in Strasbourg with an honorable vocation and, as I think, a just salary. I will advise him to also receive the other books from Mr. Calvin: but I wish he would persist in that opinion and fulfill the promise as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vergerius wrote to me to send this booklet back to you, which you should also send to him; therefore, take it in good part if, against my will, I burden you with this task. I have added eight sheets or small works or little stories against the rascal Cardinal Durant, half of which, along with the booklet, you will send to Mr. Vergerius when you can, even if late. The rest you will give or send to whom or to those you wish. Our good Lycosthenes (thank God) is beginning to recover, who (as I think he was not happy) was completely mute for 12 days and very paralyzed on one side; what prevents him from being relieved sooner are both the most inconvenient time for the illness and his weak strength, exhausted by nature and untimely mental labors.</p>
      <p>I respectfully greet the friends and brothers there, especially Mr. Theodor Bibliander, an excellent advisor and interpreter of future events among other things. If I can do anything here or anywhere, command me, and farewell for a long time. Basel, January 5, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Guglielmo Grataroli. There at Mr. Gesner's (I think) will be for several months a new Italian doctor named Hieronymus Massarius; I would like you to ask him once, but incidentally, what he thinks of Servetus; but beware, do not tell anyone that I advised this; otherwise, he is not bad.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and best pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother and superior.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
