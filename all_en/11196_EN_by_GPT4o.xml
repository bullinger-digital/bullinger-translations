    <p xml:id="regest1">Only because Nicholas [Partridge] praised Bullinger's kindness so highly does he dare to write. He knows from Partridge that the German theologians are not only striving for the reform of the church but also respond to those seeking advice in an exemplary manner; therefore, he asks, together with [his friends], to be allowed to ask him for advice if needed. Many are strengthened in their faith by the German, Zurich, and especially by Bullinger's publications; even the opponents of the Reformation are silenced in amazement at his interpretation of the scriptures, and many who were previously deterred by their teachers' threats are now reading the writings of Bullinger and others, which were dedicated to King [Henry VIII] and other prominent figures of the country; he asks him to continue publishing.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Although I have never had any familiarity with you, most learned man, that might encourage me to write, yet the noble candor of your spirit, such great courtesy and kindness, which my Nicholas has greatly praised in you, a man of such distinguished standing among your people, have extorted this letter from me at present, so that what I would not have dared to attempt under any title of old friendship, these your outstanding virtues and the humanity shown to a friend could compel even from a complete stranger.</p>
      <p>I have always held the opinion that those who sincerely favor the gospel, especially those who are leaders in preaching it purely, are not usually very morose or difficult to approach. But Nicholas has now confirmed my opinion so much that I seriously believe that not only have you been stirred by your doctrine and sincere handling of the divine word to restore the morals of the long-corrupted church, but that you Germans shine as lights to the whole world by the example of your life, so easy and open are you to helping and embracing all who favor piety. This makes me less afraid, though unknown, unskilled, and an untimely interloper, to approach you with my letters, since you do not spurn those who offer their devoted spirit to you, however otherwise crude and unlearned. Although I should not so much say that I am approaching, as that I am being impelled to write by Nicholas's report of you. For he has so inflamed my spirit with his frequent praise of your inexhaustible humanity and the most delightful company of the greatest benefit, that, although I have always wished him everything that I would wish to happen to myself, I somehow almost envy him this happiness, that he has been given to associate for so long with such learned and pious men and to enjoy such eloquent conversations. Nor can I, I know well, be at peace in my mind or cease to envy him this happiness until I understand that you will not consider us more alien, though never yet seen, than he has hitherto possessed us as most closely connected. Many here, let it be known, are held with no less affection towards you and yours than our Nicholas. If they could obtain, which they hope to easily persuade from such an easy man, to write to you freely and boldly when they need, to seek your advice and use your help in some difficult questions as they arise, without any mark of rashness or suspicion, they will consider themselves to have obtained the greatest benefit. For various difficulties arise in reading both the writings of the ancients and of your people and some others of this age. There are things that some of us understand less, there are things that some do not approve of at all, perhaps because they understand them little. In these difficulties, if their minds were explained by your work or that of your like, their thoughts would be greatly relieved and they would not negligently proclaim that they have gained some profit from Nicholas's journey to you.</p>
      <p>Your German writings, especially those from Zurich, and yours in particular, most learned Bullinger, are seized and devoured by all with tireless reading.</p>
      <p>Whenever they come into their hands, I hear many testify in good faith that they feel they have advanced in piety. Indeed, even your enemies, somehow astonished, are struck dumb by your diligence and clarity in explaining the scriptures. And whereas they used to attack certain Germans by name with quite shameless bitterness and slanderous wickedness, sometimes even you, to criticize your writings, to accuse of heresy, to shout out I know not what monstrous doctrines, now they gradually hold back, cease barking, and acknowledge those through whom they have sometimes profited. For no one presses Germany more vehemently with their false accusations than those who derive almost their entire lectures from the books of the Germans, indeed cunning men, who divert their ignorant listeners from where they might sometimes detect the thefts of their teachers.</p>
      <p>But your and others' works, recently dedicated to the king and some of our nobles and received with such applause by the more learned, have almost eternally imposed silence on those triflers; they have also encouraged those to handle your writings whom the dreadful threats of their teachers had hitherto deterred.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most learned man, continue with happy omens to be troublesome to your enemies and do not abandon the defense of the truth, and if you have any other monuments of your studies, publish them for the common benefit of all. In this way, you will daily more and more win the hearts of all the devoted and undoubtedly render the most acceptable sacrifice to God the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pardon my rashness.</p>
      <p>Oxford, from Magdalen College, the day before the calends of August.</p>
      <p>Yours, Michael Drome.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>[Zurich].</p>
