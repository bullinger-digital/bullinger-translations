    <p xml:id="regest1">Dedicates and sends to the Landgrave his interpretation of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Asks that this writing may be freely read in Hesse. The people of Zurich teach the pure truth. Their misfortune is not only divine punishment but also grace. Zurich, Bern, Basel, St. Gallen, and Schaffhausen remain steadfast in the Gospel. Even if the alliance is outwardly dissolved, the Evangelicals continue to support the Landgrave.</p>

      <p>To the Christian illustrious prince and lord, Lord Philipp, Landgrave in Hesse, my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Christian, illustrious prince and lord, my humble service with the offering of all good is always ready for your princely grace. Firstly, I beg your grace most highly, not to consider my trust (confidence) as an offense, that I have dared to write the Epistle to the Hebrews and hereby also send it. For it truly happened out of special love and loyalty. Since my predecessor of blessed memory, M. Huldrych Zwingli, during his lifetime, told me much about the honor, integrity, bravery, and friendship of your grace, I also hope that you will graciously accept my loyalty and not be ashamed of this writing, as long as it is useful and the pure truth. Therefore, I ask your grace to allow such writings to be read in your lands as before, and not to deny them to anyone who desires them, as it happens to us in some cities of other lands without blame. For we have no other intention (purpose) than that the eternal truth, whoever or whatever it concerns, is brought to light pure and clear, and the glorious honor of God is revealed to the whole world in the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>God has indeed humbled and sought us now, but he has sought us fatherly, not tempted us beyond what we can bear, and tested his own like gold in the fire, also punished our sins with temporal shame, so that he may free us from eternal shame. Therefore, we also give thanks and recognize his fatherly loyalty. Nevertheless, here in Zurich in the city and in the countryside, likewise in Bern, Basel, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, etc., we still firmly (steadfastly, decisively) stand by God and his word, against all papacy, in God's grace and hand, and are willing to persevere with his grace until the end.</p>
      <p>And although the outwardly written alliance is weakened by compulsion, more than by all pious love, your grace should know that all lovers of evangelical truth bear no less great love and remarkable favor towards your grace, recognizing your loyalty and goodness shown to us unworthy ones, and winning your grace's love more and more, therefore they receive your grace's steadfastness and bravery by God's word with great joy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask your grace to always increase, to have entrusted us, to graciously accept this my simple writing and hereby sent little book, to protect the commentary, as far as it is just and not contrary to the truth, as it is fitting for your grace, especially for the sake of the Christian name, and without doubt will be serviceable to the truth. May God lead and preserve your princely grace along with your people in his will to his honor and eternal salvation.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, the 1st day of the autumn month in 1532.</p>
      <p>Your grace's humble servant</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, preacher at the cathedral, Zurich.</p>
