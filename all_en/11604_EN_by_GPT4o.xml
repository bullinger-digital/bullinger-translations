    <p xml:id="regest1">[The Zurich theologians] are expecting the Dean of Passau [Ruprecht von Mosham], about whom they have only heard through Myconius and do not know whether he is in Bern or Lucerne; the discussion about faith will not be denied to anyone in Zurich, but they will not make long circumstances with this man. Myconius may keep the statements of Leo [Jud] and Bullinger on Grynäus’ lecture [about the Lord's Supper] for some time, but he should ensure that Grynäus’ writing is not printed. The plague is also noticeable in Zurich. [The Zurichers] are disappointed with Christoph [Rotacher], who has wronged a maid of Myconius; he may be able to positively influence the young man; the [Zurich] schoolmasters have already reprimanded him, and there is hope that he will improve. Christian [Hochholzer] and [Johannes] Pontisella will visit Myconius [on their journey to Marburg]; Bullinger asks him to assist the two with advice, as they hold him in high regard. He hopes for lasting connection with him, even beyond the possible death from the plague. Bullinger's mother [Anna, née Wiederkehr] died on August 16.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We are expecting the Dean of Passau; if the Lord turns him away from our church, we will rightly give great thanks. So far, we have heard nothing about this man except what you have written. And now we do not know whether he is in Bern or Lucerne, nor have we heard a word about him. He will undoubtedly find some curious and novelty-loving people among us, to whom he will be welcome. We cannot ask the magistrate to exclude him or not to listen to the man, as we continually offer ourselves to satisfy anyone questioning our faith.</p>
      <p>We would render both ourselves and our doctrine highly suspect if we did not engage with a fearless spirit. Therefore, for the safety of our church and the truth, with God's help and favor, we are ready to engage with the man, if the magistrate commands; but in the meantime, we will lay aside the arts, omit the titles, and exclude the circumlocutions to strictly and briefly contend with the state of affairs. And if we can, we will bring forth the old fathers' arguments and not make much circumlocution. But it is the Lord's to supply strength and wisdom, so that His glory may shine everywhere. Let us pray to Him diligently.</p>
      <p>Regarding the letter of Leo and mine on Grynäus' dictations, I say nothing now, except that it may be used for a month or more, provided that both are eventually returned to us in good faith. You ensure that his dictations are not published in print.</p>
      <p>The plague is also beginning to spread among us, but with still mild severity; the Lord knows what will happen. May He protect us. Amen.</p>
      <p>We all regret that Christoph has defiled your house with his infamous fornication, as we recommended him to you as a saint and most devoted to integrity, and you received him in such a way that you could never have thought he would become the corrupter of your maids. But such is the misfortune of the flesh and the folly of youth; may the Lord have mercy on him. Forgive him his fault, and wherever you can advise the wretched man, do so, lest he be entirely consumed by impurity.</p>
      <p>The schoolmasters have written to him quite harshly. I believe he will live more rightly and purely at some point.</p>
      <p>Christian and Pontisella, excellent young men, are now away and come to greet you. If you can benefit them with any healthy advice, please do so, I implore you. For they respect and love you as one who has deserved well of letters, the church, and all the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Please, always be ours, for we are yours, and write frequently. If the plague takes us away from this misery, we will discuss mutually in future glory to our satisfaction. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed Myconius.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of August, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger, as always.</p>
      <p>My most pious mother passed away to the Lord on August 16.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother.</p>
