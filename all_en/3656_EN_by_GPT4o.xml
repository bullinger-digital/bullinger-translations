      <p> Greetings. You write little, knowing that I am busy; I will also write little in return, for my brother will be in place of a longer letter. First of all, I give you great thanks for your prayer or blessing, with which you bless our wedding. May the Lord make it valid and bring it to fruition, and I do not doubt the Lord's goodwill. May the Lord also bless you and all yours in return and grant that we may someday gather for the eternal wedding of His Son! As for not inviting you to mine, I know you will not take it amiss. </p>
      <p> You would have been the most welcome guest of all I could have had; but perhaps it would have been less convenient for you to come now than at another time when we will be less busy, and I still pray that you may come sometime as you have often done before; for all of Bern desires to see and hear you. Sulzer was here these days; I do not know whether he will come to Zürich on this journey or not. We have no news of new events. </p>
      <p> The king seems to want to undertake something against the Burgundians, to which our people are diligently attending. Several captains who had recruited our soldiers were captured on the way by some prefects by order of our magistrate and brought here, where they had to face the danger of execution; for their case was handled before the dioceses in such a way that many were pleased to take the death penalty against them. However, the other opinion prevailed, by which they were released, but it was expressly said to them that this fault was pardoned to them out of clemency; otherwise, they would have been deemed worthy of the sword's punishment. They were also forced to swear to send back all our soldiers as soon as they arrived in the camp. </p>
      <p> My lords have now applied great seriousness to this matter for a while; may God confirm it! Our Savoyards disturb us beyond measure, and I fear that those churches will suffer a severe crisis within a short time. I worry that many will be praised; for there is no rest nor cessation ever. </p>
      <p> If only I could use your advice in many things, as I would like; but I will write about these matters another time. Now I commend you and all yours to the Lord. </p>
      <p> Glaner, my father-in-law, and Samuel Zähender, now your and also my relative, greet you, as do all the brothers, especially Musculus. July 25, 1558. </p>
      <p> Your H[aller]. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and godfather, to be honored with perpetual faith. </p>
