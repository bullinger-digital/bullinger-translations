      <p>I praise your zeal in reconciling the cities, dearest Huldrych [Bullinger], but as to how this can be achieved, even the most thoughtful minds ponder daily and come to the conclusion that they do not know. In Basel, they worked with some, but I do not know what they attempted. Our people have tried to convene the cities' delegates to settle the war expenses and to discuss how they wish to proceed in the future. Here is an opportunity, but whether it has been presented to you as well, I do not know; you will judge. Two of our men have been sent to Wil in favor of the people of St. Gallen, one of whom, Crispinus Vischer, a very wise and faithful man, will come to you. We will meditate daily on the welfare of the Christian republic and on what makes for peace. But I see this one thing: "Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain" [Ps 127:1]. He will watch over it when we earnestly sigh to Him in prayers, which I fear has been neglected by many so far, and more thought has been given to the arm of the flesh. May the Lord support our ministry with His spirit, so that we do not run in vain. Write while you have safe messengers. The prefect in Lenzburg, Otherus of Aarau, will deliver it when you do not have someone who can come directly to us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not cease to demand the method of study and hardening. You make me eager with the Hebrews and the office of the prophet, but you do not deliver. I had asked you for what you had compiled on the Romans, but you never responded. I beg you to forgive each weakness and ignorance. For your spirit pleases me so much that I will not easily explain it. Therefore, you do wrong by not providing what I could refresh myself with daily.</p>
      <p>Megander is well, and I wish he always remains so. The acts of the synod are completed, but due to the snow, they have not yet been brought to us. I desire the integrity of the delegates from all sides.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May Leo and Pellicanus be well, from whom I received both letters and a small gift from Funck, to which I will soon respond. And may you and your family also be well. Our Zwingli, Wilhelm, is doing excellently. We will take care of the boy as if he were our own. You will also greet his mother in my name.</p>
      <p>February 20th.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>Since it is missing, it is as: Neither city deigns to address the other first.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
