      <p>"I was with my lord today regarding your oats.</p>
      <p>There are no more oats here; however, I have been told that there are still some sacks of oats in Bad Ragaz, where my lords will arrange with the bailiff to prohibit them from being taken if they come. Meanwhile, I have written to Mr. Tscharner's agent to go to Bad Ragaz and inquire about what is there and to secure it properly." Everything is still the same. I have not reported that anything has been done about the typesetter, because if something is available, the typesetter might also be helped. I have thus reported that he has bought several bushels of oats from you and promised to pay half immediately and the other half in eight days.</p>
      <p>For if something is paid now, the typesetter might also want to have his share; therefore, write accordingly and demand the entire sum.</p>
      <p>If there is anything available, it will go to the typesetter; for I have been told that he owes a thousand guilders; on the other hand, he is also owed a great deal; yet it is believed that he may not be able to collect, and he has been working day and night, and has been considered a reliable fellow by everyone.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>On the 15th of May, in the year 1565. Yours, Fabricius. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
