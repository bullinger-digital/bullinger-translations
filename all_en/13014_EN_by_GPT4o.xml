    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The young man, [Jakob] Hermann from Magdeburg, delivered Bullinger's letter from July 7th. How full of divine comfort was this letter [not preserved]! It gave new courage to Erb, who was bedridden and suffering from a skin inflammation. May God richly reward the letter writer for this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Nikolaus König has written a letter to the widow of Erasmus Schmid, [Marta, née Blarer], regarding her exiled daughter Elisabeth, who is currently serving as a maid for the bailiff [Hans Henman I. (Amandus)] of Riquewihr. He is trying to reconcile the mother and asks Bullinger to act in the same direction. The many tears shed by the daughter would in themselves deserve forgiveness, even if she were indeed guilty, for they are a testament to her willingness to repent and show remorse. She left her boy [...] in Basel, but would have much preferred to entrust him to the grandmother, not so that she would feed him at her own expense; no, she would have taken care of that herself. König asks Bullinger to inform him about the reasons for her flight and the offenses of her husband [Hans Schumacher]. Bullinger should also send him the divorce letter, especially since some claim that the divorce occurred because she committed adultery. With the letter, she could silence the slanderers. Bullinger should prove himself an ally in this matter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Riquewihr, nothing has been heard about Augsburg and the Imperial Diet, except that Emperor Charles V intends to undertake something significant, mainly directed against Christ. But Christ has already died and cannot die again, as he has already overcome death and will let those who suffer for his sake partake in his life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, especially from König. In haste.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. Hermann from Magdeburg, a young man, delivered your letter to me on July 7th, which was entirely full of divine comforts. It greatly revived my little body, which was lying on a small bed and almost exhausted from an inflammation of erysipelas. May He, who can repay all things most abundantly, continually comfort you through Jesus Christ! Amen.</p>

      <p>Nikolaus König wrote to the widow of Erasmus Schmid regarding the exile of her daughter Elisabeth (who is now serving in the house of our noble bailiff, a truly honest and pious man) and is trying to obtain either reconciliation or grace for her with her mother. He asks that you be diligent in the same duty. Certainly, if the daughter has committed any offense, she deserves forgiveness for the many tears with which she testifies to her sin and stubbornness, also promising repentance. She left her boy in Basel with strangers, whom she would prefer to be under the care of his grandmother, not because he would be fed by her in vain, but at her own expense. Then he asks you, who know the reason for her departure, as well as the offenses of her husband, and earnestly requests the divorce letter. For there are those who reproach her with something, as if she were a prostitute. She would have something to defend herself against the slanderers. You should act as a friend in this duty.</p>

      <p>We hear nothing about Augsburg and the Imperial Diet, except that they think the imperial majesty is planning something significant, especially against Christ. But Christ, having died once, no longer dies, and He who has overcome death will one day bring to life His members who are mortified for Him. May God turn all things to the salvation of believers, etc.</p>
