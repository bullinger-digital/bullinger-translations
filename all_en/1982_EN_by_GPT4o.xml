      <p>The troubles and concerns of the fair, which present themselves, prevent me, most humane man, from being able to write to you now in a learned and full manner about what... your most faithful concern has done for the common good. Therefore, I ask that you do not interpret any negligence or imprudence in this unpolished writing of mine as if I thought that a correspondence of letters should intervene between me and a common or similar man. However, to respond in order to your most humane letters, briefly consider this: Although I have enough reason to reveal to you certain other things by which some of your young men have seriously offended me, otherwise not bad, especially because they threatened to report and speak to the lords, which, once understood, would prevent you from recommending any other to me, I prefer that they earn little faith and favor with you through false accusations or excuses, rather than seem, even if I tell the truth, to recall these things to memory due to private offense and in defense of my cause. However, if we find out later that they responded to those threats with the actual matter, I will no longer be able to restrain myself from exercising the power of my pen as they do their tongues. But so that I do not seem to measure and act for private gain, what I have done and will do, I will not receive any student at my table, not indeed of anyone, let alone your young men, but so that I do not experience the inconveniences I did before. And to show that I wish to gratify you above others, I will rent out the hypocausts, beds, couches, and whatever else pertains to them to the Swiss, if not at a lower, certainly not at a higher expense, and I will not exclude them as long as they do not cause greater harm or bring infamy and inconvenience to me or my house through nocturnal excursions, disturbances, defilements of secret places, or other similar licentious acts. I will also accommodate other arrangements, which I can do without inconvenience to myself, as you do not require otherwise. Certainly, there was a constant rumor about the Swiss that they wandered around with a tortoise, a lyre, and flutes, and indeed modestly, on the most untimely night of this summer; but I could not bear even the most modest owls in my house after one or two admonitions disregarded; for even those modest ones are in danger from cobblers, enemies with drunken minds and efforts, or from the collusions or drinking bouts of prostitutes, which provide a handle for those watches, not to mention that these also cause daily disgust for letters and there is always a fear of fire, theft, rape, or other inconveniences for the master of the house who harbors those owls. Therefore, I have the doors locked with double bolts so that no one can leave or return without a key after the eighth or ninth hour except me and whom I wish. However, whether any of your young men or more were involved in those nocturnal wanderings, as I neither wished to know nor have I explored, and besides them, there are also people from Schaffhausen and Bern here. Laurentius Blanckenheim, the secretary, knows whom he intercepted playing before my doors and dismissed with a full glass of wine. However, I do not want you to be unaware that the nature of the Swiss young men is such that they want to be seen and desire to be talked about and to be in the mouth above others, and for that reason, they make more expenses than necessary among friends, and they more boldly or foolishly involve themselves in conflicts and dangers than is appropriate for the dignity of the enemies or the injuries inflicted. In short: they think that whoever does not hold them in high regard is only sour in appearance, with whom they should wrestle. They know how, for a trivial reason, they once stirred up such a fire, such disturbances, and how they would have incurred the most immediate danger to their lives if they had not been restrained and preserved by the prayers of two women and one maid and the fear of me, though absent but still alive. Indeed, as long as this school lasted, there was not such a frequency nor such a clamor of armed cobblers against the students as there was against my boarders, yet it arose from the mutual stipulation of two, one a Swiss, the other a cobbler, that they would want to fight with arms in the forum.</p>
      <p>How much they spent with me, you can see from the notes included with this writing, and the one who spent the most did not spend more than 17 and a half florins with me. But if this semester they spent much more, they certainly cannot attribute it to me as if I received more for each than anyone else (although, if I did, they know that more was provided by me to them) nor can they claim that they wanted to change their table or leave their residence voluntarily for the sake of reducing expenses. Indeed, each had a table, residence, and bed for eleven florins, perhaps with one and a half gold coins or at most dalers. So how did it happen that they spent more this semester than the last, when neither wood nor candles nor other things needed in winter were required?</p>
      <p>If they say that I treated them harshly because I unexpectedly renounced the table and some the residence, it is answered to them that they gave enough reason with their modest gratitude, and where they did not lack a single day for obtaining a table for the Schaffhausen people without consulting me, there a three-day period was given to them by [me] and they stayed with me for a whole eight days after the renunciation of the residence and used my beds and other things as before, nor were they ordered to pay even a penny for that service of mine, nor did they offer. So how can they complain that I threw them out so inhumanely? But I forgave them everything because I know they deeply regretted the deed, and I earnestly ask the lords to forgive them everything, as I have forgiven them, by which they offended me.</p>
      <p>For that service, I promise not to judge others by their character, as you ask, and to assist those I can conveniently, as I did before, except for the table alone, as I said above.</p>
      <p>I also advise that you do not send anyone to Lausanne in the way you did them, namely, to live with a private or own table and not to cohabit with anyone whom they must fear and obey. For they have often recommended to me the delights of Lausanne and the cheapness and frequent use of the best wine, and I secretly learned what other pleasures they indulged in through license, so it did not seem so surprising to me that they found it so difficult to bear our discipline and frugality.</p>
      <p>And indeed, if everything was so cheap there, they certainly should not have spent so much there. I am very sorry that Doctor Hyperius was not more prudent in recommending their cause to you; for I suspect he advocated for them from here, because he dared, when he learned that the others had moved elsewhere, to advise Collinus to also move from my house, openly adding this reason, that it would be more favorable and seem more probable to the lords for the sake of his compatriots, but more unjust to me. For Collinus confessed this to me in my ear voluntarily. But if it is true (as I do not doubt; for he is sometimes more evidently governed by his wife and affections, and the cause of the loan taken and repaid by me does not agree so well with him). But if he wanted to act in good faith, he should have rather heard from me the reasons for the renounced table and residence and, having heard both sides, should have aimed for mutual reconciliation rather than approve their plan. But it is not uncommon with us that, while one does not fear to incur offense among students by just chastisement, another wishes to gain some favor and earn praise for gentleness and humanity by disapproving of it. Eight days ago, he approached me and said he had to write to you about how your young men behaved; so he asked if I would reveal to him how I got along with them, and I revealed everything to him, and he disapproved of most things, but remained silent on some. Therefore, if he wrote anything at the previous fair that detracts from my credibility, consider, I ask, that he could not have written anything certain to you at that time about those matters, the credibility of which he now finally wished to know from my account. May the Lord prevent us from seeking praise from the defense of petulance and from stirring up envy against him whom we do not favor so much, and we pretend, perhaps even for private gain, which we are plotting against. He is an eloquent and learned theologian; but if anyone wishes to be promoted to honors and preferred to others by the recommendation of petulant young men and listeners, let him see that he does not become suspected of a certain hypocritical ambition. I cannot and do not wish to approve of Oldendorp's rule in all respects, but similarly, neither the contempt of Hyperius's magistrates by the listeners, to whom if Hyperius secretly advocated, he would certainly not be without fault. I would wish the prince not to be so excessively attached to hunting and to be more careful of false prophets, that is, those who, under the pretext of helping the republic and the causes of the prince, rather consult for themselves, oppress the republic, the church, and the school, flatter the wicked and powerful, and attack the good and sincere. I would wish that bishops or superintendents would not so coldly or timidly or lovingly perform their duty and connive at everything, appoint the inexperienced or wicked and deplorable to the ministry, or even without examination and other just ceremonies. I would wish that we had one serious, pious, prudent, not bitter, and not given to affections as a reformer of the school.</p>
      <p>It is not likely or certainly rare that anything excellent is built and conducted from a base example that is always similar to itself, and if theologians assent to it, it is evident from experience that everything is rather destroyed and even the good are corrupted. In short: it stands very badly, nor can it be otherwise, where the leaders of the church do not treat and perform their duty more seriously and sincerely. I expected your young men here; for each still owes me some sum of money. But in vain. Unless you can send it sooner, I will gladly refrain from demanding it until the next fair for your sake. Farewell to all. Given in Frankfurt, etc. If the occasion arises, I ask you to publicly remind our otherwise excellent prince of his duty, that he should have a more serious oversight of his officials, superintendents, and masters, so that they may perform their duties more faithfully, as it happens.</p>
      <p>Yours, Wigand.</p>
      <p>And forgive your young men for my sake, I ask again; if you do not, you will make it so that I do not write as candidly in the future about what it is important for you to know, as I have done so far.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and worthy minister of the word in Zurich.</p>
