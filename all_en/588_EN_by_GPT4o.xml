      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Here at last are the books that you have long requested from me.</p>
      <p>A faithful courier was the reason I did not send them; however, you will receive the others, namely those of Sturm, when they come to us from the Strasbourg fair. The refutation of the Anabaptist heresy is not available; the bookseller has sold all such books, nor is Titelmann's work on the Song of Songs available, nor can I find Wicel's work on the Eucharist anymore.</p>
      <p>Wicel's book on apostolic tradition is also in quarto; if you desire it, I will send it. The refutation against the WÃ¼rttembergers for the Interim has been expanded, a booklet full of blasphemies. I do not wish to send the history of the holy war at this time; for certain additions are being made; once they are completed, it will be up to you to write whether you want that book. Do not be concerned about the price; I will purchase it from our printers at the lowest price possible.</p>
      <p>These booklets all cost 8 Constance batz. It will be up to you to write what I should give to Mr. Froschauer for those quires, and I will gladly give whatever he asks of me. However, there are still some things missing in the third volume of Zwingli's works: the Book of Proverbs of Solomon translated according to the Hebrew truth, the translation of Ecclesiastes, - in the Song of Songs, - the Book of Job. With these booklets received, I now have the complete works of the most holy man, a treasure more precious than gold and silver.</p>
      <p>I also ask you to write to me extensively about giving and receiving oaths, if you have the leisure, and in the order in which you usually provide everything to us. We have submitted a supplication to our senate, that they should not swear by the saints, we have provided words from scripture, added reasons and examples; but we have not yet received any response.</p>
      <p>Valentin approves of the oath with our senate and still one of the brothers, both of whom have separated from us. However, in the name of the Lord, we could not and will not deny what is expressed in the scriptures. Our certain pastors, I am compelled to say, received the legates of our senate very poorly and with bitter words, who were sent to those four pastors and dismissed them in disagreement, later they were led to repentance. If they had received the legates well in the first meeting and had said they would deliberate with the remaining brothers the next day, certainly everything would have turned out better. It is not permitted to discuss this matter at length now.</p>
      <p>We have nothing certain from the Belgians. However, I heard this from a certain merchant: "The Emperor has sent all embassies to Brabant, held them there, saying that his request and desire is, also his sincere opinion, that they should help him and his people protect and defend Spain against anyone with people, Brabant, artillery, stone, and powder. This has been refused by the cities; but otherwise, they are willing and obedient to serve His Imperial Majesty, also to protect their fatherland."</p>
      <p>Strasbourg has not yet received the mass. No one believes with what zeal the word of God is heard and how earnestly they pray for concord in public temples; without a doubt, the Lord will hear their prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 13, 1549. Greet Mr. Theodor for me. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
