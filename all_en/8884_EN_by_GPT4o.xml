      <p> Greetings. The messenger from Schwyz has brought nothing else today than a friendly letter from the authorities, stating that if Mr. Conrad does not act against the common land, letter, and seal, he will be given safe conduct to and from the court, in the same manner as my gracious lords of Zurich have also written. We are gladly accepting this, as this man has been riding around. Response otherwise. </p>
      <p> I wanted to add this so that you do not think there is something more dangerous. This is what young lord Hans Georg von Marmels informed me of this morning. </p>
