      <p>Greetings. Your letter was most welcome to me, most esteemed Bullinger, which reached me immediately upon my return from the baths; it demonstrates your usual concern for the churches, which I greatly approve of, and, as is fitting, I will not allow cooperation in this necessary work to be lacking in me. It was very beneficial that the brothers were reminded through letters in my absence, with whom I had also discussed certain matters on the same business before my departure, and they diligently performed their duty both publicly and privately, so that I hope our people will not deviate from the votes of yours and the Bernese; for they can in no way do this without an explicit denial of true profession. I did the same at the baths with both Schaffhausen consuls; for I had them as companions there, and the brothers informed me through letters about the confederates' scheme and made me exceedingly anxious. I have also received some news about the open door for the gospel of Christ among the Poles, to which I give more credence because the same is reported from various other sources, and there is no lack of hope that the boundaries of Christ's kingdom can be extended among the Germans, after immunity was granted by the consensus of all electors not only to those who have hitherto embraced the gospel but also to those who will embrace it in the future, including princes, nobles, and cities; for thus did Georg Laetus, a singular friend of both of us, and Otto Heinrich, the Palatine prince, openly indicate to me, and Charles, the margrave, who is our neighbor, is already making beginnings in the lower part of his margraviate, where he replaces the departing papist priests with evangelicals and supports and protects those defecting from papism.</p>
      <p>The Lord must be asked to spread the fragrance of His knowledge far and wide and to strengthen and guide His elect with His principal spirit, so that through sincere faith and reformation of life for the better, they may glorify Him and bring consolation in the many fatal afflictions of the Christian world through the shining and triumphant word of Christ. We are all rightly moved by the afflictions and martyrdom of the English brothers, so that, since we can do nothing else, we commend them to the comforting spirit with earnest intercessions, that those who still remain may endure steadfastly until glorious liberation, so that dying with Christ, they may triumph with Him in glory. I would have gladly sent both booklets you requested, but one is not available here at the booksellers; however, it can be obtained at the next fair; I will easily ensure that this happens. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your fellow ministers and your entire family. Basel, July 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed and beloved lord and fellow minister.</p>
