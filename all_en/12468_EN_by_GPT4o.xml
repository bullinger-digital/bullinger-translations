    <p xml:id="regest1">Pincier is thankful to God that the [Zürichers] once again demonstrated their care for him through Bullinger's letter [not received]. This allows him to better endure the difficulties of life and to deal with them more calmly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In their apology [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”], the Zürichers were apparently concerned only with the truth and God's honor, without regard for their own reputation. For in defending a cause, no matter how just it may be, one resorts to counter-accusations, even if unwillingly, which are better left unspoken, especially since accusations arise from them again. However, the reasons of the Zürichers are open before God, so they need not fear the judgment of people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The clear-sighted perception of Christ truly applies to the daring [Theobald Thamer], who tries to draw everyone's attention with his new interpretations, which he already succeeded in doing in Marburg. However, the [definitive] judgment will be made by God, as He knows the secret thoughts of every person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Pincier [and his colleagues] share the same opinion about Luther's death as the Zürichers, who do well to pray to God for peaceful people. It is true that the [inner-Protestant] conflict was ignited by scholars. Yet, unlearned and quarrelsome people will always contribute to it because they completely submit to the opinion of their teacher [Luther], regardless of what the majority of scholars may think about it. After the death of their leader, however, one can hope that it will become quieter. When Pincier confidentially discussed the [Eucharist] dispute with Johannes Pistorius from Nidda in [1545], the latter said that the great esteem enjoyed by Philipp Melanchthon could overshadow Luther's authority if the latter were to die first. May harmony now return!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Pincier commends himself and his colleagues to Bullinger's prayers.</p>

      <p>Greetings from God through Jesus Christ. I give immortal thanks first to our God and then to your kindness for deeming it worthy to write to me amidst your great and numerous occupations. I also congratulate and rejoice with myself for being, though otherwise unworthy, enriched and adorned by so many and such great acts of your charity. I wish to remain in the same goodwill. For I hope that this condition of my life, or any other, will be much more tolerable and peaceful for me, since it is otherwise exposed and subject to various adversities from Satan and the worst of men. To endure and overcome these with a more equitable mind and courage, the friendship of good and learned men indeed brings no small assistance and comfort, in my judgment. For this reason, I do not cease to commend myself to you repeatedly and, in a way, to impose myself upon you, even if I have nothing else to write.</p>

      <p>In your apology, I believe you sought not so much the applause of the multitude as the perpetual course and agreement of truth, and you looked more to the glory of God than to your own or anyone else's honor. For often, even unwillingly, counter-accusations (die Gegenanklagen) are extorted, which undoubtedly the best of people would prefer to avoid altogether if the nature and end of the matter allowed. And I hardly think it possible for anyone in such a contention and defense of themselves, however just, to propose their innocence so gently and modestly without also, in the meantime, showing the opponent's crime or injury or malevolence or falsehood or imprudence, as if doing something else, from which their accusation chiefly arose. But your reasons are well known to God, so the judgments of men are less to be feared.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The prophecy of Christ truly applies to that man bold enough in bringing forth new interpretations with some desire to dissent from both the ancients and the moderns. I greatly fear that he is led more by ambition and envy than by a true zeal for piety, as he wishes to appear so singular, as indeed he is regarded by almost everyone in Marburg. But God knows how faithfully each one serves, who will ultimately judge rightly what is hidden from us here or what people falsely establish and persuade.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We feel the same about Luther's death as you do, and you rightly pray to God to provide successors who are men of peace. But indeed, although the dissension between the parties may eventually be settled by the more learned, there will never be a lack of unlearned and contentious people who will want to cling to and stand by the words of their master, regardless of what the better and greater part of the learned may decide. Otherwise, there is good hope that the rest will be more placable and not as agitated as Luther was. For I heard last year from Johannes Pistorius of Nidda, when we were speaking familiarly about the end of that controversy, that the authority of Philipp Melanchthon could easily overshadow Luther's authority if the latter were to die first. May God grant that complete harmony is established among all, so that the kingdom of God may be expanded and His name celebrated. Amen.</p>

      <p>May you fare well in Christ with all yours, and I pray that you always keep us commended in your prayers. Given from Frankfurt, around the Ides of April in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pinzinger, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned Antistes of the Zürich church, his teacher and lord, uniquely to be honored. In Zürich.</p>
