    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's gift. The catechism by Leo Jud is well received. Bucer defends Luther, even though he sees how Luther attacks everyone he thinks contradicts him. Arguing with Luther, who preaches the Gospel, is not sensible. It is not for us to condemn him, whom God uses as His instrument, even though it is hard to swallow what God allows him to write, now for example against Erasmus. In Strasbourg, everything is calm. Bucer fully supports the people of Zurich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I give immense thanks for your gift. It is clear to me how much you desire and are able to serve the Church of Christ towards solid piety. May the Lord preserve and promote you.</p>
      <p>Your catechism is highly approved. For who would not approve what is pious? Indeed, I desire something in the exposition of the ecclesiastical ministry, about which more another time. For now, there is no time. We live by faith. Therefore, the first thing in the church, which is proposed both in words and symbols, is the promise, which, when we have embraced it by faith, our mutual confederation follows by itself. However, as far as I am concerned, since you see abundantly that you are going the same way as all the saints, these things of yours are quite correct, so that with the ancient church I wish us all to agree both in the manner of speaking of the scripture and in other things, and then to deliver everything of Christ to our people in such a way that they receive and embrace them as things that are of Christ.</p>
      <p>About Luther, my dear Heinrich, I had written extensively, if you had cared to read, what keeps me in my defense of this man. I see how excellently my Lord has used him for His glory so far and still uses him to preach that on which everything depends: "Jesus Christ is our only Savior, and besides Him nothing can be for salvation," indeed more excellently and even more successfully than I do not say myself and those like me, but anyone else in all of Europe. At the same time, I see this utterly intolerable fury, with which he rages and rants against anyone, not who disagrees with him, but whom he thinks disagrees, and thus he curses the most holy men who have served the Church of Christ to the greatest benefit. This indeed is the sole reason that has drawn me into the arena, so that I have given my name in this sacramental fight. For in the very question from the beginning, I seemed to see that I would not have fought here at all. But what should I do? Should I abandon him? But my Lord, who knows how much this fury is an evil, and follows it more gravely, as I said, uses him excellently to preach His gospel. Should I, whom the Lord now deigns to such a distinguished ministry in the church, cast him down? If it is not mine to cast him down, so that he may perform this ministry with fruit, I must therefore seek to mitigate his evils, to overlook, to cover them, to assert, defend, and proclaim his good with great zeal. You say: "The ancients did not tolerate such. They had greater regard for the saints, who have now happily completed their labor for Christ. They did not tolerate those who rage and rant." I too wish not to tolerate such a Luther. But how shall I avert this evil by condemning and rejecting the whole Luther? That is not allowed, since the Lord has decreed to use him in this way. Where is that authority for us in the churches of Christ, that they should reject Luther because we condemn him? I see, to my sorrow, that by attacking Luther, we have caused many to reject the whole gospel with Luther. He seeks a quarrel with the weary. But what will we achieve by quarreling in the commonwealth of Christ? That Luther should act more gently? But he who seeks this, provokes the hornets. That others should become better from it? None of you will hope for this. For the whole cause has been thoroughly examined and the good men defended, as much as they can indeed be defended by us. I am so enclosed by these things that I think we must entirely swallow what the Lord permits Luther to write against kings, princes, and everyone, as well as against us, as he now does against Erasmus.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Here everything is calm. May it remain so. But farewell. I fear some are contemplating war. May God turn it for the good.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 9.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>You write that you are mine and ask that I remain yours. Ah, my dear Heinrich, I seek nothing more in life. Truly you are mine, always to be respected by me in the Lord. More another time. Now it was not possible. Greet a thousand times a thousand your entire choir and the most holy Leo.</p>
      <p>To the excellent Christ's Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
