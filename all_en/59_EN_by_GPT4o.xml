    <p xml:id="regest1">There are no news. Georg Frölich writes a short message in cipher: Piety is considered a vice [in Augsburg]. He and his people live in the worst bondage. Emperor Charles V will not wage war on anyone this year unless he is forced to. [His son] Philip II of Spain will soon be crowned [Roman-German King] in Augsburg or Strasbourg. [So much for Frölich's message].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Two [imperial] regiments were moved from Nördlingen to Heilbronn. However, before their departure, the [Spanish] mercenaries set the hospital on fire and prevented the firefighting efforts. Goods worth up to 15,000 guilders went up in flames! This was reported by a pious, reliable citizen [N.N.] from Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The Bishop of Constance, Johann von Weeze, is playing a nasty game with the city of Constance. He forbids all citizens of Constance from cultivating wine on the Reichenau. Moreover, he neither allows the vineyards to be leased to others nor does he take care of their maintenance himself, even though the citizens of Constance have requested it. He does not care about his future financial losses in the tithe income but gladly accepts them as long as the citizens of Constance suffer an even greater disadvantage. Help, God! What terrible people these are!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">King Ferdinand I has no interest in a [conciliation] agreement with Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. He claims the duchy as if Ulrich had forfeited it. The court proceedings he demanded are already being held [under the chairmanship] of the Archbishop of Cologne, Adolf III of Schaumburg. It is feared that Ulrich will lose his duchy again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">The mercenaries and Spanish soldiers, who were previously stationed in Ravensburg, are now in Reutlingen and are oppressing the population greatly. Moreover, the soldiers are hunting a lot of game daily in the best ducal hunting grounds, the Schönbuch, skinning the animals and leaving the venison behind. Duke Ulrich, who had the eyes of many [alleged poachers] gouged out, must now (like everyone else) endure his divine punishment!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Charles V has ordered a so-called Interim. New inventions always need new names! For this purpose, a monk from Cologne [Eberhard Billick], [the imperial commissioner] Heinrich Has, Jakob Sturm from Strasbourg, and Georg Besserer from Ulm, as well as other committee members, have been tasked with drafting a proposal on how everyone [in the empire] should handle religious matters until the general council. Ultimately, however, the Emperor is to have the final say on the content of the Interim.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">As has just been learned, the princes and electors have managed to persuade Charles V to take on the arbitration of the legal dispute between Ferdinand I and Ulrich of Württemberg. The Emperor is said to have already promised not to depose the Duke. However, he will have to buy back the duchy from Ferdinand I for a great deal of gold, as if he had lost his claim to the land.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Duke Heinrich the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel is demanding 26 tons of gold from the imperial estates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">The citizens of Augsburg must pay their bishop [Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] compensation of 19,000 guilders. In addition, he is making high demands on the imperial cities. From the city of Kempten alone, he demands [another] 30,000 guilders! At best, he will probably receive 10,000 or 12,000 guilders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Currently, the most important topic at the Augsburg Diet is that the clergy are reclaiming all their church properties and rights. After that, a general council can discuss [religious matters]. It is firmly believed that Charles V will propose this restitution to the imperial estates as such an urgently needed measure that the [secular] estates will have to agree to it. After that, the citizens of Constance will be told once and for all how they must behave, and in particular, how they must deal with the priests. Should they oppose the decision of the imperial estates, they will fall out of favor with all other estates. And they will receive no support because no one wants to take on the Emperor and the imperial estates. Therefore, they will soon be destroyed as a [deterrent] example for all disobedient people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">According to a distinguished man [N.N.] who has free access to the Emperor, things will go badly for Constance. However, he mentioned some reasons for this, among many others, that are completely unfounded! But God is a mighty avenger and savior! There is great unity among the citizens of Constance, and many of them are turning earnestly to God. May their good example also benefit others! Bullinger and all the pious [Zurichers] should pray for the citizens of Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">Everyone sends their regards, especially Blarer's brother [Thomas Blarer] and Konrad Zwick. Greetings to Bullinger's family and colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">Bullinger should deliver the enclosed letter addressed to Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">The Lindau church, after the death of the pious Thomas Gaßner, now wishes for a new pastor. Blarer is to take care of this successor at the urgent request of the Lindau council, but he does not know any [suitable candidate]. If Bullinger can suggest a pastor for this position, he should do so as quickly as possible. Blarer should also persuade the Zurichers, at the behest of an honorable man [N.N.] (who was sent to him specifically for this purpose), to allow Johannes Haller to serve the Lindau church for one or two years. [The appointment of a Zürcher] would be safe for the people of Lindau, as the Emperor does not want to appear hostile to the Swiss Confederates. Since the Lindau church deserves to have a pious and well-educated leader, Blarer has promised to take care of it. Bullinger should let him know quickly whether the appointment of Haller would be promising. The Lindau council would [then send a corresponding letter] to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">Unfortunately, Blarer has nothing more to report.</p>

      <p>No news. Letus writes in obscure characters and few words that piety there is considered a sin, and that he and his people are in the harshest bondage. The Emperor will not wage war with anyone this year unless forced, and the Prince of Spain will come to either Augsburg or Strasbourg to receive the imperial crown, and that soon.</p>

      <p>The two regiments have moved from Nördlingen to Heilbronn. However, before they left Nördlingen, they set the hospital on fire and the citizens, according to their orders, were not allowed to intervene. Thus, the soldiers stood by the fire. Goods worth up to 15,000 guilders were burned. This was reported by a pious, honorable citizen from Augsburg.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our bishop is treating us very badly. Many of our citizens have vineyards in the Reichenau, which must now lie fallow. He will not allow our people to cultivate them, nor will he allow them to be leased for cultivation, nor will he cultivate them himself for our future benefit, etc. And yet he takes all the wine for himself! He gladly wants to lack and be stingy, now that we have nothing and are blind. Help, God! What miserable people they are!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The king will not accept any treaty or agreement with Duke Ulrich, but claims the land as entirely forfeited and demands his rights. It is now contested before the Archbishop of Cologne and it is feared that he must again come for land and people.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The soldiers and Spaniards stationed at Ravensburg are still at Reutlingen. The good people are very oppressed. They shoot a lot of game daily in the Schönbuch, where he has the best hunting grounds. They skin the animals and leave the game lying. He must now endure this from the strangers, for which he has severely punished his own people and had the eyes of many gouged out. Ita sunt iudicia domini. And everyone must give back the little knife.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor has ordered an interim. That's what they call it now. For new inventions must have new names. For this interim, he has appointed a monk from Cologne, Doctor Heinrich Has, Jacob Sturm from Strasbourg, and Jörgen Besserer from Ulm, and one or two others. They are to deliberate on how the interim (that is, in the meantime before the general council) should be handled by everyone. Thus, they have set their matter and submitted the interim of all things to the Emperor. The resolution of the interim is to stand by him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Now it is being said that the Emperor has taken the Württemberg matter seriously, and the electors and other princes have brought it into his hands and secured the Duke's reinstatement of the land. But he must redeem the land from the king as forfeited. It will cost several tons of gold!</p>

      <p>The people of Augsburg are paying their bishop 19,000 guilders, and the bishop still has great claims on the other estates. He demands 30,000 guilders from the people of Kempten alone. If it goes well, they think he will take 10,000 or 12,000 guilders.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The biggest issue currently in Augsburg is that the clergy are demanding to be fully restored everywhere. After that, a general council should discuss what is right. It is generally believed that the Emperor will take such a serious approach to this restitution that the other estates will all agree. Then we will be told once and for all what we must do, especially regarding the priests. If we do not do what others have agreed to do, we will have the disgrace before all other estates. If someone takes us on, they must also take on the Emperor and the entire empire. If no one takes us on, we will soon be made an example to all disobedient princes.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>As a distinguished man, who has free access to the Emperor, has let it be known: This city will fare badly for many reasons. He has mentioned some, for which we are completely unjustly blamed. But the Lord is the avenger and savior, whose arm is not shortened. There is no small concord among us, and many are seriously turning to the Lord. I hope their goodness will also benefit others. You pray diligently for us with all the pious.</p>

      <p>The church of Lindau now desires a pastor, as the very pious Thomas Gaßner has recently exchanged death for life and migrated to the heavens. The council requests and implores me in every way to look after them and find a successor. But I know no one. If you happen to know someone, I beseech you by Christ to inform me as soon as possible. A good and solidly pious man was sent to me for this purpose, to persuade the Zurichers to allow Haller to serve the people of Lindau for one or two years. This would be safest for them, as the Emperor does not want to appear angry with the Swiss at this time. I have promised to try something here. It is indeed a most worthy church, which should be provided with a good, pious, and learned bishop. If anything can be hoped for here, let me know as soon as possible. The council of Lindau will write to yours, etc.</p>
