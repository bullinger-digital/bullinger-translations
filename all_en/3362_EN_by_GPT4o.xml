      <p>To D. Bullinger, a most distinguished man and my dearest friend, I, Friedrich von Salis, send greetings.</p>
      <p>If you are well, my most honored Lord Bullinger and my most esteemed patron, it is well. Indeed, I and my entire family are quite well, by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, after I returned from Venice, I have written to you several times, and likewise, I have received some letters from you, which were indeed most welcome to me; for no other letters are ever more pleasing nor can they be, than those letters which are sent to me by you and my son. Therefore, I also ask that they be more frequent, provided that this can be done without disturbing your studies.</p>
      <p>But I have also received your Apocalypse, with which I was delighted in an extraordinary way, and I thank you especially for this gift, and I will also return thanks as much as I can when the opportunity presents itself. As you write, I will share your Apocalypse with my father-in-law and friends, but only after I have read it myself; for being too distracted by occupations, I have not yet been able to examine your work with the diligence I wished and wish for, although I have skimmed through most of it, and I was very pleased that you render the most obscure and difficult to understand passages with a skillful and most exquisite pious interpretation, making them very clear and easy to understand, so that what was previously most obscure to me (indeed the least of all) now seems to be most clearly understood. Therefore, the Lord God is to be praised, who has bestowed upon you such a gift of all-encompassing erudition and singular grace, and He is to be asked likewise to deign to preserve and further prosper it in you for the promotion of His glory for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>As for what news I might write, I have almost none; for regarding the peace made between the Pope and his adversaries, I know that this is well known to you. I myself indeed with the most Christian King in the manner of the pontiff, and as his predecessors acted, to whom he is very similar; for by his actions, the Christian King was cast into a great labyrinth of troubles and finally and completely deserted by him, not to say betrayed. But the King, having been struck, will be wiser in the future, and will not rashly move the plain anymore. I indeed deeply sympathize with all of France, which is now subject to so many devastations and misfortunes. May the Lord God have mercy on it and send His peace.</p>
      <p>While considering the calamity of France, which is now said to be oppressed, it indeed comes to mind what you have spoken to me as a most true prophet, and likewise, you predicted the outcome of the papal war in my presence, which is now clearly known to have happened. But I will let these things pass, since both of us feel no delight, but indeed much sorrow, when these things are recounted from the misfortunes of France.</p>
      <p>Our soldiers, who had gone to Rome with Duke Guise, are said to be returning, although there are those who think they will remain in Ferrara under the Duke's pay; for indeed it was feared, even when I was in Venice, that the whole burden of the war would be turned against the Duke of Ferrara, and that fear has not yet been put to rest. Therefore, it may happen that our soldiers will be detained in Ferrara.</p>
      <p>But leaving aside now foreign matters, let us turn to our own. I have understood, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, that you, with the greater part of your family and also with my son, are ill with that disease, which was like a universal passage, and for this I sympathized with you and yours, indeed with mine also (for what is yours is dear to me as if it were mine). But in the meantime, it was most pleasant to hear that you have all recovered, and for this, I congratulate you all and pray to God that He may keep you all safe forever. Conversely, I would like you to know that after my return from Venice, I, along with my entire family, was similarly afflicted with the same disease that you suffered from, and it detained us for some time and left us quite vexed and weary, but we have all been restored to our former health by the grace of God. May it indeed be perpetual and everlasting.</p>
      <p>I wish to see you and all the friends I have there, who are most singular, and I do not know indeed whether around the upcoming feast of St. Martin, when I will have gone to the Chur fairs, I can travel there; I will try, however, with all my might, and unless I am hindered by more pressing business, I will certainly come; for my spirit longs for it. In the meantime, if my son needs anything during the coming winter, which should be supplied by me, you will let me know, and I will not fail in any way. For if he needs clothing or anything else, it is ready to be sent; just indicate to me, my Lord Bullinger, what I should send, and also if money needs to be sent, inform me, and I will immediately fulfill what you wish. And indeed it is very pleasing to me that no expense is spared for what is necessary and appropriate for the liberal education of the boy. But let this be enough to have informed you; you, in other matters, as you are yourself like the best father to my son, will supply if the boy is in need of anything. My father-in-law greatly reproaches me for allowing the boy to give attention to the lute or lyre; for he fears that, delighted by this art of playing, he may neglect other studies. I, however, am entirely free from this concern; yet you will take care, with your singular kindness, that if any such impediment arises, it may be removed, lest I may justly be accused of rashness in this matter by my father-in-law. I would have written to you sooner and more often, but I have been in the Valtellina for 15 days and only arrived yesterday. Therefore, for my silence, you will have me excused.</p>
      <p>The last letters I wrote to you, I entrusted to a certain nobleman from Valtellina, named Johannes Baptista Schenardus, who said he was going to Basel for the sake of studies; I do not know, therefore, whether you have received them. I have nothing more to write to you now; only this remains, that I commend and offer myself and all mine to you alone, and I pray you to greet your most honorable wife and your entire family very much for me, and likewise, you will greet the most excellent Lords, your sons-in-law, and the reverend elders Lord Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr, and likewise Lord Walther and Frisius and all other friends and patrons, to all of whom I also commend myself greatly. I have written to my son, urging him especially to be diligent in his studies, pious towards God, and especially obedient to you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant him grace to conduct himself well towards all and to fulfill the duty of a good son. Farewell, most excellent and esteemed Lord Bullinger, and love me and all mine, as you are accustomed, in return. Given at Samaden, October 21, 1557.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis. To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my Lord and most esteemed patron. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
