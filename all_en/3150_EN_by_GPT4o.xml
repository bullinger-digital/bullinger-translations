      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Behold, the great envoy Heinius Speet returns to you, who has been with us for several weeks, sometimes digging and sometimes carrying soil and manure to the vineyards, whom I did not want to meet you without a letter of greeting. He is simple, as you know, to whom he has joined the piety of the soul, wishing, if he could, as he would, to accommodate all good brothers. He will also report to you about my affairs. The church, thanks to God, is still safe. The prince is expected with his pregnant wife, etc. Our warriors stand ready, some to serve the Emperor, others the French. An army is being conscripted against the Turks, and a huge sum of money is being extracted. Colmar contributes nine thousand florins to the war subsidies. The republics everywhere are indignant, fearing the king's deceit. Mr. Margbachius of Strasbourg has again gone to the Palatinate to reform the church in his own way. They say that Rabe is certainly using a linen garment among the people of Ulm and becoming more lenient. Rumors are growing about a conference, which should be followed by a national conference, namely at the Greek calends. I say with Hezekiah, "If it cannot become better, let there be truth and peace in my days," nevertheless always praying that the descendants may be preserved in truth by the usual mercy of God. Certainly, the unrepentant world rages and tumultuously rages everywhere, with charity growing cold and holy discipline perishing. I believe this is a sign of the coming of the Son of God. Farewell with these. Our people greet you, especially Nikolaus König. You, in turn, will greet yours by name, Gualther, Bibliander, and Johannes Fabritius. Pray to the Lord for me and for the church of God.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, April 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthias Erb, an old and widowed sexton.</p>
      <p>We are yours and you are ours. Would that it were forever.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zürich, to be respected as lord and brother, etc.</p>
