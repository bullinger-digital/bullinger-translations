    <p xml:id="regest1">In the afternoon, Haller received Bullinger's letter [No. 2564] from September 4th. He also thanks for the copies [of Bullinger's "Hope of the Believers"], the two crowns, and Bullinger's commentary on Luke, which [Hans] Welser was very pleased with. The latter will write to Bullinger as soon as the [messenger sent to Zurich] [...], to whom he [already] gave two guilders, has returned. The dedication [to the commentary on Luke] addressed to Welser will be translated into [German] by Haller (as desired by both Bullinger and Welser). It's good that Bullinger dedicated his commentary to Welser as planned! Many criticize him, but there is also much to criticize about his critics.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The animosities [among the people of Augsburg] are troubling Haller greatly, especially as he is trying to reconcile both sides.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- On September 1st, Haller received Bullinger's letter from August 24th [No. 2543] through [Johann] Vogler [the Elder]. He immediately entrusted his response [Letter No. 2560] to the Augsburg messenger [...]. In Augsburg, they are now awaiting the decision from Zurich regarding the request [for a pastor]. [Wolfgang] Musculus, [Johann Heinrich] Held [von Tiefenau], and Haller were appointed by the parish convention to establish churches in the Augsburg area, but only Musculus and Held received the council's permission to do so; a decision that Haller welcomes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Haller has reported extensively about [Hans Wilpert] Zoller in a letter. He is doing well and is appreciated by everyone. What he will do after the war is still uncertain. He is in love with a daughter [...] of the city clerk [Georg Frölich]. However, for significant reasons, Haller cannot advise this connection. Bullinger should keep this to himself. According to his wish, Haller will encourage Zoller to write a letter to [...]. However, Zoller is currently unlikely to find time to write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The [Schmalkaldic main] army is moving daily. From Ingolstadt, it has reached Donauwörth. The reason is unknown. There is said to be a secret plan. They were unable to reach the well-fortified Emperor [Charles V.].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- On [September 6th], two companies of Appenzellers returned the large cannons to [Augsburg]. The two units were then sent further to the Klause [Ehrenberg]. Today, the other six Swiss companies are staying overnight in Augsburg (some [mercenaries of these companies] are currently guests at Haller's). These units have been tasked with monitoring the pass at the Klause. After the Tyroleans destroyed the castle at the Klause, a new war is likely to break out there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren, is moving [southward]. Haller is not too worried about this, as God makes everything work for the good of those who love Him [Romans 8:28].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- On September 4th, Bullinger's cousin M[ichael] Hedinger arrived in Augsburg together with the brother [...] of Georg Binder. The city clerk, Nikolaus [Müller, known as] Maier, Welser, and Haller have made great efforts to secure a position [as a soldier] in Augsburg for the two. [Swiss mercenaries] arrive in Augsburg daily. Haller helps them find employment as much as possible, but not all can be accepted! Haller has nothing to report about [Wolfgang], the son of the [Zurich] mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, except that according to Vogler, he has moved away.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Haller has not seen the students listed by Bullinger, nor Fridolin Hospinian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The people of Nuremberg are now behaving well. They sent money [to the Schmalkaldic League] and expelled an imperial delegation from the city that had requested passage for Buren's Dutch troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The pastor of Kahla (Saxony), Thomas Naogeorg, a learned and modest man, recently came to Augsburg, where he will presumably soon be employed as a pastor. He holds the [Zwinglianism] in high regard. He likes Bullinger's booklet "De sacramentis." The number of followers of the [Zwinglian] faith is increasing. Naogeorg openly states that Luther claims a physical presence [of the Lord] in the Eucharist, even though the cat [Bucer] and the mouse [Musculus] (two creatures he does not like at all) try to excuse Luther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Unfortunately, Haller cannot send Bullinger a copy of the [imperial] ban letter, as it has not yet been published. He has also never seen it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- However, he sends the admonition letter with which the princes [Johann Friedrich I of Saxony and Philip of Hesse] warn of a poisoning danger emanating from the Roman dragon [Pope Paul III]. This Roman beast truly does not relent in its zeal! In Augsburg, several soldiers have already died after drinking water.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- If only the hesitation of the [Schmalkaldic League] would prove to be sensible! Meanwhile, there is distrust of the overly fearful Elector of Saxony, and it is believed that he would have been better off staying at home. On September 5th, there was said to have been a skirmish. Today, refugees from Neuburg [on the Danube] arrived and reported the plundering of the suburb by the "Welschen." However, they were driven away by the guard [of the Schmalkaldic League] left there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Bullinger should forgive Haller's unkempt writing: It is already 11 o'clock at night! Haller has sent the guests to bed. Tomorrow, he must preach very early in place of Held. The latter left today together with Musculus. Greetings to the family, to the colleagues, to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], and to Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli].</p>

      <p>Greetings through the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Your letter dated September 4th was delivered to me on the 9th of the same month, today around the second hour in the afternoon, along with the books and 2 crowns. I thank you for taking care of my matters, and for sending the copy of the commentary on Luke. We presented the book to Welser, who received it with great joy. He will write to you once the messenger has returned. He gave the messenger two guilders. As you requested, I will translate the preface into the common language in the coming days. Welser also asked me to do this. In my opinion, you did well to dedicate it to him, as it was promised to him long ago. He is well-disposed towards us. Many criticize him, but I find more to criticize in his critics than in him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will write to you about the wonders sometime. I am almost overwhelmed by the animosities among those who are at odds with each other, whom I trust and wish well. If only you knew the true state of all affairs! By keeping silent, interceding, and praying, I live with them in such a way that I do not offend either side, yet I strive to reconcile both. However, since I do not have time to write more now, I will respond briefly to your matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On September 1st, I received your letter dated August 24th from Vogler, to which I immediately responded in the following days through the Augsburg messenger, which I believe you have already received. We are awaiting your response to our request. We anticipated what you suggested in your recent letters, namely, to write to the senate that the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few, etc. Musculus, Held, and I were appointed by the brotherhood to go to restore the churches in the Augsburg area. However, the council did not approve of me going, which I find a very agreeable decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I wrote extensively about Zoller in my recent letters. He is alive, well, and very dear to both his and our people. I do not yet know how he will live after the war. The city clerk's daughter loves him, but I cannot advise him to marry her for significant reasons. I would not want this to be made public. Keep it to yourself. I will encourage him to write as you instructed, although I know for certain that he does not have much leisure to write.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The army is moving daily. They have withdrawn to Ingolstadt. Today, the main force is at Donauwörth. They have retreated again because the Emperor is well-fortified, and they could not reach him with artillery or otherwise. I do not know what is planned. There is a secret plan in place.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Next Monday, two companies of Appenzellers, the main leaders, will return the artillery home, which consisted of large pieces; then they will be sent to the Klause. Tonight, the other six Swiss companies are staying here in Augsburg. I have many guests. I write amidst the turmoil. They must also go to the Klause because the Tyroleans have destroyed the castle at the Klause, where our people had a garrison; however, the passage through the Klause is still open. A new war is starting there. The Bündner could do well now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Count of Buren is moving southward. Everyone wonders what will come of it. May God turn it for the best! I care little about it. As for my person, I know that all things work together for good to those who love God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>On September 4th, your cousin M. Hedinger arrived, along with the brother of Georg Binder. The city clerk, N. Maier, Welser, and I worked hard to have them accepted in our city. I do not yet know the amount of their stipend. Countless people arrive daily, whom I promote as much as I can. But because we have so many resources and the expenses are excessive, it is not easy to accept anyone else. I have neither seen nor heard anything about the son of the mayor Lavater, except that Vogler told me he has left.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I have not seen any of the students you mentioned, not even Fridolin Hospinian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The people of Nuremberg are now behaving well. They sent money to our people. They expelled the Emperor's delegation from the city, which requested passage for the Belgian army.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Recently, Thomas Naogeorgus, the pastor in Kahla, Saxony, a learned and modest man, came to us, having been called several times by our senate. I believe he will soon be our colleague. He thinks highly of our religion. He read your booklet on the sacraments, which he greatly appreciates. Praise be to God, our number increases daily. He openly says that Luther established a carnal presence, no matter how Felinus and Musculus, different and most hostile creatures, defend and excuse him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>You wish to have the letters called the "echtbrieff," but they have not been published. They are kept as secret as possible. I have not been able to read them yet.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I send the caution of the princes about the poisons released by the Roman dragon, so that it never ceases to perform its duty. You see in what great dangers we are. Already, several soldiers have died in our city from drinking water. But we will walk freely over asps and basilisks, for He has commanded His angels concerning us, etc., for the Lord is our refuge, fortress, rock, and tower of strength.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Our people, whether wisely or unwisely, are certainly acting slowly. If only they would restore the situation to us by delaying! The Elector of Saxony is suspected by our people. Everyone wishes he had stayed at home. He does not want to bite. He fears for his stomach. Others say different things. On September 5th, they say there was a skirmish. Today, refugees from Neuburg arrived, saying the "Welschen" plundered the suburb, but they were driven away by the guard left there. In summary: The fortune of war is uncertain. The Lord will finally say: "Here I am, your salvation!" We tirelessly beseech Him to do so; we do not doubt that you will do the same for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Farewell and forgive my less diligent writing. I barely have time. I am writing now at the 11th hour of the night, after sending my guests to bed, and tomorrow morning I must preach in place of Held, who left today with Musculus. I will write more soon. Farewell again. Greet the family, the brothers, the consuls, and other good friends, especially my father-in-law. September 9th, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
