      <p>S. D. I have received all your letters, dear brother, including your latest ones through our MÃ¼ller, who is heading to the assembly in Baden. I am amazed at how you manage to endure so many labors. You preach frequently, are often disturbed by those who come to converse or consult with you, and furthermore, you write extensive reports and letters. Since you wish to serve us with these, we rightfully express our gratitude to you.</p>
      <p>I gladly received the truly generous and splendid gift sent by the magnificent council of the Rhaetians to my Josias. I congratulate him also for the fact that in the letters sent to him, they have expressed their goodwill most abundantly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay them, bless them, and keep them from evil! Our Josias also owes you a great deal, as you have worked hard to accomplish this; he himself will undoubtedly thank you, etc. How I wish your disturbances were truly pacified and settled! Let us pray to the Lord to repair what has been diminished by human negligence or fault. In the Netherlands, a severe war has erupted. You know how for years Duke Alba with his Spaniards has driven great tyranny in the Netherlands, exiling many nobles and honorable people, torturing and murdering countless. The exiled have banded together; many cities, weary of the tyranny, are defecting from the Spaniards, driving them out, killing them, and taking in the exiled, who are called the Geuzen, similar to the Huguenots in France, and now hold many strong cities. Alba with his Spaniards tries what he can, and there is bloodshed on both sides, and God has so far given grace to the poor Geuzen. Alba has recruited from the emperor, to order cavalry and infantry in Germany. This is allowed, and he has appointed as commanders the Count of Eberstein, Frundsberg, and Bollweiler; some also mention the one from Ems. They have accepted soldiers to lead to the Spaniards, and Alba cries for quick help, as many in German lands are dissatisfied that Germans are siding with the shameful, tyrannical Spaniards and want to help foreign people and Spaniards, who have never been well-disposed or loyal to any Germans, to oppress pious Germans, and therefore the German princes should not let them pass, and many soldiers have already been shot over this, and it is said that the princes are arming themselves in opposition. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the Geuzen have taken the fortified cities in Zeeland and Holland. They had also taken Valenciennes, but lost it again, and the Spaniards cruelly slaughtered everyone inside. In Bergen or Mons in Hainaut, some Spaniards also entered in peasant clothes through treachery; but they were all slaughtered and the cavalry that came for the city were driven away. Near Flushing, they had a naval battle with each other, and 20 Spanish ships were destroyed and captured. Alba wanted to send his treasure and jewels to Spain, worth several tons of gold; but the ships were intercepted, captured, and taken to England. In these matters, a declaration of the Prince of Orange and his brother, Count Louis of Nassau, and other lords has been printed in Paris, France, in which they explain their reasons for taking up arms against the tyranny of the Spaniards, and initially 8,000 Gascon arquebusiers have joined the Geuzen. Therefore, Alba and the King of Spain have recruited the king to recall his own and forbid them from siding against Alba. The king is said to have done this, but so weakly that it is believed he does not regret it. It is also said that 20,000 have been shipped from La Rochelle and around there and are moving towards the Prince of Orange. Some ships are also said to have come to them from Friesland and the sea cities. It is also written that English ships have come and taken Gravelines and Dunkirk, although this is still in doubt.</p>
      <p>It is certain, however, that England is helping with money and has allied with France; for the admiral from England is with the king, Montmorency with the queen, etc., and the matter seems very serious.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if God does not help the Geuzen, they will hardly be able to endure; but when the bloody measure of the Spaniards is full and the iniquity of the Amorites is complete, a poor people may break great power. God is to be prayed to day and night for His grace; for the arrogance and defiance of the adversaries have never been greater, etc. I write these news to you as I have them from Nuremberg, Augsburg, Paris, and from the country.</p>
      <p>Share with our consuls and friends, Charles, etc., fellow ministers, brothers, whom you will greet.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste on July 4, 1572. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Navarre has died in Paris, etc. To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at Chur at St. Martin, my kind lord and dear brother. Chur.</p>
