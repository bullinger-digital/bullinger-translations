    <p xml:id="regest1">Referring to Vadian's letter [No. 2352], Bullinger can promise that he will take on the publication of the [“Swiss Chronicle”] as best as he can. - Bullinger knows that the Antichrist would reward the [Zurichers] if they even slightly glossed over the power and corrupt lifestyle of the monks. May God protect the [Zurichers] from this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Regarding the [book censors], Bullinger can say nothing other than what he has already reported [not received]; however, he will make an effort not to be negligent in this regard. He must constantly fight!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- He just received a letter from [Johannes] Gast in Basel [No. 2348]. In it, he writes that the Schmalkaldic League has been extended by 20 years, and that among others, [Elector Frederick II] of the Palatinate, Count [Philip the Elder III] of Nassau-[Weilburg-Saarbrücken], and Count [William IV] of Henneberg-[Schleusingen] have been admitted to the league.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Emperor [Charles V] is said to be upset with Germany because so many people have fallen away [from Catholicism]. Some believe he will attack; others do not believe this and think he will go to Spain to oppose the white Moors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The priests and monks are leaving the Palatinate and going to the territories of [King] Ferdinand [I], where they are welcome because there has been a lack of such there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- In Saxony, a sect is said to have arisen that advocates circumcision and the Sabbath. Luther will apparently write against this and will likely associate the [Swiss] churches with the Jews!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger hears nothing about the [Second Religious Conversation] in Regensburg; it will probably remain unsuccessful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Greetings from [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Theodor] Bibliander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [Enclosure:] Summary of a letter from Mayor [Adelberg Meyer zum Pfeil] and the council of the city of Basel to Mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] and the council of the city of Zurich dated January 30, 1546, which was delivered on February 3. Frederick [II] of the Palatinate has ordered that the Gospel be preached in his land and the Mass abolished. The Lord's Supper was introduced in the German language and celebrated on Sunday, January 10, in the Church of St. Peter in Heidelberg. Frederick [II] is also expected to meet with [Landgrave Philip] of Hesse in Marburg soon. It is suspected that the Schmalkaldic League will admit the Count Palatine and [Hermann von Wied, Archbishop] of Cologne. This is probably God's providence, who lets his word spread amidst the persecutions instigated by [Charles V] and [Ferdinand I]!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have nothing, most esteemed man, to respond to your letter, except to promise all our diligence, effort, and faith in publishing those books, as much as my modest abilities will allow. I know, I know, my most esteemed Vadian, that we would be adorning the Antichrist if we were to continue even slightly to gloss over the power and most pernicious lifestyle of the monks. God forbid, God forbid.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2">
      <p>Would that it were in our power to decide on monasticism and to execute what had been decreed! But the victory belongs to the Lord.</p>

      <p>Today I received news from Basel from Gast, and as I have it, I share it with you: The Schmalkaldic League is to be extended for 20 years. Among others, the Elector Palatine, as you know, the Count of Nassau, and the Count of Henneberg, as well as others, are to be newly admitted.</p>

      <p>The rumor is that the Emperor is very impatient with Germany, which is so vehemently falling away, and is very displeased. Some believe he will initiate something; others believe he will not initiate anything, but will go to Spain, bring much money there, and wage war against the white Moors.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The priests and monks are leaving the Palatinate with impatience and fleeing to Ferdinand. There they are said to be welcome, as there has been a lack of such nonsense for a while.</p>

      <p>In Saxony, a sect is said to have arisen that brings back Judaism: circumcision, the Sabbath, and other things. Luther is supposed to write against this. Some think he will also associate our churches with the Jews and attack them, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We hear nothing from Regensburg; it is thought that nothing will come of it.</p>

      <p>Summary of the letter:</p>
      <p>"We are truly informed that Elector Palatine Frederick, in the Palatinate, is appointing preachers everywhere to preach the holy Gospel clearly and plainly, to administer the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ in a Christian manner, and to allow the preachers to marry. Also, on Sunday, January 10, in the parish of St. Peter in Heidelberg and throughout the Palatinate, the papal mass was abolished and the Lord's Supper was introduced in German and used. Also, the two princes of the Palatinate and Hesse are expected to come together in Frankfurt soon, where we suspect that the Elector Palatine, as well as Cologne, will be admitted into the Christian union, etc., thereby undoubtedly breaking many evil practices, and it is a wonderful work of God, who spreads his word amidst the persecution of the Emperor and King."</p>
      <p>Dated January 30.</p>
      <p>Mayor and council of the city of Basel, to the mayor and council of the city of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Delivered in Zurich at the town hall, Wednesday after the purification at 9 o'clock."</p>
      <p>To his esteemed, honorable lords, the mayors of Watt in St. Gallen.</p>
