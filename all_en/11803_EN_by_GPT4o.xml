      <p>Greetings, my most delightful and thrice venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It seemed appropriate to send these things to you through this young man from Zurich, however unpleasant they may be. I deeply lament the common fate of Christians, who snore with such security amidst such great dangers in all things and sleep on both ears, or, if you prefer, with such confidence some attack others' hair, as if nothing at all were threatening from the common enemy of Christian piety, present and indeed most atrocious evils. But thus, rather than hope or despair, it is soon expected that we will be devoured in a pitiable manner at once, having been long since torn apart bit by bit by that adversary.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must urge a timely repentance towards God all the more, if perhaps there are, as there always certainly were, some whom the Lord will rescue by His kindness. Pray for us, my venerable brother, that I may never fail in my duty, but may always bring fruit to my Lord and that my fruit may remain. May He also keep you flourishing for the glory of His name and safe in all respects for as long as possible!</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household along with your best friends and brothers. Farewell. June 27, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his more than brother, Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
