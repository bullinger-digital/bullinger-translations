    <p xml:id="regest1">Has learned by letter that the concord is being hindered, and inquires whether the Zurichers are meant; only knows that they have not satisfied the people of Strasbourg. The [clergyman] who has been imprisoned in Meersburg for five years has renounced his wife under the influence of his relatives and sworn to the Mass. Joachim [Maler] will report on the situation in Konstanz.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>A certain good man writes to me again and again that the concord is being disturbed; who is to blame or the cause of this dangerous difficulty, only God knows. However, since nothing has been heard about this matter for a long time with us, I wonder if perhaps he wanted to refer to you Zurichers. This one thing I know, that the people of Strasbourg are not satisfied by you.</p>
      <p>Then the prisoner, who was in prison in Meersburg for five years, has been released, but under the most impious conditions, to which he consented, overcome by the flattery of his relatives and kin. For he renounced his wife and was absolved from her in the papal manner, and then swore to the Mass, with sponsors given, who would pay two hundred gold coins if he did not adhere to the sentence. How terrible it is, my Bullinger, to bear the cross so bravely for such a long time (for he could have been freed in the first month) and finally to be miserably and very dangerously cast down with good words!</p>
      <p>As for how things stand with us, you can inquire from our Joachim through a living letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household and all good things. September 28, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
