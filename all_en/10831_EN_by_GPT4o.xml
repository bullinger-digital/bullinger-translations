    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should inquire with Dean Lorenz [Meyer] about the dispute of Peter [Schnyder], as those from Fulach are acting unfairly; Ritter and Sebastian [Gr√ºbel] have passed on some information to the marriage deceivers, yet [Schnyder] fears he will not be admitted. Regrets the theological quarrels, which confuse the people, and distrusts Bucer's new proposal for concord; if Luther were interested in an agreement, he would accept the [First Helvetic] Confession. Benedikt [Burgauer] once again publicly represented Lutheran positions regarding baptism and communion; he wants nothing more to do with this man - who preaches like a traditional believer but considers himself evangelical.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although honest and upright people do not need any recommendation with you, nevertheless, because the matter being dealt with Peter in Laufen (with remarkable deceit and hatred) is very clear to me, it seemed right to me to encourage you to inquire about this from Lorenz, the Dean of Stammheim, and the other chapter brothers, since I do not doubt that those from Flurlingen will pretend utmost justice for an unjust cause. If any mention of me and Sebastian arises, know that we have done nothing other than persuade the elders of the advice you communicated to Peter; for he himself feared that they would not accept it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dearest brother, you cannot believe how anxiously the iniquity of the times disturbs me, in which the light is sought to be obscured by fog, not indeed among the learned, but among the simple, who are ignorant of figures of speech, for whom it has been fought so strenuously by our dearest teachers to be understood plainly and clearly. I truly fear that poison lies hidden under honeyed words, with which concord is sought; for you yourself know the first confession we wrote to Bucer, because it was plain and clear, was not accepted, and what does it mean that another obscure one is foisted upon us instead of the Basel Confession? Indeed, if Luther is so eager for concord, why would he not accept ours? Add also that it is so diligently prevented from being made public.</p>
      <p>Day by day I experience what it brings to have dealings not with Luther, who is in Wittenberg, but with the one who resides in Schaffhausen; for Benedikt recently preached publicly that the internal cannot exist without the external, nor the external without the internal, but they are bound together with an iron chain, so that one cannot exist without the other. Then when he utters these words "I baptize" etc., now the water is no longer water, but the regeneration itself; the baptism of John and Christ is not the same; for the baptism of John was pure water only, ours etc. Just as the soul and body in a man, so bread and wine, body and blood are united together, and he says there is no need for any interpretation, but simply to believe the words. I truly do not know what I should do; for to allow the church to be ensnared again by those figurative expressions, I do not think it is my duty, and to throw myself again into contention, even less. Therefore, to remain with this man any longer is not my intention; for besides all this, he indeed preaches repentance, but through the law, not through Christ, as is the custom of all papists; yet he is sold and regarded as a minister of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me commended in your prayers, I pray.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, 1536.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, church leader of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
