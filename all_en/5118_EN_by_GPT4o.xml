      <p>Grace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, and I wish you, my revered father in the Lord, and all yours a happy new year from the bottom of my heart. Next, you should know that I received your letter with the silver gift, for which I thank you very much. I carefully keep the gifts you sent me, and I want to preserve them in memory of your paternal benevolence throughout my life. Thirdly, I will also ensure that, according to your admonition, I fear God and obey my father and mother and study diligently. May God grant me His grace.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you and ask that you pray to God for me; I will also diligently pray for you. Farewell, dearest father in Christ.</p>
      <p>My parents and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, 1562.</p>
      <p>Johann Heinrich Musculus, your obedient son in Christ. To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest and always revered father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
