      <p>Greetings. Things are well, since you clearly admit that in disapproving of Coelius's book, I did not use those words, which indeed I had not used: impious, heretic. What you then infer, that it is nonetheless heretical and impious, I consider to be of no concern to me. For I disapproved of the publication of that book for other reasons, and I never observed, as you suggest, that people could be saved without Christ; otherwise, I would not have remained silent.</p>
      <p>I hear finally that he has expanded the book and changed many things in it after it was read by me, and now he does not want to appear to have ever thought that way. However, I am not at all worried if he has included my letters in his apology, which I hope are written by me in such a way that they cannot be attacked by the pious. But if some have attacked them, and I think a place has been left for me to clear myself, there is no one in the world who can convict me of the same crime. If anyone tries, their impudence and madness will be evident to all. You know the saying of the common people: "He who speaks what he wants will hear what he does not want." But tell me, my dear Vergerio, do you think that the church of God can be built up by such disputes, especially if not only you and Coelius are now engaged, but I and many others are unwillingly dragged into the same dispute, when otherwise there are more than enough disputes among the evangelicals.</p>
      <p>You seem to rely entirely on the authority of princes, whom I, as I highly revere, especially the pious ones, never forget that saying pronounced by an uncommon prince: "Do not put your trust in princes and in the sons of men, etc."</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 22nd of July, 1557.</p>
