      <p>S. How much joy I have felt from your letters, most illustrious man, I can hardly express, for the further I am from you, the revered fathers and brothers in Christ, the more even the smallest memory of you is most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>Moreover, your letter, with its utmost gravity and piety, what could have happened to me more desirable? For as soon as it reached my hands, I seized it before others and read it with the greatest eagerness, not forgetting to give immense thanks to God, the best and greatest, who has deemed me worthy to be adorned with such a friend.</p>
      <p>But I have and give you great thanks for having retained the memory of me thus far. Would that something could finally come to my mind by which I might be able to repay such a benefit to you with dignity.</p>
      <p>What you wrote briefly yet learnedly and wisely in your letters about the venerable mystery of the Trinity is most pleasing, and I will share it with Threcius and the other brothers, who, with me, honor and revere you with equal respect. There are many new things from our parts that I could write, which contain almost nothing good, for everything is now full of evils. The world now seems to be in turmoil and upheaval, so that it may finally fall with a heavier collapse, as he says.</p>
      <p>The church among us is greatly disturbed by these new doctrines, so much so that it seems impossible to extinguish this poison by human means, but what is impossible with men is possible with God, who will eventually restrain the enemies of His church. Here we expect a heavier cross from the Lord every day, for the peace we have lived in so far is due to the Lord's mercy, but now with so many dangers looming, what else shall we do? We will surely wait with uplifted heads for the coming Lord, and in the meantime, we will not be moved by God's help, even if the earth is shaken and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.</p>
      <p>We are constantly waging a bloody war with the most atrocious enemy, the Muscovite, and now a general expedition of the entire kingdom is feared to be imminent with hired soldiers.</p>
      <p>And to say it in one word, we see nothing good being done in this world anymore, certainly nothing is heard now except heresies, dissensions, enmities, wars, slaughters, etc.</p>
      <p>In these storms, however, which is our only consolation, Christ Himself protects and guards His bride from all evils. We pray that you help us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>You will convey my many greetings to all your revered colleagues, brothers in Christ, and also to your wife, the most pious matron, and all your children.</p>
      <p>I also earnestly beg you to have my brother commended to you. Farewell, most illustrious man, and if you ever send letters to Geneva, greet Mr. Calvin and Beza for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given at Ostror처g on May 18, 1564.</p>
      <p>I ask you to forgive the roughness of the letters, which I did not even have time to correct.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted friend, Wenzeslaus of Ostror처g, by his own hand. To the reverend man endowed with piety and singular learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Z체rich, lord and father in Christ, to be honored with utmost faith and respect.</p>
      <p>Z체rich.</p>
