    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot report anything certain about the Swiss troops in French service; the siege of Perpignan was abandoned, although a sortie by the besieged failed; the mercenaries belonging to the later withdrawal are being led there, while those who went to Piedmont under Wilhelm Frölich and [Jakob] Fuchsberger are already largely returning, as the French-occupied cities are not seriously threatened by the Governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos]. Soldiers are also returning from the area beyond the Moselle, as they were poorly treated and because [King Francis I] could not hold the conquests in Luxembourg; the imperial cities are said to have promised the returnees immunity. The French [King], who conspires with the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I], also threatens Burgundy, but fears [the Swiss]; at a favorable opportunity, he will not hesitate to break the peace agreement [with the Free County]. Greetings. [Peter] Kunz read Rümlang his letter to Bullinger [No. 1681]; Bullinger should urge Kunz and Treasurer [Sulpitius Haller] to advance the school in Königsfelden according to the council's decision. Further greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I have diligently inquired about the Swiss troops serving at the court of the King of France, most learned Bullinger, I have not been able to discover anything certain. We here have been held in great expectation of the truth for some time, but after diligent investigation, we have learned the following: those who are serving in Narbonne, France, attacked Perpignan but abandoned the siege without success because it is well fortified with artillery, and it fired back every time it was struck. Then, when those in the city gained hope and courage to drive away the enemy, they made a sortie but were defeated, losing 800 men and two banners, although not without significant losses on our side as well. The Emperor recognizes Perpignan as being located at the Pyrenees. Not far away is a city called Cortisona, which acknowledged the French and still does, as it is under French control, marking the border between the two rulers. We still do not know whether the soldiers who are on the latest expedition have reached them; for they are being led there. But those who were on the first expedition and were stationed in Piedmont cities as a garrison and were distributed through those cities, namely those led by Wilhelm Frölich and Fuchsberger, are now returning home, with only a few retained in the name of the garrison. They were not endangered, only tasked with defending the royal cities, which they accomplished, because the Marquis of Guasto, the Governor of Milan, was also defending other cities among the Piedmontese that recognize the Emperor, but not with so many soldiers that he dared to invade and attack ours, although he attempted some things through tricks, nothing was accomplished in open warfare.</p>
      <p>Those who served in the border of Belgian Gaul across the Moselle are returning home because they were poorly treated by the Swabian commanders and captains, and Luxembourg and all other places that the French had occupied were lost again; for they recognize the Emperor again and the French have freed themselves from the yoke. The French army there is greatly diminished, as it is said that the imperial cities have allowed their return home and have pardoned any offense if they wish to return now.</p>
      <p>The French King acts impiously, who adds sorrow to the pious in this Turkish madness; he seems to have hardened his face, as he has also conspired with the Turk. He covets Burgundy, and if he did not fear us, he would have invaded it long ago. A truce has been made between the commanders, namely the royal and the Burgundians; but no one should trust too much in a false peace, because if the French King were given the opportunity, he would pursue his affairs in his usual manner, always having a pretext for his violence, with which he could deceive himself.</p>
      <p>This hastily, I could not write more. Take it in good part and keep me commended to you. I ask you to diligently greet Erasmus, Pellicanus, Theodor, Megander, and all your devoted ones.</p>
      <p>Kunz writes to you, who also read his letter to me before he sealed it; you judge how they please you. I particularly request from you to write diligently to Kunz and the Treasurer to advance and establish the college in Königsfelden - may it be called Basilipedium or Basilidapedium - as it has been decreed by the council.</p>
      <p>Farewell. You will greet Lavater very much. I wish prosperity and Christ's peace to all yours.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the 19th day of October in the year 1542. Entirely yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and faithful churchman of Zurich, his most integral patron and to be respected friend in the Lord.</p>
