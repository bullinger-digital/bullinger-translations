    <p xml:id="regest1">Wäber praises God and wants to keep Bullinger updated, as [Andreas] Rappenstein has already done in his [unreceived] letter. Given that the [Bucerian-Lutheran] opposing party has unsuccessfully obstructed the appointment [of Jodocus Kilchmeyer to Bern] for six weeks, everyone must recognize that the appointment of Kilchmeyer, despite everything, is God's work! Now it is important to convince the Zurich authorities and Kilchmeyer of this. The latter should proceed to Bern without delay. The [love for] truth and the sincere disposition of the authorities and the subjects are reason enough for this. It should be clear to everyone that one must deal with the teachings [of Christ] clearly and without ulterior motives. Kilchmeyer should not let the cunning opponents extract any [details] from him until everything is settled. He will be informed about further developments.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Beat [Gering] and [Simon] Sulzer mislead their followers by portraying their opponents as troublemakers and claiming that they do not want to teach anything new and only seek peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Therefore, Wäber considers the following advisable (Bullinger may forgive the well-intentioned advice). If the Bernese authorities emphasize to Kilchmeyer that they want to get rid of the ten-year-long dispute in the church, he should respond with the arguments discussed below, so that Gering and Sulzer cannot oppose and label him as a troublemaker.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- 1. Different interpretations of the scripture have always brought discord and errors into the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- 2. Therefore, the apostolic church established the creed [confession of faith]. On this basis, divergent doctrines were subsequently rejected at the synods [councils].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- 3. The Bernese authorities also had to make a similar experience, and they managed to reject disputes and heresies as best as they could. For after Bern, with a printed mandate [from June 1523], caused everyone to preach as they could justify from the Old and New Testament, the disagreements in the city and countryside became even more numerous because no one used the correct standard in interpreting the scripture.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- 4. To establish unity, the Bernese authorities organized a disputation [January 1528] and had the conclusions [the ten theses established in November 1527] reviewed based on the Holy Scripture, as the apostolic church and later the synods once did. It was found that the 12 articles of faith [of the Apostolic Creed] had been distorted over time. During [the debate] on the first and second conclusions, it became clear that the Pope had falsified the 9th article dedicated to the holy Christian church [by adding the word "catholicam"].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- 5. During [the debate] on the fourth conclusion, it was similarly found that the Pope had inserted a side article ["Descendit ad inferna"] into the 12 articles, which even Luther helped to uphold. Even today, there is no agreement with the [opponents] on justification and the office of the church, while they believe that one must simply believe [their doctrine in this regard] and not question or criticize it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- 6. In the announcement of the disputation [of November] 1527, the authorities committed themselves and their descendants to avoid error and disputes in the future and to adhere to what would be determined based on the H[oly] Scripture.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- 7. After the disputation, a reformation [mandate] was issued [in February] 1528, which had to be confirmed by oath by everyone, as was done in the time [of the kings] Hezekiah and Josiah.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- 8. When deliberating on the [Wittenberg] Concord regarding an agreement with Luther, it was decided at the two Bernese synods of [October] 1536 and [September] 1537 that teaching should continue as before. This was enforced by the council and the mayors. The preachers also had to commit to this by oath.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- 9. In the following conflicts of the years 1542 and 1544, the Bernese councils sent legally binding notices to both parties, indeed to all [Bernese] deans and chapters, urging everyone to continue adhering to the [Bernese] disputation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- 10. Kilchmeyer should ultimately emphasize that he will be peaceful with those who adhere to the truth and interpretation of the Holy Scripture recognized by Bern and do not attempt to equip the pastors with a cunning power or introduce side articles [into the doctrine]. However, if someone violates the recognized doctrine or practice, he will combat them based on the Holy Scripture, whether they are preachers, schoolteachers, members of the authorities, or subjects.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- With such an argumentation, we would maintain the upper hand in the church. Furthermore, the [opponents] (and not we, whose teachings they despise) must prove that [since 1528] the teachings have not been truthful if they want to convince everyone of their [changes].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [Gering and Sulzer] have nominated a monk from Interlaken [Christian Danmatter] for election, who is supposedly learned and capable. Yet he is dumber than Wäber himself! For when he obtained the position of assistant in Bern through Peter Kunz's mediation, he was transferred back to a village [Belp] within about a year due to incompetence. To make him appealing to the Bernese authorities, the two preachers assure that they are doing nothing against the Reformation. Yet today, Sulzer preached without any explanation on John 8, [33], Jeremiah 9, [23f], and Galatians 6, [14], making statements that only confuse the congregation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- In summary, [the opponents] pretend to adhere to the Reformation to blind the authorities. Therefore, one must resist them with all steadfastness!</p>

      <p>S. Dear Master Heinrich, for the sake of brevity, it remains to praise God and to exhort you in every way, as Rappenstein has written. The appointment of Kilchmeyer must be recognized by everyone as God's work, as it has been handled with remarkable zeal and speed by the opposing party over these six weeks. Therefore, with your esteemed advice, help against Mr. Josen and everywhere, so that such an appointment is not hindered (otherwise it would be a cause of ruin for the church in Bern), so that Mr. Jos also promptly proceeds here. He will find enough comfort: the truth in itself, a simple and upright people in the authorities and among the subjects. But let there be clear and bright simplicity with the teaching and not contentious. He should also beware of sweet, smooth words, with which one might want to entrap him, so that he does not reveal anything until he has fully understood everything. For one is quick, as we will inform you further about what happens, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for the two, Beat and Sulzer, their followers are only misled by the simplicity of the listeners, whom they constantly persuade, yet they teach nothing new and desire nothing but the peace of the church in Bern, accusing those who do not follow them of being restless and unpeaceful, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, I think the following report would be helpful for Mr. Jos (I ask you to forget the proverb "sus Minervam" this time; I do it out of good zeal). If he alone or with others from our gracious lords is approached, they would want to be rid of the long-standing dispute and discord of preaching, which has lasted for ten years, in their city and land, etc., so that the two cannot claim possession, as if anyone who does not preach like them should be considered contentious and discordant, indeed so that Mr. Jos can maintain his position and respond, namely:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>1. Different understandings of the scripture have always brought discord and various errors into the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>2. Therefore, the first apostolic church established the creed and subsequently, in the synods (councils), always rejected disputes and false teachings according to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>3. Our gracious lords in Bern have also experienced this and have rejected both disputes and errors to the best of their ability. For after the printed and first issued mandate, that everyone should preach what they believed to uphold with the new and old testament, the dispute became greater in the city and land than before. The reason being that everyone understood and interpreted the scripture as they pleased, not according to the correct standard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>4. Therefore, to plant unity, our gracious lords have, with great danger of the setup and cost, organized and held a disputation, and also, according to the manner of the first apostolic church and subsequent synods, had the conclusions reviewed with the holy scripture. In which place the common rule of Christians, the 12 articles of our faith, have been violated, it was thus found in the first and second conclusion that the pope had falsified the 9th article of the holy Christian church and extracted his authority from it with the violent (violation) of the holy scripture.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>5. It was also found in the 4th conclusion that the pope had added a side article to the 12, which Luther also wanted to help defend, etc. For in these two points our dispute still stands, that they believe, regarding justification and the ministry of the church, one should simply believe the words, not ask further, allow no twisted speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>6. Therefore, in the announcement of the disputation, an authority was bound together for children and children's children, to avoid all future error and dispute, to remain by what was thus found with the holy scripture, anno 27.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>7. After the disputation, a reformation was established, which was confirmed by oath in the city and land, as once Hezekiah and Josiah, anno 28.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>8. In the continuation of the concord with Luther in both synods of the 36th and 37th year, it was clearly maintained in our churches to teach nothing else than as before, and this was confirmed by the council and citizens at that time. It was also confirmed by the oath of the preachers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>9. In the subsequent disputes of the 42nd and 44th year, our gracious lords, council and citizens, have twice issued sealed acknowledgments, presented to both parties, also sent to all deans and chapters, to remain unwavering by the praiseworthy disputation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>10. Whoever now (says Mr. Jos) wants to maintain peace, calm, and unity, by maintaining the truth and interpretation of the holy scripture, no excessive power of the spiritual nor side articles of faith wants to introduce, all as it is found with the holy scripture and accepted and still maintained by a Christian community in Bern, with the same I also want to maintain a lasting peace, calm, and unity, not to cause dispute or discord anywhere. But if anyone understands to act against it with teaching or doing, preacher, schoolmaster, superior or subjects, with him and them I could not accept peace, but I would have to fight against the untruth and untruthful, also the unpeaceful and restless, who break the unity of the general church in Bern in city and land, with the holy scripture and drive them away with God's help until my end, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>And with that (to conclude my foolishness) we remain with our church in possession. And they must prove that from the beginning it was not truly taught and handled, before they proceed with their intention (and we must not prove that their teachings are false, for they have so wonderfully confused it, only for the sake of appearance), so that they want to do enough for everyone.</p>
      <p>They have a monk from Interlaken well placed (and pledged their soul as a guarantee, also appealed to the last judgment, he is learned, capable, etc.), with whom a church in Bern is provided. And yet he is a much greater idiot than I, that, as in Peter Kunz, brought with him, to be a helper, he had to return to a village within a year's time (because) he could not manage the diaconate; which good lords and citizens knew well. And with that the preachers might want to persuade our gracious lords, they have assured to the utmost, they want to act against their reformation, etc., not at all. But just today Sulzer in the sermon (Semen Abrahę sumus, John 8, [33]) has pointed away from fleshly glory and said: "Glory in the Lord (Jeremiah 9, [23f]) and the cross of Christ (Galatians 6, [14]); yes, glory in that you are sprinkled in holy baptism with the blood of Jesus Christ." And speaks that without any explanation, beyond what he knows, that a community is badly hurt by such unclarified words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>In summary, why I have indicated this last, they pretend to remain, with which they blind an authority. If they do not hold it, it is all the better to deal with them steadfastly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Bern, 13th of September 1546.</p>
