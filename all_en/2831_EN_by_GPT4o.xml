      <p>Greetings. As much as your letters were more pleasing, most excellent Bullinger, it was equally distressing that the pious Lismaninus did not deliver them to me; for I feared that I might not see the pious man, whom I finally saw, and I was delighted by his presence and conversation, yet it grieved me not a little that he departed so suddenly and without any service from me.</p>
      <p>However, your letters and those of the pious Pellicanus have achieved this, that I would dedicate myself entirely to him, if I could be of any use to him. But he, much wiser than I, knows otherwise... and indicated what is expedient. I give thanks to God, that you are far from the Bellians, who are bursting while B. operates through others, and who, while they neither hear nor do anything for the benefit of the church, prohibit those they can, indeed they most unjustly drive them away, they rage if anyone suffers for Christ or merely turns and hears the word. What do you not do at home? How do you present yourself to foreigners, how do you adorn the Italian church, which you have? Christ sees your so pious zeal, which I pray may ignite more and more and, fully blessing you, may He cause all your holy desires, indeed beyond your desires, to reach a happy conclusion.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to you for your diligent labors for the Genevan church, the most splendid ornament of the Bernese church. For what more elegant crown does it have than that through it such a great church began and stood? Great is the kindness of God that, although He is most sufficient by Himself, He wishes to adorn such miserable creatures, that He does not disdain to use them in works that surpass the earth, indeed heaven, and commands them to serve in this and promises and gives great things to those who do. I congratulate that so holy senate for such pious, such Christian zeal, which not only strives for the glory of Christ among their own and in their own, but also for those acting afar. Complete, I pray, O man of God, what you have begun, so that with joy you may give thanks to the Lord with us over the peace and blessing of such great churches. If the successors of Judas and (whatever they pretend) true enemies of piety, who wish to be considered brothers, are heard, they will bring sudden ruin to themselves and others: for it is amazing to say how the Lord manifests Himself as kind and favorable to the Genevan church, always more and more opening and dissipating the plans and efforts of Satan and his followers. Since it is for the glory of Christ that both churches are united, and it is not only for the honor of both, indeed it is for the benefit of both, that they are bound by a holy and firm covenant, so that even children can see, and there is no one, however little endowed with judgment, who would not easily judge that neither can withdraw from the covenant without incurring a mark: now especially when they recognize the same Christ and the same gospel, how shameful it would be to consider that the enemy of piety could be made a citizen and a brother excluded from the city, an impious person admitted to a friendly covenant and a pious person dismissed. And not only in this do I urge you, and all the pious who can do anything with you, but also for a far greater and more necessary peace and concord, namely of all churches. Indeed, we will write much back and forth about the Lord's Supper: I do not see how the dissension can be removed unless it is dealt with in person with friendly words. How much writing would have been needed about the dissension of circumcision and the burden of the law? If Paul had not dealt with it in person, he would never have obtained the agreement he achieved. Writings have their power, I admit: but the Lord wants it to be dealt with in person with words, where it can be done. Here I urge you, by Christ, to finally allow those you know to meet. Princes must be solicited and everything that pertains to this must be done by you and others. May Christ accomplish this so necessary thing through you. It seems difficult, indeed most difficult. But what does He not make easy, for whom nothing is impossible?</p>
      <p>Forgive me if I dare so much with you; for I would rather deal with you in such a way that you command what you wish me to do through the Lord, and you will experience how willingly I strive to obey. Farewell, pious shepherd of Christ's holy flock, and continue to perfect what you do. May Christ, the head of all, continually guide you with His spirit! I wish your holy colleagues well, I wish to greet Haller most dutifully and whatever he strives for the glory of Christ. I greeted our prefect in your name, as you commanded, who received it most kindly and gratefully.</p>
      <p>Your colleague and other brothers greet you. If Lismaninus is there, I wish him very well.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, February 16, 1556. When I had finished the second sermon, I met our prefect, who ordered me to greet you most dutifully and through you also Walter, who should not spare the prefect's son, but chastise him as much as his deeds demand.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, distinguished theologian, most dear brother and fellow minister. In Zürich.</p>
