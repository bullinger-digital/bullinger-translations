      <p>Greetings. I will write, reverend father in Christ, once more to Mr. Pergula and encourage him to diligently focus on what we are asking for, and as far as I can see, he will not fail in his duty. He respects you, truly loves me, and when last year I traveled with Mr. Gesner through those parts and fell ill, he treated me with every kind of service. Therefore, there is nothing I would not promise myself from him.</p>
      <p>The others, as you say, all disgracefully fail, they promise much indeed, but deliver nothing. However, Augustinus Maynardus wrote that Count Ulisse Martinengo sent his own messenger to Trent, but apart from speeches, he could not acquire anything; yet he did not even send those speeches, so that, as far as they are concerned, we would also lack those. But what about Traversius, what about Frederick after so many magnificent promises? They are abundantly lavish with words, but very sparing with everything else. How does that splendid speech in the name of the Swiss to the fathers suit your taste? Our people will not write, as good men advised, but will send envoys again.</p>
      <p>When the consul proposed the matter in the Senate of the Three Leagues, it is amazing with what great contention of spirits the matter was conducted; there were those who thought neither writing nor sending envoys was necessary, because the Zurich consul had very arrogantly excluded our consul from all action recently. Thus, the consul himself and many others complained to me. Consul Ambrosius (as he is cunning) when he saw the spirits were exasperated, began to calm them and modestly excused the consul, saying he had hoped for better and was himself deceived, and other things etc. Thus, it was finally obtained that envoys would be sent.</p>
      <p>But when this was decided, others who were against it also agreed and said: if one wants to send envoys, then one should use a different seriousness than before and not let oneself be led by the nose by a single person etc. These things to you; but if our consul is sent (as the legation is decreed to him), ensure that he is not excluded from action; for if this were to happen in the future, it would cause great envy among your people towards ours; the good would be offended, the bad would be confirmed. You yourself understand well what I am writing.</p>
      <p>Our people love Lord Thumisius and speak honorably of him, saying he is a humane man and familiar in meetings. Therefore, if he is sent, he should be secretly advised to ensure that our people are not neglected. I have nothing else new at all; therefore, I consider myself excused to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, for as long and as happily as possible. Chur, December 1st, 1562.</p>
      <p>I return your things.</p>
      <p>Please, if there is anything certain in the meantime, do not hide it.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to send anything back; he already had this sermon of Fontidonius before; if there is anything left, distribute it to others. In the meantime, I compared the manuscripts with mine, which Mr. Pergula sent; mine contain more pages; the earlier ones agree with those you sent back; but in my writing, there is additionally a decree on reformation; eleven canons are added, also a decree on the concession of the chalice, where the matter is referred back to the pope. If you had these, good; if not, they will be sent.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, always to be honored.</p>
