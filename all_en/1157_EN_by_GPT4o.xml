      <p>Greetings. I have indeed long neglected the duty of writing, Calvin, most esteemed and beloved lord and brother in Christ, but in the meantime, I have nonetheless loved you, nor do I doubt anything about your zeal towards us. I know, however, that you are very busy and cannot always do what you wish. Therefore, I excuse you for not yet having responded to our letters sent to you long ago. Those who come to us from you report that all your affairs are well. You also hear that our matters, by the grace of God, are proceeding rightly. Let us pray to the Lord that He may protect us and always advance His glory among all.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly know that a council has been convened for the first of May. These are mere tricks and treacherous deceptions; indeed, open force shines through in every word. But what else do you expect from the devil and his members? I am sending an example, in case none has yet been delivered to you. Although I do not doubt that it is poorly described. I see that we must be most diligently vigilant, pray most fervently, and work most faithfully. For plots and dangers are increasing.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly know that Magdeburg, under a severe siege ordered by the Emperor because of its commitment to pure religion, was liberated on December 20th, with the Lord's help, triumphing over the enemies, even capturing Duke George of Mecklenburg. For this is what friends from Nuremberg write. Meanwhile, an army of about 3,000 horsemen and more or less 16,000 foot soldiers has gathered around the coastal cities, which has occupied the bishoprics of Verden, Bremen, and Magdeburg. Against this, Maurice recently moved, equipped with Saxon and Imperial soldiers. That Danish army seems to have hindered the Emperor's plans and efforts, so that he may not now attack Piedmont and Switzerland to subdue them. May the Lord keep us from evil. Farewell most happily in the Lord, most friendly lord and brother. The brothers greet you. Greet Mr. Gallasius, our Mr. Farel, and all the other brothers. Zurich, January 19, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed and dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
