      <p>Greetings. I did not know he would stay here so long; otherwise, I would have written more extensively.</p>
      <p>Now, as he is about to leave, he finally meets with me.</p>
      <p>I am therefore sending back to you through him these letters of yours, which you recently sent to me, and I give you great thanks for sharing them. Our people are preparing for the Basel convention.</p>
      <p>Delegates are being sent, who were also previously in Neuch√¢tel. There is no intention to return anything, but to show and explain to the Swiss collectively (perhaps forgotten over the course of so many years) by what right this dominion is held. But what will happen further, we will hear shortly.</p>
      <p>The Duke treats his people in such a way that they secretly encourage ours to endure the worst rather than return under him. Therefore, even the people of Thonon and some other prefectures have petitioned our senate not to accept any conditions by which they would be restored to the Duke, but to provide them with the same loyalty in defense that they have shown by obeying them until now and will continue to show. The Waldensians (as I have certainly heard from Consul Negelin, Steiger, and others these days) have once again routed and put to flight two of his legions sent against them, and, as I hear, he has now been defeated by them seven times. Some of our citizens were in Geneva these days, and while they were there, some people speaking Italian arrived, leading with them some mules or horses loaded with, as far as he could judge, money. It is inferred, although it cannot be estimated for certain, that this money is being sent by the faithful from France to these Waldensians; for we hear that they are suffering from scarcity. In France, the number of the faithful increases daily.</p>
      <p>Throughout the entire Provence and Languedoc, they say there is not a small town where there is not a church and a certain minister. Almost all our French are leaving; they claim discipline, but they seek something else, and although much has been granted to them before, our people seem inclined to grant them a more extensive and freer use of discipline. May the Lord grant that they use it well! Our Diesbach recently celebrated his wedding at Moudon with the widow daughter of Johann Rudolf von Erlach. I would write more, but the messenger is waiting for me now.</p>
      <p>My brother is not allowed to write now, so greet him in my name along with all yours, friends, and brothers. May the Lord protect us! I have understood what your people have written to ours about the people of Glarus, but I do not yet know what ours will respond; I know this arrogance and unheard-of insolence is being borne with great indignation. Every day one expects that a clash will have to occur. The people of Solothurn and Fribourg also cause our people many troubles in many matters; for they are lying under the same cover with them.</p>
      <p>May God make it better, amen! Farewell again. Bern, the day before Ascension Day, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
