      <p>In the year 9th of June.</p>
      <p>I have written my letter to you through Froschauer. Everything that has been written by our people is in utmost secrecy; however, understand well that the proposed articles would be very burdensome if they were not to be mitigated. The Lord of Hosts will be for us in place of many thousands, and He will exercise His power here all the more, the less there is of human counsel and aid, wherever we may turn; we are between a rock and a hard place.</p>
      <p>The city's envoys in Augsburg have not yet given an answer to the Interim, waiting daily for their superiors' decision.</p>
      <p>All princes honored the emperor on Corpus Christi. The Elector Palatine and Margrave Joachim of Brandenburg led the Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg; no one stayed behind except Margrave Hans and a young prince of LÃ¼neburg, who claimed illness. Oh Lord God, how utterly useless and weaker than weak we are.</p>
      <p>A very poor man in Augsburg publicly shouted at the emperor and king, telling them to repent, as God's punishment is at the door.</p>
      <p>He was then imprisoned, but persisted in his preaching; it is not known how it will end for him.</p>
      <p>The Turk is said to have set out excellently against the Shah, intending to maintain the five-year peace with the emperor, it is believed.</p>
      <p>The estates have granted the king to give a barrel of gold every year for five years in Austria, and also to provide for future unrest that might arise in Germany, to pay for the help of the Roman expedition for six months; it amounts to many barrels of gold.</p>
      <p>Maximilian is said to be going to Spain daily, and the young emperor is coming out; it is said to happen for great reasons, as he is a very kind-hearted lord, and therefore there is concern that he might waver here outside.</p>
      <p>Herewith a letter coming from Munich to my brother-in-law Marcell Dieterich; I consider it important and send him the letter at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>It is said that discord is about to arise among the Confederates because of the oath, etc. But you know what good means have been found therein, see to it that you do not allow any unnecessary cause of discord in any way. Let nothing temporal, no temporal honor or anything else be dear to you; if your lords cannot take the oath as others wish to swear, then they can give such an oath to each other. What does it matter? Be vigilant. See what you have to do; you will have people who will laugh in their fists and take advantage of your discord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be on guard and show your people more towards peace and unity, rather than maintaining their old custom of taking the oath to the detriment of unity. In such cases, one must let seven be even and four odd.</p>
      <p>But why do I urge the one who is already running? Take it for good. I have heard a bad speech today from a Confederate; I hope to God it will be better than that it should lead to unrest. Hold fast, and as strong as you are, there are enough people who will gladly help you in and promote the unrest.</p>
