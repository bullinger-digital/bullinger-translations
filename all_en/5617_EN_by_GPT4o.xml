      <p>Highly learned, gracious sir.</p>
      <p>Since this well-known and with the advice of pious, honest people has married in Strasbourg and my dear late father, Doctor Caspar Hedio, had a special friendship with you, my dutiful and friendly request is that you, for the sake of my late father and the friendship, kindly assist the groom, as he has no parents, so that his desires may be fulfilled, advise and assist him.</p>
      <p>This is my and my family's obligation to you and yours in friendship; if I knew otherwise than all honor, along with the dowry, I would have refrained from writing this letter.</p>
      <p>Doctor Caspar Hervagius is a brother-in-law, having previously married the eldest daughter with good people's advice.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God Almighty.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the 20th of February in the year 63.</p>
      <p>And I dutifully ask for forgiveness for writing so poorly.</p>
      <p>God willing, it shall be better next time. Eusebius Hedio.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, professor and doctor in Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
