      <p>Greetings. I, reverend father, have read the acts of your envoys eagerly; but to speak truthfully and candidly, the intervention of our envoys seems very lukewarm. Our envoy, who wishes to be seen and regarded as truly evangelical (to whom, however, I have communicated nothing about this intervention of the envoys), asserts that the King of France has indeed taken some account of the envoys' intervention and has promised less because of the kingdom's nobles, but has begun to do more, and he offers as evidence of this that in France, the persecution of the pious has ceased and that out of such a large number of captives, only a few have been burned; he therefore hopes that everything will become better day by day and hour by hour. May he predict the truth! The same envoy also reported, and indeed as a certainty and verified, that the Duke of Guise has conquered and forcibly taken the very fortified town of Calais (Caleß) and that very recently. He says that they came upon it by surprise; it was said that the duke initially suffered great damage and had to withdraw with losses. From the lord's speech, I perceive well that the French are greatly rejoicing over the port, etc.</p>
      <p>I write this to you now, so that I may send you some letters, as you prefer empty letters rather than none at all. I will send back the acts of the envoys to you soon through the noble man Friedrich von Salis, whose arrival is expected. Farewell, reverend father, and convey my greetings to all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 17, 1558. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
