      <p>I recently received the letter you sent to Lord Johannes Pontisella, most illustrious man, and I immediately ensured it was delivered to the faithful in Locarno, so they may know what was decided at the assembly and how they should conduct themselves as persecution increases. On behalf of the faithful, I am immensely grateful to you for your diligence and dedication in this matter of Christ. May God, the keeper of hearts, reward you according to His mercy and the sincerity of your spirit. We further implore you, Lord Heinrich, by the compassion of Christ, to persevere in the province you have undertaken with a cheerful spirit and to prevail through prayers to the Creator, exhortation to the magistrate, and diligence among all the people of Zürich.</p>
      <p>We trust in your kindness that you will do more than we ask and pray for. You will learn from me in a few words what is currently happening in Italy. Four days ago, a false rumor reached us, namely that Peter Strozzi had fallen with all the Rhaetians; I suspect this has also reached you.</p>
      <p>But the truth is far different; for yesterday, trustworthy merchants arrived to inform us that everything is going well for Peter Strozzi and the Rhaetians, many castles besieged by the Spaniards in the territory of Siena have been captured by Strozzi by force, in which four hundred Spaniards are said to have been slaughtered and many captured.</p>
      <p>To the people of Florence, the most desired freedom is promised, and no harm is inflicted upon them as much as possible, so there is hope that not only the Sienese can be liberated, but also the Florentines may defect to the French. In the Piedmont region, the French occupy all the plains without opposition, they plunder and carry off the crops, hay, and all other supplies of the imperialists, and, to put it in one word, everything is going according to the wishes of the French. I thought it right to write these few things to you, and they are all true; if anything else worthy of memory happens, I will also try to inform you of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The pious men Lord Bernardino Ochino and Augustinus Maynardus and Niger greet you. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Chiavenna, July 13.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
