      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, many and serious reasons prevent me and do not allow me to come to you. Meanwhile, I have asked this brother, who will deliver this letter to you, to come on my behalf and expedite certain matters. Therefore, I commend him to you as a person of the highest regard.</p>
      <p>He is a very pious and very learned man, also a refugee himself because of the gospel. From him, you will hear the state of my affairs; therefore, I will write sparingly about it.</p>
      <p>Ludwig, my nephew, has finally suffered shipwreck, although I have directed the course of his navigation as much as I could. I have asked this brother to inquire about him and, if he finds him anywhere, to encourage him to return to his homeland; for I have now abandoned all care for him. I desire that he brings Aurelius to me. You, as you are accustomed, assist these matters with your charity.</p>
      <p>I daily expose my head to great dangers in these regions, and I trust in God, who will deliver me. All of Italy is in arms, even though a treaty has been struck between the Pope and the King; but soldiers are being gathered both for the Emperor and for the King himself, who is contemplating invading the Kingdom of Naples. The churches of Italy itself have peace, except that the Anabaptists sometimes provoke persecution.</p>
      <p>Recently, I traveled through the entire Valtellina Valley together with our Lelio, and that region is not free from that plague. It was brought in by the one whom you call a poisoned flask; and I wish he would not continue! For I see that those who ought to be watchful, as if from a high place, are not very diligent.</p>
      <p>I thought it best to abstain from the synod now, as I predicted I would do; for some judge the brother not very candidly.</p>
      <p>I will abstain (as I hope) even in the future; I have enough business at home.</p>
      <p>Lelio returned to his father four days ago. He promised to return to me shortly. Morosini (this is between you and me, and do not share it with anyone) indicated to me that he would return to his homeland within three months and advised me to postpone my departure, which I had prepared, and to enter that island with him rather than alone. Which I will do; indeed (so you know) I have now postponed coming to Zürich, because I see that I will come again within three months. Meanwhile, this brother of mine, who is coming, will expedite certain matters that cannot be delayed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Matthias Flacius Illyricus was with me, with whom I discussed much about the Eucharist; I diligently advised the man not to stir up tragedies.</p>
      <p>Soon you will have from me the Pontifical of the Fathers, which you said you desired, a truly worthy codex, which you may place among the excommunicated outside the museum; I am now writing against it.</p>
      <p>I had written against Nausea, the praiser of the council, whose book of mine was recently printed in the very heart of Italy; the printers are beginning to dare so much. Farewell and greetings to Zwingli, Lavater, Josias, your sons-in-law, excellent men, indeed to the whole family, school, and church, as I am accustomed to say. Pray for me continually, which I earnestly ask of you.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, June 20, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
