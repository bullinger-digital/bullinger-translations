    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received Blarer's letter from August 22 [No. 2995]. He shares Blarer's opinion on Emperor Charles V's response [to the Swiss Confederates from July 28] and also represented the same to the Zurich councilors. There is not much behind the fine words of this letter! Bullinger also wants to let the other matter [concerning the politics pursued by Constance] rest. May God make up for all the omissions!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger has also received the letter from Blarer delivered by Hieronymus Hürus [No. 2987]. Hürus is an exceedingly sensitive, learned, God-fearing, and skillful person, to whom he could only offer little company due to the Zurich shooting festival and the large influx of visitors. If possible, he will send a letter with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He will also take up the matter of the [letter from the Constance Secret Council to King Henry II] and ensure that the French messenger [Sébastien de l’Aubespine] behaves more prudently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There are no verified news to report from Chur or Bern (where negotiations [with France] are apparently taking place).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] If only the godless Count of Büren, Maximilian of Egmont, were truly captured! Should Blarer learn anything verified about this, he should report it immediately. Nothing else is to be expected than that the imperial mercenaries will behave so badly until they destroy themselves. For now, however, they function as Germany's scourge before they themselves are visited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Sultan Suleiman has dispatched a splendid embassy to France, which was seen in Lyon by some Zurichers (who returned last Saturday [August 20]).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is certain that Charles V and Henry II are not fulfilling their mutual obligations. Who should trust them then? Blessed are those who have nothing to do with princes! In Lyon, there is a rumor that Henry II and Pope Paul III have suffered a heavy defeat against England. Therefore, [the mercenaries hired by Henry II] are now moving from Landrecies to Boulogne.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The Zurich shooting festival will end tomorrow or the day after.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] May God thwart the bloody attacks of the mighty kings and save His own through His mercy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings to the whole household. Blarer should write frequently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [P.S.:] Bullinger will respond to Sebastian Schertlin's letter [No. 2990] as soon as he has the occasion and the necessary time to do so.</p>

      <p>Dear and trusted brother, I have received your letter, sent on August 22. I completely agree with your judgment on the Emperor's response. I have also informed many of my lords about it. These are good words and nothing behind them. As for the other matter, we will let it rest. May God restore all that has been neglected.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Dr. Hieronymus Hürus has delivered your letter to me. Thank you. He is a wonderfully fine person, learned, God-fearing, and skillful. I have shown him little friendship due to the shooting festival and the influx of people. I will write to him further if I can.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the letter and that it should be handled more carefully by the French messenger, I will see to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We have no certain news from Chur yet. Bern is involved in some negotiations (but nothing certain), as has been said.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Oh, would that God capture the enemy of God from Büren! If you learn anything certain, let me know. No one expects anything else than that the imperial mercenaries will do no good until they bleed themselves to death. For now, they are the scourge of the German lands. Soon the scourge will be thrown into the open.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Turk has sent his powerful embassy to France. Some of our citizens (who just returned from Lyon last Saturday) have seen it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is certain that the Emperor and France are neither loyal nor friendly to each other; who should trust them then? Blessed are those who have nothing to do with princes! Our citizens say that the King of France and the Pope have suffered a great loss against England; so goes the rumor in Lyon. Therefore, the mercenaries are moving from Landrecies to Boulogne.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The shooting festival will end tomorrow or the day after.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that He may thwart the bloody attempts of the mighty monarchs and preserve us, who call upon His holy name in His church, for His mercy's sake. Amen.</p>

      <p>My household and all friends greet you and your entire household. Farewell forever and love me as you do, and write frequently. Zurich, August 23, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>You will diligently greet Dr. Schertlin, whose letters I have received and for which I give great thanks. I will write to him when the subject and leisure permit.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful minister of the church of Constance, his dearest brother. Constance.</p>
