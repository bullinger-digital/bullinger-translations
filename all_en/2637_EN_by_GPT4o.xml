      <p>Yesterday, I was certainly informed that the Turk, after learning about the truce made between the king and the Emperor, has abandoned all that war preparation and will no longer send an army to Hungary or a fleet to the Emperor's maritime provinces. Now the Germans should consider where this army, gathered by the Roman king, should turn. Now they truly have something to fear; before, they did not. To those whom you wish to inform of these matters, do not name from whom you have it; however, I write to you as most certain and well-known. In my last letters, I forgot to add the treaty of the truce, which I sent later. I have recommended the guest of the Stork, as much as it is in my power. Farewell. Commend me to your masters. Solothurn, 29th of May.</p>
      <p>Yours, S. Laurentius.</p>
