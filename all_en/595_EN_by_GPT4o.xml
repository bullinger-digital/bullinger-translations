      <p>Greetings. I know that my letters are eagerly awaited by you, but I also want you to know that while I have not lacked material, neither have I lacked the will: the only reason they have not been sent is that there were no couriers to deliver them there. However, so as not to delay too much, and to relieve both myself and your expectation in some way, I wanted to send these to our Hochholtzer, since I had a messenger not going further, so that they might be sent to you through him, lest I write too late while waiting for a certain messenger. But the main thing I have to write about is your secondary plan, about which you also write to Calvin (of which I am sending a copy here), D.</p>
      <p>Musculus and I approve very much. We would not disapprove of the former method either, if we were not held back by the obstinacy of the senate and the colleagues. However, we have not reported this plan of yours to the brothers. It seems that Calvin's response should be awaited. Upon which it will be more convenient for you to decide what should be done and how, and then to inform us of that. It only seems to me to be somewhat harsh, that in the form of the letter, in which it seems to you that Calvin's letter should be responded to, among other things, the following are included: nor should you doubt the colleagues, the ministers, I mean, of the churches throughout Switzerland, that they too will approve these things, especially since public disputations have been held among them many years ago, and confessions of common faith have been exhibited by them, with you not objecting, with which these of yours agree, and they adhere to those of theirs, etc. For these things seem to be said especially about us, and said in such a way as if you had not previously discussed that declaration with us. From which some suspicion of discord between us could easily arise, which must be avoided by all means, and it must be acted in such a way that everyone understands that the spirit and mind of our churches are entirely the same, and a kind of kindred necessity. We will also seem not to object to the confession of your faith, but to adhere to ours in such a way that you only hope that we cannot embrace and approve these of yours in all respects, as if you are still uncertain about our agreement. I write these things so that they may be mitigated, if it seems so to you. For I desire nothing more than for it to be known to all, what is the agreement of both your and our church, how close and necessary the union, lest you seem to agree and convene with others more than with us. It would also seem to me not unwise, but perhaps very much to the point (if this can be obtained from others), that after the letters of the Genevans and yours, another of yours to us should be added, in which you would more fully explain your plan, to which we would also respond with another letter, in which we would testify to our agreement, and wish the same purity and clarity to all churches, etc. For this matter, neither the consent of the magistrate seems to be needed, nor the subscription of our names. But I do not know what can be obtained among ours.</p>
      <p>Day by day, the writings and words of certain seditious men are becoming more and more exacerbated, who instill in them, to incite them and disturb everything, how much Calvin and Farel boast of their victory, that they have finally drawn you into that agreement, how they now raise their crests, how they even insult us, how they promise that both Philipp and Bucer are of the same opinion, now all their obscurities are to be explained in this way, no one will be able to hinder the freedom of more obscure sacramental expressions, etc., as long as there is agreement in meaning, etc. Hence they are so incited that they can hardly bear to hear us speak about this matter. However, that fury must be restrained with moderate persuasions, which, even if they achieve nothing, we will still have done our duty. However, I am sure that the obstinacy of a few will not alienate your minds from us and our churches. But enough of these things. You, with your prudence, will easily see what needs to be done. I, as I am yours, do not want to hide anything from you that I think is in the interest of our churches.</p>
      <p>In previous letters, you recommended to me Jung from Konstanz; he has been received in such a way that he waits until some suitable position becomes vacant. I thought he could be conveniently and usefully appointed to the church in Aarau, now that Zender has passed away, as you know, if Gervasius's appointment cannot be obtained. But listen, I beg you, to what nonsense these people attempt: they have elected (as the election was granted to them rather dangerously, as it now appears) Ismael Buchser, whom our people last year dealt with at Sebastian Guldibeck's, whose maid he also married, being deprived of his stipend, a man unlearned, imprudent, of a bold and insolent tongue, of very light morals, who had scarcely obtained such clemency from the magnificent senate, that he was received into the diaconate at Sursee. Where he also conducted himself in such a way that at the next synod he barely earned a testimony of his repentance. He, as he is light and of no reputation among sensible men, is nevertheless of great esteem among those like him, who also try to extol him, because they know him to be very light and therefore not likely to oppose their vices. It happened that two months ago he was elected by Benedict May to the church in RÃ¼ti, of which he is the patron. This election was ratified by the senate, although everyone understood that this one thing was sought by that lord, to have a man whom he could use at his discretion. Now the people of Aarau also come forward, declaring their piety and ecclesiastical care in this matter, and elect him to their church, who was scarcely considered worthy to be a deacon of the whole class. Who would not notice that these people have neither God nor any religion at heart. They have written to our senate for his confirmation; however, we, having understood the matter, have diligently advised the senate not to agree to the unjust election and petition.</p>
      <p>Today this is being discussed in the senate. What happens, you will learn either from me hereafter or from Christian [Hochholtzer?]. Within an hour that messenger departs, so I do not know what has been done; I hope, however, that they will deny it in every way, since yesterday I understood that almost all the senators were very much moved by the indignity of this matter. In the meantime, you can work for Gervasius; here I can do nothing, because, as I said, the election is in their hands.</p>
      <p>Calvin's letters to you, which I send here, have also waited here for a full eight days for a messenger. Since there is no hope of another worthy one, I wanted to send them to Aarau through this one as well. He wrote to me very amicably; it seems to him that a declaration must be made; he mentions Philipp himself, whom he knows to think nothing else nor to be otherwise affected, and who can easily be drawn to us.</p>
      <p>I diligently inquired about Anna Bachoffin; however, I have not yet been able to find her. As soon as I have tracked her down, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>I have taken Dobler and Bindschedler into my household, as both they and their parents requested of me; I would have preferred to place them with someone else because of the lack of furniture; for it greatly inconveniences the management of the household for me to live so suspended and not to be able to enjoy the things I left at home. But since they urged me and your common letters through Ammian also requested this of me, I took them in.</p>
      <p>They pay 28 florins for everything except necessary clothes and books; they have already paid the money for half a year. I will watch over them and take care that they are kept in honest discipline and return to you not without an increase in learning and prudence. Certainly, their presence is acceptable to the magistrate; we will be able to obtain more easily from them in the future what seems to pertain to the promotion of studies.</p>
      <p>These things you have from me at present through an uncertain messenger; if a certain one comes to me, I will give more, and perhaps what is now neglected through carelessness. Farewell. All the brothers send you greetings.</p>
      <p>Greet from me all who are with you. Especially to your wife and family, convey many greetings from me and my wife.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and prosper you in every way. Given in Bern, July 18, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
