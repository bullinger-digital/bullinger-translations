      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write to you at the moment. However, since that messenger is going there, I wanted to give him this letter to you, so that if you wanted to send anything to us through him, you would have a reliable courier. I greatly desire your letters amidst such great upheavals and cannot help but wonder why you are now completely silent. Musculus and Mecardo have gone to Basel. They returned the day before; they report that Schertli is leading his soldiers through the bishopric of Basel to Lorraine, to join the king's forces there. What their purpose is or what the northerners are doing, either he does not know or I cannot extract it from him. There is a rumor that Ferdinand has obtained a truce from the Turk; if this is true, our people should see what they will do. Our people (as I wrote before) are too aggressive, and we now have a great deal of trouble with them to restrain them. I greatly fear the consulship of Negelin, which he will enter around the upcoming Easter festival. May the Lord restrain his spirit and efforts, so that we may live contentedly in the Lord in peace. Amen. I have various things I would like to pour into your lap, but I do not dare to entrust them to letters. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers be safe, as well as your household, whom you will greet diligently from me and all of mine. Bern, March 26, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
