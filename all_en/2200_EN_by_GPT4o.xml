      <p>God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ beforehand, etc.</p>
      <p>Kind, dear godfather, the bearer of this letter, Barbi Kluntz from Z체rich, daughter of the late Jacob Kluntz, who perished at Kappel, has served for some time here with my master treasurer Haller in our neighborhood and, as far as I know, has conducted herself honorably and well. Now, perhaps some fortune has come her way, as she intends to marry; however, since she has previously overlooked and angered her relatives in Z체rich, such as Hans Bl채si, her stepfather, and Hans and Melchior Kluntz, her relatives, as she informs me, she would like to reconcile with them, especially since she hopes to receive some inheritance from her stepfather.</p>
      <p>She also mentions that my master mayor Lavater has supported her somewhat. She has therefore asked me to give her a letter of recommendation to you, which she may use with my master Lavater, so that he may help her with her relatives and especially with her stepfather. Since she has conducted herself piously here, as far as I know, and I have not found her request unreasonable, I could not refuse her, and I commend her to you for this reason. I assume you may know more about her affairs than I do.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend her to you. My master treasurer Haller greets you, with whom I had breakfast today along with Mr. Hans Asper. He is dealing with his Dornach battle in Solothurn.</p>
      <p>I am always waiting to hear some news from you. It is said here that those from Ulm have expelled all their priests. Octavianus of Parma stayed here overnight recently, but only revealed himself when he was about to leave; he comes from France. Otherwise, we have no news, except that there is a great armament everywhere in Germany. May God send it all for the good. Amen. Dated in Bern, February 25, in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Z체rich, my beloved master and godfather.</p>
