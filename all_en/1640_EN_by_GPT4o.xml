      <p>In Christ, greetings! I passed through Oxford on the fifth of May: as soon as Johannes von Ulm learned of this, he, most excellent man, insisted that I write to you and would not cease asking. Therefore, I could not refuse him, as he was making a just request and beautifully reminding me of my duty. I wrote to you a letter shortly after Easter: whether it was delivered, I do not know. I will briefly touch upon the main points of that letter here. First, I give immortal thanks to your piety, by which you were led to make a very loving mention of me in the preface to our prince. I have always loved your doctrine and learning, which are praised by all; now, however, I also embrace and gladly acknowledge your great humanity and incredible love towards us. The prince himself certainly received your little gift with the greatest gratitude and the best of spirits: know that what you did was not only honorable but also very useful and pious: for, as Socrates says, the exhortations of great men are spurs and goads to successfully conduct a praiseworthy life. Each night, when we were on the borders of Scotland, after receiving the book there from Johannes von Ulm, I read a proper lesson from your book to his highness, and he wanted it not only read but also carefully examined: by this, I truly sensed that he, otherwise endowed with an excellent nature, made great progress; and he often affirmed that he was very much indebted to you. So much for this.</p>
      <p>You will best understand the state of my affairs from this very message. I had initially intended to write more, but business and the journey itself necessarily call me elsewhere: however, I will add these few things; if you respond to them, you will undoubtedly do a most pleasing thing. First, I ask whether a marriage contracted without the knowledge or against the will of the parents is legitimate and true: and whether those who are thus married and persist in the same are to be said to live piously and legitimately in holy matrimony; or whether they can separate again by the will of the parents. Secondly, I ask whether a woman who leaves her own husband and adheres to another while he is still living can marry him after the death of her own husband, to whom she adhered while her own husband was still alive. Thirdly, I ask whether those who, during a time of persecution, out of fear of death, were joined in marriage to each other without witnesses, but nevertheless affirmed before many that they were married and lived together for a space of twenty years, etc., are to be judged to live piously in holy matrimony. I ask you to briefly explain to me what you think about these matters. I hastily wrote this to you: I hope you will consider it kindly, which I certainly do not doubt you will do.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent and dearest to me, Mr. Bullinger, and always commend my ministry in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Oxford, the fourth of May 1552.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your greatness, Johannes Willock.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend father in Christ and lord, Mr. Bullinger, pastor and most faithful bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, these are given.</p>
      <p>"Willock."</p>
