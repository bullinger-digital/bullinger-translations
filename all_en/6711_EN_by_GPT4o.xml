      <p>Reverend Father in Christ, I have received your letters and sincerely congratulate us all on this pious agreement in Christ. I am indeed, if anyone, most eager; therefore, there was no need for that excuse with me, especially since I am your client and disciple. As for our affairs, I know that I am the one being targeted; but for that reason, I could not abandon a good cause. What if Beatus had been forcibly imposed on the House of God, into what great distress would he have thrown both our churches and yours? The consul Tscharnner was initially very much against me; but now he admits with a sigh that I saw more from the beginning than he did. Our city was initially divided into factions; but now all the tribes have been unanimous and cannot bear the dominion of the Five Cantons, especially since they aim solely to subject us to the Council of Trent. Your matter is also at stake, and I am convinced that your senate will also consider both their own and my situation. However, I have long desired to be freed from these troubles, as in this republic one thing after another keeps arising and there is never an end. But the Zurich senate has so far not admitted my pleas. Now God is my witness that I did whatever I did most unwillingly; but with a clear conscience, I could not speak otherwise. Many good men will testify how I have timely reminded our people of their duty. But since some were shameless, they had to be reprimanded more sharply. I have indeed made every effort to ensure that this city would be safe, which would now lie in ruins if I had not opposed the furious plans of many with all my might. I will write most accurately about all matters to your lords the consuls, which will happen within eight days. In the meantime, my father, support the cause. Truth is the daughter of time; it can be suppressed, but not oppressed. I would have written immediately now, if the House of God had just met; before, it could not because of the snow. You will know at once what is being done. It is not so bad in the courts as well as in many communities in the Upper League; the peasants are beginning to notice. Is it not a great thing that the Landammann Paul Pul has written to Rome on behalf of Lord Batten, and his son has married Lord Batten's sister and, in return, Lord Batten's brother has married the Landammann's daughter, and it is a double kinship, and he is supposed to be the judge in this matter? You can judge for yourselves whether this is acceptable to the House of God. I will write about the means another time. If the matter is handled correctly, good means will be found; but if a House of God is to be forced by violence, then in the future a House of God will have nothing more to say to the priests. How would it be if they were sent away and those who have provided for Lord Batten from the Five Cantons were paid? Then they would have less reason to complain. However, you will understand how far it goes with the next message. In the meantime, do your best as before. I hope to God that more honest men will give testimony and evidence (as the whole council here does) of how everything has unfolded from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>These things most hastily. You, my father, if I am so often a burden to you, forgive me. Farewell. Chur, March 4, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>They are spreading here unfortunate rumors about some new sect in Alsace, which has arisen there; about this, I ask you to inform us, etc. The Six Cantons have responded quite amicably to the House of God.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
