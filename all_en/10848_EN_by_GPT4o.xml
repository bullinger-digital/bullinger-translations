Thank Bullinger for his letter and promise to return the booklet ["De vera obedientia oratio"] by the Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] soon. The bearer of the letter will report on news from Italy. Greetings. A federal diet is scheduled for May 14; regarding the schoolmaster, they will look into it further afterwards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, most esteemed Bullinger, is coming to us, a man who seems to us to be noble and courteous, claiming to be coming directly from the emperor's court and household to Zürich - he says he has personal business there, which he will discuss in person when he arrives. However, he thought it would be presumptuous and rash to intrude upon your home without being known or recommended by anyone, so he asked us, who are well known to you and respectful of your name, to provide him with a letter that would allow him a freer and more appropriate access to you. Therefore, relying not on any merit of ours but solely on your kindness, we send you this letter of recommendation, hoping it will provide him with a more honorable opportunity to approach you, while also asking that you do not take offense at our presumption.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we received your letter along with the booklet by the Bishop of Winchester some time ago, for which we thank you greatly, and we will return the booklet as you instructed very soon.</p>
      <p>It is not worth writing about rumors from Italy, as the bearer of this letter, who is arriving in haste from there, will himself provide more accurate information.</p>
      <p>Farewell, distinguished man.</p>
      <p>From the ancient court of the Rhaetians, on the penultimate day of April 1536.</p>
      <p>We wish the best for M. Leo, Utinger, Pellican, and all the brothers together.</p>
      <p>A federal diet is scheduled for the fourteenth day of May, after which we will pursue our plan regarding the schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Blasius and Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
