      <p>Greetings. I do not have anything unique to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>Indeed, various and wondrous things are being reported; but I do not have anything that I can affirm with certainty yet.</p>
      <p>It is known about the gunpowder explosion, and, as I hear, the sons of the Elector Palatine do not hide that they are responsible for this and hope that they have earned merit with the princes of the empire, while they turn all the blame on the emperor, who not only allows it but also, at whose suggestion and command, these things are carried from Germany against the Germans. I have not yet heard anything about the Swiss being defeated by Monbrun. However, it is now almost universally rumored that there are great hostilities between the King of France and his brother, the King of Poland; the latter does not want to leave the kingdom except under certain conditions: 1. that he retains his principality of Anjou and all its revenues; 2. that the right of succession remains free for him and his children (if he happens to have any) in the Kingdom of France, should the king die without a male heir. There are also some other conditions of this kind. The Parisians are said to have offered him a hundred thousand crowns annually if he stays in France, and many other cities are said to do the same; for they fear that if he leaves, the Huguenots will seize everything. The king urges his departure. Someone recently coming from the court says that the king was walking alone and pensive in a garden and finally stopped; there it was heard from him that he burst out with these words, swearing by the blood of God: "He will leave, he will leave." Others say that in his absence from the city of Paris, the Parisians have surrendered to another, and thus Paris is already being occupied by him, and this has already begun to happen in other cities as well. However, nothing is certain here; these are the words of the common people, although they are also being spread among the nobles. They also say that all the armies that he was sending to Narbonne and Dauphiné against the faithful have been recalled by the king. Others affirm for certain that the King of Poland will be in Nancy by St. Martin's Day; for there are said to be great preparations to receive him.</p>
      <p>They also say that the Solothurn envoy is going there to speak with his brother Pomponius, who is also going to Poland with Angianus. Believe as much as you want. The sons of the admiral have moved to us these days with Lord Andelot, Teligny, and some others; they will live here for a while. I received letters from Geneva. We have already seen that poem about the peace of France printed in a booklet, the title of which is: Dialogue, in which many things are explained that happened to the Lutherans and French Huguenots; this booklet, if you exclude the historical parts, seems to be very seditious. Nevertheless, I thank you for sending that poem. In return, I am sending you another one sent from Wittenberg to our Coladon, which I do not know if you have seen before; you will return it after you have read it.</p>
      <p>I add to these the letters from Chur, for which I thank you, and I ask you to forgive me; for I wrote hastily, as I had many things to do at the same time.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you in return.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 7, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
