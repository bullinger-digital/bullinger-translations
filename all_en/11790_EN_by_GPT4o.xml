    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for her writing, as Bullinger will be very busy, but the necessity arose in the absence of her husband [Richard Hilles]. The reason for her writing is this: Since John Burcher requested to deposit 30 guilders with Bullinger for him, she hereby sends 21 crowns into trustworthy hands. Greetings and sending of a small gift; she availed herself of the help of her servant [Francis Warner] in composing this letter, who also sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Strasbourg, 9th May in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Greetings and progress in the Lord's vineyard. I have indeed greatly doubted whether it would be better to write anything, most esteemed sir, or not; for knowing how many and how necessary occupations always overwhelm a faithful pastor of the Christian flock, I hesitated to disturb them or to distract you from them in any way. But again, the necessity connected with my brother's benefit urged me to write, which I could hardly neglect without a mark of disgrace and ingratitude. Indeed, it sometimes seemed to me that I would have been exceedingly foolish if I thought that by remaining silent (namely by not writing) I would be showing no less disrespect to you than by writing imprudently or importunately.</p>
      <p>Therefore, relying on your kindness and not forgetting the pious duties which you have voluntarily offered and also rendered to my husband, I have taken the confidence to write a few things to you now in his absence. In this way, I hope that I may not seem to have had no regard for your most holy affairs due to my talkativeness, nor, on the other hand, should I justly be condemned for negligence or contempt due to untimely and indecorous silence.</p>
      <p>But so as not to detain you any longer, briefly accept the occasion of my letter: Recently, Johannes Burcher, our compatriot, sent to us, asking that my husband arrange for 30 guilders to be delivered to your house to be kept there for a while until he needed them. Therefore, we send you, according to his request, along with this letter, 21 crowns, which if you keep with you until the young man requests them back, you will do something both pleasing to me and most useful to him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, please greet your dearest wife in the Lord with my words, for whom you will also receive a small gift enclosed as a sign of friendship. My servant, although unknown to you by face, sends his regards to you from our household, whose assistance I have used in composing this letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your sister in Christ, Anna Hilles, Englishwoman.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and supreme pastor of the people of Zurich, these letters are delivered. In Zurich.</p>
