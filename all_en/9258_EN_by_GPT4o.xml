      <p>Last month we sent you letters, in which we abundantly indicated what is happening with us and how many competitors there are, among whom Duke Anjou is one, who in every way aspires to this kingdom, hence he has many on his side, especially from the papists, who favor him not a little. The efforts of Anjou's envoys are not obscure and have such progress that they seem to please everyone, that is, both Catholics and some of our evangelicals. However, as we wrote before, due to that nefarious French massacre, Anjou seemed to have lost hope of the kingdom itself among the patrons of our churches.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the French envoys have not ceased to give great hope to our patrons and to persuade them that Anjou can be received with the greatest good of the French churches. Therefore, it has come to the point that we propose the conditions, which we once sent to you, to them, if the matter is brought to this contention with our Catholics about Anjou and the Austrian by the papists themselves. But because we are completely ignorant of the state of the French churches and whether what our people are planning will be useful for those churches, we now, through this courier, whom we send to you and to other French, Allobrogian, and exiled churches, eagerly and expressly wish to know and earnestly ask that if it comes to that, which God forbid, but still, if it comes to that, that Anjou is seriously discussed by the papists, what our patrons should do in such an arduous matter, you would indicate and write down and advise whether with both our and those churches' benefit that Prince Anjou can be elected and accepted as our king under some favorable French conditions. Therefore, all good people expect your opinion, which they ask you to pronounce openly and freely, namely whether he can be appointed to this kingdom with the benefit of those churches. Indeed, our people would never want to admit him except with the greatest and most ample good and the most tranquil state of the French churches as well as ours. Although our people would rather do without him, yet this is proposed by our people, if perhaps they come into contention in his name with the Catholics. For indeed our people are so disposed that they would rather incline towards Anjou than the Austrian. For this reason, since no one can better indicate to you what should be decided for our patrons, about whom we spoke above, under these conditions in this matter, and we also believe that you will advise us according to your Christian candor, it is necessary that you write to us your judgment without delay. And especially, when our courier comes to you, you will give him your judgment, which he will immediately convey to the brothers in Geneva and others. You will also send and write to us the same judgment and opinion. You will take care of all these things with as much speed as possible, for the election of the new king is now in the very preparation, as you will learn from this courier. Farewell well and happily. May God defend you and your churches and also protect us.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau on the 7th day before the Kalends of April 1573. Your most devoted and observant Paul Gilowski, superintendent of the Reformed Churches of Christ in the Duchy of Zator and Oświęcim.</p>
