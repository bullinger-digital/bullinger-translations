    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter with information about the position intended for him. Points out the advantages of relocating the school from Rüti to Zurich and suggests the appointment of an administrator and a cook. The pedagogium led by Lepusculus in the Basel Predigerkloster could serve as a model. Warns, in view of the upcoming meeting, of the deceitfulness of the opponents, as he can observe in Bern how [Sebastian Meyer] and [Peter] Kunz are recently trying to obscure their doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Plans to move for the Zurzach fair and asks for information on where he should live.</p>

      <p>Greetings and a peaceful conscience through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks I can, my Bullinger, for writing to me with more certainty about the position intended for me than I have heard so far from the messengers in person. For one person has told me one thing, another something else, as each understood the matter differently.</p>
      <p>The other plan of your senators, who think the Rüti school should be moved to the city, is approved by me not only because I would prefer to be with you for the sake of theological study, but also for the many benefits to the students. For they would not only be able to hear me, but also other professors, and could be most conveniently imbued with the letters of the Old and New Testaments from early youth, as their tutor would require them to recount each day what they had observed from each lecture before going to bed. Not to mention the example of learned men, by which they would become better and not only more learned every day. Moreover, your school of the more refined letters, which I hear is almost deserted, could be made more frequented if the more advanced students were transferred from the monasteries to the city and took turns listening to Theodor, Pellicanus, Collinus, Ammianus, and me lecturing alternately on dialectics, rhetoric, and something in the New Testament, provided that a selection of listeners was made and each could hear more or fewer professors according to their capacity and could apply themselves to the exercise of writing and speaking. So much for the progress of the tutor and the boys if the Rüti school were moved to the city.</p>
      <p>As for the sustenance and management, if I were to be appointed to this school, I would very much like an administrator and a cook to be appointed, who would supply all the necessities of life for the boys and for me with my family.</p>
      <p>For I cannot bear so many cares with my very sickly little wife, who is otherwise little skilled in domestic matters. You know that a man devoted to the liberal arts should be free from such anxious cares.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my Bullinger, I would like to ask not only you but also Megander, Leo, and your other colleagues who are concerned with these matters, that you do not dissuade the Zurich senate from this plan, but rather persuade them with all your might and follow the not bad example of the people of Basel, Strasbourg, and Bern in this matter, especially the Rauracians, who have established an excellent pedagogium from the Dominican monastery equipped with everything pertaining to the study of letters and have appointed Lepusculus to it in such a way that he is occupied only with teaching in literary and piety matters and is completely free from the care of domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your aforementioned colleagues, Theodor and others who are fond of me, and be careful in the upcoming meeting with you. For whatever the logodaedali (cunning speakers) have not been able to achieve with threats and savagery, they now try to obtain with flattery, deceit, insinuations, traps, and wonderful machinations. I easily understand this from our people; for when [Sebastian Meyer] in his commentary on John 6 raged against us beyond measure and repeatedly insisted that the body of Christ is given to the faithful mind at the same moment as the bread is extended, now, together with his Kunz, he has become milder and completely silent on this matter, and to make the people more favorable to them, they have not given any exhortation at all about the Eucharist, what it is and how it should be taken, before the supper. This, however, was always done solemnly before.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, April 19, 1538.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellikanus.</p>
      <p>At the Zurzach fair, I intend to travel by ship to Brugg (God willing) with my household goods and family and then to you; therefore, help and arrange, as I trust you well, that I will be informed beforehand where I should move.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his most favorable friend and patron.</p>
