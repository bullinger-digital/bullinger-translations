    <p xml:id="regest1">Feels the frailty of old age. Received Bullinger's letter along with that of Leo Jud on June 10 through Gervasius Schuler and sees that Bullinger is aware of his letter to Jud. The reason for this was the heretic judgment of some scholars [about Schwenckfeld], yet he accepts the admonition to let such questions rest and is pleased that Bullinger firmly adheres to Zwingli's [understanding of the Lord's Supper]. Has settled in Konstanz in the house of [Johannes] Zwick and his wife; sends greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna]. Sends a booklet that he received from Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ from God, along with my Christian love and loyalty, be with you.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious, beloved lord and brother, I would be delighted to hear of your health and well-being and that of all your dear relatives. As for me, my condition due to my age is like that of the moon; now it increases, soon it decreases, so it is with me, sometimes weak and sick, then better again. Yet I let myself be sincerely and well contented by God with thanks and praise, etc.</p>
      <p>Especially beloved lord, your friendly, Christian, and entirely brotherly letter was delivered to me on June 10 by Master Gervasius Schuler, along with the letter of my dear lord and godfather Master Leo Jud, which I read and understood well, as my godfather Master Leo Jud has also opened or read my letter to you, etc.</p>
      <p>Faithful, dear lord, you should know that it is not due to the judgment of many learned men, which I have read, that I am accused of heresy, which is why I wrote to my dear lord and godfather, as mentioned above. Since this has also reached your love and you have written to me so very fatherly and admonished me in Christian love and loyalty to let such matters rest in view of my age, I can see that this advice is good. I can also understand that if I strive to do right by God's house and diligently and faithfully heed His great grace, to remain steadfast in faith and true patience until the end with my God, you would not expect more from me, nor demand any account from me regarding the actions and omissions of others. Therefore, I highly appreciate your love and loyalty towards me, as I am well satisfied and content with your letter. And that you are of no other opinion regarding the sacrament than you have always been, which greatly rejoices me; for I have always believed that our pious Zwingli's service in word and truth has pleased the Lord, and his teaching will stand the test. May God grant him and all believers a joyful resurrection from bodily death.</p>
      <p>My faithful, dear lord, praying to God for me, as I do for you; to Him we are entrusted in time and eternity, to preserve you with healthy long life, for the edification of His Christian community. I have settled here with our pious Doctor Zwick, who, along with his honorable wife, shows all loyalty and love, as if I were their son or father; to the faithful God be praise and thanks, who has so graciously provided for me in my old age and surrounded me with Christian, pious, faithful, godly people, may God be their eternal reward. Pray, please praise and thank God with me for His grace. Please convey my greetings to your Christian wife diligently and faithfully in the Lord and hold it in good regard for me.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a booklet, which was sent to me from Augsburg by my host. If it pleases you, I would be glad to know.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, on Wednesday, August 20, 1539. Your entirely willing faithful brother.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm von Zell.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, etc., my especially gracious, esteemed lord and brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
