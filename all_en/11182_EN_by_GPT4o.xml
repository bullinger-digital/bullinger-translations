    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains that he was not treated more amicably during his visit; that among the theologians, strife prevails instead of love, which complicates their confrontation with the actual opponents, a confrontation that urgently needs to be conducted right now, and this will not go unpunished. Thanks for [Bullinger's "De scripturae sanctae authoritate"]. Recommends Otto [Werdm√ºller], whom the Wittenbergers give a good testimonial.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From the many letters received and sent, I had indeed thought myself to be not just an ordinary friend to you, but almost like a family member, or even something greater if it can be said; however, in person, I was treated no differently than someone known only by face and a conversation or two, and this pained me, not so much because of you, but because of my own imprudence. Well, the Lord has willed me to be such until now, that is, most imprudent; may He help, I pray, henceforth, so that I do not stray so recklessly.</p>
      <p>Our spirits should be fervent in love for the Lord; for we are teachers of love, and behold, we are vexed by quarrels. What have we to do with quarrels if we are ministers of Christ? We know how to say: "Where there is no love, there is no church." Why then do we present ourselves as leaders of the church as long as the pursuit of love is lacking among us? We lack what I cannot give; may the Lord, I pray, grant it and indeed soon, for we have need. Satan will soon bring forth what he has long been plotting, and now indeed he has begun boldly. He has prepared those who will defend his attempt with books, and he has gathered, as far as I can see, minds not to be entirely despised; for even if they speak less truthfully, they speak plausibly enough to deceive. Meanwhile, the appellation of heretics so fills the ears of the people that, even if someone tries henceforth, they cannot eradicate it. Hence, the gospel of Jesus Christ will perish from the mouths of the pious. Indeed, I think our ingratitude is to blame, as we, taught in faith, do nothing with our strength to prove it lives in us. God has never endured such ingratitude for long. Therefore, if we truly embraced love, we would already be consulting together on how to confront the council freely, removing such impudent writers; otherwise, each acts according to his own will, and thus things will eventually come to a bad end. But I speak in vain about this matter, as no one is less suited to such arduous tasks.</p>
      <p>I thank you for that great gift of yours. May the Lord repay you; for there is nothing in me that can be returned equally.</p>
      <p>Here is Otto for you, a young man to whom the Wittenbergers attribute both learning and honesty of life. You will do a service if you embrace him as closely as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours, Theodor and Pellican, in the Lord. Basel, June 18, 1538.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his venerable in the Lord.</p>
