      <p>Greetings. From the letters of our Beza, you will understand how inclined the princes have been to send envoys for the purpose of intercession: and how generously they have offered their services. There was a bit more difficulty with the people of our order.</p>
      <p>They are displeased, of course, with the nocturnal meetings: as if it were free for the brothers oppressed by such harsh tyranny to choose convenient hours for themselves. A confession was also sought, in which you will see that our brothers have openly professed what they feel. At least they did not dissimulate in embracing the doctrine, from which they seemed to have deviated somewhat before you, and what you feared, that they might be bound to Brentius, Merpachius, and the like, has been dispelled. Indeed, they understand that they do not have agreement with all the French churches.</p>
      <p>Even though they still stubbornly cling to their errors, some have been softened, so there is hope that if a friendly conversation is once had, they might be persuaded. However, I am not led by this confidence to think that we should come if they invite us: but I follow other reasons, which I have explained to you.</p>
      <p>As for what you mention, that nothing is permitted to you without the consent of the magistrate: do you think me so rash and devoid of humanity, that I would disdain those with whom we are joined by a sacred and indissoluble bond divinely, so that we may act together with common efforts? But I do not think we are held so servilely bound, that we may not discuss familiarly what is most expedient for the common good of the church. What I wrote, I repeat again, if we refuse, nothing can be objected with any color, in my judgment, that this is not a shameful and dishonorable evasion.</p>
      <p>If perhaps it seems otherwise to you, I am sorry that in a common cause our opinions differ so. But neither will your most illustrious senate, as I hope, reject the meeting if it is offered, nor will it be through you that they do not show themselves willing to remove this unfortunate dissension and seek peace, who desire to see the church tranquil. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother most worthy of my respect.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord sustain you all with His strength, protect you with His defense, and govern you with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 15, 1557. I believe something has already been accomplished in Bern regarding the alliance. Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and brother worthy of my respect, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
