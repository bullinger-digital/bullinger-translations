      <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, the savior of the whole world, bless your excellency and all your people and keep you from all evil. Illustrious man, noble count and lord, to be honored with the highest respect, I hope that my last letter, which I wrote to your excellency at the end of August, was delivered in good faith. Certainly, I received your excellency's letter dated September promptly and I am particularly pleased that our response to Brentius's Testament was not displeasing to your piety.</p>
      <p>Now, I am sending this booklet, which I have attached to this letter, and I ask that your excellency kindly receive it and read it at your leisure. In it, I respond in some way to the question proposed to me by your excellency about the substance of original sin, although I have discussed original sin more diligently and copiously in my Decades, Decade 3, Sermon 10. As far as I can judge from present circumstances, I clearly see that we will never reach a certain and full understanding of the saving doctrine if we listen to those theologians who continually propose new speculations about matters of religion.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the apostle predicted that such people would arise in the church, who would continually forge new doctrines that provide questions rather than the edification of God, which is through faith, and who are always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. And since the same apostle added: "Separate yourself from those who are like this," I certainly leave their questions, which they daily invent, to be determined by themselves, and I rest in the simple apostolic doctrine, which has long been clearly revealed and known to us. And I encourage your excellency to do the same. The doctrine of our salvation in Christ has been clearly explained and known to us; let us persevere in it and express and adorn our faith in Christ with holiness of life and works of mercy or charity, to whom be honor, praise, and glory forever and ever. I am brief in writing because I know that my dearest brothers and fellow ministers have sent more extensive letters to your excellency; I did not want to double the trouble. May the Lord Jesus bless your excellency and all your people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your excellency's most devoted Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
