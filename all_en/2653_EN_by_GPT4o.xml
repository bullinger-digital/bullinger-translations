      <p>The issue of the oath of allegiance is back on the table; my lords do not refuse to swear, but only according to their faith by God alone; the other Confederates do not want to accept this. This greatly burdens my lords, be aware, they will write to your lords, as well as to Bern and Basel, by Sunday or Monday, and urge them, for the sake of God's honor, not to deviate from them, since we are of the same religion. However, nothing has been decided yet; but pay attention to whether the envoys come to you or not; you will hear about it from good friends; whether they come or not, the matter stands as follows: The Confederates mean that one should swear according to the custom of the cantons, namely by God and the saints, and the envoy from Zurich should give the oath uniformly in all churches; if he does not want to do it, the one from Bern should do it, if not, then the one from Lucerne should do it.</p>
      <p>Here my lords are not burdened by not giving the oath; they are willing to yield for the sake of peace, preserving their rights, and allow another, like the one from Lucerne, to give the oath by God and the saints in all places where the gospel is not, and do not want to force the other places to a different form of the oath than what is customary with them, and are willing to be completely satisfied with that and have no conflict, but that, as has been the custom from old times, the one from Bern gives the oath in Zurich and only by God and not by the saints, and likewise Zurich gives the oath to Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen only by God and not by the saints. The other places do not want this, they mean that since Zurich gives the oath in everyone's name, the common form should be used; whoever wants to invoke the saints may do so; if not, no one in evangelical places should be forced to do so. To this, my lords mean that if we swear here, those in Bern, Basel, and you in Schaffhausen, swear for yourselves, as in other places, each community for itself, where everyone should be allowed to remain by their faith and be bound by their faith. That they want to let their own swear against our religion by the saints, they do not want.</p>
      <p>The places also do not ask that in their churches the oath be given only by God and that their own be allowed to swear in this way. Moreover, if one should not adopt it, why should one undertake it? Thereby one sees that they want to force us alone to this, so that they can say, before we said in the peace of the land, they have the old true faith, now we must let the form of the oath by the saints be given to us in our churches, etc. But this will do no small harm to our religion and lead to other consequences that are unbearable for us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my lords mean that if one wants to seek peace, one should let everyone swear by their faith; for in faith one cannot and should not be forced as in other matters. The oath is not a small matter for us. Iuramentum est religionis obtestatio and the bond and pledge of religion, not only of external things.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is not a trifle, as some think, or what lies in a word; the word encompasses the whole faith.</p>
      <p>We have the command that the oath should be by the name of the Lord alone, and that this is the glory of God, Deut. 6. 10. Exodus 20. Psalm 63.</p>
      <p>Isaiah 45. 65. Jeremiah 4. Again, we have the prohibition that no one should swear by the names of those who are not gods, Exodus 23. Joshua 23. Jeremiah 5. Zephaniah 1.</p>
      <p>The oath is a testimony of what we confess to be the highest good, the highest truth, and the searcher of hearts; if we join the saints, we equate them with God and also acknowledge the saints as our highest good.</p>
      <p>The oath is a confession of who can save and destroy. We say: so help me God. If we add and the saints, we confess that these are also helpers, etc.</p>
      <p>The oath is like an invocation of the divine name. We say: Thus I ask that God help me. If you add: and the saints, you have invoked the saints together with God, denied the true religion.</p>
      <p>The saints themselves consider it blasphemy if what is due to God is attributed to them, Acts 14. It appears in Paul, torn clothes, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if we swear by the saints, we do what displeases them. Here and from other things it appears to us to move/admonish? for serious reasons, not to admit such an oath. There will also be little luck in it; otherwise, it would be friendly, otherwise, it will cause much conflict; one will swear, the other not, etc.</p>
      <p>To the preachers in Schaffhausen, June 14, 1555.</p>
