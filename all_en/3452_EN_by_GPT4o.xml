      <p>The one who had promised me to send the chests and luggage, which I had left in ZÃ¼rich, did not keep his word. For this reason, I was forced to send this one of mine, who would take care of it, whom I did not want to send without my letter to you, to testify to my respect and devotion towards you (which you will always recognize as most devoted to you). I would also ask that, if there is any delay with my luggage, you assist him with advice and help, so that no further delay is applied and they reach me. I gave him the keys, so that there is no suspicion among the customs officers that there is anything in the chests other than furniture necessary for my use and that of my family, and absolutely no money or currency. I am sending you poems composed among our Savoyards when there was only a rumor about our war, which I had forgotten to recite to you. We hear that in Piedmont and in Italy everything is going quite well for us, but I fear the outcome, as the Lord usually mocks the plans of the powerful and suppresses pride. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, all friends.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
