      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am sending you the second book of "Convivial Questions," in which the principal examples of fornication, adultery, treason, theft, and the impious lives of wicked men, of whom there is a great multitude in Germany, including the impious lives of priests, are criticized.</p>
      <p>I have sprinkled in examples taken from histories, so that the book is less suspect. In Heidelberg, a mass was held by an 18-year-old monk. Present were the Count Palatine and the Countess Palatine, who offered. Then the preacher stood up and said: "Our gracious lord has accepted the Interim; but I have not accepted it, nor will I accept it. It is not his place to judge in this matter." Thus, seditions are stirred up in all places.</p>
      <p>Dominus Michael, an Augustinian monk, preached for a long time in Speyer. When the Emperor came, he fled to Mainz, where he was almost stabbed in the church by the Spaniards; for a priest had reported him as a Lutheran monk, misleading many people.</p>
      <p>It is said for certain that Duke Albrecht was captured by the Saxon cities when he wanted to ride into Poland, and his people were severely defeated. This is the punishment for perjury.</p>
      <p>The Emperor took the Elector and the Hessian with him from Speyer. The Elector did not want to shake hands with the Hessian when the Hessian rode to his carriage, saying: "Kiss you, false little cat."</p>
      <p>As for the situation in Strasbourg, God knows. It was bad enough; for 48 citizens, and the richest ones, have left, many from the council, the mayors, and others.</p>
      <p>Two pipers from Solothurn were found in a brothel, each having brought a prostitute home with him to keep house. They say the prostitutes are most shameless. Thus do the papists usually act.</p>
      <p>The Swiss cities are said to have won two battles against the Imperial forces. Also, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is said to have suffered great damage. The English, Danes, and those from Sweden are said to be allying with the Swiss cities; then we will see divine power against the enemies of the Gospel. Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is said to be wounded and captured; Lady Maria is said to have died of grief in a convent.</p>
      <p>The people of Ghent, when their governor died in the castle, buried him in a convent; the citizens took the castle and killed those in the castle.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Emperor is moved to travel down the Rhine, to prevent some plots. We will see miraculous works. The people of Valencia, a large city between Antwerp and Paris, are said to have defected from the Emperor to the French because of the cruel inquisition in matters of faith; they have killed all the priests and monks.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has removed his artillery from the roads to Speyer; I think he intends to transport it by ship down the river.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have given the Emperor their largest cannons and repeated ammunition; it is said to be worth 14,000 florins. They rode after the Emperor to escape the Interim. I fear they will not remain steadfast; for Christ will not be with the merchants.</p>
      <p>I sent a selection and letters to Zimpert of Schaffhausen; I do not doubt that you have received them, or, if he has not yet sent them, demand them from that negligent man in handling the affairs of friends.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
