    <p xml:id="regest1">Through Erasmus Ritter, he has heard with joy that the dispute [over the catechism] in Bern has been settled. Luther's conciliatory response [to the reformed cities of the Confederation] also makes him hopeful; contrary to the intention of the people of Zurich to send a separate letter to Luther, in Konstanz they would prefer a joint approach by the Confederates. The death of Jakob [Windner] is a heavy loss for the church in Konstanz. He sends a poem about a terrible event and points to the recently appeared comet. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>I hear that the dispute among the people of Bern has been beautifully settled, dearest Bullinger; for I received this news from Erasmus Ritter himself, which brings me great joy. For what is more pestilent than the dissensions of brothers?</p>
      <p>From this, Luther's response to you also gives me hope for better things, as he very amicably promises to embrace you with singular affection, having set aside his rancor. For in such goodwill of minds, all Christian concord seems to me to consist. For what kind of concord, I ask, will there be, which has come together with dissenting minds? - however desirable and beautiful a thing concord may otherwise be. I hear, however, that the church of Zurich is privately going to respond to Luther with something unknown. This plan does not please some good people among us; for it is fitting to freely share our fraternal thoughts with each other. They think it more advisable that none of your churches respond privately, but that all respond together. For one cause, one people deserves one and the same response; thus you will more easily avoid danger, and unanimity among yourselves will be more certainly preserved.</p>
      <p>There is no news with us, except that the Lord has taken from us Jakob, the parish priest of St. John's, by a death indeed not untimely, but which harms the church unless we find a successor equally learned and pious.</p>
      <p>I send you here a marvelous tragedy described in verse, by which we are taught how the Lord is to be invoked, lest he lead us into temptation. You have seen the comet casting long rays; what it portends, the Lord will teach us.</p>
      <p>Would that it be for our good!</p>
      <p>Now, my Bullinger, farewell for a very long time in the Lord with your wife, mother, children, and all brothers. February 28, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, my dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
