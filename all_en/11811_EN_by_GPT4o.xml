    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger wrote a letter in June [No. 1753], but he does not know if it has arrived, as the messenger was unknown to him. In it, he expressed his gratitude for the way the people of Zurich welcomed him, a stranger, so warmly, and he has no doubt that they will continue to support him, especially in theological matters. Furthermore, he asked Bullinger to vouch for him for at least half a year with Christoph Froschauer, so that Froschauer would bring the books he requested to the next fair in Frankfurt and hand them over to the Wittenberg bookseller Johannes [...]; he wishes for all of Bullinger's printed writings, the recently published Bible ["Biblia sacrosancta"], as well as the works of [Konrad] Pellikan, but he is willing to temporarily forgo the latter. Additionally, some students have requested a list of works by Bullinger and other [Swiss Reformers], as it is forbidden for Wittenberg booksellers to bring such writings to Wittenberg; Hentius is eager to repay Bullinger's efforts - in whatever way possible. He sends greetings to all, especially [Theodor] Bibliander, to whom he apologizes for not having written.</p>

      <p>Greetings and in Christ, our Savior, peace, etc.</p>
      <p>I sent you a letter in June, but I am unsure if it has been delivered, as the messenger was completely unknown to me and could not confidently promise whether it could be delivered to you or not. The content and main point of that letter was an expression of gratitude, because everyone, both those to whom I was recommended and those to whom I was not, received me, an unknown and unlearned man, with all humanity. Furthermore, I was greatly assisted by all of you in matters that were necessary for me to know and worthy of understanding, and I have no doubt that you will continue to assist me in the future, especially in theological matters, in which I have recognized you, the Zurich preachers, as high priests. Therefore, writing the same now, I wish to express the same as I did in the previous letter. It would indeed have been proper not only to have gratitude for such great benefits towards me but also to repay it generously; however, there is no doubt, as the situation does not allow or, as the poet says, my will, when my strength is lacking, that you will praise and consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I asked you, honorable man, in my previous letter, to assist me with your and other most learned men's works in such a way that you would vouch for me with your godfather, Christoph Froschauer, for at least half a year, and that he would bring them to the next Frankfurt fair, which is held on the feast of Bartholomew, and deliver them to a certain Johannes, a bookseller in Wittenberg, who would bring them to me. Whatever he demands for all these, I mean all your writings that you have published, along with the Bible, which was published during Lent of this current year, I will send in good faith by the defined time, namely by the feast of George, with a certain and faithful messenger. I would indeed wish for the works of Konrad Pellikan to be sent to me as well; however, so that you do not think I desire many things that are impossible for me to obtain, I have decided to forgo them for now; yet I do not doubt that I will have the works of the same man, if I live.</p>
      <p>Moreover, some students have asked me to request from you a catalog of all the principal works of men, so that, having seen this, they may ensure that the books they most need are brought at certain times of the year when the Frankfurt fairs are held, for it is forbidden for Wittenberg booksellers to openly bring any of your works to Wittenberg.</p>
      <p>Therefore, so that many students, indeed, do not lack your and other orthodox writers' works, I ask and earnestly beseech you to kindly send me a written catalog; where I can reciprocate your kindness, in whatever matter, together with the rest of the students, I promise my diligent service.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Given in Wittenberg, on the third day before the calends of August in the year of the Virgin's birth 1543.</p>
      <p>Martin Hentius, most devoted to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone, especially Theodor Bibliander, and excuse me for not having sent him any letters, also Christoph Froschauer, and Gwalther, Master Otto Werthm√ºller, etc.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, always honorable lord and friend.</p>
