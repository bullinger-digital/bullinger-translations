      <p> Most beloved godfather in the Lord, I congratulate you and your fellow ministers, the most learned and faithful athletes of Christ, on the comfort of the excellent elders, Mr. Bernardino and Peter Martyr, with which the Lord, in His benevolence, deigns to relieve your labors and cares, and to adorn your church, school, and republic. Thus, for one Pellican of pious memory, who for a long time adorned your church with his mere presence, you now have two illustrious and distinguished elders, through whom the loss of the former is compensated with a splendid surplus. I pray to the Lord that this happiness may be long-lasting for you. </p>
      <p> Regarding the affairs of our Germany, I do not doubt that more is written to you by friends than to me. For just as I rarely write to others, so others in turn write to me very rarely, except for Mekard, the minister of the Augsburg church, who wrote the following two days ago: "Our army, with a bloody victory, liberated Siget, a most fortified stronghold, from the siege of the Turks, where in the first encounter there was a dangerous fight due to the fleeing Hungarians and some other men of that nation. However, the steadfast and very brave virtue of the Germans finally routed the Turks, and those who had fled before began to fight again and gained victory. In this conflict, Bolwil, the supreme captain of Ferdinand, left his own brother dead with the noblest of the nobles, and he himself barely escaped with a pierced foot. On the ninth of this month, we received letters that almost the entire Turkish army was defeated by ours. Today, Johannes Fugger departs with 50 horsemen to aid Ferdinand the Younger, King of Hungary. Johannes Walther of Hirnheym, with 500 horsemen at the expense of the Roman king, the Elector of Saxony sent 2000 most noble horsemen to Ferdinand at his own expense last week. The supreme captain Ferdinand the Younger already has an army of 7000 horsemen prepared," etc. If you have anything further through our most beloved godfather Mr. Haller, let me know, especially about England and Poland. Farewell excellently. Greet your entire household in my name and that of mine, and your fellow ministers, the most beloved lords and brothers. </p>
      <p> Bern, 25th of August, 1556. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most beloved godfather in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich. </p>
