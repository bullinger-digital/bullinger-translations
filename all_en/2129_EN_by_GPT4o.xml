      <p>Celio Secondo Curione through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>When Hieronymus Massarius, now a doctor of medicine, our most beloved brother in the Lord, was coming to you, I did not want him to come without a letter from me to you; for although there was nothing particularly important to write to you, I preferred to write even this rather than to interrupt this most pleasant duty of conversing between us, especially with you, with whom I converse as willingly as I can, more than with anyone else. This is due to your love for me and, in turn, my love for you, which I feel growing more every day. You have demonstrated your love for me with great and numerous proofs, both often in the past and recently when you received me, as I was setting out to meet your daughter and then returning with her and her husband, with gifts, hospitality, and kindness as if I were one of your closest relatives. I have not yet been able to demonstrate my love for you with any distinguished proof; for you neither needed it nor, due to your modesty, wished to test it. But if you were to allow it, you would find a man not only most devoted and loving but also most respectful of you, furthermore mindful of your merits towards him, faithful, sincere, and above all, obedient to you. I speak to you at length about this because I see you almost deliberately avoiding giving me any task or recommendation. Your son Heinrich was here, setting out for Strasbourg; I was completely unaware of this, which would not have been the case if you had instructed him to show himself to me or to indicate his presence in any way. To confess to you frankly, this troubled me not a little. When I heard this, I began to examine myself thoroughly to see if I had offended you by deed or word or even by a nod, or if I had somehow unknowingly violated our friendship, and although I found nothing, I could not and cannot remove the scruple from my mind unless I see you using me and my affairs as familiarly and freely as I have used yours. I remember recommending some of our people to you, whom you treated with every kind of humanity. I do not mention my Horatius, whom I did not want to set out for Italy without greeting you and being instructed by your salutary advice. Therefore, my dearest and most respected brother, I beg and implore you, if in any way I have harmed our old friendship, which could have happened not out of intent but through imprudence, do not hide it from me, but, as is fitting between friends and brothers, reveal it freely, lest by concealing the wound, the limb should fester. If you do this, I will try to make amends to you completely. But leaving these matters aside, I thank you for the little book and also for the letters, in which you carefully wrote down what seemed noteworthy to you in our dialogues on the greatness of the kingdom of God; for you have provided me with the opportunity to say more, to correct, to change, and to refute. Therefore, I confess that I owe you much for this reason. But I will end my writing to you here this year and pray to God, the Father of Jesus Christ, that the coming year may dawn peaceful, fruitful, and prosperous for you, your children, your wife, your relatives, your friends, the church, and your city. My wife, all the children, and friends, and especially Martin Borrhaus, our rector, a truly good man, send you their best wishes. Farewell, my best and most esteemed brother, and please lovingly greet your three most humane and learned sons-in-law along with their wives, and your other children and family members for me. Basel, the fourth day before the calends of January 1553.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor and overseer of the church of Zürich, most dear and respected lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
