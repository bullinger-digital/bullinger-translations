      <p>Greetings. I received your letters at almost the same time and, along with the latter, a package of some unknown items, which I promptly arranged to be sent to Herr Stettner in the fortress through his people, as you will understand from the letters he is now sending. Since there is no doubt that he will also write to you about other matters, such as what will happen at the assembly, and about a certain very strong fortress recovered from the Swedes, he relieves me of that task, and quite conveniently so. For when my student here goes to Konstanz, the homeland of both of us, from there to you...</p>
