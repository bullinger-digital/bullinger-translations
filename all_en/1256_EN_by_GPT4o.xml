      <p> Greetings. The day before yesterday, I received your letter sent through Elias Mörikofer and I thank you greatly, not only on his behalf but on behalf of all of us, for the kindness shown to him, which he praises highly about all of you. As for the council, as you write, it seems that France will not send anyone. My lords have sent an envoy to the king, the standard-bearer Tilger, who has returned these days; he confirms this and also says that the king personally spoke with him about this and is well aware of the emperor's schemes. However, I hear nothing about France having a separate council; he also does not intend to hear about it. It is said for certain, and it is also written from Augsburg: the pope has sent a legate to the emperor in Augsburg to inform him that the time for the council is too short, therefore he desires to extend it from the first of May to the Greek calends, i.e., that nothing will come of it. Otherwise, I have nothing new about the council. We intend to help ourselves here with the disputation; if someone comes to us with the Holy Scripture, they will be given a good answer; for thus it is written and the decision of the disputation is made. </p>
      <p> May God keep us in His grace. Amen. Musculus has started well; but soon misfortune struck. His wife, who was quite advanced in pregnancy, fell down the stairs as if she were in labor; as a result, she had a flow for four days; the child died within her, with much pain and suffering, after she had been in severe labor pains for two days and nights, it was expelled from her; it was a son, buried yesterday. She is, thank God, strong and fresh again. He also has a sick child, David; it is suspected to be a fever. I and my household are, thank God, in good health. Today we have a big wedding here, young Wilhelm von Diesbach with the daughter of young Hans Rudolf von Erlach; there is much nobility here. Herr Ambrosius im Hoff has become the governor in Baden, a fine, friendly, evangelical, brave man, whom I wished for above all; I am pleased for him. In Lausanne, however, several have died, which has caused the French to close the gap again. Corderius and Jacobus Valerius are imprisoned according to their breach. It is expected that the lectures will soon be suspended; thus Zoller and Bindschedler are to return. </p>
      <p> Florianus Susliga, the Pole, has come here these days, a remarkable impostor. Astonishing things about him were told to us by Antonius Schorus from Antwerp, a very learned man, who is now in Lausanne and was familiar with him in Heidelberg and Strasbourg. He also wanted to borrow money from me; when I refused to lend him any, he left the inn without saying goodbye, meanwhile proclaiming mountains of gold. Beware of him. This year he has traveled all over Italy, even Rome, after France and Spain. </p>
      <p> Herr Jacob Zorn was once again rejected by my lords; he found other feudal lords, the young lords of Diesbach, who appointed him to the parish of Worb. My lords confirmed it without any examination, based on the recommendation he had from Zürich. This is what I have now; you will consider everything favorably. Bern, April 27, 1551. </p>

      <p> Before I closed this, it happened that I came into conversation with Lord Tilger, the tetrarch; he confirmed that everything is as I wrote, and furthermore, that the king himself said orally that he knows well that the emperor intends to separate the Confederates through the means of the council; for he cannot achieve it in any other way than concerning religion. If he then brings the Confederates together, he will not fear him. Therefore, he does not want the council at all and has agreed with England not to send anyone there. Scotland is also in his hand, and nothing will be done without him. The pope has also not only not allowed him to do so but has also urged him to do so; for the pope also senses the emperor's schemes. He also said that he has urged him that the Confederates, regardless of religion, should not leave each other, they are one; so he not only wants to give them his goods but also his own person. This he said, which I wanted to add here. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and venerable godfather. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
