      <p>Greetings and blessings. I read your letter, godfather and brother, not without the greatest sorrow, not because I was unaware of these things until now and am only now being informed, but because the repeated mention of that miserable state, not only ours but of all of Switzerland, brings it back to my attention and presents it for contemplation. But what can we, who are ministers of Christ and the churches, do in such great dangers? We can commend the public welfare to the most powerful and merciful God and always offer prayers and supplications to Him, but most importantly, we must steadfastly continue in our duty like Jeremiah, who himself did not experience better times. Let us therefore continue to accuse crimes and criminals, exhort everyone to repentance, and advocate true faith in Christ. Long ago, I learned from experience that the ministry can hardly survive where avarice (sacrilegious) plunders public and ecclesiastical wealth, and I believe that those who began the Reformation by exposing ecclesiastical wealth to hypocrites and teaching that tithes and other ecclesiastical tributes could not be demanded or paid by any right, sinned gravely at the beginning of the Reformation. But it is in vain to complain about these things now.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repair the damages inflicted on the church! If you need a faithful minister, we will send one or two. Johannes Willing taught in Ulm, who also previously taught in Rhaetia; I fear he will soon be expelled by the Lutheran doctor Ludwig Rabe; another good man, Johannes Gast, has been expelled and is looking for a place to serve; therefore, write back about what hope remains.</p>
      <p>Greet Philipp Gallizian and the consuls and Pontasella.</p>
      <p>Yesterday was a French day in Baden for the 11 places, where the king's servants are to be requested. There is discord among the places; for some want to go out of the union and separate from the king, etc. But it is a trick to obtain money; the devil has advised us of this misfortune.</p>
      <p>This deplorable corruption and shameful wickedness will not last long, etc. Farewell. I could hardly write this.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 13, 1558.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Valentin Winckler, whose letter I received; thank him on my behalf, etc. If I can do anything for his benefit, I will gladly do it.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his most esteemed and beloved lord and godfather. Chur.</p>
      <p>To Hans Schmid in Chur at St. Martin.</p>
