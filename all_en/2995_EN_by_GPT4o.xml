      <p>Greetings and peace. I confess that I owe much to your piety, for you have so diligently advocated not only our cause but also that of the Church of Christ, not only with Mr. Musculus but also with Mr. Gesner, my esteemed teacher, so that we might have their opinions on the matter which Menno and similar people are trying to make controversial and doubtful among us. It cannot be expressed how many pious and learned men among us have been cheered by the writings of both men.</p>
      <p>You will deign to give thanks here in the name of all of us. Your apologetic exposition is highly approved by all the pious, who eagerly await your homilies on the Apocalypse. We live here not without great danger of wars; for our neighbor, the Count of Rietberg, Lord of Essen, attempted to seize some lands from this jurisdiction this summer. Because our princes do not tolerate this and see that dealing with him legally has been in vain so far, the matter seems likely to erupt into a bloody war, unless the Lord prevents it. Our people have enlisted a not-to-be-despised army. He seems to rely on foreign troops. I pray that you will commend our churches to the Lord God in your prayers. Mr. Johannes Utenhovius is meeting with Mr. Johannes a Lasco in Poland, a journey I wish to be good for them and useful for the Church of God.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, most vigilant bishop. May the Lord God also preserve your church there. Amen.</p>
      <p>Norden, 24 August 1556.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
