      <p>Greetings and Peace. Your letter, most esteemed friend, dated the 23rd of August last, was received by me two months ago through your nephew Rodolphus Zwingli, who, as I hear, is now studying in [Cambridge]. Rodolphus Gwalther is pursuing studies in [Cambridge]: both were here in London on the 15th of December last, not long after they arrived in England from Nordwijk, located in Emden in East Frisia.</p>
      <p>They ensured that your letters, which you mentioned, were delivered to certain most reverend bishops of our country: namely, they first delivered those to Lord John Parkhurst in Nordwijk, and then to the Bishop of London, and afterwards they took care to deliver all the rest to the bishops to whom you yourself addressed them. Whether your Rodolphus approached the Bishop of Ely or not, and presented your letters to him, I do not know. Furthermore, on the sixteenth day of the aforementioned December, your Rodolphus and Rodolphus Gwalther received from me here in London, for necessary uses, a loan of the value of eleven florins and eleven batzes of German currency, calculated at fifteen batzes per florin, to be repaid at the next Frankfurt fair through your friend Mr. Christopher Froschauer. My son Gerson Hilles, who came with them from Frankfurt to Emden, also lent them the value of thirty florins and batzes of German currency. They promised to repay this sum at the aforementioned Lenten fair to my son Barnabas Hilles, or to my servant Robert Mascall, through the same Mr. Froschauer; about which repayment (as also about the repayment of the aforementioned eleven florins and eleven batzes) I have no doubt. However, certainly, as you will be able to understand from the letters you received from me in October (as I recently understand from the letters of Mr. Rodolphus Gwalther, dated the 16th of the same month in Zurich), I wrote to your piety that it would be more beneficial for you, I mean for you and Mr. Gwalther, if you would first arrange for your money, which you wish to be paid here in England to the two aforementioned young men, to be counted in Frankfurt, so that I can later pay them the value of the same here.</p>
      <p>I received the very beautiful booklet on the authority of Scripture and the Church, which you sent me, and I thank you for your kindness.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to Mr. Rodolphus Gwalther the elder in my name: and thank him (you may say) for writing to me about the sign that was seen in the sun among you on the penultimate day of September: it may indeed happen, as he himself thought, that it will eventually be followed by an uncommon example of divine vengeance on the unfortunate and unrepentant world. I am indeed sorry that Mr. Rodolphus Gwalther was so afflicted by an acute and burning fever last summer, which distressed him so much that he began to doubt his life. But I rejoice that God had mercy on him, restoring him to health and to the Church, so that after his illness he can rightly say with the holy prophet David, I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. Nor do I doubt at all that he will ensure that whatever money I have now entrusted to his aforementioned son Rodolphus, namely the aforementioned sum of eleven florins and the same number of batzes, will be faithfully repaid to me at the next Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>But I ask you, Lord Bullinger, by the Lord, not to take it too harshly that I am now writing my letters to you and to Mr. Gwalther jointly; and not separately to either of you. For it is now very troublesome for me (of which I am certainly much ashamed) to write letters in Latin, and I write very slowly; so that now I can hardly write as many letters in two hours as I could once dispatch in half an hour in my youth. But blessed be the Lord my God in all things and at all times - at all times and always, whether in prosperity or in adversity! Amen.</p>
      <p>It would indeed be fair if at least some of the paternal wealth were to pass to the rightful heirs of Lord John Butler. But since he himself sold all his patrimony here, and according to the laws and common law of the kingdom of England granted and confirmed the same to our native buyer and his heirs, or (as our lawyers or legal experts barbarously speak) assured and gave seisin, that is, legal possession, there remains no hope that the heirs of the said Lord Butler (especially those born outside the kingdom of England from a non-English woman) can recover that sold patrimony, or any part of it, by English law (as our lawyers speak) or repossess it, as far as I can understand or learn. Therefore, Henry Butler must have patience, and in this case not have hope against hope.</p>
      <p>Since I last wrote to you in August, I have received no letters to you, nor to Mr. Rodolphus Gwalther, from the reverend lords bishops, nor from any other learned men (as far as I remember). But if they now wish to write to you through my aforementioned servant Robert, who is, God willing, to set sail from here towards Hamburg this February, I hope my son Barnabas can very well carry those letters from Hamburg to Frankfurt for you to the aforementioned Mr. Froschauer.</p>
      <p>I suppose you have heard that the Duke of Norfolk of our country was recently accused of the crime of treason; and on the sixteenth day of January, he was publicly sentenced to death by the peers of the kingdom of England, according to the custom of the same kingdom in judging such crimes. Among other crimes, which (as I hear) he committed, this was one of many: that he sent a large sum of money to one of the two earls who was a rebel in the northern part of England two years ago, and took up arms against our most serene queen. Shortly, it is said, he will be beheaded here in London, as he deserves. May God grant him grace, that he may repent from his heart for his ingratitude and much iniquity, which he committed against God the best and greatest, and against the royal majesty! Recently, two men here were punished with death for their impious crimes, who among other things also conspired to kill Mr. William Cecil, Baron of Burghley, the principal secretary of the royal majesty, as one of them confessed at the gallows. God, through His providence, brought the whole matter to light before that nefarious crime was carried out.</p>
      <p>Farewell. And may the best and greatest God preserve you for the promotion of His glory and for the edification of His Church for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>London, the 18th day of February, in the year 1571. Yours as you know, Hilles, merchant.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend, these will be delivered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
