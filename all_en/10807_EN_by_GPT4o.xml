      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Here you have, beloved brothers, our thoughts, which we have further elaborated on the articles. We know nothing more useful at this time, nor do we wish to add more, as we await better and further information. We also believe that you share our opinion that it should remain firmly as it is. We also ask you to present our clarifications in your and our name to the appointed delegates, our gracious, dear lords, so that when the matter is concluded, our clarification will also be included. We did not want to burden you with further and longer writing, for each of us has acted in such a manner; you understand it well enough. Furthermore, there is nothing new or additional, other than what was previously written to you, and yet it is not only good but necessary that everything be added. Therefore, act faithfully, as has been done so far. What has been added for clarification, we have underlined.</p>
      <p>In the 1st, we found "leading away" too weak, so we added "hindering".</p>
      <p>In the 2nd, we have better arranged the end and set it with more complete and clearer words.</p>
      <p>The 3rd expresses the person and work of the Holy Spirit more clearly, so that we are not suspected of the Campanian and Servetian sect.</p>
      <p>The 4th expresses more clearly the breach and benefit of the law, which not only brings forth sin and frightens; Romans 7; Psalm 119; 19, 8-15, etc.</p>
      <p>The 5th prevents that our good intention is not misunderstood; Numbers 11 [24-30].</p>
      <p>At the end of the 6th, the apostle's word 1 Corinthians 3[7] stood very well; giving light to the whole article.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the 7th excludes the sacraments that were in the Jewish and papal churches. The same also prevents misunderstanding of the word "secret" and drawing it to an arcanum and occultum, which is a papal manner; it also honors and praises the sacraments, which are not only called water, wine, bread, but also washing, body, and blood.</p>
      <p>The 8th clearly expresses the faith that is necessary for the sacraments, also shows the spiritual manner and excludes the miraculous, which some hold to.</p>
      <p>The 9th is thus somewhat more complete.</p>
      <p>The protestation in the 10th is more necessary than anything else for many reasons, which you well understand.</p>
      <p>We have considered and set all this with seriousness to the best of our ability; desiring and asking that you do not disregard it, but present and help it with diligence and faithfulness, so that it may be included.</p>
