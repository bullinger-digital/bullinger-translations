    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has sent this messenger [...] only to inform that Konrad Zwick will report on the successes of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. God will continue to provide wonderful support if one only relies on Him and not on worldly appearances!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Esslingen must pay Emperor Charles V 40,000 and Reutlingen 20,000 florins. How are these cities supposed to raise the money? Lindau was only charged 4,000. It is believed that Konstanz would achieve peace even without a fine and under good conditions. Zwick will probably report on this as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Strasbourg has probably already surrendered. The city is said to have received good peace terms and was not burdened [with an imperial garrison]. Hopefully, this is true! Because everything can still change.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz might acquire another property instead of the Dübelstein Castle, which was offered to him for purchase. Blarer thanks Bullinger for his efforts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He really had no time to look into the booklet [“Usszug der fürnemisten Eesatzungen”] sent by Bullinger. He should just answer the questions directed to him (regarding the marital problems described to him [in No. 2841]) with a simple yes or no.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The letter [sent by Rudolf Gwalther] to Hans Widenhuber was interpreted differently, but this is not of further importance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Hopefully, the rumors about Landgrave Philipp of Hesse are not true! May God not let him fall so deeply!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blessing wish. Bullinger should pray for Konstanz. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [P.S.:] The enclosed letter from Augsburg should be forwarded to Bernardino Ochino. [From there] nothing is reported about the Landgrave.</p>

      <p>All love and good. With this messenger, nothing special to write, except that you will hear from my dear cousin about the Elector's situation, how well it is going for him. May God continue to advance this work and show the wonders of His hand, as He certainly can and will, if trust is placed in Him and we do not become blinded by human appearances.</p>

      <p>Esslingen gives the Emperor 40,000 florins and Reutlingen 20,000 florins. Not knowing where they should or could raise the money. Lindau gives only 4,000 florins. It is believed that we might get through this time without money and otherwise also with good conditions, about which, I think, my dear cousin will inform you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>With Strasbourg, we believe, it is now also over. They should now have a very good report and not be burdened anywhere. May God grant that the matter has a good foundation! For these things can still turn out strangely, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding Dietrich Marcell, it is no longer necessary. He will not buy Diepoltstein. Another purchase has been agreed upon for him. He might succeed in this purchase. I thank you very diligently and friendly for your efforts and work.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I wish to hear from you a brief decision on my two cases, previously written to you, as I truly, truly have not had time to look into your sent booklet as needed. I did not want to keep it from you any longer, as you might not have advised it. You could write with one word yes or no.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Regarding Widenhuber's letter, it is said to have been understood differently. But it does not matter at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Regarding the Landgrave, I will still hope for the best from all sorts of indications until I can no longer. I hope the Lord will not let him be so disgraced and suffer such great dishonor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>With that, my dearest heart brother and lord, God be with you! Do not cease to pray for us and our churches: As He adorns us with His name, may He also strengthen us with His spirit and graciously preserve us with His mighty hand for His eternal praise! Greet all good lords and friends. 17th of March.</p>

      <p>Herewith a letter. Please forward it to Mr. Bernardino. It has now come to me from Augsburg. Nothing is written about the Landgrave.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
