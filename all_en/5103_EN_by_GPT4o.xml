      <p>Greetings. I sent the letters or a copy of the letters with a certain peasant named Hans Pfenninger from Uerikon. Now Captain Meiss comes, with whom I have discussed all the matters; he thinks there is nothing to worry about. Therefore, you may make less of it; however, it does no harm to take good care. You will understand everything from Meiss.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the seeds of the Venetian war have been sown. Chur, in the evening before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his master.</p>
