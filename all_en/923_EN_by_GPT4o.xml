      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a most distinguished man, his patron and most respected lord, Johannes Rudolf Stumpf sends greetings.</p>
      <p>In my previous letters to you, most excellent man, which I believe have now been delivered, I responded as the time allowed and cleared myself as much as I could of the suspicions which I recently learned were raised at home from my father. However, knowing that my father's wishes in this matter were not yet satisfied, I further obtained from Mr. Peter Martyr that he would free me with his testimony to you. He, who was previously a friend, is now a most dear friend through your recommendation, and knowing that an injustice was being done to me, promised to offer his assistance to me, and I do not doubt that this has been done, and therefore I trust that you will gladly acquiesce to such a serious testimony. If you desire anything more, Cox remains, whom I will have to persuade. I also hope that you have already received Hopper's, on whose advice I turned aside to a citizen, a German bookseller, a good and learned man and an intimate friend of Hopper himself, having left the college, whose hospitality I now use, both for books and also for other conveniences, although more expensive, as far as expenses are concerned, than before.</p>
      <p>I hear lectures not as I would wish, but as I can; for in any faculty the reformation of studies proceeds more successfully than in theology. If I were to turn my mind to medicine, I could have four most select lectures daily, of which I hear two others, namely Aristotle's book On Physical Hearing and Galen's On Natural Faculties. I have the rest in common with Johannes. And these are about my affairs.</p>
      <p>As for the English state, everything is now quite right, and there is the greatest hope concerning religion; for the Archbishop of Canterbury recently took a wife, and likewise the Bishop of London has removed the altars, which were hitherto reserved for the use of the Holy Eucharist, throughout all the churches entrusted to his faith. Our Mr. Hopper, too, who was made Bishop of Gloucester on the feast of the Ascension of Christ, inflicted such a blow on the pontifical ceremonies that, if another like it follows, it will be all over with them; for in the king's council he stood most beautifully against the bishops, who were vigorously defending vestments and such trifles, and at last the reverend fathers were brought to the point of confessing these things as indifferent. With this granted, the councilors immediately pronounce Hopper a bishop with this sentence added: since they have decided these things are indifferent, they should pursue each other with mutual charity and recognize Hopper as a brother in his vestment and a colleague in ministry, and he likewise them. As for the cardinal articles of faith themselves, the greater number of bishops, and most of the king's councilors, stand on our side; if there are any remaining, they do not dare to mutter anymore.</p>
      <p>When I add one thing that happened with us in Oxford during these festive days, I will end the letter. A sacrilegious priest, the alpha of all the papists, of whom there is still a huge crowd, an enemy of God and all the faithful, having often performed the play of the mass in papist conventicles, was finally caught in the act during these festive days and thrown into chains under the condition and agreement that after being well fattened on dry bread and pure water for whole months, he will be returned, if only more severe things do not follow.</p>
      <p>Each of the listeners, for such excellent discipline, must pay the king ten English pounds, that is, florins of our currency, as a price, so that they may finally learn that the mass is not to be so rashly despised, which is valued so highly by the king.</p>
      <p>But since the letter has grown more than justly, I will stop here. The rest, if there are any, you will hear from Mr. Peter and Johannes. Farewell. Greet your most honorable wife with the children and son-in-law Ulrich most dutifully.</p>
      <p>Given at Oxford, June 1, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rudolf Stumpf, most observant of your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and serious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurichers among the Swiss, his patron and most respected lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
