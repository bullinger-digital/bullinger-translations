    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the services rendered to the [Zürich] church [at the meeting in Basel]. The jointly drafted [First Helvetic] Confession was gratefully received by the council and people of Zürich on February 12, especially because of the prospect it opened for recognition by Luther, Melanchthon, Osiander, and others. Requests to prompt [the Wittenbergers] to a benevolent response and to ensure that the slanders in Württemberg cease. A rejection of the confession by the [pastors] of Zürich is not to be feared. Expects a prompt reply from Wolfgang Capito on whether a pharmacist has been found who could take a son of Christoph [Klauser] as an apprentice.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you thanks, my reverend Bucer, dearest brother, for your exceptional concern, by which you have clearly demonstrated your deep devotion for our church through the greatest acts of piety. May God increase His spirit in you, so that you may continue to do good both for our people and for other churches.</p>
      <p>We recited that confession of ours, composed by your efforts, Grynaeus, Leo, and the common work of all, to the senate and the people on February 12. Here, I cannot express to you how they listened to it with such joy, and how they gave thanks to God not only for the established concord but also for the fellowship you offered and for the great hope you opened to us, with which you encouraged us, namely, that Luther, Melanchthon, Osiander, and the other holy and wise men will not demand anything more from us. O, how happy I would be if I live to see the day when you present me with their testimonies! But I hope the most merciful Lord will look upon us with compassion and soften their hearts, so that they too may begin to embrace us with sincere love, just as we, having dispelled all suspicions, will love them from the heart whether they want it or not. Help now, that they may also be friendly to us and write to us. We will do the same for them. Stop the slanders in Württemberg; it is now very rough there. Nothing unpleasant should happen to them from our side, but rather what is pleasing and of service to them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our brothers both in the city and in the countryside desire nothing in that confession. All who read or hear it confess that there is nothing in it but pure simplicity, so you need not fear that ours will reject it.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask Doctor Wolfgang Capito to write me a reply as soon as possible about Doctor Christoph's son, whom he would like to have as an apprentice with you. If it is possible, write a reply before our merchants travel to Frankfurt, so that the good man is not left in uncertainty. He has entrusted everything to Doctor Capito and me, so let the matter be important to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with Capito, Bedrot, Dasypodius, and the others.</p>
      <p>In haste, February 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Martin Bucer, venerable bishop of the people of Strasbourg and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
