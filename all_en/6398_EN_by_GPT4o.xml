      <p>To the honorable lord and father, late in the night comes the castellan or captain of Ramosch, who resides at the castle of Ramosch, reporting that the peasants, among whom are some bailiffs, have set the castle on fire and burned it down.</p>
      <p>The castle belongs to the cathedral chapter and the bishop. My lords are now gathering in council, and as this messenger is ready to depart, Mayor Ambrosi has instructed me to write these things to your reverence, with the request that you also inform my gracious lords, the mayors.</p>
      <p>If the messengers are still in Baden, one might send these matters there; if not, and if Lord Landrichter Capol is with you in Zurich, then inform him about these matters.</p>
      <p>From the Spaniard's writings from Ast, of which I gave you a summary yesterday, and from this current act with the castle of Ramosch, it is clear how necessary it is for our dear Confederates to send a dignified embassy, et in his Tigurinos legatos, qui plurimum authoritate valent apud nostros.</p>
      <p>They hate the people of the Five Cantons because of the MÃ¼sser War... Chur, on Ash Wednesday, in the year 1565.</p>
