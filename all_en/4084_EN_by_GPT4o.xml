      <p>I am sending the acts of the Augsburg council together.</p>
      <p>There is still nothing certain about the affairs of France.</p>
      <p>Can anyone write before everyone has returned to quieter places from the inauguration and anointing? The Lord uses His means beyond the grasp of human understanding and in a moment changes many matters, softens the most obstinate minds, strengthens the weak, and raises and restores desperate situations. What you wrote about the Saxon disputes was most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>We must expect great progress everywhere. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the friends.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, September 20.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
