      <p>I grieve, and indeed I grieve deeply, that my sin of poor depiction has so exceeded, that it has also been an offense to you, whom I always wish to be unoffended. I would grieve even more, because, while I seek pardon for my fault, I might fall into the same and perhaps no less, unless I hoped from you, as we all obtain from the head, namely the remission of punishment, which I am in no way able to pay, although I promise to apply all diligence henceforth, so that your and others' annoyance may be alleviated in some part. I thought more magnificently of the Pole than you think, and because you know, while he was with us, that nothing seemed more to be feared by him and more grievous to him than if it were made public, you could have interpreted skillfully in this sense that he conducted himself in such a way that he is now more known than he would have wished; for here, in Straßburg, Genf, and elsewhere, there is no one who does not know him very well. He scarcely dared to open himself to us out of modesty, and in Straßburg he did not at all hesitate to contend sharply with words, if not with fists, with a certain laundress, unable to bear her injuries, he proceeded to bring the matter to the magistrate with his royal privilege, not doubting that severe punishment would have been taken for a very slight matter. But Bucer appeased the man. I have these things along with many others from a learned and pious man, who visited him this winter in the house of the same Bucer, from whom, as he himself confessed to me and confirms these things, he received many benefits, which I do not know how splendidly he repaid; this one thing I know, that Bucer's wife here in front of many complained more than once that he never gave anything but words.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with those words, I meant nothing else than that he was not in possession of his wish, which you will understand better in person. Meanwhile, however, so that you do not think I am alone in this opinion, ensure that D. Gasner shares with you what D. Münster writes to him in his ear, and be assured that I do not obscurely feel about the man of clear birth and do not slander my very dear friend, and I humbly pray that this may never come to mind, my lord.</p>
      <p>I could scarcely peruse Calvin's response even once in such a great pressure of time and business, believe me. If you have not opened the letters, I am sorry; at present, I do not send them, because I will look more diligently and urge the man even more, as you order, so that nothing may be lacking, although three days ago I wrote to him copiously through a very certain messenger and added some things, as I had promised, to the previous requests, among other things, however, this one thing is included here; the rest, if you will not be burdened to hear, you will understand when I return.</p>
      <p>Utenhovius, who greeted you, is that man from Gent, who obtained advice from you on the matter of the Mass to be made; the same wrote to me that two brothers of D. a. Fales are being held in a very fortified castle for the sake of religion. Now indeed from Italy we have that Dragut, the son-in-law of the Turkish prince, when he had arrived near Genua at three miles Swiss at dawn, exported only one prey of 150 souls and soon withdrew into the French bays, undoubtedly intending to attempt something similar on his return; but there are not light conjectures that something of society exists between the aforementioned Dragut and the hunchbacked scoundrel.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, having finally received a response from the imperial chamber, claims that the Pope has no right in the city of Piacenza and also demands Parma and some other things, indeed if all is to be believed, he says that everything possessed by the Roman pertains to him. Therefore, unless he voluntarily yields, it is to be feared that soon the decision may come to arms. Caesar promises to assign Octavio Farnese 40,000 crowns annually in the Kingdom of Naples and would most gladly receive them himself. But the old fox forbids hoping for greater things. God knows what will happen. May He Himself guide us with His principal spirit, and all others, if not superfluous, will certainly not be necessary for us.</p>
      <p>From Caelius, when you send him the transcript, I do not doubt that you will receive the judgment all the sooner and more carefully considered.</p>
      <p>Scertelinus ordered me to convey to you a doubled greeting from his chief supporters, which I do from the heart, as I wish you all the most fortunate things and have nothing else, except that you do not cease to love me wrongly [perhaps?] because you have not a few things to blame in me; but rather pray with me to the giver of all good things ardently, that He may amend all these things, and remind me more frequently and freely to do so more ardently; for in no matter do you please me equally, and in this regard, I owe you more than I ever thought. Again, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of July 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Laelius Socinus.</p>
      <p>I beg you to tell D. Bibliander that I am waiting for his response with desire and greet my always venerable host with the rest of the friends. About our Vergerius, nothing, since he himself has written to you.</p>
      <p>Do you think that if a Turk is baptized, his entire household should also be baptized, and if it is not allowed to imitate circumcision in this, why is it allowed in the sons, who were not circumcised with better right, it would be equally pleasing to have your judgment on this matter.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop among the Zürichers, most observant to me.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
