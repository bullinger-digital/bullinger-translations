      <p>May God's grace through Christ, our Lord, be with you beforehand, etc. Honorable, beloved godfather, I am truly and deeply sorry for your ailments, which trouble me no less than my own. God knows, I wish I could relieve you of them! Neither effort, cost, nor labor would deter me; but it pleases our Lord God to crucify and humble our flesh, as it is also to partake in the resurrection and heavenly glory.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we should rightly endure and praise God even amidst all pains, as He has redeemed us from eternal pains and opened to us the blessed hope of the heavenly kingdom through His holy gospel. May He daily increase and sustain hope and patience in us, so that they may guide us to eternal life. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding your other writings, I thank you for your recent news. We have not had any certain news about the affairs in the Netherlands for a long time, which is why I have sent them to my lords. We also hear about peace in France, that it is maintained by those in La Rochelle; but in Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné, it is not so near. The royal envoy was here these days. He gravely complained to our people about them, saying that they do not want to accommodate peace; he says they demand from the king, indeed prescribe to him such conditions of peace, which they would hardly dare to ask if they held him captive. He also affirms that the king greatly regrets the Parisian massacre; but the Phrygians are wise too late. If only he would finally be wise!</p>
      <p>We have not yet seen D. Beza's book. It is strange that these men cannot rest; I fear that through their Frenchmen, they may also stir up new troubles for us in Lausanne. But let them beware; for they will not be tolerated if they are found to be plotting anything.</p>
      <p>They are now harassing Coladon, who teaches theology in Lausanne and whom they could not tolerate in Geneva before; now they would gladly expel him from here as well.</p>
      <p>The three cities of Bern, Fribourg, and Solothurn are still in negotiations with the people of Geneva regarding the alliance; but it does not seem to be progressing well. They were just together about it last week.</p>
      <p>In our place, Christian am Port, our sincere and upright schoolmaster, has been elected in place of Valentin Ampelandri, and I have high hopes for him, for which I am very glad. If only the school could also be well provided for again! Lord de Mülinen, by the grace of God, is better again, so that he can walk and enter the council once more. Steiger and Diesbach are also in very good health; they greet you, as do my father-in-law and all our people from Königsfelden. Greet all yours in my name, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, relatives, etc.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 7, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
