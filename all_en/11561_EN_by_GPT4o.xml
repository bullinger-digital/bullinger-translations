    <p xml:id="regest1">[Gasparo] Contarini, the papal legate at the Regensburg Imperial Diet, has faced rejection with his demand for the recognition and preservation of the authority of the apostolic see by the estates and even by Emperor [Charles V.]; it is said that the Emperor gradually understands which doctrine corresponds to the teachings of Christ and the Scriptures and can rightly appeal to the Apostles and the Fathers; may God grant him wisdom. Vadian expects at least a temporary alleviation of the pressure on the Protestants from the negotiations.</p>

      <p> Greetings. From Regensburg, there is nothing new, except that Contarini, the papal legate, has been rejected not only by the estates but also by the Emperor himself. He stated that he had no other mandate from his hyena than to strive with all his might to ensure that the new Lutheran doctrine does not in any way detract from the old decrees of the fathers, the most recent holy councils, or the authority of the holy pontiff and the Roman see, and to urge all the estates not to prefer the new ideas of new men over the ecclesiastical religion that has been accepted and approved for so many centuries, but to recognize, honor, and protect their mother Rome, namely the apostolic see. It is said that the Emperor is now in a position to finally understand which doctrine aligns more with the teachings of Christ and the spirit of the scriptures: whether it is the papal one, which the Romanist Paul boasts so much about being apostolic, or rather ours, with which all antiquity and all orthodox teachers agree. May the Lord deign to imbue his heart with the best counsels. I am certain that, if not a thorough examination of the matters, at least an end to this kind of tale can rescue us from the jaws of our adversaries with some pacification and defer what we desire to more convenient times. Farewell. Very quickly. St. Gallen, the 10th day of May, in the year of our Lord 1541. </p>
      <p> To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. </p>
