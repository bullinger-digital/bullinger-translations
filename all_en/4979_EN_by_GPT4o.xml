      <p>Greetings. Brother Peter came to us and requested to be supported at the expense of our church; however, since our church is already heavily burdened and there is a great abundance of the needy, and we are also severely pressed by the scarcity of all things, we sent him away with travel provisions. He wished to proceed to you, in case any hope might shine for him with you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you can help him, please consider him recommended, I pray. Grave dangers are arising from all sides.</p>
      <p>Papal envoys are acting among the Rhaetians, who have joined forces with the Spanish delegation, requesting that Italian exiles be expelled from the Valtellina, indeed that preachers be expelled and Jesuits, the most wicked scoundrels of all, be received, in short, that the Roman seats, which have been removed, be restored. The audacity of these scoundrels is incredible, and they are supported by those who oppose the gospel everywhere. We do not cease to encourage the pious to remain steadfast, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, on September 11th, the Bishop of Konstanz died, a man otherwise tolerable. As soon as he began to fall ill, Emser, the Pope's nephew from his sister, was summoned from Rome by swift horses, who, while the bishop was alive, wanted to join himself as a coadjutor to the bishop, but could not be forced upon the resisting bishop. Now, however, with the bishop dead, he is present by post and is said to have completed the journey in just a few days. I saw letters written from Konstanz yesterday, in which I understood that all the best people greatly fear that he will be created, especially since the votes of the Pope and the Emperor are readily available.</p>
      <p>That Emser is a military man, and therefore the wise think he will wage war against us, etc. But the Lord lives, who can break all the power of the world.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we hear nothing about Mr. Peter Martyr, whether he has reached the court or not.</p>
      <p>We are very anxious and do not hear what is happening in France. We diligently pray to the Lord to bless His cause.</p>
      <p>You could not do anything more pleasing than to share what you have about French affairs. If you do not have time to write, let our Jonville or another good man write.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend man, etc., and on occasion, it has been shown that heaven is the name of a place and that the right hand of God is circumscribed somewhere and that the body of Christ, which is at the right hand of the Father, is not everywhere. Brentius, however, wrote against my book in German and contends that the body of Christ, because of the personal union, is everywhere, that heaven is not a definite place, and that the right hand of God is not circumscribed anywhere. In short: he babbles so foolishly that I am ashamed of the man.</p>
      <p>God willing, I will respond to him.</p>
      <p>I hear that our adversaries are raging completely; may the Lord restrain them! Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 21, 1561. All of ours greet you; greet all the brothers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>[To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.]</p>
