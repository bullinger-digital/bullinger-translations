      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, Your princely grace my humble, obligated and willing service always beforehand. Gracious prince and lord, the noble knight Hans Jacob Adelschweiler von Nollingen, my friendly, dear brother-in-law informs me of the great and commendable grace and favor Your princely grace has shown him as an undeserving one and still shows daily. Therefore, I am compelled to thank Your princely grace most sincerely, with humble request, to have him, as he needs help and advice, henceforth recommended in grace.</p>
      <p>If ever Your princely grace I could serve and please with all that is possible for me, I would always be ready. I hereby send two printed sermons, which I have given to print in past days and just now coming from the press, humbly asking Your princely grace to kindly receive the mentioned sermons from me, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my beloved son-in-law Mr. Josias Simler, this church's school reader in the New Testament, out of special love and affection, which he bears to Your princely grace, has inscribed and dedicated the Epitome bibliothecae etc. to Your princely grace, as the dedicatory epistle and the work itself testify. Such a book was just printed yesterday. So my friendly brother-in-law wanted to deliver it today, but my dear son-in-law was not in the city, as he traveled to his mother, who lay mortally ill. He was well-intentioned to have the book royally prepared with binding and appropriate adornment. However, since he was not at home and there was such a suitable messenger through whom the book could be delivered to Your princely grace promptly and surely, I have taken it upon myself confidently and in his name demanded two copies from Mr. Froschauer, prepared them and send them to Your princely grace here with my friendly brother-in-law with great confidence, Your princely grace will kindly receive them from me. What then my beloved son-in-law has particularly to write to Your princely grace, he may do so when he returns home. But it is certain, and I am also thoroughly informed, that the aforementioned dedication is not made with the intention, as is common with many at this time, to obtain or request anything from Your princely grace, or under such guise to flatter, but is greatly satisfied if he may have Your princely grace's grace and good, favorable will, if he can please Your princely grace and serve further, yes, if Your princely grace continues to love and help promote the good arts along with the true Christian religion. Above all, Your princely grace may well know what our gracious lords and superiors' general decree is, to take no rents, gifts, or presents, that Your princely grace should have no other thought herein than that my beloved son-in-law has wanted to serve and please Your princely grace heartily and willingly. Humbly asking to have us always recommended in grace. May God Almighty keep Your princely grace in His divine grace in health and true well-being for a long time. Dated in Zurich, the 8th of March, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
