      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you. I write briefly to your kindness, dear Heinrich, because my weary and trembling hands hardly perform their duty due to a severe illness, which has so weakened my strength and mind that I henceforth await the glorious coming of the Lord, to rescue me from this present evil age and, because of the death of His Son, to grant me the reward of eternal life by grace, amen. I cry out now, struggling with death, with Bernard of Clairvaux, who, near death, said: "I confess, I am not worthy, nor can I by my own merits obtain the kingdom of heaven, but obtaining it by a double right... namely by the inheritance of the Father and by the merit of the passion, content with the one, the other is given to me; by whose gift, begging by right, I shall not be confounded" etc. Therefore, now under the hand of the mighty God, who deals kindly and mercifully with me, I sigh for the future homeland, I beseech you, brother in Christ to be revered, with your holy brothers, pray for me, that God in His usual mercy may keep me in the usual confession of piety, lest, agitated by the wiles of Satan, I waver. Amen. I therefore desire to depart and be with Christ in those heavenly mansions prepared by God from eternity, which I do not doubt I shall soon attain through Christ. I perceive the grace of God calling me to Himself by a slow death, thus gradually the strength of my sick body fades. O Father, into your hands I commend my spirit through Jesus Christ. Amen. Again, I commend myself to your holy prayers, amen. Greet all the brothers in Christ. I did not want to write; but my weak mind has produced more than I hoped. Yet love itself supplies strength. Farewell then and live in Christ, to whom you have hitherto steadfastly ministered in the building of the church of God. Proceed happily, and there will be a great reward for your work in the kingdom of God. Amen. On the day of the Ascension of Christ, when the Son of God brought His immortal body into heaven, sitting at the right hand of God the Father etc.</p>
      <p>Your Erb from the heart, loving the kingdom of God. To the most excellent man and true confessor of theology, dear Heinrich Bullinger, brother to be revered etc.</p>
