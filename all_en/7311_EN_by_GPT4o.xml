      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand, etc. On the past Wednesday evening, a letter was written to my gracious lord from Mr. Bellievre, completed at the post in Solothurn, stating that in France near Paris at Saint-Denis, an attack and encounter occurred, and the king scattered his enemies, captured many of them, and led them into the city without harm to himself and his people.</p>
      <p>The Swiss Confederates stood in battle formation; no one dared to attack them. However, the misfortune struck the lord constable; as he was bravely fighting, he was wounded, yet he still managed to enter the city with the victory and only passed away on the third day thereafter.</p>
      <p>The king wrote this to him (Mr. Bellievre) on November 14th from Paris, as he intended to march out again the next day to relieve the burden of the empire, etc. I once heard this letter read in haste and retained the summary as I have written it here. I would have also requested that the letter be copied for me, had I not thought that Mr. Granreyen would have already announced it. I ask you to inform me how he presents it; for I suspect it will be reported differently. It is believed here that if it was not just a skirmish, but a field battle, it would have proceeded very differently.</p>
      <p>We will soon learn more thoroughly about this; whatever comes to me, I will let you know. In the aforementioned writing, it is also mentioned that Mr. Anemours has brought Vienna back into the king's hands and that Macon will soon be similarly conquered; for there is little resistance there. I am sending you here 3 captain's letters, sent from Paris; please return them to me well secured by the next dispatch; for whatever I receive from both parties, I will let you know. Your letter, dated November 24th, has reached me. Last Saturday, my lord MÃ¼ller peacefully passed away in the Lord; praying to God that He gives us another good mayor and has mercy on us.</p>
      <p>God be with you! Greet for me the symystas, Mr. Mayor and Mr. Captain Carli, Pontisella, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated November 28, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
