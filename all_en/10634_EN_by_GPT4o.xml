    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on the recent events in St. Gallen: The intention of the people from the monastic lordship to honor the abbot with a festive procession was opposed by Mayor Vadian and the council with the condition that not all armed men were allowed to march through the city to the court at the same time, upon which they initially wanted to force the march through, but then relented; on Sunday, the abbot's people want to meet in Rorschach. Over the weekend, among others, the captain of Wil and Jakob An der Rüti from Schwyz, and on Saturday also the abbot, were in the city. [Konrad] Brüllisauer's son promised the city bailiff [Albrecht Schlumpf] payment for a vineyard as soon as mass is read again in St. Gallen. In the monastery, a preacher threatened that he would hold mass in the city church of St. Laurenzen within a year. Request to deliver the enclosed letter from Nuremberg to Andreas Geßner. In the Rhine Valley, the vines bloomed late. The news about [the Anabaptist uprising in] Amsterdam seems to be true. Wants to discuss with Bullinger in Zurich. Greetings; [Jakob] Rordorf should collect the blue yarn from Gebhart Brunner. The people of the Rhine Valley thank [Johannes] Haab.</p>

      <p>God with us. Amen etc.</p>
      <p>My lord, beloved brother, at the request of my lord doctor from Wadtz and others etc., also out of my duty to my gracious lords of Zurich etc., I write to you in trust about this matter as follows, so that you may inform my particularly gracious, dear lord Mayor Roysten, in case things turn out differently than stated below, not to discredit, as is often the case, but to believe the truth, and to consider what such an undertaking might bring, as both are good, pious cities especially trusted. Considering the matter, what concern etc. Also, it has been decided by the abbot of St. Gallen or his people towards St. Fiden, in his courts before the city of St. Gallen, to hold a feast (Fest) from all the people of the monastery, in honor of him or others, and the court is held every Sunday. However, before this Sunday after the date, a respectable council in the city was informed several days in advance (without being asked for their opinion on the matter) and made a decision: If they were to come, as it was met by 500 armed men, the mayor was instructed, so that when they came and were let out of the abbot's court, to make a small speech there in honor of their gracious lord and convent, not to let them in, but to inform them, when they came, that they would gladly let them pass through, but one court or district at a time; they assured themselves of nothing but good. Thus, no one came until Sunday of the day, as they wanted to pass through. The steward and chancellor sent the messenger to the mayor and informed him (without asking if he would allow it). He gave the messenger the answer as stated above, which a council had decided, also holding before the messenger, as the rumor that perhaps some would carry handguns, which the messenger answered: "If God wills, not." As it was not known whether they would be satisfied with the answer, to pass through and not make a small speech, also each district separately, and yet the people gathered somewhere far outside the city, among whom the chancellor with a good battle sword, also the bailiff of Oberberg in the front row, and other officials, to be cautious, to defy anyone, Mayor von Wadt took the old one, also the under-mayor to him under the gate and then sent the city servant to the chancellor and people outside, to ask the chancellor in the friendliest manner if they would be satisfied with the council's approval. Thereupon the chancellor himself went with his battle sword to the three mayors at the gate, which was open, thus again opening the council's approval, with the request to remain and be satisfied. Thereupon the chancellor said: "Dear lords, we have decided to enter the court together, to make a small speech there in honor of my gracious lord and the convent (although the abbot is not present), but we have agreed that we will not separate in any way; but one assures oneself of all good." Thereupon he was answered to remain by the council's approval, although they had the need that they would not be satisfied here in the city; well meant, not theirs etc. Upon this answer, the mayor continued: "So you may well march around the moat around the city." Thereupon the chancellor said: "No, we will not do that, but will march next to the mountain in my gracious lord's court towards St. Fiden." But they marched there to the gate, the chancellor with the battle sword in front (at the forefront). Thus they turned around at the gate on the moat. Also in quiet secrecy, for good, the council also had 200 men in their houses, armed, along with 4 small cannons loaded, if they wanted to forcefully enter here, all well-armed, until all the citizens were also informed of this and could arm themselves. They also marched to the gate, so that Mayor Franzist Studer himself called 14 riflemen to him in haste under the gate, each of whom had loaded their rifles, thus waiting. Praise be to God, it turned out well. Also, next Sunday, it is said, they will gather in Rorschach.</p>
      <p>Also on Sunday and Monday, many of their councilors, also from Wil, the captain was here. Also, the one from Schwyz, Jacob An der Rüty, who was a spokesman in St. Gallen with master Haben. Also, the abbot spoke in the city on Saturday; that day back out etc.</p>
      <p>Also, one from Thal from the Rhine Valley (Vogt Brulisower's son, the abbot's council) gave the city bailiff of St. Gallen a fresh purchase in Lindow in the inn, perhaps not held by the one from the Rhine Valley, giving a vineyard for 600 lb den[ar] St. Gallen currency, when mass is held in the city of St. Gallen, to pay him etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the monk who now preaches in the monastery of St. Gallen (is, as is certain, carried by the sexton for a council), indeed came to the city church of St. Laurenzen to the sexton and said with more words, there he or someone will hold mass within a year. What blasphemies you may consider etc.</p>
      <p>Also, a letter comes from Nuremberg, given by master Andres Gässler.</p>
      <p>Here in the Rhine Valley, the vine bloom was late; almost fallen off.</p>
      <p>I fear more for the future, how it stands with you. What news you have, write to us.</p>
      <p>From Nuremberg there is no news. Then it is believed that from Amsterdam it is true, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>When I come to you, I have my concern to discuss with you.</p>
      <p>Greet my dear lord neighbor, lord Rösten, for both of us your whole house, master Kaspar, Rordorff. Tell him to take the blue yarn, which I left here to be dyed, from Gebhart Bronner; I have put it in his barrel and also let him know.</p>
      <p>I long to you, Hans Müller, his people etc. [...] Haben. The people of the Rhine Valley and others truly say much good, also much compassion from him [...]lb, tell him and thank him, especially also the preacher from the Rhine Valley. God [...] keep in.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, quickly, on Tuesday before John the Baptist's day in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your willing poor Hans Vogler in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, to his own hands.</p>
