    <p xml:id="regest1">In the matter [of the new appointment of the schoolmaster's office at] the school [of Aarau], Hochholzer has been very engaged. However, in the end, the [Ulrich Trog supported by the Bernese] was appointed, and Hochholzer cannot oppose this. He does not know what the future holds, but according to Bullinger's advice, he will try to win [Trog's] sympathy. He is still quite young, but seems to be frank and good, as long as he does not let himself be seduced by his spiritual superiors. These only promote Lutherans, no matter how uneducated they may be, while the Bernese council is blind. A synod is expected next spring, but whether it will happen is uncertain, especially since it will probably only be convened when the [Lutherans] are sure of their majority, which will not happen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Things are quite good for the [people of Aarau]; however, it is to be feared that most will follow the stronger party. Due to the prevailing ingratitude everywhere, as the Apostle [Paul] says, people must believe lies because they do not want to believe the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Hochholzer is also doing well, although he earns little in Aarau and his wife [Agathe, née Näf] increasingly wants to return to her homeland [Zurich]. He himself would not be averse to returning home either.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Surely Bullinger already knows the news that was communicated to the [people of Aarau] by letter from a brother [...]: That [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick wants to join the Schmalkaldic League. If that is true, there will be difficulties, and [Heinrich] will not gladly pay a ransom to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] for it. - Greetings, also from [Agathe], to the whole family; likewise to [Rudolf] Gwalther and to Hochholzer's teacher.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. For a long time, esteemed lord and father, I have labored in the matter of our school; but it has turned out as you know. The one whom others wanted was accepted. It was not my place to reject him. What he will be like, I do not yet know; he is silent. In the meantime, I will diligently do what you advised; I will strive in every way to win his favor. He is still quite young; I will try to win him over to the Lord. He avoids the company of people, seems simple and good, unless he is led astray by great promises. This indeed happens among our bishops: what cannot be obtained by truth, they try to impose by cunning. Some uneducated Lutheran, inexperienced in all things, and of little (I would almost say) proven integrity, is promoted to have the best; a lover of truth, opposed to Luther and his kind, learned, of proven integrity, experienced in all things, is hindered by them, and is poorly regarded.</p>

      <p>If this were new, I would be greatly surprised; but truth has been hated by the world since the beginning of the world. Such is also the blindness and ignorance of our Bernese council (otherwise most prudent), that while they teach their own, they do not notice. We expect a synod in the coming spring, but we do not know if it will happen. We judge it will be of little benefit. For we will not be called until they judge that they can overcome us by numbers; which will not happen. For although their part is greater, truth is not measured by numbers or fewness. The greater part of the world loves errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3">
      <p>We are quite well. Praise to God, the best and greatest! However, we fear that many will follow the greater part, as is usual; as the prince is, so are the people. Moreover, our remarkable ingratitude deserves that, according to the words of the Apostle, we believe lies, because we do not want to believe the truth. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p>

      <p>As for my affairs in Aarau, I am doing well considering the smallness of the stipend, but I do not know why it is that the longer my wife is here, the more she desires to return to Zurich; she is daily held by a greater longing for her homeland. Although I do not greatly desire it now, yet in due time, if it were granted, it would not be entirely unwelcome. The earth is the Lord's. He has sent me into His vineyard, and in it, as much as He grants me strength and gifts from His abundant kindness, wherever I may be, I will labor faithfully both in uprooting and planting. I commend myself and all that is mine to you as always.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Among other news, which you have certainly learned more accurately, it has been brought to us by a brother's letter that [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick is seeking to be received into the Schmalkaldic League. If this is the case, the dismissed one will cause much trouble, and he will not gladly pay a ransom to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]. I ask you to convey greetings, in my name and my wife's, to your whole family. Also, greet Mr. Gwalther and my other venerable teachers.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours in the Lord. Aarau, February 9, 1546. Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
