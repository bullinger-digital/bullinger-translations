      <p>S. D. You understand from the letters of others what is happening with us and elsewhere; nothing occurs to me that I might add to them. I received letters from Geneva from my son to me and to you, which I am sending. I have added Crispin's, because I know you are curious about what he has decided regarding my commentaries. My Felix writes in other letters that on May 21 he saw witches being burned, 36 held in chains, who have been sentenced to death, more being investigated, and while punishment is being exacted from them, the clothes of some are being anointed by other witches; such is their audacity. Ludwig Muraltus reported to me that the only daughter of a certain nobleman of Savoy (the name escapes me), a very wealthy man, has been accused of the same crime; that nobleman defended his daughter in Bern; what he achieved, I do not know; however, she could have been accused out of hatred.</p>
      <p>We tanners will triumph tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Regarding the letters of Mr. Xylander, I hope he will publish nothing that he will not first send to us. He is certainly an excellently learned man, so I hope his efforts will not be entirely in vain. I do not care about the barking of the Papists; I fear, however, that in the matter of predestination and free will he might mix in something from the philosophers; he can, however, be advised. Mr. Erastus holds him in high regard. I took care of the letters to the steward of the hospital, but I have not seen him in the meantime; perhaps tomorrow he will greet the new consul with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Please convey my greetings to everyone and in my name pray that the waters of Vultureae may be healthy for you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 16.</p>
      <p>My household greets you, Regula Zwingli diligently takes care of everything. Ransius is always present at dinner and lunch with us and delights in rich foods.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father-in-law.</p>
