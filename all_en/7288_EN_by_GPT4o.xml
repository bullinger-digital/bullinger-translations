      <p>Greetings. From France, I have nothing of significance to report, except that yesterday it was brought to us that the city of Metz has been occupied by our forces. This would be an easy access point from Germany. They also say that Condé's forces are increasing greatly day by day, new troops have been sent from Gascony and by the Queen of Navarre, and that the Chancellor of the Kingdom and Montmorency are working hard for peace.</p>
      <p>All the pious fear that this delay will be detrimental to our cause. Movanus is gathering large forces in Vienna. Some think he will besiege Lyon; but this is uncertain. Our people are raging greatly against the priests and monks. From the Netherlands, we hear nothing but that extreme cruelty is being exercised there.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you all your letters that you recently sent. As soon as I have any definite news, I will write to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I am very sorry about Mr. Müller's poor health; please greet him in my name, and also Mr. von Cham.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 3, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
