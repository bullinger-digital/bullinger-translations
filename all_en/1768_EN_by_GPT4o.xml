      <p>Greetings. We have received your letter and express our great thanks for the love and friendship that you have shown us and continue to do so. Siena has thrown off the Emperor and expelled the Spanish garrison. Because of this, the Spaniards who were on their way to Germany have been recalled back to Italy. However, the Italians are being allowed to leave. Otherwise, there is no news at present. May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
