    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer can only write briefly; there is nothing more to say about [Albert] Hardenberg and the [against Andreas Osiander directed] "Speculum"; regarding Zwingli's collected works, Blarer can only expect good things in view of the modesty and skill of the people of Zurich. He feels sorry for Philipp [Melanchthon]; L[uther] will likely maintain the unfortunate course he has taken until his death. Blarer had expected better from [Wolfgang] Musculus; Cochläus is not worth a long response; this is merely an attempt by the devil to distract Bullinger from more important tasks. [Francis I] is supposed to repay [Charles V] all war costs since 1543. The Swiss Confederates are not to be included in the peace [of Crépy]. [Henry VIII] is not supposed to have made peace with [Francis I]. With great pain, Blarer was reminded by Bullinger of the [Zurich] defeat [in the Second War of Kappel]. Bullinger should continue to pray for [Konstanz], as Blarer fears the worst. Greetings to Gwalther, to whom he will respond as soon as possible. Greetings from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick. Blarer personally delivered Gwalther's letter to the mayor [Jakob Zeller?].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Clearly, I would like to write to you, venerable Bullinger, my dear friend; however, I can only write briefly. Regarding our Hardenberg, the Speculum, and other matters, there is no need to say anything; they are and will remain in their place. As for the publication of Zwingli's works, I will not delay you any further, even if I could, since I dare to promise myself the best from your modesty and skill.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, by His own spirit, guide everything to the happiest outcome! The fate of Philipp [Melanchthon] grieves me beyond measure and belief. In the meantime, I do not doubt that this is happening by the singular counsel of the Lord, who will use this occasion to call that most holy heart to better things. I greatly fear that Luther will not be able to successfully complete this unfortunate course. May the Lord remove from him this impotence of unhealthy passions as soon as possible and have mercy on him and us!</p>
      <p>I wish Musculus, born for better things, would not follow worse ones; I have seen nothing of this, but I do not doubt that they are as you write. I do not see that you will achieve anything worthwhile by responding to Cochläus at length. Satan throws these obstacles in the way of your other most pious endeavors, in which I strongly urge you to continue; let those who delight only in the worst waste good hours in this way.</p>
      <p>New news is being circulated among us in a wonderful manner, so unlikely that it is beyond measure, that I believe these monarchs are colluding to the ruin of others.</p>
      <p>They say and write that the Frenchman must repay the Emperor many tons of gold and specifically cover all the costs of the entire war from the year 1543 until now. The imperialists say and write this most steadfastly. Also, the Swiss Confederates are not at peace, but even if it were true, they would not be concerned; they do not need any promised peace from the Emperor, they will remain well before him.</p>
      <p>The Englishman is said not to want to accept peace shortly, and it will still require some effort, as you write. As for what you add: "What if? You understand the rest," I clearly do not understand; therefore, I would like you to explain this to me more clearly in your next letters.</p>
      <p>With great pain of my soul, I read at the end of your letter the mention of the slaughter of your people by your own people, marveling anew at the depth of God's judgments; but all things work for the salvation of the elect.</p>
      <p>Ah, my sweetest brother, do not cease to commend us to the Lord! I clearly see the gravest things looming over us, for which we will need the most powerful help of the divine hand to endure.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household with all friends and brothers most lovingly, especially our Gwalther, to whom I will respond to his most loving letters as soon as I have the opportunity.</p>
      <p>I will not say much, but I owe myself entirely to you, whom I see clearly love me candidly and sincerely in all ways. My brother and Zwick send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, 18 October 1544. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Tell Gwalther that I personally delivered his letter to our mayor. To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother, etc., in Zurich.</p>
