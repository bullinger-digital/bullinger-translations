      <p>Greetings. I implore you to focus on this matter of concord, not necessarily with Luther, which perhaps is still far off, but truly on our own. For what do I hear! The people of Bern are not in agreement. Ah, immortal God, how we present ourselves to our adversaries! You write excellently about the diseases of the church today, but we do not equally strive to remove these diseases. We all have knowledge, but see how disgracefully we are divided in the meantime! We never agree, no one truly submits to another, so that there is true unity of spirit. You do not go to Bern yourself, nor are you there long enough until the matter is completely settled. If we truly love each other and the truth, the Lord will inspire and not oppose our efforts. I beseech you, strive so that the peace, which cannot be obtained in the whole church, at least stands firm in ours, so that the adversaries do not have something to justly criticize perpetually. I wish, if there is any authority of mine, that you truly focus on this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, January 14.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his friend. Zurich</p>
