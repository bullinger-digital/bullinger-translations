    <p xml:id="regest1">The troublemakers [Beat Gering and Simon Sulzer] have attempted to oppose the [pastor] election of a Zurich native [Jodocus Kilchmeyer] made by the Bernese council. They claim it is illegitimate and violates spiritual authority. However, the examples of [biblical rulers] Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, Judas Maccabeus, and Cyrus [II] demonstrate that authorities possess power in ecclesiastical matters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger should therefore ensure that [Kilchmeyer] does not reject the calling prompted by the Holy Spirit. [Kilchmeyer] can count on support [in Bern].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Know, Bullinger, that our troublemakers are very upset that the Zurich magistrate was chosen, whom they did not nominate. They wanted to impede his calling as if it were not legitimate, and that it violated ecclesiastical authority. But we know from Jehoshaphat, Josiah, Hezekiah, Judas Maccabeus, and King Cyrus what the magistrate can do in ecclesiastical matters and in ordaining ministers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, ensure in every way that he does not refuse the calling bestowed by the Holy Spirit. He will have steadfast supporters.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Given on the 15th of September in the year, etc., 46., etc. Yours, Eb.</p>
