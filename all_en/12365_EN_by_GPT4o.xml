    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian finally sends the [biographical notes of his "Little Chronicle" on the] abbots [of St. Gall], who over time transformed from fathers and teachers [of faith] into monarchs. The misdeeds of these abbots had to be noted, yet Vadian also made it clear that the abbots would be tolerated and even recognized as magnates if they had strived for a [morally] strict way of life, a good education, and the correct [Christian] doctrine, and had not turned to the doctrine of salvific works out of greed. [In his report] Vadian questioned many things but left [the conclusions] to the judgment of his readers. However, he always made it clear what he aimed for with his work, even if he did so in a simple and cautious manner to avoid offending those of different beliefs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Vadian also endeavored to present the history of Thurgau to the uneducated reader and to record lesser-known facts about the origins of St. Gall and the Appenzell region from various sources. This now makes many things clearer among the [old] chroniclers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Vadian deliberately wrote some German names differently than usual to make their original meaning apparent. For example, Ulrich is written, which some derive from Huldreich, others from Wohlreich. Factual considerations always determined his writing, so he rarely got lost in sophistry. A future copyist should copy [Vadian's manuscript] very carefully. [Bullinger], who is constantly interrupted by official duties, would have good reason to assign others to this transcription.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Since Vadian is friends with Bullinger and [Johannes] Stumpf, he allows himself the remark that the history of the older Thurgau from the time of Abbot Konrad [von Bussnang, i.e., from 1226] to that [of Abbot] Diethelm [Blarer von Wartensee] [i.e., until 1532] has never before been compiled from the sources with such care. For the even older period from [Abbot] Othmar [i.e., from 719/20] to the death [1239] of [Abbot] Konrad [von Bussnang], there are already some Latin [accounts]. [Bullinger and Stumpf] will be able to determine for themselves what these are worth compared to his, especially since he did not imitate these accounts in his report but rather drew on old sources from the monastery library [of St. Gall], including the German chronicles of the [abbots] Wilhelm [von Montfort], Berchtold [von Falkenstein], and Georg [von Wildenstein]. Although these chronicles are [historically] weak, they provide useful information about the past. Finally, Vadian is the only one who, to portray the history of the last hundred years, used the writings of [Abbot] Kuno [von Stoffeln] as well as those of the two [abbots] Heinrich [Heinrich III. von Gundelfingen] [and Heinrich IV. von Mansdorf] (both appointed as abbot by the Constance Synod) and the [abbots] Kaspar [von Breitenlandenberg], Wolrich [Ulrich VIII. Rösch], Gotthard [Giel von Glattburg], Franz [von Gaisberg], and Kilian [Germann].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He undertook the present work to assist [Bullinger and Stumpf]; however, this is not the only reason. Despite his countless affairs, he was also motivated by love for truth and the fatherland. [Bullinger and Stumpf] should now evaluate the result; if it is useful, it should be published, if not, returned. Vadian would have wished for [less educated] readers than Bullinger and Stumpf. While writing, he often thought of the passage by Pliny the Elder, who wrote in the introduction to his "Natural History" that he wished for [the learned speaker Manius] Persius, but [the unknown] Laelius Decimus as a reader.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Vadian has described his hometown [St. Gall] quite extensively and demonstrated its freedom from the abbots. Neither Bullinger nor Stumpf, [Christoph] Froschauer, nor the Zurich council will likely have any objections to this freedom. In religious matters, Vadian was very reserved. Considering his office, it is not his task to refute the error of the abbots, especially since in the [protection and shield treaty of the Abbey of St. Gall with the four places Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus from 1451] religion was explicitly excluded and subordinated to the Roman chair; likewise in the captaincy [treaty of 1479 with the same places], through which the [captains of the shield places] gained no authority over religious matters from the abbots. On the other hand, the abbots have subjected themselves to the four places in external matters with the eternally valid [Federal Charter of 1451].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- In his [biographical portrayal of the abbots], Vadian occasionally mentioned emperors and kings intentionally, even though he knew that Stumpf would treat these separately. By establishing connections between the actions of the abbots and other events of the time, his depiction became more vivid. For similar reasons, bishops were also mentioned, who, as is well known, gradually became oppressors of the emperors' subjects in Rome and even drove them out of Italy. Here too, Vadian held back and did not reveal all the clergy's tricks to avoid causing fear among the people and to encourage a more cautious defense of piety.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Stumpf should be given a successor [in Stammheim] so that he could fully devote himself to [his "Swiss Chronicle"]. That would not be costly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Johannes] Kessler would like to publish Vadian's treatise "On the Monastic State" separately, even if it should appear in Stumpf's Chronicle. However, [Bullinger and Stumpf] must agree to this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- In the preface to his Chronicle, Stumpf should emphasize that his Chronicle was written out of love for truth and not for polemical reasons, and that every reader is free to choose one faith or the other.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The first sections of the [manuscript sent to Zurich with this letter] as well as its last sections have been written cleanly by Vadian [from earlier versions]. He had no reason to rewrite the middle sections, which deal with the period from [1226 to 1491, i.e., from Abbot] Konrad [von Bussnang] to [Abbot] Ulrich [VIII. Rösch], but made [additions and corrections] there and hopes that they will be manageable in print.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- His work contains many details (such as the journey of Abbot Kaspar [von Breitenlandenberg] with the monastery caretaker Ulrich [VIII. von Rösch] to Rome), which show how the monks were driven by desires and engaged in trivialities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Vadian has written the records about Abbot Franz [von Gaisberg] in an annalistic manner, and there is a reason for this. He does not want anything to be changed or omitted [in his work] (especially in the case of the monster Ulrich [VIII. von Rösch]), even though he is generally not opposed to some formal changes and is ultimately willing to submit to the judgment [of Bullinger and Stumpf].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- His depictions only extend to the second year of [Abbot] Diethelm [Blarer von Wartensee], i.e., until 1532. However, it would be good to write a few words about the last [Kappel] Wars [of 1529 and 1531], especially since the memory of these wars is still present and the associated treaties still exist, and it would also be desirable for the Inner Swiss not to preempt the [Protestants] with a depiction. By explaining the backgrounds of these wars, it could be made clear to posterity that the [Protestants] had good reasons to undertake these wars. If such an account is moderately designed, it is even hoped that it would please the opponents, the former friends and allies (especially those who are attracted to the religion [of the Protestants]). Such a depiction should be written now, but only published much later. Stumpf would be the suitable man for this, and Vadian would be willing (if he lives longer and finds the time) to help him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Vadian already wonders how [Bullinger and Stumpf] will handle his rather long but useful depiction of the abbots. Should they only use excerpts from it, Vadian requests that copies be made and the manuscript returned to him. In this case, it would be nice if the records from the time of Abbot Kuno [von Stoffeln] [i.e., from 1379], even from [his predecessor] Georg [von Wildenstein] [i.e., from 1360], to Diethelm [Blarer von Wartensee] were included. However, if [Bullinger and Stumpf] decide to print [the entire work], Vadian would no longer need his manuscript.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. You finally have, most esteemed man, my abbots, or rather not mine, but those of the times, who were first fathers and teachers of that kind, then, through love of wealth which they had fled, became dynasts and monarchs imposed upon the churches of believers, with such variety and obstinacy of minds and pursuits, that it is worthwhile to know even the bad and wicked ones (since history remembers the bad no less than the good). However, I have listed them in order and noted in which year each abbot was elected, for the sole reason that the events and deeds of each year might be attributed and narrated more clearly; these have been noted with as much brevity as possible. I attribute nothing to the religion introduced by the doctrines of men, except that I show everywhere that they did not keep faith in fulfilling that profession, to which they even bound themselves by sacraments. I suggest that good men and teachers of honest and Christian discipline should be tolerated and even praised, and seen as worthy of the liberality of magnates, if they had devoted all their efforts to a more exact regulation of life in a free monastery, in the manner of the ancients, and to learning good arts and doctrines, and had not fallen into those redeemable works, which are far from the most sordid gain and Christian charity. This, I think, is the praise of monasticism in my abbots, this alone is the glory of the monks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is certainly not a jot that attributes anything to superstition; rather, I criticize what seemed to have been fabricated by them in their manner and for the sake of capturing a little glory from trifles, and what seemed to have been taken from the writings of their predecessors. I propose many things called into question to the judgment of the reader, so that he may follow and hold what he wishes; but in the meantime, I openly suggest what I wish, feel, aim for, and what he himself ought to hold, if he is to listen to me. For I was compelled, with as much diligence as I could, to take care not to criticize anything too boldly or freely or to carry it up and down, more than a moderate and Christ-dedicated mind would allow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And since I have labored not only for people of our opinion but also for readers of different religions, a method had to be maintained by which we could be somewhat approved by them. Nothing has been detracted from the genuine truth, nor has anything been criticized or detracted in such a way (although some things deserved it) that any business could easily bring me reproach. What displeased me greatly was that this inflated and arrogant kind of people, having left the nest, flew out into the world, admitting no kind of vice, so that no regard seemed to have been had for the name, profession, rule, and discipline of the fathers, nor for the oath and promise of their purpose. Yet I seemed to have attacked and accused this perfidy in such a way that I would not easily stir the bile of any fair reader, who is led by just causes not to approve of what was unjustly admitted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But to leave these things aside: I aimed at nothing more than to note some things about the course of those ages for the common reader, which are not unworthy of knowledge and not very well known throughout our Thurgau, yet are certain and true and encompass the origins of our city and the district of Appenzell, then a few monuments taken from old charters, pertaining to the common knowledge of the times; which we have placed both in Latin, so that they might be held in greater faith, and in German, so that nothing might be lacking for those eager for our native matters. In interpreting many words, rites, rights, and institutions, we have put some effort and followed a certain teaching, as about the advocacies of those times and about some other observations of the middle times, which will pave the way for the reader, even a little learned, to understand many things among the chroniclers, which are otherwise very obscure. However, it was done by industry, not by chance, that I wrote some German names in various ways, because they are also derived variously from the etymology. Ulrich is commonly written, which some explain as Huldrich, that is, gracious, others as Wolrich or Vuolrich, that is, well-rich. But know that I am not careless in orthography.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For the meditation on things holds me so much while writing and commenting that I rarely look up to draw the lines, and he who is to copy anything from there will need great care; but perhaps this work could be transferred to others without fault and deserves excuse for the haste intercepted by perpetual business. However the die may fall regarding the indication of this my labor, I am certain (which I can easily boast to you and our Stumpf out of my love for both) that the history of Upper Thurgau, which is drawn from Abbot Konrad to Diethelm, is nowhere described with as much faith as I have sought it from its sources. Others have also written in Latin about the earlier ones from Ottomayr to the death of Konrad; but what the history of these is like compared to mine, it will be yours to judge. Indeed, I have not imitated these alone, but I have been greatly aided by the library of the monastery and by several examples of old tables, but also by the reading of trivial booklets of the monastery. In a subject (I confess) almost ignoble, but yet, as far as the history of the times is concerned, worthy of knowledge, I found a chronicle written in German about Wilhelm, Berchtold, Georg, etc., in the archive of the hospital, nor do I doubt that Mr. Stumpf has seen something similar. However, almost all of Kuno and after him Heinrich, whom the Synod of Constance gave as abbots, furthermore Eglolph, Gaspar, Wolrich, Gothard, Francis, Kilian, etc., are mine alone and are most worthy of knowledge for the history of the last more or less hundred years now first emerging. I offer and submit all these to your judgment, so that, if the material is deemed worthy of light, it may be published, if not, it may return to me. For whatever labor this was, it was expended for your favor; but the study of truth was the cause, by which I was more willingly gratified to you, and I confess I was equally stirred by the zeal to help the fatherland, so that (since the most convenient opportunity had been offered), I might not seem to be idle even in great business. However, I would prefer plebeian readers and listeners to Bullinger and Stumpf, and not rarely did that Cecilian saying occur to me while writing, which is read in the preface of Pliny's Natural History: "I do not want the most learned of all, Persius, I want Laelius Decimus; for that labor will benefit the mediocre and those otherwise little acquainted with the times, who, if I am not mistaken, will confess to have obtained fruitful reading."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have described my homeland a little more extensively; but I have described it truthfully and allowed nothing to ambition. I have also vindicated it and asserted it from servitude. For it had been so defamed and obscured for several years by the arts, counsels, calumnies, and insults of certain monks, that it seemed not of its own right, but entirely a slave and servant of the abbots. Nor do I doubt that you also most candidly favor my homeland, nor that Stumpf is of any other mind towards it, nor even Froschauer. For who would doubt about the consuls and senate of Zurich, who love and cherish us and ours in so many ways? Whose favor, I think, will be more inclined, the less dark are the things we have written about the dark monks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>We could have insisted more sharply in many places for the sake of religion; yet we did not want to accuse ourselves of any excess. It was also not my duty nor my office to correct their error; with time, one water will run away with another. The abbots have reserved their religion to themselves, that is, that their stewards should not burden themselves with it, but only with external justices; for with faith he has drawn himself under the chair of Rome and has excepted the same with express words in the castle and land rights and in the captaincy letter, that nothing is owed to him in matters of faith. Nor can the castle right be revoked or renounced for any reason, but must remain forever, and the abbot is obliged to be obedient and compliant to the four places. For these are expressly provided for in the letters of the city and the rights of the districts. But I have used all discretion, so that nothing is taken from the truth and no temptation is allowed to arise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>That I inserted the years and fortunes of emperors and kings in some places was done deliberately. For although I certainly knew that nothing was omitted by Mr. Stumpf in its proper places, where he pursues the nomenclature of kings, yet it was necessary to remember these, both because the abbots were subject and sworn to them for many centuries, and also because a certain light and as it were life is added to the deeds, if it is shown in a few words under which monarchs and in what state of times and events each thing was done, said, and acted. Any history narrated nakedly and simply is half-dead, if you do not mix with it the light of public times and above all of the princes, who are the sources of actions and affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Indeed, the mention of kings and august emperors led me to the mention of bishops, who first began to embrace the emperors recently created by them in Rome, having rejected the native and true, namely the eastern monarchs, soon began to persecute those very ones whom they had pursued with all honor with internal hatreds, ambition growing, and finally began to remove them entirely from Italy. For it is better that these things are not entirely hidden from the common people and the populace, even if I would not want everything to be clear to them. For I would fear that in the cause of the Roman pontiffs the populace, fully instructed about their arts, would not rather use the Tenedia axe (as it is said) than any other more moderate means of aiding piety.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>It would also seem advisable to me that a successor be given to Stumpf, at least until he could complete that work of his with the utmost care. This could be done with no labor and almost no expense in autumn. But you will decide about him yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Kessler anxiously desires that what I have written about monasticism and the state of monasteries be published privately; for he would like my trifles to be read by many. And it could be done that, inserted in the chronicle work, they might finally be published privately or (to speak correctly) separately. But it will also be yours to decide about that.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Mr. Stumpf will do well if in the preliminary or dedicatory letter he uses some careful apology with a captation of goodwill: that everything is written for the honor of truth, to harm no one, but to open to everyone what has happened most faithfully, and to spare everyone from seeing; and that the intention in these books is to set faith right, although it is shown here and there what agrees with this or that faith and what has been in use and practice in each of the next thousand years, what has been done and left undone; moreover, from what causes those are moved who are eager and ready for the improvement of Christian life and state, for a common reformation or improvement, especially of the clergy (who should be examples and leaders of others). In which message every reader should let that please him which he wishes to be most acceptable to him in matters of his faith; that should be free for everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The first sections and the last I have written twice; but the middle ones I did not want to write out cleanly, namely from Konrad von Bussnang to Abbot Ulrich the last. But I have reviewed them, hoping that if it should come to print, one would easily be able to manage from there. Many small things will be seen that I have noted; as in Abbot Kaspar, how caretaker Ulrich transacted with him in Rome. From this, however, one sees with what temptation and intrigues the monks have been involved and how loyal they have been to each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>In Abbot Franz I used a new form and wrote an annal, which was not done without reason. For I would not want anything to be changed or omitted there, although I have added some external things; but not even in Wolrich, than which I do not know if there was any more notable monster. But I will easily yield to your judgment. I did not extend the acts of our times beyond the year of Christ 1532, that is, the second year of Diethelm. However, it would be better to write down the wars recently held, namely those which the cities waged with the districts, without long delay, while the memory is fresh and with the letters and tables made, sent back and forth, someone could be helped by your work; nor should it be committed that we concede that province to any Immontano, who might preempt us. However, if I am not mistaken, the whole history could be written from its causes and origins in such a way, both truly and freely, that posterity would have no doubt that our people were moved by the most just causes to undertake those things; and also a moderation of style could be applied, which would be approved not only by the enemies then, but also by friends and brothers in the future (especially if our religion begins to please them). It would be better to write it now, but to publish it much later, first privately, then publicly. Stumpf would be wonderfully suited for this. If I could, aided by ours, gratify him, I would do it with a ready mind, but in leisure and gradually (provided the Lord grants me a longer life).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I do not know how you will proceed with these abbots, since they are quite long, and yet in my opinion not an unuseful reading. But if it should please Mr. Stumpf and you beforehand to take from it and to place here and there, etc.: I ask you to have it copied in such a way that my exemplar remains clean and whole. And if you wish to proceed in that way, then do so well and let the last abbots remain for the sake of the history of the land of Appenzell and our city of St. Gall, namely Abbot Kuno and all following up to Diethelm, as they are written, so that the histories of our region may also be clearly recognized and read; I would also like to have Abbot Jörg. But if you print the whole bloodletting, then I do not care about the exemplar. Whatever you consider best, let it happen.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gall, in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the renowned city of Zurich, his lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
