      <p>Greetings. Due to the hurried departure, it was not possible to write, dearest Bullinger; but I did not want to keep it from you that we have achieved everything we desired, through legal means, according to our intentions; and we had judges from all the districts who were so humane, wise, just, and equitable, that it seems this matter fell not by any man's counsel, but clearly by the providence of the Lord. Indeed, Mayor Lavater conducted himself so magnificently and wisely that he has gained immortal gratitude among our people. But more on that later. Now, on behalf of our city, I give you the greatest thanks for assisting us with your diligence. The Lord will be your reward, and one day our council will repay the favor, always remembering you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the 9th day of September, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your friend from the heart, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, supreme lord and friend.</p>
