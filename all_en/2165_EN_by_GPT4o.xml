      <p>Greetings. Your very long letters, which are most delightful to me, are all the more welcome. I do not doubt that you and other good men have grieved, not only when you understood what the Bishop of Winchester, the Emperor's agent, is plotting, but also when you perceived much graver matters from the course of events itself. But it is more to be lamented that no one's eyes are opened, indeed that the very instruments of tyranny are eagerly handed over to those same Spaniards, whose name they pretend they cannot even bear. There is no one in Germany who does not deplore the state of the times and truly admits to understanding that all these twists and turns lead to the point where the Spaniards always have more power in the empire than the laws and institutions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they either humbly or submissively obey, or, even if divine help were to shine upon them, they do not stir themselves; thus, the inertia and sluggishness of this age have occupied their minds. What is scarcely bearable: if either my king or other princes, even against their will, were to open a way to be rescued from the most wretched servitude, they are so far from recognizing the benefit that they reject and restrain those who bring help. Therefore, I see not only that the politician must yield to the times, but also that a different spirit must be adopted, so that we do not afflict ourselves in vain with complaints and miseries. May God grant, my dear Bullinger, that the desires of some may not have so much power among you that you offer anything from your liberty to that Emperor. They know (believe me) the recesses of the mind by which they might conquer, and if one way does not succeed, they will attempt another.</p>
      <p>I write hastily, as in the greatest hurry; but you understand well enough what I mean. I hear that conditions of peace have been proposed to the Margrave, indeed quite fair ones, but which he did not even want to hear. From this, people conjecture that he hopes for some support from my king. You see how flexible suspicions are. Previously, as it truly was, they said he depended entirely on the Emperor; now they fear the king. However, I assure you of one or the other; either my king will never use his services, which I believe more, or at least negotiations will be conducted first, so as not to harass Germany. For it is contrary to our interests to expose that weakness, already broken by its own forces, to the wolves.</p>
      <p>The Count of Mansfeld and the others of the evangelical party will not allow the forces of the Bishop of Brunswick and others to grow under the pretense of subduing the Margrave. Something similar can also be transferred to Lower Germany.</p>
      <p>In this matter, which is very obscure to me, I use this conjecture; if you have anything better, share it or use it. - The Pope wants his brother's son to marry the daughter of the Duke of Florence. Good deed; something will be torn from the empire, or Juno, the matchmaker, deceives me. In Corsica, both sides are struggling, the Genoese due to a lack of money, and our people in some places due to a lack of supplies. The port and city of Bonifacio can be held along with some other surrounding towns, so that the situation flows most unfortunately, and through these, the domination of the whole island. Rizzius is going to your people to attempt something new. He has promised to return to us if he succeeds, a truly courteous man, who does not refuse this hospitality despite being so poorly received. As soon as anything new happens, I will inform you. Greetings to Lord Laelius, much more to Vergerio, since, as I see, he needs it. I am yours and very much so. Farewell. Chur, in great haste, 13 days before the calends of February. Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
