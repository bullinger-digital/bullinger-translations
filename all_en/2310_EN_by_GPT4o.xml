      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you, venerable brother, a few days ago and sent a bundle of letters that had been sent to me in Strasbourg. Now I am sending you letters from my son-in-law along with letters to our Mainardus, the minister of the church in Chur, which I ask you to send to him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>This will be most pleasing to my son-in-law, to me, and to Augustine himself. Farewell. Regarding the affairs of England, I believe you have heard that King Philip is arriving with great forces. The English who are abroad have been ordered not to stay in Lutheran cities or in France, but in Italy. Six thousand Englishmen, led by a certain nobleman, have gone to France to the king, ready to carry out orders. That tyrant of England, the Bishop of Winchester, has been accused of treason by the council; the queen did not admit the accusation or, if she did, she said she forgave him because of his many merits towards her. The Emperor is said to have great forces in the Netherlands, and the French likewise. Thus you see everything is full of troubles. Let us pray to the Lord that in so many troubles He may defend and preserve His church. Once again, farewell with your entire holy family. Greet the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 12, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, C[oelius] S[ecundus] signed.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother, Antistes of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
