      <p>S. D. If only there were more of such counselors to your king, who would impress upon him what you are accustomed to remind him. For thus there would be more peace in the kingdom, and all things would be both happier and more stable. You know from histories repeated from the beginning of the world that God, the most just, has at all times most severely punished those who have shed innocent blood, especially that of His faithful. Nor do I think that any innovators, disturbers of public tranquility, schismatics, or heretics should be spared. However, it was fitting that a fair examination of causes be made, and that judgment be passed on each matter from its own sources, and that the guilty be punished in the manner prescribed by the Lord according to the nature of each crime committed. I know and indeed experience daily that many cover their most shameful desires with the holy name of religion, whom, I am sure, the Lord Himself would punish, even if the hands of princes were at rest. Meanwhile, it was altogether fitting that a holy distinction be maintained between the innocent and the guilty. Solomon in Proverbs says: "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the just, both are an abomination to the Lord." But who does not know that to be an abomination to God is the utmost misfortune and misery? Therefore, counselors who truly and sincerely love the king, protect and increase the king's happiness, and care for the safety of the entire kingdom, would work faithfully in this matter, so that, as you earnestly desire with a holy vow, a serious decision would finally be made about religion, namely from the very sources, not from the pools and perplexing opinions of men. And unless this is done at some point, we expect nothing other than certain destruction.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our religion and doctrine are disapproved by your learning mainly because we have given too much rein to the people, so that now they hold religion in derision and indulge securely in every kind of vice. But you know, most excellent man, that in the ages of the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, the people were altogether such, and indeed the people who had given their name to the Lord, whom you rightly blame for living licentiously in our age. For both the prophets and the apostles, and even the Son of God, our Savior, waged a perpetual war with them. You are not unaware of what they blamed in the people of God: certainly, gross negligence, shameful inertia, impious security, and the most foul lust for committing all kinds of crimes, impiety, and Epicureanism. But this shameful life was not a fraud to pure truth; no one shunned the preaching of truth because of the disobedience or rebellion of the licentious, except for the Julians, Porphyrys, and Lucians. The integrity of the church consists chiefly in the sincerity of faith and true doctrine. What is more, in that very age there were many in the church who, by the purity of their lives, expressed the purest doctrine and declared their faith by their deeds, such as, by the grace of God, not a few remain in our age. For in those churches, which the Lord has willed us to serve, there are the sheep of Christ who are not ungrateful to the Redeemer, who indeed abhor all impiety, who detest that licentious life of the pseudo-faithful, and strive to serve God in faith, hope, and charity, and to prove themselves to God by daily repentance. Here I do not wish to boast insolently, but having weighed the morals of both the papal and our church, I do not shrink from a better judgment before a fair judge, so that the tree may be judged by its fruits. But what wonder is it that in our age we see such corruption of the common people, when the minds of men, otherwise corrupt by nature, have so swelled through that Pharisaic and papal leaven by the habit of sin, that now, as of old, that saying of Jeremiah applies: "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good, who are accustomed to do evil," - finally, when the Lord Himself has expressly foretold us through the apostles what kind of men the last age will have? Not that I think these things must happen by fatal necessity because they were foretold by the Lord, but because He, foreseeing the extreme wickedness of the age, predicted it for the benefit of the faithful, so that the pious would not be offended by them, the impious would be hindered, and all would proceed eagerly in the way of the Lord. Therefore, those who read the sacred scriptures and consider the wickedness of men, attribute the blame for crimes not to the preaching of the word, but to the insuperable hardness of men. Certainly, we have never loosened nor do we loosen the reins given by the Lord to the people, the many-headed beast, but we now preach with that severity, according to our strength and the grace granted by the Lord, with which we see it was once preached by apostolic example. Moreover, we labor as much as we can for the discipline of Christ to prevail. Do not, therefore, be offended by the excessive freedom of some. For there were many such even in the age of Christ, to whom, however, the Lord had not loosened the reins, nor did He have those which some in later ages applied to govern the people. But we teach true freedom not as doing anything at will, but as obeying God according to the guidance of the divine Spirit. For thus Zechariah sang, that being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we might serve Him in righteousness and holiness all the days of our life. To which we also refer that word of the Lord: "If the Son makes you free, you are truly free," and again that of the apostle: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." Therefore, where this is not, what remains but shameful servitude? Nor is there any reason for slaves to boast of Christian freedom; they have the apostle who refutes them, rebuking them, Rom. 6.</p>
      <p>But what greatly troubles your mind is that we have so much renounced the authority, which should prevail greatly in the ministers of the church, that now, being reduced to order, we cannot rebuke, restrain, or finally uphold the dignity of the word.</p>
      <p>However, with your permission, I will say that we have never weakened nor do we wish to loosen today any authority received through the scriptures from the Lord. For we read that the authority and power of ministers consist in the clear words of the Lord and the apostles: He gave the keys, the instruments of binding and loosing; the apostles of Christ establish the authority of ministers in pure doctrine, in holy constancy, in the freedom of speech, and in the sanctity of life, not in any external pomp. Of which the brevity of a letter does not allow more copious discussion now.</p>
      <p>But we desire in every way to preserve that power and authority intact in the church. Nor indeed has anyone reduced us to order. We obey indeed the holy magistrate according to the precept of the apostle Rom. 13. and according to the teaching of John Chrysostom explaining that place; but we obey up to the altars, mindful of that Petrine, or rather divine, sentence: "We must obey God rather than men."</p>
      <p>Therefore, if it should happen to us, as it happened to the most sacred prophet Isaiah, that princes command us to speak pleasing things, we reply to them what he could have impressed upon us earlier; you know the place Isaiah 30. Therefore, by the grace of God, we freely rebuke and reprove both the highest and the lowest, nor do we see any other dignity of the word of God to be asserted by us than that it be announced freely, sincerely, and constantly, but meanwhile prudently, even against the gates of hell, namely according to the apostolic canon, which is read in 2 Corinthians 10 and 2 Timothy 2 and 4. Thus indeed the apostles of the Lord asserted the dignity of the word and were not burdened by undergoing the danger of death for it, nor did the impious violate its dignity, who both trampled the word underfoot and slaughtered the preachers. Certainly, nothing from worldly wealth or honors is added to the ministry of the church and the word of God, as Paul testifies in 1 Corinthians 1. Meanwhile, I willingly confess that both the ministers of Christ and the churches are found, among whom your words may find some place; I confess also that in ourselves there are many things that need holy amendment. But we should not look at the deeds and weakness of men, but at the commands of the Lord, and strive to establish all our affairs according to them. If wrong examples present themselves, it will be our duty to think of providing better ones.</p>
      <p>I perhaps address these things to your prudence more verbosely; but you will forgive me this fault, if indeed I commit any fault here.</p>
      <p>For I love you sincerely, my most esteemed lord, and therefore, taking the opportunity offered by you, I speak more freely with you, nor do I aim at anything here other than the glory of our common God and the eternal salvation of both. Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, the last of June, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Bullinger. To the most illustrious man, Lord Jean Du Fraisse, ambassador of the most Christian King of the French among the Rhaetians, Bishop of Bayonne, his most esteemed lord. Chur.</p>
