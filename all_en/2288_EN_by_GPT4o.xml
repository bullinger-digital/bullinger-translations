      <p>Greetings. It has now been nine months, most esteemed compater, that I have endured the squalor of prison. In the meantime, however, I have written many letters to you through pious men, so that those who have left here for the cause of the Christian religion might, by the appeal of my letters, move your piety and all the other learned men of your church to be inclined and merciful towards those wretched and calamitous people. I have written briefly, as I could, because, as I wished, it was not permitted, nor is it now permitted, as I write secretly, as you know the misery of captives to be. Yet you have not replied to me with any letters, even the briefest, as far as I know. For this reason, I am very sorrowful. You know, if I am not mistaken, how much I value you; I have always held you in the place of a most esteemed father and teacher; among all your most devoted, you have never found anyone dearer than me, nor have I, to testify the truth, ever acquired a more candid friend. Those who have brought letters from me to you since the death of the most pious king have been most dear friends and brothers; but the one who brings these to you is Mr. Jacob Haddon, not only a most dear friend and brother in Christ, but also one whom I have always esteemed in every way for his exceptional learning and virtue. Nor do I think I have known anyone in England endowed with a more candid piety towards God, or more removed from the desire for perishable things, which foolish men admire. I commend him most dutifully to your piety.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your most dear wife, your children, and your entire household, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Pellican, and all the ministers of your church, Mr. Lavater the consul, and your entire city. I would write more openly if I dared; but I have often been deceived by friends. From prison, May 23, 1554.</p>
      <p>Soon, unless the Lord restrains the tyranny of our enemies, we will migrate in the blood of Christ to heaven.</p>
      <p>Yours as always and formerly, John Hooper, always most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the most sacred church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>"Letters of Mr. Hooper, Bishop of Worcester, from chains on May 23, 1554."</p>
