      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter, written in Zürich on the fourth day of March, was delivered to me not long ago. Although it was somewhat mournful and complaining, it seemed very pleasant to me, not only because it was from you, whose every writing and word has always seemed honorable to me, but also because it so earnestly demanded my duty and stirred up my negligence and sloth in writing. Indeed, my most revered father and lord, although I may write to you less often than I would like, I do not neglect this duty whenever any opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>For I recently sent you two letters, one to Frankfurt for the March fair, and another immediately after Easter. If they are still, as often happens, delayed on the way, they will eventually, as I hope, reach you. Meanwhile, I never cease to think of you and speak of you honorably, as I ought.</p>
      <p>To write to you about French affairs at this time might be somewhat tedious, for everything is brought to you even without winds and ships. The most holy one will leave nothing untried.</p>
      <p>If he cannot bend the heavens, he will move Acheron: for he sees that it is no longer a matter of trifles, but of life and blood. I wish that our people would not allow themselves to be deceived! The Duke of Guise, by some hope of moderating religion and accepting the Augsburg Confession, has delayed the German princes from joining this war; in the same way, he has tried by all means to persuade our queen that the matter in France is not about religion; that it is a manifest conspiracy, and that it is the king's cause, which she, holding a royal position, should not oppose. Meanwhile, he has arranged for his niece, the Queen of Scots, to seek the favor and friendship of our queen, sending gifts and making some promises: that she wishes to come to England this summer for the sake of honor, and to establish an eternal bond of friendship that can never be broken. She sent a diamond of great value, a very beautiful gem, adorned all around with gold, and accompanied by a beautiful and elegant poem. What do you ask? They thought that by summer meetings, hunting, and flattery, they could easily distract our minds from the noise of war and lull us to sleep. Meanwhile, our queen, having suspected the whole matter and understood what was being done, for it was not so difficult, changed her mind about the journey, gradually alienated herself from the Guises, and inclined not obscurely towards Prince Condé. The Duke of Guise took it badly that his plans were not succeeding; he received our ambassador contemptuously, publicly proclaimed edicts that the Queen of England was plotting against the kingdom of France, and that she alone had stirred up these tumults. Our queen could not bear this patiently, nor indeed should she have.</p>
      <p>She immediately acted openly, recalled the ambassador, as I hear, enlisted soldiers, ordered all ships, wherever and whosever they were, to set sail, so that no one could leave, and to report what was happening. Oh, if only she had wanted to do this earlier, or if now the German princes would follow this example! The whole matter could be settled more easily and with less shedding of Christian blood. And indeed, the queen has sent to the German princes at this time; and now there is an ambassador from the Duke of Guise at court, with new, I suppose, flatteries, to delay and hinder us. But it will not be so easy, I hope, to deceive those who see.</p>
      <p>The Scottish affairs concerning religion are quite settled. The queen alone retains her mass against the will of all.</p>
      <p>This whole year there has been incredible intemperance of the sky and air with us. Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor winter, nor spring, nor summer, nor autumn has performed its duty sufficiently. It has rained so abundantly and almost without interruption, as if the sky could do nothing else. From this contagion, monsters have been born: infants with horribly deformed bodies, some entirely without heads, others with foreign heads; some trunks without arms, without shins, without legs; others with only bones, entirely without any flesh, like the images of death that are often painted. Many similar things have been born from pigs, mares, cows, and hens.</p>
      <p>The harvest at this time has indeed been somewhat meager with us, yet not so much that we can complain greatly. Johannes Burcher has recently returned to us, very afflicted and miserable, as it seems to me; I have promised him whatever I can, although I hear that he did not leave Zürich very honorably.</p>
      <p>I sent to Mr. Martyr 10 French crowns, which I wish to be used at your and his discretion for a public feast. I beg you to consider this small gift, whatever it is, kindly, and to commend our churches to the Lord in your prayers. Greet that excellent woman, your wife, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Josias, Mr. Ghesner, Mr. Wolphius, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Wickius, Mr. Haller, Mr. Frisius, Mr. Guldebeck in my name. Farewell, my most revered father and lord in Christ.</p>
      <p>Salisbury, August 14, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Jewel, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zürich, his most revered lord. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>The gem speaks:</p>
      <p>It is not the material that makes me proud, That I am invincible by iron, by fire, Nor the spotless whiteness, the brilliance, Nor the light of clarity nor the art of the master, Who gave this form, elegantly adorned with gold, -</p>
      <p>But that I express so surely the heart of my lady, That if the heart could be seen with open eyes, The heart would be seen more surely than the eyes.</p>
      <p>Let there be firm constancy in both hearts, Let there be spotless whiteness, brilliance, Let there be light of clarity, hiding no deceit within, In short, let everything be equal except For one hardness.</p>
      <p>Then this is the second step of favorable fortune for me, That I hope to see such a heroine, As I had no hope of seeing once my former lady was left behind.</p>
      <p>Oh, if fortune would make it so, that this chain of adamantine hearts May not be broken by suspicion, rivalry, Envy, hatred, or old age.</p>
      <p>I am happier than all gems, I am clearer than all gems, I am dearer than all gems, As I am harder than all gems.</p>
      <p>Tetrastichon.</p>
      <p>This heart, which sent you, had nothing that could be clearer to itself, more pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>But if by chance you send yours back, she will think it clearer to herself than it was before to you.</p>
