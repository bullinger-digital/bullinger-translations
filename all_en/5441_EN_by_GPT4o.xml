      <p>Greetings. What I knew, reverend father in Christ, about the abbot of Eremi, I have already informed you and I believe my letters have reached you. Our people affirm that he is indeed on his return, where he is said to be lying ill on the road, which my relative reports from you, I have not yet learned. What you heard about the scarcity of grain in Italy is true, but whether the council was dissolved for those reasons, I cannot easily say. I wrote to Mr. Traversius a few days ago and hope to learn the truth from there soon.</p>
      <p>The day before yesterday, citizens of Trento, cattlemen, were here, but their arrival was announced to me when they had already left; they said nothing about the dissolution, but consistently affirmed that there is great scarcity of everything there. And when asked what the fathers were doing in the council, they replied that they did not know, except that they were indulging their bellies and taking care of their skin, and that in recent weeks Cardinal Ems had struck a Spanish bishop with three blows in a crowded assembly of fathers. This rumor has spread throughout Trento and nearby Italy.</p>
      <p>When asked about the cause, they denied knowing any other than what was commonly said, that the Spaniard had reproached Ems for being unskilled in the Latin language, which was necessary for the business conducted in Latin. This is what they said.</p>
      <p>This is what I heard from those who heard it in the inn, and from the innkeeper himself.</p>
      <p>Further, I know that a letter has come into my hands, which Gilg Tschudi wrote on August 15 to the governor Dietegen in the courts (the letter, as I suspect, was deliberately delivered to me; for Dietegen sent it to the cathedral provost; from there it was brought to me by Mr. Philipp Valentinus, who once dined with Mr. Muralt, now entirely among the clergy and, as we have noticed enough, a good fellow. But this is for you; we are observing the man.</p>
      <p>However, you may warn our good friends, who trust him with all secrets, in secret about this rogue; for the good brothers from Geneva write to him diligently, not knowing that he is such a notorious scoundrel, as we have sufficiently experienced and found. This man, I say, brought it, asked me to express the meaning of the letters in Latin; he pretended to do it without the knowledge of the provost; but it was done with their advice, to provoke me in this way; for why else would the provost give German letters to an Italian?) This letter is very bitter and sharp.</p>
      <p>Its sum and content is this: firstly, he has forgiven here in Chur at the wedding, how the Prince of Condé has tripped up the old believers (this term is repeated several times in the letters); now he lets them know that the Prince of Condé has broken the peace, has not kept his promise; for the other lords with him, like the admiral and others, have so highly praised his promises, that they accused him of being a traitor, so he turned away from the old believers again.</p>
      <p>Thus the rascal covers his lie, which he said here, with another lie. Further, Frölich writes on July 24 from the camp (his letter was read in Lucerne before the envoys), how they have happily come to the other forces, that the soldiers are so joyful and willing, as he can hardly remember. For there are a large number of French on horse and foot, about 1500 German horses, also two regiments of landsknechts, the Count of Ring with his regiment has not yet come to them.</p>
      <p>But he has informed them by post that he will be with them within 5 days. Further, on the day he (Frölich) wrote this letter, a nobleman came, reported how 4000 Spaniards and 4000 Gascons, about 8000, are coming next through the kingdom of Navarre; the Gascons are led by Mr. Tarrides, and he thinks that when they come together like this, they will accomplish much in a short time. Also, the Prince of Condé is staying in Orléans; his people are frightened, a great lord has fallen from him these days, many are falling from him daily, hoping to come to grace with the queen and the king. They are also conquering many places, giving the disobedient their due.</p>
      <p>After all this, Tschudi triumphs and adds: "So it should go; one must do to the Lutherans as the one from Büren; one must teach them to fast and celebrate. These are from Frölich's letters." Further, he writes that it was written to him from Lucerne on the day when the 7 places announced their escort to Mr. Coignet, as they also wrote to the king. This was the sum of the letters, which I wanted to record here, not because I think you are affected by these or care about them, but so that you know what they think they know and why they insult us. But now they carry victory in their hands; for they have made a pact with death; it cannot fail them. In the meantime, you see the remarkable malevolence of this man, you see the rascal applauded among us, among whom he is remarkable, whom I recently painted in his true colors, who nevertheless pretends wonderfully, neglects no sermon, always has the gospel in his mouth, who, if he were not already known to me inside and out from his virtues, if the royal envoy had not already described him to me in his true colors, would undoubtedly deceive me. Now if things were brought to a crisis, he would be the first to retreat; but he must choke on it, he must not let himself be noticed publicly, even if it breaks his heart. I have seen Dr. Lavater's recently published book and have read some of it; I congratulate you on having such sons-in-law, whom you leave behind as heirs of piety and doctrine after you. I also wish to see something soon that comes from your sons, who I hope will grow and succeed in their father's glory. I will write for those sessions to the Italian brothers; but you see yourself how negligent they are about these things; I will not fail in my duty. Farewell, reverend father, with all yours, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I met Mr. Tscharner; he says that these days Caesar Gallen's son from Constance, who is housed in Como, was with him, who, when asked about the soldiers, replied that he could not believe that the Pope would send many soldiers to France; for there is no money; it is true that he has raised a force, but not as large as is said here. From the Duchy of Milan, only runaway troops are drawn; the leaders who were taken away have no money; at first, it was said they should march on Genoa; but later, when a dispute arose between the Duke of Ferrara and the Florentine, they marched on Mantua; the same has it with the Florentine. The Florentine has taken a better position from the Ferrara.</p>
      <p>This is what he, who came the day before, said; the consul praises him for his faith and constancy. In the meantime, I came across Philipp Valentinus (for I pretend, break in, as much as seems good to me), who says it was written to him, he has taken a fortress in the Apennines; in short, he must have taken something.</p>
      <p>But, as I suspect, it will not be Riberra's. This same Mr. Philipp affirms that he was told and written for certain that several sessions of Brescia were printed there, he wrote there for them, but the response was that they were printed there and suppressed; the reason given is that the Pope does not want them to be published yet. I hear that the Pope does not agree with the council in everything, because they wanted to subject him to the council, and that point has not yet been resolved. Chur, August 24, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be greatly respected. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
