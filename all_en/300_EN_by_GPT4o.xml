      <p>S. Indeed, it is most justly arranged that those who do not wish to serve God freely must serve the harshest servitude in the world. I believe that on this very day the city has been occupied by the king's forces through some collusion with ours, which I humbly pray may be fortunate and auspicious for pious people. My brother, my German brother, also came here yesterday during dinner; C[onrad] Z[viccius] preceded him in the last few days by visiting his dying sister in Arbon, whom we now hear has been completely freed from the bonds of the body. Ah, how many Jeremiahs we would need to adequately and worthily lament this most mournful calamity, especially since everyone with a little foresight understands that even more terrible things than those present, although they are most terrible, are impending. May the Lord, whose mercy is without number, preserve us alive until we see a more pleasant state of affairs with the glory of His name. Our Curio himself will explain his efforts to you in person, but he understands that he also needs your recommendation to Haller to have more success; I earnestly beseech you not to deny him this. He is of a character, although more than sufficiently free, yet not malicious; his patron, to whom he was bound by certain reasons, granted him freedom again before Augsburg accepted this monstrous Interim, about which he will speak to you in person.</p>
      <p>My German brother respectfully sends you many greetings and would write himself if he were not now suffering greatly from the crudity of his stomach. He commends himself and our dear sister to your and your family's sacred prayers, which I especially do. I read with great pleasure in your letters that Christ is extending the borders of His kingdom among others, although it pains me greatly in the meantime that due to our execrable ingratitude, such disgrace is taken from us and we always act worse than before.</p>
      <p>I congratulate not so much him as us and the whole Church of Christ on the rescue of the most holy man Brentius from the lion's jaws. Greet Musculus, a very learned and pious man, along with our Gervasius, who is distinguished by the Lord's uncommon gifts, very dutifully in my brother's and my words, especially your household with the English and the treasurer and others who love us in the Lord, especially your ministers in the work of the Lord. Farewell, my soul, venerable and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, 13th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>We are waiting every hour from Konstanz to hear how things have gone. If it is not taken today, it will happen tonight or tomorrow; it is thought that all are blind practices, also concerning the Confederates; they have been advised to remain quiet in Thurgau.</p>
      <p>Ah, the great blindness, that such a matter is approved based on the trust of one single man, [Eck], without clarification of what the conditions or the oaths will be. The imperial negotiators have not been asked about it either; some do not want to know anything about it. In short: it is an incredible misery, at which all people should rightly be horrified; for judgment begins at the house of God.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger, very venerable and dearest brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
