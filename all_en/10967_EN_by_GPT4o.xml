    <p xml:id="regest1">Compared the revised version of the letter to Luther [by the Basel city clerk Ryhiner] with the original, insists on the correctness of the latter, and reports how the wording [at the meeting from November 12-14] came about; he and Leo [Jud] cannot agree to the proposed change, which also does not correspond to the position of Bern. Warns against machinations that, for the sake of the hoped-for agreement [with the Wittenbergers], endanger the proven unity [of the Swiss churches]. Greetings. Inquires for [Nicholas Partridge] about a travel opportunity to the Antwerp fair.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Beloved lord and brother, I have received your letter along with the attached copies of the preface to Doctor Martin Luther. And as I read it together with Master LÃ¶we, I was surprised that something was thought to be unclear and disordered, which perhaps came into the separation through the carelessness of the scribes. Now, I do not know what each one has written. But I do know that the separation given to you in Basel matches the original. I still have the original, as it was presented in our meeting and read aloud to all the messengers at the town hall. I have nothing to add to it. And when Bucer asked me in the city clerk's house not to change anything but to let it remain, I replied that he should see me as another person. For I freely acknowledge that if I had dictated otherwise than it stood in the original, I would have acted dishonestly. But I read it as we had agreed. Thus stands our separation. And the preface now sent to us has exactly the order and sentence as ours, except that some things are omitted, some are expressed with other words. But in the end, where the crux lies, our separation reads: "[...] we could not see otherwise than what we have previously taught and believed among us. Therefore, if your opinion is (as we do not doubt), it is not understood otherwise than that it is in accordance with our faith and our confession and not contrary to it, that we will also continue to teach thus." So many are the words of the separation; they are also clear. It has been discussed among us. And Bucer adds the word "in accordance with." Just as he did not want before that one should say, Luther considered that we would well tolerate his articles "beside our confession," and wanted one to say "by our confession"; your copy has completely omitted this. But the words, as mentioned above and included in our separation as an answer, are taken from the Bernese answer and our instruction, so that we did neither too much nor too little. They are also intentionally set thus. What stands in your copy could more easily be interpreted as if, regardless of our confession, we had completely subscribed to Luther's articles. For your words sound thus: "we could not see otherwise than what we have previously taught and believed among us, and will also continue to teach, therefore we let the presented articles, after their elucidation mentioned above, be considered as Christian." These words are very sharp and pressing, quite different from ours. Whatever may be the case, it is not appropriate for us now to change with our, that is, Leo's and my voice, what has been publicly agreed upon, exactly in the form also set in the separation, read at home before the council and citizens, and kept in such form among the other city affairs. You know yourself what kind of people we have, and what accusations, however small they may be, could be brought. You write how awkwardly Bern answered. Now, in their answer, it stands word for word thus: "We do not see those articles in any way contrary to our Basel confession (which Luther also acknowledged and accepted as Christian with the most beloved lords and brothers of Strasbourg), which makes it easy for us to bear them by our confession and consider them to be Christian." Should it now be changed behind their backs, you have to consider what they would say about me. Therefore, I let the writing remain, especially in this point, as it is, and answer thus for myself and Leo. Besides, if you want to take the burden upon yourself and send this form, it will be up to you. We did not want to present it to our lords, so that they would not become unwilling or suspicious or perhaps otherwise engage in much disputation over it.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to take good care that we are not separated. Oh, how the devil would rejoice, how our enemies would be encouraged! Beloved lord and brother, be vigilant! There are very strange machinations at play. I wish I were with you for half an hour. I have also written to Bern to let the presented writing go. For we only recently heard their counsel. But bear with us and be patient. You must not always attach: "But if they have not changed their opinion, I understand ours will continue." Dear, my lord and brother, do not rush away from us. It stood even further behind in Rychstett than in Bern. Let us remain together and let the answer remain thus and send it once, whether to Strasbourg or Wittenberg. If you want to hold many more meetings, ask or separate from us, it will surely not lead to your or our benefit. But what kind of concord is it that we become discordant, who have always been the best friends and want to be diligent with those who are to be suspected of having no such disposition towards us as those before whom you rush.</p>
      <p>Understand my friendly, brotherly writing in the best way. You know from what disposition I speak, and if I could share my heart with you and your church, I would do so. With this, I commend you to God in His grace. Let us pray to Him that He may graciously guide us so that we remain in unity. We have once set a unanimous answer, let us remain with it. Leo greets you. Greet Grynaeus, Carolstadt, the city clerk, and other dear lords and brothers, especially Lord Jacob Meyer and Bernhard Meyer, etc.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours. I would like to hear from you exactly when a ship will be going to Strasbourg eight or fourteen days after Christmas. For my Anglus wants to go to Antwerp. The fair will be there on the purification.</p>
      <p>5th of December 1536.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, and faithful Lord Oswald Myconius, preacher in Basel, his dear and trusted lord and brother.</p>
