      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest Bullinger. I do not recall receiving any letters from you this year, and I am unsure whether you have received mine along with Agricola's book, which I sent through two young men. However, I believe you are very busy with the printing of the third Decade, and I have no doubt that in this book you will provide sermons on the matter of the Eucharist, on how this most holy matter should be presented to the simple people conveniently and beneficially.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg received the priests on the eve of Pentecost. They chant and perform mass, but with fear and trembling; the senate assigned soldiers to them, sixteen to each church, who patrol the temple armed from all sides, lest a tumult be stirred up by the people or rather by the children, who have so far mocked their superstition. Two defected to the priests to avoid losing ecclesiastical benefits; a third sang evening prayers with them and, when he returned home, began to go a little insane due to his troubled conscience and wanted to kill himself because of his defection from the known truth. Our churches prayed more than once for his salvation, and the Lord heard the prayers of ours, and he was restored to health. As soon as he regained his health, he sent the priests the choir robe through a boy, who threw that garment into the temple, saying to the priests: "My master has seen the judgment of the Lord coming upon you because of these blasphemies you have performed; he does not wish to partake in your sins and will never return to you, preferring to beg rather than to blaspheme God." The Emperor is still hiding in Brussels; when he will come to that assembly is unknown. The King of France has dismissed his army, and peace between the French and the English has been confirmed. The seed of the Gospel is being sown with great fruit in England. They say the King himself writes down the sermons of both Bucer and others in the temple with his own hand, then explains them at home to his courtiers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen him with His spirit. But hey, what do you think about our satire, which our Valentinus publicly performed? Is it appropriate for preachers to handle such matters?</p>
      <p>Merchants have bought almost all of Sundgau from King Ferdinand and are expelling the nobles and barons, which greatly displeases them. But it is well for those idle men, who are perpetual enemies of Christ and the Gospel. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Dr. Theodor, Pellican, and Rudolf, etc., along with your most chaste wife. Basel, June 5, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Write back at least a single line about your health and condition.</p>
      <p>To the true theologian Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
