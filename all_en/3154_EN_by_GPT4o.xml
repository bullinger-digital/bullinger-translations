      <p>Greetings. I could not refrain, reverend father, from writing at least a brief letter to you, both because my duty required it and because I noticed that you would like to know the state of our affairs and the church. As for the first point, I would be entirely ungrateful if I did not at least acknowledge the greatness of your merits towards me with a benevolent mention.</p>
      <p>Your many and great benefits towards me should have made you expect nothing less from me than what is customary to come from a grateful and loving person, especially one who loves you and yours. If my circumstances were not such that I could offer nothing beyond the testimony of due benevolence and gratitude. However, I will ensure that, if divine goodness ever favors my efforts, you will find that you have placed your merits in a grateful and mindful person.</p>
      <p>Regarding my own state and then the state of the church, you kindly inquired in your recent letters to me. Know, therefore, that with divine grace favoring me, I have not merely sailed to Wallenstadt with favorable winds and full sails, but almost flown there. At Wallenstadt, a carriage was ready, in which I placed my wife and children; eventually, I boarded it myself. The transport for the rest of the furniture was also provided by our magistrate; however, I bore all the expenses alone. I arrived at a troublesome and laborious time due to the frequent sermons, which I am somewhat glad to have partially abolished. Now, for the first time, I see how great a burden has been placed on my shoulders; I am scarcely granted time to breathe or collect myself. If this calling were not clearly divine, which came to me beyond all hope and expectation, I would certainly waste away with anxiety. You will pray with me to God that He may supply me with strength and not disdain to animate and instruct me with the richer grace of His spirit for such an arduous function. What troubles me most is dealing with a deceitful and cunning man, whose practices, if I wished to describe them to you, would certainly exhaust my paper. As for my domestic affairs: everything is expensive and sold for twice the price as in Zürich. Regarding the state of the church, I have not been able to ascertain anything certain in such a short time. Many churches are indeed vacant. But everything is conducted at the discretion of one person, who, as far as I can judge, can hardly tolerate our people; he would rather appoint a chimney sweep. The indignity of the matter would compel me to write much, if I did not restrain myself. However, regarding our bishop, as far as I can conjecture, I promise myself everything to be favorable and easy. I have not yet met the man; from his meeting, whatever I can surmise, I will immediately write to you.</p>
      <p>I hear that he was once a frequent reader of your commentaries. If this is so, as trustworthy people affirm to me, I thought it most appropriate to urge you to write to him familiarly, testifying that we have good hopes for him and asking him to continue to present himself as the good and pious men wish him to be, unless you think this kind of argument should be deferred to another time.</p>
      <p>I have hastily written this to you, reverend father, as you see, in the midst of my many occupations, not because I wish to give advice to you, a most prudent man, from whom it is entirely fitting for me to seek advice, but because I wanted to depict somewhat the state of our church to you. You, knowing what is in the interest of the church and divine glory, which is your piety, will not fail to act. Recently, a certain canon of that flock of not the lowest note, a man quite civil, as it seemed, who, in the presence of Johannes Pontisella, wished me many good things and solemnly affirmed that he spoke sincerely from the heart (for he saw that I somewhat doubted his will) and desired in every way to promote the cause of the gospel; and hoped that soon we could both unite. Therefore, as I wrote before, there is good hope regarding the bishop and the college. Those who are the worst are lazy bellies and those who hold religion in contempt; they too, like a certain Cerberus with a bone thrown into its mouth, can easily be appeased.</p>
      <p>For your booklet, I owe you great thanks; its reading is all the more pleasant to me because I remember hearing everything from you in person.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us. Everything is peaceful and calm. The royal envoy celebrates feasts daily, from which I have so far deliberately abstained, although the envoy himself has solicited me more than once both in person and later through a scribe. He usually does this whenever he intends to propose the king's cause, to more easily win over the citizens' minds to his opinion.</p>
      <p>For there is no slight suspicion that he is planning a new expedition, and there are those who affirm that the commanders have already received orders from him. However, nothing certain is known because he does not usually refer these matters to the people until he has all his affairs in order. When he has well prepared the field, he only then brings it forward. I will not add more. I ask you, reverend father, to preserve your former benevolence towards me in the future as well. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, alumnus of your church, most observant of you.</p>
      <p>This letter, well-learned, kind sir and godfather, I wrote eight days ago; however, I did not have a messenger at that time. Since then, I have met the bishop once or twice; he has presented himself friendly towards me and offered much good. On the 26th of April, the date of this letter, I was before the council on behalf of Mr. Pontisella, and I handled the matter earnestly. Our lords are all inclined towards him; but since the entire God's House League wants a schoolmaster, Mr. Philipp, who was also present, has so much influence that they have postponed the good Mr. Pontisella further, and they want to leave the matter to the commissioners (of whom there are four appointed by the God's House League) until after Pentecost. The good Mr. Pontisella has nothing, he cannot hold out any longer. I asked our lords to act promptly in this matter and to write to the commissioners on behalf of Mr. Pontisella. They would have gladly done so; but Mr. Philipp flatly refused and thwarted everything. For he knows well that Mr. Pontisella, due to his poverty, will be forced to seek elsewhere. Mr. Philipp, in my presence before our lords, completely slandered Mr. Pontisella; what he fabricated against a good man, but undeservedly, I will tell another time. In short: our lords would gladly help Mr. Pontisella; but they cannot overcome Mr. Philipp's practices.</p>
      <p>This is the summary. Therefore, there is no hope for Mr. Pontisella. Mr. Philipp has claimed before our lords how you, godfather, have congratulated and wished him well regarding the schoolmaster who is supposed to come from Innsbruck to Chur, etc. I have, as much as I could, conveyed your will to my gracious lords regarding Mr. Pontisella. Therefore, my humble request to you is that you would take the trouble to write a short letter to Mayor Ambrosius on behalf of Mr. Pontisella. Consider, if he would support him, Philippus would have to desist. Believe me, godfather, the pious Pontisella is being treated very unjustly and is being burdened and accused by Mr. Philipp with things that are never found in truth.</p>
      <p>It is my humble request to you, kind sir and godfather, that you will not be angry with me for writing to you in such an unseemly manner. Truly, the great injustice has so enraged me that I can hardly write in either Latin or German. Be entrusted to God. 26th of April.</p>
      <p>The mind of Consul Ambrosius was somewhat alienated from Pontisella. Therefore, when you write to him, you will temper your style so that he does not find out that it is done at my instigation; for thus he will doubt less about your will towards Pontisella and will more diligently apply himself to the matter for your sake.</p>
      <p>I received these letters as if open from Mr. Philipp, so I send them to you as they were given to me.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and patron, most esteemed. Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
