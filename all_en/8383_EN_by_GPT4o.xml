      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote while bedridden through our Liner. I had also written earlier through the bookseller of this city; but I have received no response to either of these letters yet. By the grace of the Lord, I am now better and walking again. I sent Felice to Lausanne, as I mentioned in previous letters; I have explained what is contained in this note for him; as for the rest, there is no need for you to be concerned; for I will not accept anything for the time he was with me. I would have gladly kept him longer, if it had been in accordance with both your wishes and his conveniences.</p>
      <p>It is enough for me that you understand that I and all my affairs are at your disposal and that I am glad to have had this small opportunity to show that the memory of your kindnesses has not faded with me. Since Liner left us, I have received nothing of any importance; I am waiting to see what you receive from the Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>Steiger, my father-in-law, my wife, brothers, and all friends send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th of September, 1570.</p>
      <p>You can reply through this boy, if you have anything to write back.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
