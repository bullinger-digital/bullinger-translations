      <p>Learned, honorable, especially gracious, dear sir, I offer you my humble, willing service, along with whatever honor, love, and goods I possess, as before. Gracious, dear sir, since (as I have been informed) the time has come again for the examination of the young and beginners, I have a nephew named Hans Herter, the son of Andreas Herter from Wülflingen, who must also present himself for further examination there. And since I do not have special knowledge of his abilities, I earnestly request you, my esteemed friend, to take the good young man under your care, to advise him in every way, so that he may also receive sustenance and a decent maintenance for his position, like any other.</p>

      <p>I will strive, as a humble person, to earn your favor and that of your associates at any time, with willing submission. Dated the 21st of May, in the year 1547. Your willing servant, Hans Huser, Mayor of Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the learned, honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
