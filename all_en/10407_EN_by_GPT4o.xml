    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not received any letters from Fries and Geßner. Reports on the military campaign of Philip of Hesse to reinstate Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. A battle is expected, and there are concerns about inconveniences in the event of a victory by Ferdinand I. Bullinger wishes to receive news from Geßner and Fries about their study situation and their professors. Christoph Froschauer has conveyed their proposal to take the scholarship with him to Frankfurt. However, they will only receive the expiring installment. Peter Kolin will tell the rest. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have not received any letters from you, dearest sons, and we do not know whether this is due to the fault of the couriers or yours. However, we advise you to be more diligent or prudent in the future, considering to whom you entrust your letters.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are well - they would be better if Germany were more peaceful, where King Ferdinand has stirred up a great war, who is said to possess the Duchy of Württemberg without any title. For the recovery of it, Duke Ulrich and the Prince of Hesse, after so many just legal demands have been appealed in vain for several years, are now armed with great armies and an incredible expedition. We expect nothing but the rumor of a great disaster every day. For Ferdinand, well-prepared, neither yields nor shirks. May the Lord Jesus restore peace to us and help the oppressed and those who observe Him! But there is no reason for you to be troubled on our account here. We have no business with these matters, although we easily predict that it will not benefit us much if the king wins, who, as he is more hostile to the gospel, is also far more corrupt with the desire to dominate.</p>
      <p>Now we are also very surprised that you write nothing about your studies, your professors, and friends there with you. Come, we wish to know what your studies are, who your teachers are. From Christoph Froschauer, we have understood your plan about sending money, namely that you wish it to be given to our bookseller, which we will do at the autumn fair in Frankfurt, but under the condition that we announced in previous letters that we will send nothing unless it is already due, as they call it, by the time of the fasting period, if it is due and has fallen due. However, if this is inconvenient for you or if the studies are not as we hoped, you may return, and again under the condition that you return more learned and better. Remember, dearest sons, that you are supported by an ecclesiastical stipend. Therefore, strive to benefit the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 12, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your brothers and other stipendiaries wish you well.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger in the name of the prefects of the college.</p>
      <p>The rest will be explained by the excellent man Peter Kolin or, if you prefer, Carbonius.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Wyß with his wife Barbara, Springlius with his wife, your brother Geßner, and your uncle Andreas wish you well, Fries.</p>
      <p>To Johannes Fries in Paris and Conrad Geßner in Bourges, young men of great promise, to their own hands.</p>
