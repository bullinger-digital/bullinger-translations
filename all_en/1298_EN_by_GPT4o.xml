      <p>Greetings from the Lord, he wishes. Although no acquaintance has passed between us and I have never seen you (most illustrious man), yet from the published books I seem to know you, and from the letters written to my lord, the Marquess of Dorset, especially from the mention and conversation about you with Johannes von Ulm, a pious young man and very devoted to you, who, meeting me and gently at first opposing, almost finally compelled me to write something to you. If therefore anything has been done wrong by this boldness and impromptu (and to speak plainly) the emptiness of speech, I ask that you attribute the fault to him, although I frankly confess that I am held by the desire to know you more fully. May the Lord Jesus Christ always be present in your ministry and protect and govern you with His Spirit in every way. I hope you remember me in your prayers to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Bradgate near Leicester, on the fourth day before the calends of June 1551. Your most devoted to you and your piety, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>To the most learned theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>James Haddon, Englishman.</p>
