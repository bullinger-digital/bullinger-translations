    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received Bullinger's letter from March 12 [not received] not too long ago. In his response, he refrains from introductory apologies but wants to emphasize that he is very grateful for Bullinger's friendship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger will one day be regarded as one of the most important theologians. He can already enjoy a very good reputation in Augsburg. That he has enviers [is inevitable]. Even Homer had to endure such. The Augsburg city council is not only well-disposed towards him but also wants to do good for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The futile [Second Religious] colloquy in Regensburg ended in a ridiculous manner. The opponents were not so much offended by the [Protestant] beliefs as by Luther's insults. They wasted time because they were waiting for the instructions of the Emperor [Charles V.]. He forbade any recording and wanted to impose a confidentiality obligation on the participants as long as the [Protestants] were not ready to relent. Since the [Protestant] colloquents and their assistants feared that they might be obliged by a vow to adhere to the imperial regulations, they returned to their homeland, including the anxious [Martin] Bucer and [Martin] Frecht. Bucer is said to have traveled to Heidelberg, where Elector [Frederick II.] is striving for a church reformation in Bucer's sense.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bucer had taken a Spaniard named Juan Diaz under his care. He sent him from Regensburg to Neuburg an der Donau so that he could correct his book against [Bartholomäus] Latomus [„De vera et falsa caenae dominicae administratione“] for the printer [Hans Kilian]. Meanwhile, [Juan's] brother, Alfonso [Diaz], a learned lawyer of the Roman Rota, came to Neuburg, where he spent 14 days with [Juan], intending to persuade him to return to Rome and the papal religion. Since he did not succeed with flattery or gifts, he left Neuburg, leaving behind 14 crowns so that his brother would not suspect anything. Early the next morning, however, he returned to Neuburg with his servant [Juan Prieto]. When the city gates opened, [Prieto] went to [Juan's] residence under the pretext that Alfonso had forgotten to tell him something. He split the just-awakened [Juan's] head with an axe and then fled with Alfonso. The perpetrators will hardly be caught, especially since they have already reached the territories of the King [Ferdinand I.] and the Bishop of Augsburg [Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg]. [Added in the margin:] [Alfonso] and [Prieto] were arrested in Innsbruck. How the justice system will deal with them remains to be seen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Frölich's wife [Anna, née Lochner] is eager to show her gratitude for the gift from Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] (whom she considers a sister, especially since the two husbands are like brothers to each other); she just doesn't know how yet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Why Frölich was referred to as a "horse writer" by Bucer is unclear; probably out of contempt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [Augsburg] council has exonerated Frölich in front of the [Schmalkaldic League] assembled in Frankfurt. The allies even apologized to Frölich and only regretted that he did not want to be a Lutheran. Neither [Wolfgang Rehlinger] nor [Wolfgang Musculus] could influence Bucer on [Augsburg]. Therefore, he avoids even coming near the city!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger's report on the appropriate punishment of the crime of a Lorrainer [Niklaus Petri] in Basel serves Frölich to silence the slanderers of the [Basel] church. [That there are people like] Judas [cannot be prevented]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- For two months now, Frölich has not been feeling well; possibly a consequence of his previous worries and fears. He is therefore planning a thermal cure; perhaps in Switzerland?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger will now also know that Luther has indeed died, especially since he will have received the [writings] sent by [Johannes] Haller with the funeral oration and about Luther's burial. On one of these copies, Frölich added the following verses [in handwriting]: See, dear reader, the recurring signs of the papacy // And Bucer's faces, with which he proves himself as Proteus!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Frölich has read Bullinger's speech on the persecution of the church as gladly as his previous speech against any understanding with the Papists. Would Bullinger allow him to print one or the other! He has not yet been able to read Bullinger's writing "De sacramentis." However, Haller has promised him a copy of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- He and Haller have spoken with Johannes Vogler [the Younger] and offered him their help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- At Bullinger's request, Frölich composed a corresponding poem [not received]. He encloses it with the letter, as well as his reply in verse [see attachment] to [Giovanni Antonio Campano's cheeky verse about Germany].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- He has long heard of the plan of a pious man [Theodor Bibliander] to undertake a journey to the pagan peoples, with the aim of converting the Mohammedans to Christianity. In response to the inquiry whether such an undertaking is safe and whether it can be financed in Augsburg, he can say the following: Bullinger should advise this possibly known man against such a journey. For even if one can safely reach Constantinople, Alexandria, and Cairo from Venice, one is in mortal danger as soon as one questions [Islam].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Frölich received Gessner's Tatian[edition] through the young Markus [...]. How should he thank Gessner for such an imperishable gift without becoming embarrassed?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Haller is going his way, is pleasant to the church in [Augsburg], and fully corresponds in piety to Bullinger. Frölich, for his part, is under great work pressure due to his health problems.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Greetings to Bullinger's family, the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], and the scholars. Frölich will write to Gessner soon. Money was given to Markus [...] for the [return] journey.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- [P.S.:] [Hans] Welser and [Jakob] Herbrot send their regards. Should Gessner dedicate something to the council again, he should address the entire council and not just individual persons from it.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord. I received your letter dated March 12, Bullinger, not too long ago, and it was a great joy to my heart and especially to my friends. In response, I will not dwell on the apologies we both used in previous letters, but I will always give thanks to the Lord, who has blessed me with the friendship of such an excellent friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If you value the friendship of the people of Augsburg as much as you do, you will not be mistaken in believing that you will be regarded as one of the foremost theologians of our time among them. Your name, intellect, and holy labors in the Lord's vineyard have become known to our city and indeed to the whole world. Who could not love and respect you? Meanwhile, even Homer did not lack rivals. I know, and I am not mistaken, that our council not only wishes you well but also desires to do good for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The futile colloquy in Regensburg, which began without good zeal, ended in a ridiculous manner. The opponents, due to their cunning and perversity, did not oppose our confession as much as they did Luther's insults, and they wasted time until an order came from the Emperor, which stated: All scribes should be absent from the colloquy, and the participants should be bound by an oath not to divulge any discussions unless we are reconciled, etc. Upon hearing this, both the participants and their assistants feared that an oath and faithfulness to the mandate would be extorted from them. And each returned to his own region by a different route, especially Bucer and Frecht, as if they were delicate skins. Bucer, as I hear, went to Heidelberg, where the Elector Palatine is attempting a church reformation according to Bucer's ideas.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But, alas, what happened three days ago? Bucer hosted a Spaniard named Juan Diaz, whom he sent from Regensburg to Neuburg on the Danube to publish a book against Latomus and correct it for the printer. Juan had a brother, Alfonso, a doctor and counselor of the Roman Rota, who met him in Neuburg and spent 14 days with him, trying to persuade him to return to Rome and rejoin the papal religion. When he could not succeed with flattery or gifts, he left and gave his brother 14 crowns so that he would not suspect anything. The next morning, however, Alfonso returned with a servant to the gates of Neuburg, and as soon as the church was opened, the servant went straight to Juan's house, pretending to have a message from Alfonso that he had forgotten to deliver the day before. When the wicked servant found the good Juan coming out of bed, not yet dressed, he split his head almost in two with an axe and quickly returned to Alfonso, who was waiting outside the gates, and they both escaped. Although some pursue them as robbers, I hardly believe they can be caught now, as they have reached the territories of the King and the Bishop of Augsburg, etc. The fratricide and his servant are held captive in Innsbruck; how justice will be administered against them there, time will tell.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My wife is very eager to show gratitude to your wife, as she should. She values her gift not lightly but greatly and wishes to be received by her into the number of chaste sisters. She says: "By what right does the name of sister not suit me with Bullinger's wife, if both of our husbands are brothers?" She wishes her all joy in return, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You want to know what I do not know myself, namely why Bucer calls me a "horse writer." I believe it is done out of contempt, as if to say that Laetus is a scribe of horses. But the biting words of this brawler move me little.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Our council excused me in Frankfurt before those to whom I was referred, and this excuse satisfied them abundantly, so much so that they sang praises to me and desired nothing in me except that I would not be a Lutheran. Bucer could not conveniently prepare his way here, neither through dormice nor mice; therefore, he passed by the walls, not the citizens, with a distant greeting.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The crime of a certain Lorrainer in Basel, designated and duly punished, has been declared to me, which helps me to respond to the slander of some who say that a certain preacher of the word committed this crime, namely to brand that church. But what then, if Judas among the twelve apostles fell and transgressed shamefully?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I am still in poor health, not due to excessive labors, which I have indeed avoided as much as I could for two months. However, the past unrest and anxiety may not yet have exhausted their remnants. If possible, I will visit the baths with God's guidance. What if the Swiss ones?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>You are now informed of Luther's death, and you will be more certain through Haller, who will send you a description of his funeral and burial. I added this verse to a certain copy: Look, my reader, at the signs of returning papism. Bucer, that Proteus, now shows his forms again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I read your oration on the persecution of the church with great pleasure, as well as the previous one on not reconciling with the papists. I wish I could obtain from you the permission to print either or both! I have not yet been able to read your book "De sacramentis" due to my occupations and infirmity. However, I have inspected the frontispiece and found an excellent distinction and differentiation of signs. Haller will transcribe it for me, which I will diligently study.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Haller and I have spoken to Johannes Vogler, promising him all our efforts, which we will provide when he calls upon us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I solved your question long ago with Haller as a witness and composed it into rhymes, as you see. You will also see the antigraph on "Look at the naked buttocks, barbaric land," etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>We have heard from afar that a certain pious and learned man wishes to visit overseas and pagan nations, with the main purpose of one day, with God's guidance, working against the Mohammedans to propagate the glory of Christ. Therefore, the question now is whether such a man can safely visit Alexandria, Cairo, etc., and whether expenses can be provided for him from our city, etc. Although this good man has not been named to me, nor do I yet know who and where he is, I could perceive by some conjecture that he is known to you. If so, and I am not mistaken in my opinion, I consider it my duty to faithfully communicate to you my opinion and what I have perceived from others as borrowed in this matter. There are indeed merchants who assert that one can safely travel from Venice to Constantinople, Alexandria, and Cairo with merchants, even if one professes one's religion. But as soon as someone speaks a word against the Mohammedan sect, it is a capital offense, and so far, no one has been heard to have escaped alive. I implore you by Christ, if you know anything about that man, to dissuade him from this journey, lest he, avoiding fires, falls into the depths of the waters, and we lose those whom we most lack now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I have received Gessner's Tatian, indeed mine, with the young Marcus. How, I ask, should I respond to that man for such an immortal treasure and most precious gift? I have examined myself inside and out, with what face I should receive such an excellent gift, but, to confess honestly, I do not so much acknowledge my unworthiness as I feel it, and unless I am aided by your persuasion as an orator with Gessner, a man excellent in every way, I will appear before his face with a certain blush.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>If I could, I would have written more, although I have omitted nothing that I deemed worthy of writing. Our Haller is growing and is acceptable to the church, who will in all things reflect Bullinger, as far as piety is concerned. I wish I could live and act according to his wishes! I am distracted, not to say overwhelmed, by business, which I certainly could not satisfy for two whole months due to the weakness of my body.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Greet your pious household, the lords consuls, the city clerk, and the learned individuals. I have replied briefly to Gessner. His young man was dismissed with travel money, as he wished to receive nothing else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Farewell, my honor. April 1, more than in time, 1546. Yours in all things, G. Laetus, city clerk</p>
      <p>In Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Consuls Welser and Herprot send you their warm regards. If Gessner is to dedicate anything to the council in the future, I ask you to ensure that he does not explicitly name the consuls, but only "to the consuls and council," etc.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc., a friend and brother to be revered in all ways. In Zurich.</p>

      <p>Antiphon to the cynical obscenity verse by Campano, the antichrist's envoy, once uttered against the Germans with a bared backside, namely:</p>
      <p>Look at the naked buttocks, barbaric land. GL.</p>
      <p>Why do you mock the Germans with the most shameful songs? More shameful than the harpies, Italian land of the sacred.</p>
      <p>With what faith, scoundrel Campano, with what face do you recount? Look at the naked buttocks, barbaric land.</p>
      <p>Is this how it was fitting to repay the Germans for the plunder taken here with fraud and deceit?</p>
      <p>Now listen against the perverse, malevolent, vile, you naked papist lioness, you light carnal god, blind of eyes, your timid heart, your hands cut off, your head crushed, your feet broken, who has no faith, whose belly is god.</p>
      <p>Look at the Lernean evil, Roman land</p>
      <p>Sorbonne fierce, how fierce you are, wolf of nature, crime of honesty, fugitive of whom Christ is shame, why do you worship boys, who seek nothing but money, who prepare poison, broken-spirited men, who is your parent.</p>
      <p>Your father is uncertain, if you call that monk. And your mother a nun, you truly speak.</p>
      <p>Romulus and Remus were nourished by the breast of a prostitute, bastards and illegitimate offspring, and so on.</p>
