      <p>Greetings. It was not indeed our fault, most esteemed and beloved brother in the Lord, Calvin, that we are sending you this letter later than we had anticipated. We wrote once and again to our brothers, the ministers of the Bernese church, and they responded to us a second time. Thus, the matter proceeded more slowly. We carefully explained to them what was agreed upon between you, Farel, and us. We attached to the explanation the document to which both parties consented. We requested their consent in this matter, or if it is difficult for them to agree, to list the reasons for their dissent, or if they wish anything to be changed, added, or removed, to let us know. They responded amicably and extensively, and, to summarize, they found that our document had a beginning that was too lengthy and a conclusion that was not very necessary and therefore should be rejected by many. They did not disapprove of any of the articles of our agreement. However, they did not agree to its publication or subscription in any way. After many reasons, they mainly insisted that care should be taken not to introduce anything to this church that, due to its novelty, might stir up new commotion, which they considered would cause disturbance among them. They added that they are not permitted to agree to any publication without the consent of the magistrate, and that in the present case, it cannot be proposed to the magistrate without causing disturbance and commotion.</p>
      <p>Now, we do not think it advisable to publish anything against their will and objections, lest, while we wish to declare a common agreement to all, we provoke new dissension or animosities among ourselves with great disturbance to the churches. Nor do we think you, brother, feel differently from us, as we have perceived you to sincerely strive for peace and concord. Meanwhile, it does not seem right for our agreement to remain hidden or to fade into oblivion. We are therefore considering another form in which it may be published, and this with the good grace of the Bernese brothers. Perhaps it will not be difficult for them to agree to the publication if the preface and epilogue are removed, if there are no subscriptions, and if something of this kind is added in place of the preface. Let Calvin write a letter to the ministers of the Zürich church in which he explains that there are some abroad who think Calvin's doctrine of the sacraments does not fully agree with the doctrine of the ministers of the Zürich church and other ministers throughout Switzerland: for this reason, you, with Farel as your companion, came to Zürich and conferred with us most amicably, especially on those points about which there was once controversy, not among ourselves, but between us and some others, some of whom have departed to the Lord. In that conference, after our opinions were brought forward and examined on both sides, it was found that there is no discord between us even today; but since it seems to many that it would be of great benefit to the churches if others, especially those who think we disagree, understand that we are united in the Lord, and ready to publicly confess and steadfastly defend the truth that has been revealed to us by the Lord, you have composed a brief summary of those points about which we conferred and to which both parties agreed, and you composed it mainly with the intention that it might also be communicated to other brothers, unless you understand that this would be displeasing and entirely contrary to us. To this, we could respond to you in this form: We acknowledge, first of all, that the signed points are indeed the points about which the conference was held: then we acknowledge that we have unanimously agreed on those points, and therefore the publication is not disapproved by us, but it is indeed permissible for us to communicate them to other brothers, nor do we doubt about other fellow ministers, I mean the ministers of the churches throughout Switzerland, that they too will approve of these; especially since many years ago public disputations were held among them, and confessions of common faith were presented by them, to which we also did not object, and since these agree with ours, and they adhere to their own, they cannot but embrace and approve ours in all respects.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will now be your task, most beloved brother Calvin, to either give us better advice or to write your letter in the form we have just outlined. When you have sent it, we will attach it as a preface to the declaration of agreement, and immediately follow it with our letter responding to yours in the manner we have just delineated. Furthermore, we will send this new form, or if you suggest something better, again to the Bernese brothers, to see if they can agree to it without subscription. If they agree, we will send the same to the ministers of other churches. Finally, we will inform you in good faith and promptly of what we have accomplished. Farewell, beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich, July 7, in the year of our Lord 1549.</p>
      <p>The pastors and readers of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most faithful minister of the church of God, Mr. Johannes Calvin, esteemed and dear lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
