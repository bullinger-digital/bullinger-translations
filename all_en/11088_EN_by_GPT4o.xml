    <p xml:id="regest1">Inform the people of Zurich, who are certainly anxiously awaiting news about Bucer's visit to Bern as they are also affected, about the progress of the negotiations. Capito, as previously announced by Megander, arrived in Bern together with Bucer on September 10, although they kept it secret until the last moment that Myconius and Grynaeus were accompanying them; the two from Basel met with Megander, who then arranged a meeting with the Bernese theologians at the Barfüßerkloster. While the Basel representatives declared that they only wanted to mediate, the Strasbourg representatives asked for permission to appeal to the council in their defense against false rumors, which the church representatives allowed on the condition that no new disputation about the sacraments and no deviation from previous confessions and agreements would be demanded of them. The council ordered a special synod for September 16; in the meantime, the guests tried to rally support for their cause. In the assembly opened on September 17, Bucer defended himself in a long speech: 1.) He had never deviated from his earlier teachings but had tirelessly and successfully worked to clear up mutual misunderstandings in the Eucharistic controversy; his "Retractations" were in agreement with the [First Helvetic] Confession and the Bern Disputation and were no less clear than other confessions of German churches. 2.) He still adhered to the Eucharistic doctrine of the Bern Disputation but had reached a deeper understanding of the manducatio spiritualis. 3.) His letter to Luther, passed on to the people of Zurich through [Benedikt Euander], only reflected his role as a mediator. The following day, Megander responded on behalf of the Bernese pastors to Bucer's lecture; he denied that anyone had questioned Bucer's orthodoxy or attacked Capito at all, but he laid out in seven (individually listed) points that Bucer had mainly caused offense to the Swiss through his "Retractations" and had weakened their negotiating position. Bucer replied that the publication of his book did not violate the decision of the Basel Diet [from February 4, 1536], and furthermore, his offer to justify himself had not been accepted; solely in the interest of concord, the Strasbourg representatives had tried to prevent a defense document from the Swiss, but now, due to the preface [by Bibliander] to the letters [of Zwingli and Oecolampadius], great damage had nevertheless been done. In contrast, Megander insisted that the "Retractations" should not have been published; he expressed surprise that Bucer had not received the response to his offer of dialogue and finally pointed out that the censorship authority, to which Grynaeus and Myconius had also contributed, had approved the publication of the letters. Despite being urged to remain silent, Bucer repeated that he had not received a response from Bern. When the council called on the synod on September 19 to make a decision on a possible agreement, Capito urged for an explicit acceptance or rejection of the justification presented by the Strasbourg representatives as well as their confession. Whether their clarifications would be recognized as sufficient was disputed; although it was anticipated that they would demand a written testimony and could later boast about it, the majority agreed. The matter is now back with the council; the writers will report on the outcome in writing if possible, otherwise orally through Erasmus [Ritter] or Rhellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>We have no doubt, dearest brothers and lords to be revered in Christ, that you are eagerly, diligently, and anxiously awaiting the outcome of Bucer's arrival. And rightly so. For your situation is no less at stake than ours, as our neighboring wall is burning. Therefore, so that you may not remain in suspense and anxiety any longer, we have deemed it our duty to briefly write to you about what has transpired between us and Bucer.</p>
      <p>From Megander's letters to our Bullinger (if we are not mistaken), you have learned that Capito, about a month ago, informed the leaders of our church in the word of the Lord by letter that he, along with Bucer, would come to us on September 9 and discuss something with us. As for the appointed day, although they came rather suddenly, it was not entirely unexpected; however, regarding the increased delegation, we could complain. For not only the people of Strasbourg but also Myconius and Grynaeus from Basel arrived here on September 10. And although they spent the night in Jegensdorf (a village a thousand paces from here) and reached Bern around the ninth hour, they acted in concert with their accomplices and kept us in the dark, so that only Myconius and Grynaeus approached Megander between the first and second hour and explained the reason for their arrival. After hearing this and convening a meeting of the church leaders, professors, and deacons through the same, they were ordered to come to our Franciscan college with the other two delegates. When both sides had arrived, greetings were exchanged, and a session was held.</p>
      <p>There, Capito (being the elder) began to speak with great earnestness, saying that this delegation was undertaken for no other reason than to clear themselves of certain rumors falsely spread about them among us, without naming anyone specifically or causing harm to anyone. However, since they recognized that it would be insincere to act without our consent before the council, they had come to us first to request permission to approach him. After these words, Bucer said the same things in more words. Then Myconius and Grynaeus, after laboriously excusing themselves as not being self-appointed but requested by the Strasbourg companions, and not coming to support one side but to act as mediators, also delivered a prepared speech on the inconvenience of discord and the benefit of concord. After listening attentively to all of this and finally ordering them to withdraw, we, after deliberation, recalled them and responded that we would approach the council on their behalf regarding the aforementioned matter, but with the condition and omen that they should not expect a new disputation on the sacramental matter from us or think that we would deviate even slightly from the Bern Disputation, both confessions, and the next synod, or decree anything new without your and other Swiss churches' counsel and consent. After these actions, we each in turn hosted them for meals in the spirit of hospitality.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they approached the council and obtained permission to clear themselves before a special synod composed of deans, chamberlains, and some others who voluntarily gathered. While the synod was thus convened and assembled by the council on the 16th of this month, they, in the meantime, with their followers (whom they already had prepared here at their beck and call), did not cease to make plans and gain new friends.</p>
      <p>However, when the day of the assembly arrived and the parish priests had gathered from the villages and towns, the session was held the next day (which was September 17). In this session, the delegates were given the opportunity to speak, and Bucer, with a lengthy introduction and the aforementioned fraternal exhortation, addressed these three main points: First, the false rumor spread about them, as if they had deviated from the true doctrine of the sacraments, while they used more words than charity in explaining the cause of the Eucharist. Then, they were accused of not standing by their promises; they had promised to defend the truth asserted in the Bern Disputation, but now it was said that they not only abandoned it but also subverted it. Third, both he and Capito were accused of not dealing candidly with the Swiss churches, and this was proven by his secret letter to Luther.</p>
      <p>To refute the first point, he brought up the beginning of the controversy between our people and Luther, namely that in the Bern Disputation and in published writings, neither side had properly understood the other. Zwingli, a man of most blessed memory, had always argued thus: Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father, therefore he cannot be eaten bodily in the supper. Luther, however, argued thus: Christ, with these words: "Take, eat" etc. [Mt 26, 26], promised the eating of his body and blood; therefore, in the properly administered supper, his body and blood cannot not be eaten. Meanwhile, Christ was excluded from the supper by neither. When he saw this seven years ago, he said he had worked to make the matter known to the world through his German dialogue. This eventually led to both sides meeting at Marburg through the efforts of other good men, especially the prince of Hesse. And although little was accomplished there by those present on both sides, he did not cease from laboring for concord. For he had continually moved this great and troublesome stone up to our calamitous war and did not lose heart even with things as they were. After the warlike tumults were settled, by writing and riding here and there, he had brought about the first confession on the cause of the Eucharist at Basel, and then, because he saw that some more obstinate Lutherans were not yet satisfied with us, he had also obtained the last one. However, the books published on both sides and the sinister rumors spread everywhere were the cause of the concord not being completed long ago, not his "Retractations," which he affirmed were in all respects in agreement with the Basel Confession and not contrary to the Bern Disputation. And to make this more plausible, he interpreted many things from his preface and other probable places in German, so that even the unlearned could understand. In sum, by exaggerating the matter, he cleverly made a public issue out of a private one, saying that if his "Retractations" and explanations on the sacrament of the synaxis were condemned for obscurity, then by the same reasoning, the confession of all the churches in Germany should also be condemned. For the same obscurity was present in both. Therefore, either all those with him were unjustly confessing, or it was unjustly pronounced about him.</p>
      <p>To refute the second point, he initially responded that he was still a defender of the truth vindicated in the Bern Disputation, as he had promised. Then, from the conclusion of the disputation on the sacrament, he proved that he now felt the same as he did then. For just as only the bodily and gross eating was excluded from the mystical supper and the spiritual was asserted, so he now said nothing else, except that he expressed the spiritual eating more clearly and significantly by the power of the promise.</p>
      <p>To the last point, he recounted how his letter to Luther, copied by the schoolmaster of Kempten and sent to you, had been obtained by bad means and the worst example of many. In which, however, nothing was contained that he had not received from the brothers who had attended the Basel convention. "Why say more?" he said, "I did in these letters just as those who know and resolve the causes of the disputants." For just as many things are said separately to each party, which they would not want the other to know, so perhaps there are some harsh things in these letters that it would have been better for our side not to know.</p>
      <p>After he had thundered these things throughout the day and finally finished speaking, the council (which was listening to everything along with the deacons) dismissed us to consult the next day in the Franciscan monastery about the response to be given to Bucer. When we arrived there, by the common vote of the brothers, the task of responding and refuting was entrusted to Megander. As he undertook this, he first said that he had never heard nor knew anyone who accused Bucer of deserting the truth in the matter of the Eucharist. If, however, he knew someone, it was free for him to indicate him by name. Nor was there any reason to involve Capito in his cause. For no one was offended by him, but many were offended by Bucer's writings throughout the Swiss. First, because he published his "Retractations" contrary to the agreement of the first Basel convention. Second, because in them he confirmed the calumny imposed on us by Luther, while he, as the leader of the Zwinglians, retracted his opinion on the Eucharist and said that Zwingli only taught the genuine understanding and true use of the synaxis in his last books. From which the false suspicion conceived about us is increased, as if we recognize nothing in the Lord's Supper beyond mere bread and wine. Third, Bucer, with his followers, opposed the refutation of that very calumny by the Swiss through an apologetic publication. Fourth, that he, professing to be a mediator, consented to Luther before the concord was completed, so that for the matter of the synaxis being improperly handled and for not respecting Luther as he deserved, he asked for pardon from all the pious. In which supplication, if Bucer still feels the same as in the disputation, what need is there to ask for pardon? But because he asked for it, does he not feel differently now than before? Fifth, it is not very honorable for the people of Bern if they tolerated their disputants fighting on both sides like blindfolded gladiators. Sixth, that secret letter is the alpha and omega of the entire Buceran play acted and to be acted on the Swiss stage. For while he excuses himself so laboriously in it for having so often and so variously exposed the Lutheran articles to us, he indicates that this was not Luther's mind in his articles. For if Bucer brought Luther's very mind in his exposition, what need was there, I ask, to apologize to him? But if he did not derive this sense from Luther when expounding the articles, why did he impose it on us? Seventh, while he writes that Luther is rightly offended that we want to seem to have taught thus before as well, but that "before" is not to be understood of all the time of this conflict, but rather of the time when the concord began to be negotiated, he again increases the sinister suspicion conceived about us. For if before the Marburg convention and the Basel confession (to which he says we especially look), we did not hold the true understanding and power of the Lord's Supper, then it may seem true that we recognized only bare symbols in the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>When Bucer had received this response from Megander and the debate seemed to be ending, Bucer requested a new opportunity to speak from the council, saying that the last parts in responding should be granted to him as the accused. Having obtained this, he attempted to refute these three points: First, that the edict of the Basel convention did not prohibit him as a mediator from publishing something, but those who were still parties and were working against concord. Therefore, since his "Retractations" (as had previously been shown from the German interpretation) promoted concord, he had not violated the agreement. Indeed, since he had been mortally ill at that time, he would have acted unjustly if, being prevented by death, he had not warned posterity about his retraction. Then, although he conceded that he had published the "Retractations" too hastily, he could still be excused because, having heard of some offense in the Swiss, he had requested a day and place to clear himself. Since he had not yet been able to obtain this from us, he thought he had been treated rather poorly. Finally, he did not deny that the publication of the apology had been impeded by him and Capito, and this was to prevent the way to future concord from being closed. Meanwhile, however, nothing was accomplished by this remedy; for a collection of letters, along with a rather long preface, had been published, which had greatly hindered concord.</p>
      <p>To which Megander again responded briefly: He was well aware that it had been generally provided at Basel that nothing new should be published on either side concerning the Eucharist; others who had attended the convention knew this as well. Hence, he said Bucer was trying in vain to evade by claiming that this provision was not made to prevent his "Retractations." For it had not yet been sufficiently proven that they were not contrary to concord. Then he expressed surprise at how it happened that the response sent by us to Basel concerning Bucer's request had not been delivered to him, although other things were found intact with the messenger who drowned in the Byrsa river. Moreover, he was also surprised that Bucer considered the collection of letters such a pestilent book, although the letters and preface, before they were printed, had been seen by the book overseers. Furthermore, Grynaeus's and Myconius's little works had been inserted into them.</p>
      <p>Having said this, Megander asked Bucer to be at peace now that the cause of both parties had been heard by the council. But he, not at all inclined to peace, suggested that it could have been possible for Megander to write on our behalf about the day of judgment being appointed; however, no letters had been returned to him, no matter how the courier had managed them.</p>
      <p>With these words exchanged back and forth on September 19 before lunch in the presence of the council and the people of Bern, the council, based on Megander's report, ordered us to consult in the Franciscan monastery after lunch about the conclusion of the synod and, if possible, to agree on the words, since we did not disagree on the essence and purpose of the Eucharist. When we arrived there, with some from the lesser and greater council present, Capito, not content that he and Myconius had each, contrary to the promise given to us (before we allowed them to ascend the pulpit), proclaimed their opinion on the Eucharist to the people with full voice to the point of tedium, even threateningly tried to extort from us that we either approve or disapprove of their justification. For if we were satisfied, the matter would be well; if not, a reason would have to be given before they left the city. Moreover, since we had heard their confession recently presented to the council, they also urged us to say whether it was pious or impious. When these thunderbolts, which those who had promised fraternal charity and great clemency in action at the beginning had hurled at us at the end (to leave a sting in the minds of the listeners), they withdrew.</p>
      <p>However, as we later consulted on the request of such great fathers and senators, opinions varied, and this was only about the first article. Some of the brothers thought that it should be answered that the people of Strasbourg had been cleared to us so far as we had heard them and the matter was as they presented it; then, as far as their confession was concerned, we could bear it with our own and recognize them as brothers as before. Others, however, said that their justification should neither be approved nor disapproved in its entirety, because the things they had brought forward here and there for their defense were not fully considered and understood, and so that they might not later request letters as a testimony of approval and boast about it. But the former opinion (as the better usually prevails) won. Nor did the authors of the latter opinion deceive themselves. For those peaceful and gentle men the next day, in the conclusion of the synod, requested an instrument from the council. Nor did they simply demand that the aforementioned response of the synod be put into writing, but they also tried to insert other acts, so much so that when most of those to whom this business had been particularly entrusted had left and dispersed, the matter was again referred to the council. What the council decided about giving a diploma to the people of Strasbourg, if possible, we will send it to you now; if not, you will soon hear it in person (if God wills) or from Erasmus or Rhellikan there.</p>
      <p>Farewell and beware of Bucer's leaven.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, September 23, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your brothers and fellow ministers, Megander, Erasmus, and Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Bullinger, Leo, Bellicanus, Bibliander, Beatus, and the preachers and professors of sacred things in Zurich, always to be revered in the Lord.</p>
