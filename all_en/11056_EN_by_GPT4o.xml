    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends Hieronymus [Kranz] for church service, as the people of Konstanz have no use for him; [Kranz], a capable pastor of impeccable conduct, has been deposed [in Calw] at the instigation of some deceitful individuals, to the distress of his congregation. Greetings. Bullinger was likely informed about the situation in Württemberg by Dr. Philipp Lang; Blarer will return to [the Duchy of Württemberg] for visitation in the coming days.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I warmly commend to you and the other brothers this exiled Hieronymus as much as I can. This good man has committed no crime worthy of exile, and all the pious of the church, of which he was a pastor, are deeply grieved to have lost such a good shepherd, in whose life and doctrine nothing was lacking. However, it has seemed to the Lord that he should be believed by some deceitful individuals who are overturning everything, about which I would say much to you if it were possible in person, but I prudently refrain now. But consider this brother truly worthy to be placed over the sheep of Christ, which you will experience in reality if, by your favor, it happens to him. I also ask that you assist him, even for my sake. My people of Konstanz would not let him go if he could be of use to us now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, and diligently commend me and my wife, whom you will greet carefully in my words, to Christ with pious prayers. Greetings to Pellicanus, Leo, Theodorus, and your other ministers. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, July 8, 1537.</p>
      <p>My brother and sister and another Zwicker greet you, for Conrad is absent.</p>
      <p>Regarding many other matters, I preferred to write nothing at all now rather than not enough. You could have recently learned from Dr. Philipp Lang how things stand in Württemberg. Tomorrow or the day after, I must leave here again and return to the inspection of the churches. I owe you much, my Bullinger, and one day, I trust in Christ, you will understand that I am neither forgetful nor ungrateful.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother, in Zurich.</p>
