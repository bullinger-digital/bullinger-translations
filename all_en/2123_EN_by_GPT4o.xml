      <p>To the faithful servant of God and my most esteemed brother, Mr. Jakob Valer, pastor of the church in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Greetings and grace from the Lord. Today, my father, when I was with Mr. Calvin, your letters were conveniently delivered to us, for which I am most grateful to you. Indeed, I lack the words to express how much pleasure your singular promptness and eagerness in aiding the common cause of the church has brought me, all the more gratifying and delightful to us because examples of such faith and zeal are rare. May our Lord Jesus, whose cause you have served, continue to bless you and someday remember your service to His church. But you will learn more about this whole matter from Mr. Calvin himself, who now, being very busy, preferred not to write back rather than to testify too sparingly and inadequately to your singular faith and integrity in such a great benefit. And so much for that. For since the public courier has not yet returned, nothing can yet be written to you about the outcome of this matter. However, my father, your eagerness in helping the churches, which we have experienced so many times, makes us also in turn request your assistance more frequently and even, if I may say so, more boldly.</p>
      <p>A certain man from the town of Salins, a well-educated and very pious man, as far as we could learn from several of his letters to us and as the matter itself now shows, is held captive at Dole among the Sequani. He, when he was already prepared to depart, was intercepted by the deceit of certain monks and is now in extreme danger, and he asks that if we can rescue him from imminent death, we do not fail him for mutual charity, ready in the meantime to endure the most cruel things rather than deny Christ. His name is Paris Panier, a doctor of laws: he was born in a fairly respectable place and was not long ago a tutor to some of the Fuggers in the Poitiers academy. But his mother and brothers, partly out of fear and partly out of treachery, do not seem greatly concerned about his life. Therefore, it remains for us to be his true brothers. Our church has written to our most magnificent princes about him, whom we hope will take up the cause of Christ. But I also ask you, my father, that if you can do anything there in this matter, you show all of it for the cause of this excellent brother. You can, I believe, do much, not only because, as we think, in such a just cause such a pious and Christian senate will not reject your petition, but also because we also believe that the most honorable consul, truly pious and Christian, with whom you are related, has great influence with those Sequani at this particular time. Therefore, we earnestly ask you to, by whatever means are convenient for you, ensure that our brother is snatched from the jaws of the lion: about which matter, I believe, you will also receive common letters from our college. For I wrote this to you hastily from Geneva. When I return home, I hope to write to you more diligently and accurately. Farewell, my best and most esteemed father. May the Lord Jesus continue to bless you and strengthen you more and more each day.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
