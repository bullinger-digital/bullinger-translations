    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a gift to his wife. Agrees with what Bullinger wrote regarding Heinrich Lochmann; he has expressed concerns that [Dorothea Wirz] is still too young [for marriage] and should first be brought to relatives in Bern. The girl's guardian and the trustee [Ulrich Wirz] had announced they wanted to ride to Zurich and speak with her; Haller wants to urge both again and await the outcome. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best to you.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I have well understood your letter. For that, I thank you most highly for the little book you sent to my wife.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, regarding what you wrote to me about Heinrich Lochmann, it is not relevant. I have spoken with him; he replied that the girl is still young, and it would be his will that we should wait a little longer. But it will not be delayed. For there are many more relatives than him. He would prefer to go to Bern to relatives in the meantime, and with many more words.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I have spoken with the girl's guardian and the trustee. They gave me the answer that they want to ride to Zurich and deal with the girl, and whatever they find in her, they will bring back to the relatives. I mistakenly believed they were already there. But I will visit them and speak with them, so they ride to Zurich and take the girl to Amden, and after they find out, bring me the answer back; so I will act as is proper for the honor.</p>
      <p>What I can prove to you in love and money and to my lord mayor, I will be above that. Nothing more, then greet the bailiff of Kyburg and other good fellows for me.</p>
      <p>Given on the 13th day of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant</p>
      <p>Bitzius Haller, chief bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in greater Zurich, his kind, dear [lord]</p>
