    <p xml:id="regest1">Many, including Caesarius, are impatiently waiting for Bullinger's commentary on Luke. However, since some claim that Bullinger is one of the [designated] interlocutors of the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Colloquy convened by [Charles V], Caesarius fears that this commentary will be delayed even further. - Cochläus wanted to know Caesarius' opinion on his writing [„De Petro et Roma“, Cologne 1525 (VD 16 C 4353f)], which he wrote against [Ulrich] Velenus. Velenus is the one who first dared [in his 1520 publication „In hoc libello gravissimis... racionibus... probatur apostolum Petrum Rhomam non venisse neque illic passum“ (VD 15 V 504f)] to claim that Peter was never in Rome. Caesarius responded with the question of whether Cochläus really believed that the "Donation of Constantine" originated from Constantine [the Great]? Cochläus then fell silent and merely shrugged his shoulders in the Italian manner. Cochläus is only pursuing his own interests with the great [of this world] and does not seek Christ's honor! - Greetings to the special friend [Rudolf] Gwalther, to the other pious and learned, especially to Joachim Vadian, whose writings Caesarius enjoys reading.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Many, along with myself, eagerly await the publication of your long-promised commentaries on Luke. Because of this, when some tried to convince me that you would be one of the interlocutors at the Regensburg Colloquy by the order and consent of the Emperor and the Princes, I feared that this might cause a delay in fulfilling our wishes, even after a long wait. You can hardly believe how much I delight in reading your writings, not only for the elegance of your style but also for the precise explanation and exposition of matters concerning our religion. Let others, namely your adversaries, chatter as they wish; their ramblings do not appeal to me at all. Cochläus, one of them, once asked me how much I valued his writings against Velenus, the author who was the first among the recent ones to dare to assert that Peter was never in Rome. To which I replied that I could refute all his arguments with one brief response. He hesitantly asked, "And how would that be done?" Then I said, "Do you believe, I asked, that the Donation of Constantine, which the Papists boast about, was truly made by Constantine himself?" To which he said nothing, but merely shrugged his shoulders in the Italian manner and remained completely silent. You understand, my dear Bullinger, what I meant to imply with those words. It seems to me that this man is a seeker of favors and goodwill from great men, and writes to please people rather than seeking the glory of God and Christ. But may your kindness fare well, and please convey my greetings to Rudolf Gwalther, my esteemed friend, and to the other pious and learned men among you, especially Joachim Vadian, whose writings I enjoy reading.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, wholeheartedly.</p>
