      <p>S. D. Finally, you see what was the reason that I wrote less frequently last summer, Myconius, venerable lord and most esteemed brother; I am sending our sermons, not many indeed, but those which I wrote with much labor, especially because of other tasks by which I am continuously burdened. I wrote these in my spare hours; I await your judgment. I have dealt with the most excellent topics of scripture: laws, sin, grace or the gospel, and repentance. Although others have previously treated these topics learnedly and piously, I believe that my treatment has some clarity and perhaps more simplicity, with fewer foreign disputations. I alone treat ceremonial matters in this age.</p>
      <p>However, I did this with the greatest pleasure because they propose Christ our redeemer so clearly and teach faith in him, that I seem to have given a benefit to the students, indeed, the Lord himself has provided this to his own through me. In the 4th Decade, the topics follow: one God in three persons, worship, adoration, invocation of God, religion, superstition; Christ as God and man, king, priest, savior; the Holy Spirit, good spirits, evil or demons; the soul of man and the certain salvation of man. The 5th Decade will also have its topics. Pray to the Lord that he may be present with me by his spirit, so that I may write with much benefit to the readers.</p>
      <p>Today, which will seem new to you, Ludwig Lavater, a learned and very pious young man, has been elected into the number of the city's preachers, namely in the place of Mr. Haller; for the Bernese obtained with many prayers that the senate would give them Haller as a minister. From England, Peter Martyr writes that everything is well, that he has contended greatly against the sophists and by the grace of God has won the opinion about the supper, which we have defended until now, yet there are those who try to defend the corporal presence in public writings, etc. This will be responded to. The Protector, the king's uncle, has been freed from prison and all trouble, and was restored to his dukedom on the 5th or 6th of February. Envoys have been sent to France to negotiate peace.</p>
      <p>French envoys have arrived in England. May the Lord inspire the spirit of concord in those kings. I wish to hear something from you about the Emperor, the decaying corpse.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Julius III has been called the new antichrist; I have this from Bologna and Venice. He was Giovanni Maria del Monte, Bishop of Palestrina, originally from Arezzo. He is a most fierce opponent of ecclesiastical liberty (priestly corruption and the wantonness of the clergy). He presided over the Council of Trent, called Bologna. Is me franzos(?) dan imperij. The devil hands the vessel to all. Froschoverus will come to Basel in 8 days; let the parish priest in Louffen deal with him.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Gastius be safe, to whom you will send a copy through this student.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Oswald Myconius, venerable and dearest lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
