      <p>Greetings. Recently, reverend father in Christ, I have not written; however, I hoped within this eight-day period to learn from Mr. Martinengo about the state of the council; but not a word from there. I am surprised at how this can be. Those who come to us all indeed affirm it is dissolved; but I can write nothing certain until I have clearly understood the truth. Merchants now rarely travel to Clavenna because of the plague. As I hear, the trade of foreigners, especially Italians, has ceased in Clavenna.</p>
      <p>A servant of the commissioner has died, and when there was a large market in Cläven on St. Andrew's Day, the Italians scrambled over each other, each wanting to be the first to leave; they blocked the lake on the Milanese side, seized all goods coming from Cläven, and when one of their peasants wanted to go home, named Jacobthal, they shot him because they thought he was coming from Cläven. Here in Chur, no more than one person has died from it; but it has spread everywhere, and people make much of it. I strongly advise that people treat each other more kindly than in the previous death; I still do not know what to do.</p>
      <p>I will write here what is certain and known, not because I want it to be published; for it pains me that the Rhaetians brand themselves with such marks, although there are many good men who disapprove of the deed.</p>
      <p>There is a place two miles from Chur, called Valdey. There, a respectable man has fallen ill with this disease; his daughter, however, who had been sitting with her father, knew nothing of her father's illness, wanted to bring sausages to her father and mother (because they had slaughtered). When she found her father so ill, she stayed with him until his end. Before and after the father passed away, the mother also lay down. Other surrounding neighbors made a decent arrangement, so that this woman, although heavily pregnant, had to bury her own father and mother. Meanwhile, the outcry spread further, the court convened, and when the women wanted to return to their husbands and children, the way was blocked and they were shut out, etc. And this happened in a place where preaching is done. These things are horrible to hear, and therefore I am sure of a great pestilence; for God will punish the unbelief of these people, etc.</p>
      <p>I am working hard here. We had summoned Huldricus Campell for the business of the Bellizarii, who heard on the way that Chur was infested with the plague. He continued; but he did not want to enter my house. I was surprised. He affirmed that he did not fear death so much; but if he entered any house, his return to his own would be barred.</p>
      <p>For if he came to Engadin, he would have to swear an oath that he had not been in any house in Chur; otherwise, they would not let him pass.</p>
      <p>Thus we must fight with certain beasts, etc. - I send the business of the Bellizarii, as it will be proposed in the communities against the monks. I have not yet seen the response of the adversaries. The whole difficulty lies in whether the Pellizarii should be paid out of the Three Leagues' funds; for the monastery belongs to the Leagues.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the monks would be easily expelled. We propose it in such a way as to show that the Bellizarii are not so much asking to be paid from there, as that the monks be expelled once and for all, so that foreign lords may see that we are inclined to give them protection and shelter. Long discussions, before everything is denied. There is no need for you to send back this writing of the Bellizarii; you can let others read it, who have dealt with it. A boy from Rhaetia is recommended to us by the brothers, who delivers this to you. They ask that we recommend him to you, if possible, that he may be helped by you with the must.</p>
      <p>I know what you will answer; but we cannot do otherwise. The Upper League writes to your senate; he is a boy from the most noble and ancient Rhaetian family, called the Lumbryser; he has a very honorable parent. Therefore, I am very surprised that he is pushed into these straits by his own. If he cannot have a place with you at all and you help him with letters to the people of Basel, you will have done a pious work. Writing these last things, I was not well. It is indeed a familiar illness to me, which recurs at intervals, causing great pains in the sides; I think it is the prelude to a stone. Therefore, forgive the tumultuous writing. I have read Ochino's absurdities and am amazed at what monster the old man is nurturing. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may preserve you unharmed for His church.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 13, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
