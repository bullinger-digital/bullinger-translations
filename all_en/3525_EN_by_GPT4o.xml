      <p>Greetings. Today Froschauer brought the last sections, and today he will depart again.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I hastily compiled an index from these, which seemed to be the most important; for he constantly urged me to be brief in the rest as well. In the index of the explained passages of scripture, I do not have many parts that the Latin exemplar has; for I did not want to simply note the cited passages, but only the principal ones that have an accompanying explanation. I pray, consider this work kindly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I give you great thanks for the money sent to my wife; she also gives her utmost thanks. There was no need to send something again after the previous was lost.</p>
      <p>I have not yet learned anything about that Englishman.</p>
      <p>Beza, upon leaving here, left this book with someone else, whom he asked to deliver it to me to be sent to you, and at the same time through him, he asked me to pray to you not to take it badly that he has not written to you now. Meanwhile, nothing new has been brought, except that our Swiss are returning from the Netherlands, if any survive, those poor and utterly exhausted by diseases.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to see what the Frankfurt assembly will produce. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your wife and all the children in my and my wife's name; Musculus also greets you with his family. March 5, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
