      <p> Greetings. I have now received your letter written early in the morning on the 6th of this month, and because the post was hurrying back, I did not want to send it off without my letter. What you write about Frolich is not entirely without reason; for if the turmoil had continued in France, I could have sent a small number to augment the king's guard, as they call it, and there is no one whom the king would want to gather soldiers in Switzerland without my authority. But it will not be necessary, I hope, and everything will be settled with the arrival of the King of Navarre, and now everything is quieter. I am not very concerned about the response of the lords and the most honorable magistrate; for I expect everything just, honest, friendly, praiseworthy, and peaceful from them, and I would like to flee to them as to the safest refuge and harbor from the waves and complaints of others. May the Lord always bless them. </p>
      <p> Regarding what you wish to know about Sanlaurentiano, he is still in Vienna and will follow the emperor, but not in formalities; for there is a controversy between him and the legate of Philip about who will hold the primary position. This does not sit well with him. </p>
      <p> He does not have much hope for the council, as the pope wants to choose a place in Italy. </p>
      <p> The Spanish envoys wanted to dissuade the French king from pursuing a national council; but I think they have achieved nothing. What will follow, I do not dare to believe. </p>
      <p> We must commend the matter to the Lord, who is more powerful than Satan and does not abandon his own, to whom he has granted so many other benefits. There are those who say that those from the valleys of Pragela and Engrogna in Piedmont, who have defected from the pope for so many years, will join with that nobleman from Monbrun, who has occupied some papal places near Avignon and married the niece of Cardinal Tournon. </p>
      <p> Soldiers are being gathered against him in Dauphin√©. If you have heard anything about the assembly in Stuttgart, it would be most welcome if you inform me, and about other matters that will be worthy, and you may demand all services from me as if by your right, if you desire anything. What you wrote about the progress of the word was most delightful; we will understand more day by day. This month I plan to recall my son, as Fulgenius is preparing to leave. </p>
      <p> I am expecting a pious and learned tutor to shape his character. I commend him to you and myself to your prayers. </p>
      <p> Greet all friends. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Solothurn, early morning, October 8th. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Coignet. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich. </p>
