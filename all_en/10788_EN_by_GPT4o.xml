    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends the copy of a letter from Nikolaus Zurkinden with news about the progress of the campaign in the Vaud region: The Valaisans, in agreement with Bern, conquer the area around St-Maurice, while the Bernese have occupied the fortress of Klus; their advance on Chambéry has been preempted by French troops who intend to march to Milan. The Five Cantons do not participate in the mediation attempt by the Swiss envoys. Fribourg, similar to Valais, is involved in the Bernese enterprise through agreements regarding the capture of Romont, Rue, and Yverdon. The tensions between King [Francis I] and Emperor [Charles V] over Milan also benefit Bern. Except for the still pending handover of Yverdon, everything is going well. Despite their questionable motives, there is hardly any treachery to be feared from the Valaisans and the people of Fribourg. The very weakened Berchtold [Haller] is still alive. - Sulpitius Haller wishes for a report on the negotiations of the scholars in Basel and on the request of Duke [Charles III] of Savoy to Zurich. He requests the purchase of two hats for the council scribe [Zurkinden]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best, etc. beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear, kind Master Heinrich, as you recently wrote to me, if any new credible news comes to me, I should let you know. Since then, nothing has come to me, except yesterday these following news from Bern, the content of which I send to you in good faith, word for word, as follows, a letter sent to me, etc., reads as follows:</p>
      <p>"My friendly greetings and all goodwill beforehand. Dear, kind lord and brother, although I am, as you know, burdened with many tasks, I will nevertheless briefly inform you of what news has come to me since your last departure, namely:</p>
      <p>The Valaisans have agreed with my lords on all matters in the field, taking some land around Saint-Maurice from the Duke. My lords are satisfied with this. The reason for their action is that the Duke had thrown down some salt on them.</p>
      <p>The remaining land from Morsee to the Klus and the other side of the lake is all my lords'. The Klus has been stormed by our people, and the enemies have been forced to surrender.</p>
      <p>Our people wanted to march on Chambéry, but the King of France is advancing there with an army from the Dauphiné and with another force into the Bresse, intending to bless the Duke's bath and take the places, then march into Milan.</p>
      <p>The Five Cantons do not burden us, neither in this matter nor otherwise. God arranges everything rightly. The other Confederates have ridden there; my lords have not offered or involved themselves, but have left the matter to them, whether they resolve it or not, etc.</p>
      <p>The people of Fribourg are armed 2000 strong, intending to take Romont, Rue, and some other places with the favor and will of my lords, and have offered to let my lords have Yverdon, which my lords are well pleased with. Thus, Valais and Fribourg are also in the bath. The Five Cantons might well think it is a strange matter, which they did not expect. It involves herbs they do not know. God is the master, who gives friends and enemies according to his pleasure.</p>
      <p>The King of France has demanded Milan from the Emperor in a friendly manner. It was refused; whereupon the Emperor and King are armed, each intending to drive the other out. God protects his own and uses the princes of the world and those who despise his name for our welfare; to him be praise. Amen.</p>
      <p>If Yverdon does not surrender, my lords will march there with the land judges and large artillery. Otherwise, all matters are very well in God's hand; may he continue to be gracious to us for the improvement of our temporal life and the eternal, etc.</p>
      <p>Many people think that the Valaisans and the people of Fribourg intend to use deceit and unfaithfulness against us, showing a semblance of friendship for intrigue and cunning. I cannot find this opinion in myself; I also think their desire for land and people, honor, wealth, and splendor drives them, according to our way, but with unequal motivation, to take the Duke's land. If there is unfaithfulness behind it, may God arrange it so that they strike their lords according to the common proverb.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, February 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your good friend and willing brother</p>
      <p>Niclaus Zurkinden.</p>
      <p>Lord Berchtold is still very weak, but not dead."</p>
      <p>Further, dear Master Heinrich, I ask you, as you offered in your last letter, to briefly report to me in writing the negotiations that the scholars in Basel have had with each other, and also to let me know exactly what the Duke of Savoy's request to our Confederates of Zurich is, and with what response it was dealt with.</p>
      <p>Also, I ask you to kindly buy me 2 hats in the form I have enclosed a sample of, one with a slightly sharper point than the other, with fine, clean, pure wool, but simple and light. For my lord's council scribe has written to me about it, and I cannot leave the house now; otherwise, I would have gone to Zurich myself to buy them. I will send you the money for them in good faith.</p>
      <p>And whatever new truthful news comes to you, let me know; likewise, whatever comes to my hand, I will also report to you.</p>
      <p>No more, then may God keep you in his care, and greet Master Löwen and the bailiff of Kyburg for me, as well as anyone dear to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Lenzburg on the 22nd day of February in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of the county of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in greater Zurich, my dear, kind lord.</p>
