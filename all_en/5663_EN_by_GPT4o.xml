      <p>Greetings. Behold, reverend father, another letter, in which it is written that the council is gradually dissolving.</p>
      <p>Today I read another letter, which was written in Bergamo, in which it was announced to them the death of the pope, which I still do not believe.</p>
      <p>But it is a sign that he is lying mortally ill.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 26.</p>
      <p>More certain news about the council shortly.</p>
      <p>You see great variety.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
