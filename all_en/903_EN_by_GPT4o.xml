      <p>Greetings. Here you have your Frisius once again liberated from the underworld, which I hope has been done for his good and not to my detriment. As I wrote before, neither the laws of the people of Basel will deter me, nor will I think that the whole world is confined to this city. The inconveniences you write about your city, I knew before, and therefore I will not trouble you in testing the wills of two hundred people, and I will avoid, if I can, those inconveniences you write about. May God govern both us and the entire course of our lives to His glory. You will learn the rest from Frisius. Farewell with all the brothers. Basel, May 10, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, F[ranciscus] Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
