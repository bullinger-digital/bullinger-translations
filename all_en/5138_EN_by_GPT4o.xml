      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters (reverend father).</p>
      <p>We owe you eternal thanks, who, even in your greatest occupations, still remember us; I will return everything in good faith. I see that what Hercules Gallus of Constance communicated to the consul is not entirely in vain. Christ lives and reigns.</p>
      <p>If I write to the duke, I will use such modesty and brevity that it can satisfy a prince and not be a disadvantage to me. The courier has not yet returned; when he returns, I will discuss the matter.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new about the council, nothing certain at all; I am very surprised that the Italian brothers write nothing clear, nor does Mr. Frederick.</p>
      <p>But now our fairs are approaching, and we will certainly have something definite.</p>
      <p>They have occupied the border towns from the Adige, located against the B端ndner, and have written to the captain at F端rstenburg about how some unruly people in the Adige have gathered, intending to close the castles and monasteries. However, they have prevented this by force and captured about 20 of them.</p>
      <p>They confess that a large part from the B端ndner promised them help in their undertaking, of which they complain greatly. The captain has written back that they are completely foreign to him; they should promise much better to the B端ndner.</p>
      <p>This the captain has written to the old Mr. Travers, who has informed the bishop. The bishop has sent both Mr. Travers' and the captain's letters to our council; they consider it a foolish practice and hidden food and have therefore sent the letters back to the bishop with the city servant, indicating that if something fundamental is written to the common Three Leagues, they will know how to respond well; for this is bad stuff, etc. You have the summary; you can easily see where everything is heading: the imperialists are looking for an opportunity against us, to place foreign troops in the Adige, so that if the war starts, ours cannot move, and it is to be feared that the bishop knows well about the plans. Nevertheless, they must let Christ be Christ and remain, even if it should break their hearts. I am sending my booklet to the bishop to read and distribute almost all the copies I have among the papists. They give me such smooth, hollow words that I could easily slip over them and, if I were not careful, also fall. Now comes Philippus from Lugano, who passes through Basel by you, who can inform you about what happened in Venice with the monk, the greatest scoundrel Lastauro. He can also educate you about the council.</p>
      <p>In Como, as a credible merchant says, two monks have forced two honorable women, whom they had brought into the monastery for other business, and also abused them against all nature in the Italian manner. The women have complained to the authorities, and the two monks have been warned and escaped, etc. I send everything back with this man from Lugano.</p>
      <p>Most certainly Mr. Ambrosius paints very poorly, so that in this kind of writing I seem to be defeated by him, who himself does not paint well. Farewell, reverend father, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 19, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your observant Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I ask you to keep in mind what concerns Vergerius and his mission, about which I wrote before, and as soon as Mr. Coignetius arrives, communicate, so that the man's efforts can be countered in time.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church in Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
