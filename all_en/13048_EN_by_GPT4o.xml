      <p>Greetings. I did not know this messenger was leaving until he was already about to depart. Therefore, I cannot write everything I would like. However, I will write more extensively within three days, God willing, through Andreas, that Zurich ruffian, as I have matters I very much want you to know.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, and please give these letters, which have been kept with me for some time due to the rarity of messengers, to Froschauer. His mother sent them to me.</p>

      <p>On the upcoming Thursday, namely the first of September, the Imperial Diet will begin, about which I will write more shortly. August 26, 1547. Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>

      <p>P.S.: Georg Frölich almost succumbed to an abscess and is still bedridden, but he is recovering again. Praise be to God!</p>
