      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, Isaac Keller, a doctor of medicine and stepson of the late Grynaeus, is a man of excellent learning and singular piety, whom I commend to you, my dear Bullinger, with all my heart. He wishes to become known to good people, and because he is unmarried, he is looking around to see if any opportunity might present itself for advancing his affairs. He has a brother, Andreas Keller, a man of considerable authority in our senate and a friend of mine, to whom I would like your relative's business to be recommended, either through this letter or in your name; for from him we will receive not only advice but also assistance of no ordinary kind. We have no news at present, except that Schertlius is said to be enlisting soldiers in the name of King Ferdinand. Albert of Bavaria, having been approached by his nobility for the freedom of the evangelical religion and to prevent the Spanish Inquisition from taking place, replied that as far as that Inquisition is concerned, he never intended to introduce it, but regarding the opening of the door to the gospel, he had not yet given a clear answer when a friend from the court wrote to me, but he did indicate that hope had been given to many, albeit not clearly. We must pray to the Lord, who holds and governs the hearts of kings in His hand, that He may grant and illuminate the most ample principality with the light of true knowledge. Our Conrad Lycosthenes, by the singular grace of God, has been restored to the point that he can almost walk without a staff, but the bond of his tongue is not yet so loosened that he does not stumble over some syllables and letters in pronunciation. However, since he is making progress in this area day by day, we hope that he will again be able to fulfill his ministry, at least in part, which I so desire and pray to the Lord for as earnestly as anything, because he is certainly an instrument of no ordinary kind. Farewell with all your family and wife.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 4, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and beloved colleague. Zürich.</p>
