    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like to know what Bullinger thinks of the [Wittenberg Concord], and expresses satisfaction with Theodor [Bibliander's] [rejecting] stance. One must not be deceived like by [Till] Eulenspiegel, especially in concord-friendly Basel, where for the time being only Mayor [Jakob Meyer], the Thirteen, he himself, and Gryn√§us are aware of the matter; the latter two have opposed signing.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is necessary for me to have your opinion on the Saxon Confession. Therefore, I ask you not to delay your response. Theodor has written, and it pleases me exceedingly. We must finally see the picture of Ulenspiegel, whether we see it or not, not indeed because of Luther or the people of Strasbourg, but because of our own, who desire concord with new sails. Speak freely, I ask you. The matter has been kept secret among us for some time with the mayor and the 13 men, myself and Mr. Grynaeus; but it will soon come to light. We, that is Mr. Grynaeus and I, have refused to subscribe. This is in your heart. Therefore, we have moved the hearts of the senators. Although we have added that we will not be obstinate, as long as the truth remains. Therefore, be careful not to delay your opinion.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I could not write more.</p>
      <p>In haste, July 15, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger in the Lord.</p>
