      <p>Most Reverend Father in Christ, I do not know if anything could be more pleasing to me than to receive letters from you, beloved father, who are occupied with many affairs, both private and especially ecclesiastical. From these, I have understood how great your paternal love is towards all Christians, how you have not forgotten us, and how with ardent prayers you beseech God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ to grant to me and my entire family the spirit of grace and consolation in this so depraved age, and to make us patient, so that whatever adversity He sends us, we may bear it with a calm mind, - for all things work together for good for the pious -, until at last we are transferred with Christ into heavenly joys. For this reason, we diligently strive to retain a sure hope, faith, and a good conscience until the day of the Lord, so that we may finally enjoy eternal life with Christ and all the saints. Concerning our affairs, most loving father, I wish you to know this, that I, with my whole family, who greet you dutifully, am very well (praise be to God); it has been very pleasing to me to have learned this repeatedly through your letters.</p>
      <p>For your gift, I will strive to give thanks as much and as greatly as I can, not as I ought, and I ask that you kindly accept from me, not looking at the smallness of the gift, but at the spirit of the giver, a little epithalamium (a poem written for a wedding) written for the marriage of the most illustrious Prince Johann Casimir of the Palatinate, which was celebrated on June 4th in Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>I lovingly request that you remember me in your holy prayers and deign to greet all the ministers of the church in my name, especially Lord Walter. May God the Father of mercies keep you and yours safe.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, July 14th, in the year 70.</p>
      <p>Your intimate Reinhardt von Radtloo, Mayor of Limburg.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Father... and Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>"From D. Reinhardt von Radtloo, Mayor of Limburg."</p>
