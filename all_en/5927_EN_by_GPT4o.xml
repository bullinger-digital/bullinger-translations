      <p>Greetings. I send you (reverend father) the first part of the Response, which was produced by the first impulse; what I send is not yet polished, I only seek your judgment.</p>
      <p>I have been writing all day, and now it is late at night, and I am completely exhausted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have not distinguished everything well, and many things are also lacking in composition.</p>
      <p>The second part remains, which will be entirely didactic; for every question will be about the church, the perfection, clarity, and certainty of scripture.</p>
      <p>I intend to compare with scripture the traditions, councils, fathers, popes, and also the authority of the church in general.</p>
      <p>You see how wide a field presents itself; but either it must be silent or these things must be handled.</p>
      <p>Once these are completed, I will briefly compare the papal doctrine with the holy scriptures, which you also once did; I will add a few things about ecclesiastical judgments; for the absurdity of the papal doctrine is so great that it now falls into the eyes of all.</p>
      <p>Finally, I will turn to the Germans, and just as Fontidonius praises the benefits of the popes, so I will remind them of their misdeeds.</p>
      <p>When I will complete these, I cannot yet determine. If you have anything beyond what is in your commentaries and in the Apocalypse about the deceit of the popes towards the German princes, please, note it.</p>
      <p>I have also collected some ridiculous and inept formulas of the papists for interpreting scriptures, of which I know you have an abundance.</p>
      <p>I send these now to use your judgment. You will say I am too vehement; but consider with whom I have business.</p>
      <p>When you read these at leisure (the matter easily suffers delay), I wish to know from you whether they can be printed in ZÃ¼rich, which I would very much like due to the proximity of the place; but if not and you do not wish to involve yourselves in my fire, let me know this too, so that I can promptly look for a printer, while those good fathers still reside in Trento.</p>
      <p>In all things, I will acquiesce to your judgment.</p>
      <p>But I ask you, do not, out of your singular modesty, order me to be too modest as well.</p>
      <p>I know with what danger I undertake all these things, and God is my witness that I would have preferred to rest.</p>
      <p>But what can I do? I am dragged by the hair, I cannot do otherwise.</p>
      <p>The rascals know who I am, they know the place where I dwell; but because they pretend, they have given it to our bishop, so that he himself does not seem to be the torch of this fire.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, reverend father, for writing so tumultuously; I cannot do otherwise, my hand is exhausted. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the same day as before, or rather in the dead of night, in the year 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours observantly, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>You will return this first part of the speech through suitable people; for my copy is covered with erasures.</p>
      <p>These very things are now given to me by Mr. Ulrich Martinengi; I barely glanced at them; you will return them sometime.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be eternally revered.</p>
