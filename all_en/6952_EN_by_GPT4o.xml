      <p>I received your very welcome letter yesterday, S. D., and I give you my utmost thanks for your news, which you received from Germany, especially concerning those events that occurred in Hungary. But it is new to me to believe that Suleiman, the Emperor of the Turks, is not dead, although I received this information from two or three places in Germany, and it was recently confirmed to me by the letters of our Queen's majesty, and that Selim, his son, was received with great applause to the empire. But as I suspect, it is a great habit of the Germans to speak nonsense, especially those who support the Spanish factions, so they wish what they have thought to happen. Regarding the passage of the King of Spain through the Rhaetians or for sending troops against the Flemish through that route, because it is a shorter journey for him, if Lord Bellenerius, my predecessor, hindered the efforts of his people in those parts and suffered, I will certainly do it more ardently and with greater spirit, because I still, having never loved the Spaniards from my nature, know well that it is not in the interest of the majesty of my lord the king. Who, if it will be permitted for me to speak thus, bought that passage, nor will it be reproached to me that I not only apply diligence in that matter, but in others, which will always bring harm to the similar enemy of the Lord Jesus Christ, I will strive with all my might to provide an impediment. Regarding your letters, I made an effort today to ensure they are delivered quickly and securely.</p>
      <p>Farewell well in the Lord, and may it be well with you and your family. From Erlenbach, November 20.</p>
      <p>Your most friendly in all things, P[ierre] de Grantrye. To the venerable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zürich, his kind lord. Zürich.</p>
