      <p>Greetings. I have received letters sent to your excellence from everywhere.</p>
      <p>I acknowledge your kindness, by which you deign to send them to us as well; you do rightly; for it is useful for us to know what mortals are doing or contemplating in the world. For by knowing such things, we can speak more aptly in all places and prudently occupy the minds of men with some holy cunning. It is therefore necessary that we are not ignorant of many things that are happening, especially since we have a bishop here at the gates, etc. We have not yet seen the monk nor can we hope that he will ever come to us again. If he were present with all his kind of hooded ones, we would fear nothing. We know how evident the truth is, how powerful He who is in us is, and how the greater part of our Confederates by no means wish ill to the gospel.</p>
      <p>We do not dread dialectical captiousness and the smoke of sophistries, as we are also learned and accustomed to these in public disputations.</p>
      <p>For we have Augustin Mainard and others accustomed to suffocate these Hercules-like cacos, and why do I not mention you there? For you, if needed, would fly to us; you are our reserves, the foundation and support. But it is unknown where this hooded one has fled; he will not come.</p>
      <p>I understood what you think should be done with our people for the Locarnese against the cruelty of some. I will write to the brothers through Thecia and instruct them. I fully believe that adversaries will come here from there if assemblies are ever convened. For I myself read what they wrote to our people, which I previously wrote to you. Our people in the latest small assemblies responded to them that at the request of the most illustrious people of Zurich, they allowed the Locarnese to live among us; therefore, they cannot now decide anything different from this. I do not doubt that they will steadfastly remain in this response and purpose. However, whatever it is, when assemblies are convened, I will write to you.</p>
      <p>And as always, I am not a leech that will not let go until full of blood: we are seeking another master for our Latin school. Pontisella could not please. I read what you wrote to Comander: you testify that he is learned. We do not deny it; however, I was never given the chance to hear him, so I could understand how learned he was. For he did not want me to enter his school as a listener and perhaps as a monitor, which the commissioners and the school lords had established and the League of the House of God had ordered. You testify that he is honest; we also do. You testify that he is diligent; that I cannot. It is fitting for the judgments of good men to be free; I am therefore surprised how you can predict diligence, who, with what diligence he administered the school or taught the boys, you never seemed to see. I will say nothing here about the man's arrogance and pride, and how self-willed and irritable he is, although he always enters the temple leading the boys girded with a long sword. This, I think, mostly drove him away: the commissioners and our entire League of the House of God want the school to have some overseer (they called him a scholastic, who would have the care of the school and inspect how well everything was administered), who would enter the school every week, as often as it seemed to him, and advise if it seemed necessary. He obstinately refused this, affirming and contending that nowhere is it customary for such scholastics to be appointed, who have any right or power over the master or who have to advise him; that he is a free man, an honest man, and therefore does not want to suffer any overseer: if they do not want to believe him and entrust everything to his judgment, they may have their school; he does not want to be the master of that school any longer. With such very disdainful words of renunciation (I was present and saw it myself), he has irritated the commissioners for several years now. He indeed asked for Comander to be given to him as an inspector; however, he did not want Philipp in any way. The commissioners and the House of God, sparing Comander due to his severe old age, wanted Philipp to be the inspector. The man, as I said, irritable, renounced the school a hundred times and testified several years ago, as I said, that he no longer wanted to stay here. What could they do?</p>
      <p>They ordered him to leave. They would have gladly kept him if he had wanted to be retained and had been a little more tractable. Now they have ordered me to seek another.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I seek and ask your kindness to favor and assist us. A most pleasant dwelling and a vegetable garden are given to him, Renenses full of a hundred: a hundred good guilders. For they will hardly accept him again, so obstinate and peevish. I am troublesome with excessive prolixity, I know; but it is necessary for you to know this.</p>
      <p>No news here from Italy. I hear quietly that the Landgrave of Hesse favors the papist party and offers his services to it. Farewell, most esteemed man by all good people, and do not cease to love your Philipp. May your family and entire household be safe. Comander and Consul Tscherner greet you. It is not necessary for you to write to Tscherner and Travers for the Locarnese.</p>
      <p>From Chur, June 23, 1556.</p>
      <p>Of your kindness, Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people, his lord. Zurich.</p>
