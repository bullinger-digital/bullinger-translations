      <p>S. What I have received from various places, you can understand from our treasurer, the envoy of our republic. You can trust him in all things; for he is upright. I cannot say more at present.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. May the Lord bless you! On Pentecost, at 9 o'clock in the morning, 1573.</p>
      <p>It is always confirmed that the royalists, from April 2nd to the 7th, fired and laid down the bastions and made other breaches so that they might storm. The assault on April 7th failed for them; for those in the city received them and fell upon them in such a manner that the king suffered great losses, especially among the great lords and his nobility. There is great hunger and scarcity throughout all of France; this is testified by some servants who return home and say they have never heard of such misery, and the Swiss Confederates are also experiencing great scarcity, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and brother, Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur.</p>
