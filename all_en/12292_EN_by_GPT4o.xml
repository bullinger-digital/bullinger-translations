    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received Renato's letter [No. 2212], from which he has gathered Renato's opinion on the [“True Confession” of the Zurichers] as a response to Luther's [“Short Confession”] and is grateful for Renato's openly expressed opinion. - The claim that in the meal (coena), besides bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ are truly consumed in some way, disturbs Renato, who also doubts that such a doctrine can be testified by the [Holy] Scripture. However, it should be noted that when the believer celebrates the meal, his mind (animus) is not focused on bread or wine, but on what is represented, namely on Christ's body and blood, even if these are not offered in or with the bread, because they are at the right hand of God, as is also evident from the words spoken by the ancients during the celebration of the mysteries, “Lift up your hearts!” Through the symbols (symbola), which are a representation, the believer celebrating the meal focuses on the Christ sacrificed for him, and through faith, he receives the gifts obtained through Christ's sacrifice. Therefore, the believer participates not only in the bread but also in the Lord himself, as is evident from John 6, and has always been testified by the true church based on Scripture. - Renato believes that the feeding (manducatio) happens once, namely when one believes in the Gospel, whereas the remembrance takes place as often as one pleases. Certainly, faith is one [Eph 4, 5]; but it increases, otherwise one would not read in the Gospel: “Increase our faith” [Lk 17, 5]. This one faith must be renewed and refreshed, which happens whenever a person nourishes himself with heavenly grace or the word of life. Since the meal consists of both sign (signum) and word, why should the believer not feed on Christ in the meal? - Since Christ has prescribed us to eat the bread, not the body, and to drink the wine, not the blood, Renato concludes that in the [meal] only the remembrance should be celebrated. Certainly, bread and wine are symbols; as such, they remind the believer that the Lord has sacrificed himself for him. If the believer believes in this, he will certainly be spiritually fed by the body and blood of the Lord in faith, even if the mouth only eats bread and wine. - Renato emphasizes that one should not remember present things, but past and absent ones. It is true that the remembrance refers to the one-time and past death of the Lord. However, the Lord is still present through faith in the mind and spirit of man, so that he [in the meal] receives Jesus with all his merits (beneficia) through faith. If the believer were to receive only bread in the meal, faith would no longer play a role! - Contrary to Renato, Bullinger believes that the meal (epulum) [of the Corinthians] should not be associated again with the meal, especially in a time that has fallen into excess and drunkenness. Here, according to the apostolic rule [Rom 14, 19], only the edification of the church should be considered. The experience of the Corinthians further shows that these meals did not contribute to it. - Renato distinguishes between the first meal and the later [evening] meal [celebrations] and believes that at the first meal, the present Christ offered himself to his disciples through faith, because the disciples were called to receive, “Accipite, edite” [Mt 26, 26], whereas in the later [evening] meal [celebrations] only the remembrance is celebrated; hence [the concluding exhortation] “Hoc facite” [Lk 22, 19; 1Cor 11, 24]. For Bullinger, this distinction does not apply at all, especially since Paul writes: “I have received from the Lord what I also passed on to you” [1Cor 11, 23]. The “Accipite, edite” as well as the “Hoc facite” applies to both the disciples and the later believers, for although Jesus was physically present at that time, he not only drew the disciples' attention to visible things but also to the merits granted by him through faith. Whether at the first or at the later [evening] meal [celebrations], the death of the Lord is always proclaimed, faith in the forgiveness of our sins is strengthened, and [the participants] are encouraged to be grateful. Finally, today as in the past, hypocrites also participate in the meal. - Despite all this, Renato and Bullinger share common views: A spiritual, not a fleshly presence of Christ in the meal (even if the Zurichers emphasize the presence of Christ generated by faith; see Gal 3, [1-5]); the presence of Christ at the right hand of God, also recognized through faith (since the union of Christ with the believer or the feeding of Christ by the believer means nothing other than faith [in Christ]); the sacramental character of the meal already recognized by Augustine (while not only the [Holy] Spirit is effective in the believer, but also the external symbols speak and testify); the aversion to any opinion that attributes an unspeakable and invisible character to the meal; as well as the insight that the meal serves to commemorate the death of Christ. - However, since a meal without faith would be illegitimate, the Zurichers recognize that the believer is spiritually fed by the body and blood of Christ, but that this feeding does not occur through the symbols used in the meal, but through faith. Also, during the meal, Christ does not descend from heaven again! - Renato may believe that the dispute over the Lord's Supper can never be ended as long as there is talk of feeding the body. However, Bullinger cannot imagine how faith could be omitted in the meal and how, consequently, the feeding of the body of Christ generated by faith could be denied, especially in view of Christ's teaching in John 6, since all believers since the apostles have recognized two things in the sacraments: On the one hand, the spiritual reception through faith; on the other hand, the physical participation (participatio) in the visible symbols. The disputes among people will never end anyway. - The Council of Trent is disgracefully falling apart and leaving a bad impression. Bullinger would be pleased to hear more about it from Renato. The costly Diet of Worms was dissolved without result: No wonder, since it was not God's honor and the preservation and expansion of the church that were sought, but the restoration of the devilish church.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have received your letter, most learned and dearest brother Camillo, from which I have understood your judgment on our response given to Dr. Luther. I am not at all upset that you and men like you, pious and learned, freely express what you feel; indeed, I give you immortal thanks for this. You are somewhat offended that we write: "In the meal, besides bread and wine, the body of Christ is truly and in some way consumed, and his blood is drunk." You add that you do not yet see by what testimony of Scripture this can be confirmed. So consider this: The faithful celebrating the Lord's meal does not focus his mind on the bread and wine, but on what is represented by the bread and wine, that is, on the very body and blood of the Lord, which are now not in the bread or with the bread, but at the right hand of the Father; for this reason, the ancients proclaimed in the sacred mysteries: "Lift up your hearts." Furthermore, the symbols remind us of the things of which they are symbols. The bread represents the body, the wine refers to the blood of the Lord, and therefore the pious celebrating the meal focuses his whole self through faith on the very Lord Jesus given for us, and thus through faith receives the fruit of the given body and shed blood. Therefore, while the faithful dines, he participates not only in the bread but also in the Lord himself. Moreover, it is clear from the 6th chapter of John that the body of the Lord is eaten and his blood is drunk by faith. That the Lord's meal is celebrated by the pious through faith is so clear that it does not require laborious proof. But the true church of Christ has not taught otherwise from the very beginning of our religion according to the Scriptures. But you add: "The feeding happens once, when the Gospel is believed, but the remembrance, as often as one pleases." Indeed, there is one faith; yet it has its increments - otherwise, it would not be said in the Gospel: "Increase our faith, Lord" -; finally, it is recalled and renewed, so that a man eats as often as he is nourished by heavenly grace or the word of life. Since the meal consists not only of the sign but also of the word and sign, what will prevent the saints from eating Christ in the meal? "We think it prescribed by the Lord," you say, "that we eat bread, not the body, and drink wine, not the blood, when we gather, and that for a spiritual end, to commemorate the death of the Lord." Certainly, bread and wine are symbols; therefore, they bring something else to mind, namely the very body and blood of the Lord, which when the pious believes were given for the expiation of the faithful, he certainly ate the body of the Lord and drank his blood, namely in mind, spirit, and faith; meanwhile, with the bodily mouth, he eats bread and nothing but bread, and while doing this, he praises the Lord's beneficence and faithfully remembers that the Lord was once given for sins. You add: "If it is a remembrance, it must be a remembrance of things done, not of things present, but absent." It is a remembrance of the Lord's death, which was done once and cannot be done again. Meanwhile, the Lord is present to the spirit and mind of man through faith, not through bodily presence. It would indeed be absurd if he had said: "Eat me in remembrance of me." Therefore, we understand this of the bread and the external action, which represents the very Lord Jesus and all his benefits. We certainly recall these with faith, but in the way faith is accustomed. If we eat nothing here, we certainly exclude faith from the meal. I would not want to mix a feast with the Lord's meal, especially in this age of ours given to gluttony and drunkenness. I think the apostolic rule should prevail in these matters: Whatever is decent and edifies the church, pursue those things." However, I do not see any benefit from feasts; indeed, I see a not insignificant reason why we read that the mystery of God was contaminated among the Corinthians.</p>
      <p>Then you distinguish between the first Lord's meal and our last one, or the one in use today. But I would never concede this to you, since I believe the true meal is none other than the one handed down to us by Christ. Saint Paul testifies and says: "I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you," etc. For it is effective and divine in the saints because it is Christ's meal. You concede that in the first meal, the Lord himself is received by faith, but not in ours. You prove this because there he said: "Take, eat," etc., in ours: "Do this," etc. But the Lord's word: "Take" also pertains to us today. Or how will you prove that these words of the Lord: "Do this," do not pertain to the apostles? All those things pertain to both the apostles and us. For although the Lord was present in body then, he wanted the mystery to be celebrated by the remembrance of benefits through faith and not merely by sensible consideration, which contributes little to piety and salvation. "In the first," you say, "he encouraged those reclining with words and deeds to believe that he was giving himself for them for the remission of sins; in this of ours, all things are different." But all things are equal: for the death of the Lord is also announced to us; faith is built up and thanksgiving is stirred. For all things pertaining to the meal are directed to this end, that we believe our sins are expiated by the Lord given for us. Now you also think that hypocrites were present at the first meal, but only the pious at ours, as if we had ceased to be flesh and blood, as if in the first there were no scattered arguments from which we could gather what the later ones would be like, not to mention that the archetype is not usually the most imperfect. Therefore, if you examine all things more closely, you will see that we do not disagree badly among ourselves. You confess that Christ is present in the meal in spirit, not in flesh. Quite rightly, and while we speak of the eating of the Lord's body, we do not speak of bodily presence, but of that which is of faith. It acknowledges him sitting at the right hand of the Father, joining himself to the faithful in spirit, and therefore eating is nothing other than believing. You add: "Not in a proper way, but in the way he predicted he would be present." Again, you pronounce rightly. But we understand that proper way as sacramental, imitating Saint Augustine in that kind of expression. The sacramental way is finally that in which something is also presented to the external senses, such as the breaking of bread, which speaks of the Lord's body being broken, etc., where now not only the spirit works in the minds, but also uses external symbols, which speak and testify in their own way. Thus, I say, we have said in a proper way; but we do not want to understand it as ineffable, invisible, etc.; we abhor those. I wanted to respond briefly to your points, most excellent man, so that you might understand our opinion more correctly. We teach just as you do that the commemoration of the Lord's death is the end to which the meal is destined. But since this is not without faith, unless it is illegitimate, we say that in the meal the minds of the faithful are also fed, fed indeed by the body and blood consumed, not by the benefit of the symbols, but by faith. For when the celebrating believer believes that the Lord's body was given for him, the blood shed for the remission of sins, he eats and drinks and therefore gives thanks, just as the prophet said: "I believed, and therefore I spoke." But as the faithful does not seek an experience outside the meal, that Christ may descend from heaven and offer himself to be seen and touched by the faithful, so neither in the meal does he wish to touch or eat or drink the Lord's body given and blood shed corporally. The saints are satisfied with spiritual eating, after which they do not hunger or thirst. For those who fully believe that the Lord Jesus is the absolute perfection given from heaven by the Father, they rest in him and seek nothing else after their redeemer. It is enough for the saints that they have the symbols of truth, the signs of faith and things certainly done, bread and wine; which while they handle, they do not consider according to their substance, but according to the mind of the institutor. He wanted to retain in memory with these symbols the death once accomplished and that he was offered for us. Therefore, the saints turn the eyes of their minds to the Lord given, not seeking him in the bread, but at the right hand of the Father. The bread is a memorial and a sign, reminding and transmitting to something else that is signified. Hence the Lord said: "Take, eat, this is my body," etc. I hope I have explained our opinion to you clearly enough with these brief words, which if you consider well, you will understand does not differ from yours.</p>
      <p>You may think that there will be no end to the contention as long as we make any mention of the eating of the body while discussing the meal. However, I do not see how that can or should be omitted, without which the meal is of little benefit, that is, faith. Again, I do not see how we can deny that the body of Christ is eaten by faith according to the general and most explicit doctrine of Christ in John chapter 6. I do not see how what is offered to be explained by the words of the Lord can be omitted. For he said: "Take, eat; this is my body." I do not see how we can despise and reject the kind of doctrine used by all the saints from the age of the apostles in the church of Christ. For all who have discussed the mysteries have acknowledged that there are two things to be considered in the sacraments, one of which is perceived by the mind through faith, the other by the body through the external participation of the symbol. It seems to me certainly cautious enough if we rightly and explicitly distinguish these things and do not mix them; if we clearly teach that spiritual eating is nothing other than faith, that external symbols have the power of signifying and refreshing, not of comprehending or exhibiting what they signify. Meanwhile, I am not unaware that contentious men are never satisfied. But it will have been enough for a pious teacher to have sincerely taught the truth. They seek a pretext for quarreling in all other doctrines as well, in which in the papacy the tradition of men is more important than the purity of the word of God.</p>
      <p>We have heard that the Council of Trent has disgracefully dissolved, leaving behind a foul memory of crimes. If you were to discuss this more fully and explain how the matter was conducted, you would do a very pleasant thing. The Diet of Worms, celebrated at great expense, also dissolved without result, and it is no wonder; for such assemblies and councils do not come together to propagate and preserve the glory of God and the safety of the churches, but to restore Satan to those oppressed twice. Therefore, they are entangled in their own counsels and fall. So we, who see such examples daily, should disregard the consultations of men and direct our eyes to the word of God, teaching those things which we have received from the word of God, and praying that he may always deign to be present with us by his grace. Farewell. All the brothers greet you. Zürich, September 18, 1545. Your Bullinger.</p>
