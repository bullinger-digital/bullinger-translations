    <p xml:id="regest1">Receive attentively the educated letter bearer Johannes Lening. Your advice is correct, but our judgment of others must be determined by the desire for peace. If only they had always prayed for peace! As far as the Lutherans (?) seek peace, you will be accommodating towards them. The Prince Philip of Hesse (?) seems to be God-fearing; in this respect, we want to support him. With the messenger on our side, you will negotiate seriously and sincerely and not condemn the unknown like Luther. He should see that we - unlike the Lutherans - are truly brothers.</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord, my dear Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Receive this for your piety and that rare humanity. These are indeed counsels, as you write. However, we must judge according to what people profess.</p>
      <p>I judge you from your own words. I mean judging others. We must be cautious in our matters according to the knowledge the Lord has given us. We all ought to pray for peace, and if only this sentiment had always been present among all. But for this, greater thanks are due to God, for He has granted you this spirit. Therefore, as far as they seek peace, you will strive to be accommodating towards them.</p>
      <p>The Prince here seems to fear God. So far, let us support him.</p>
      <p>This man who comes to you is pious and truly learned, and also one of ours. This is true. You will deal with him more seriously and candidly about everything, so that no one notes in us what we rightly condemn in Luther, namely condemning the unheard and unknown. Therefore, as you are accustomed, be towards this man like Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the fellow ministers and assist this man in such a way that he sees we are truly brothers to each other, unlike what is observed among the Lutherans.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 24.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, my most dear brother.</p>
