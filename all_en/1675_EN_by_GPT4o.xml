      <p>Greetings. I did not suffer as severely as a certain woman from Bern preached in Bülach; I had a feverish diary, which had somewhat laid me low; but it ended in a very severe and burning cough, which has now subsided with expectoration. Today, by the grace of the Lord, I have preached again.</p>
      <p>Regarding the two and a half, about whom you wrote to me most recently, I cannot write otherwise than as their testimonies, which we gave them, sound. Jakob Keller behaved very well for a good while. Later, it became too long for him; he went out of the monastery at night without permission and took others with him; that brought him the blow here. Adam Fry did not achieve much in life, but also did not study much, as far as I know. Sometimes he was here, sometimes not; yet while he was here, I heard nothing bad about him. After they left, I heard that they wanted to go to war and were at the muster in Chambéry; but whether it is exactly so and how they came back, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Felk will also be gone again these days. I wish they would leave us in peace; we have more dissolute acquaintances at home than good ones, whom one must sometimes help out of necessity.</p>
      <p>So when strangers come in addition, the country will soon be so full of dissolute priests that God must punish us. I have almost insisted, as much as I could, that the idle people must go. I would gladly endure if Gisslinger, Stoffel Klewi, etc., behaved differently or were elsewhere. But those jesters are in greater esteem than wise men.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, there is nothing new, except that those from Augsburg sent to the emperor, excusing their quick surrender to the princes. So writes Meckart. What, I ask, has heaven seen or heard more insane? The city is still open and unfortified in three places; they have no people at all, trusting that they are well off with the emperor and have done nothing against him; they will realize it.</p>
      <p>Sarcerius, Brentius, and Dr. Forster from Wittenberg have been summoned there. The new council is a new devil, which will vex the churches as badly as the old Tridentine devil. But there must always be something. May God give his power and his churches victory, courage, and steadfastness. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have nothing from Baden. I send you 2 copies, as you requested, of the Ecclesiastical Doctrines. May the Lord be with you and all yours, whom I wish well in Him. All mine greet you. Musculus' wife is now suffering from the same fever and cough as I am. He also greets you with his entire family. Given in Bern, July 10, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Regarding the two and a half, we will leave it to your judgment, as we wrote most recently. If there is something to hope for with Vögeli, do the best with him; he has always behaved well here. Send the others home, since he does not want to be obliged.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
