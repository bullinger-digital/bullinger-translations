    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks the Landgrave for defending the Zwinglian faith in Schweinfurt and Nuremberg. Bullinger hopes the Landgrave will not be influenced by the well-known arguments of the Zwingli opponents. Intends to prove in the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews that the teachings of Zurich contain nothing heretical. Defends Zwingli's death in battle, which should not be understood as God's judgment on a heretic. Victory or defeat proves nothing about the truth or falsehood of the defended cause. Complains that no one seriously fights against the wickedness of the world. Assures that Zurich remains firmly committed to the Reformed faith.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious Prince of Hesse, Philipp, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you thanks, most illustrious prince, in the common name of all the pious, for defending our cause, or rather not ours, but that of Christ the Lord, for many years, and especially in recent days at Schweinfurt first, then at Nuremberg, against those who wished to have us and our doctrine, which they call Zwinglian, proscribed. For you saw with that sharp prudence with which you are endowed by the supreme prince, God, that it is not the doctrine of man that is proscribed, but the truth of God, which Zwingli preached to the whole world no less piously than wisely. Remembering the words of the apostle, in which he exhorts his Timothy and says: "Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner" [2 Tim 1:8], you did not wish the truth to be proscribed under any pretext of human name. Therefore, we also congratulate you here, most pious prince, for that remarkable prudence and constancy which is in you, and we give thanks to our most gracious Father God, who has given you to our cause as a fair judge and protector. We further pray to Him with unceasing prayers, that He may confirm what He has begun, and increase His gifts in you, granting you a secure rule, a safe home, strong armies, a faithful senate, a good and obedient people, holy and truthful prophets, and that He may preserve you for us long in safety and in the way of truth. For we know that without the special inspiration of the divine, the piety of princes is weak, so that now we attribute all that is conferred upon us through you to divine goodness, which uses you and your ministry as an honorable vessel for the glory of His name in His house. For we do not write these things because we think that the cause of truth could not stand or would perish without your or other princes' consent, for we have long since learned that truth itself is indeed invincible and immortal, by which not only princes but all the kingdoms of the world are preserved, and whatever praise or blame, advantage or disadvantage princes have, all arises either from the cultivation or neglect of truth. For what is clearer than what Christ said: "I do not receive testimony from man" [John 5:34]? What is more evident than what the prophet wrote: "Do not trust in princes or in any man, in whom there is no salvation. For when his spirit departs, he returns to his earth. On that day, all his thoughts perish. Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God, who made heaven, earth, and the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever" [Ps 146:3-6]? In sacred histories, too, we see Saul, Ahab, Joash, and Zedekiah, chief enemies of truth, in danger throughout their lives, in turmoil, having nothing safe or firm, and finally being stripped of life and kingdom with a foul slaughter of their own, while the truth, which they wished to extinguish, nonetheless remains eternal, while David, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, most faithful worshippers of truth, by the benefit of truth, remain fearless even in the midst of dangers, stand calm even in tumults, conduct affairs successfully and with the highest praise, and are finally rewarded by God, the most faithful judge, with eternal glory of immortality. From which it is clear that truth is indeed happy and immortal by itself. For those who defend the truth are indeed defended by it and enjoy many benefits from it. But those who attack it are not only deprived of happiness but do not even achieve what they wanted. For truth has stood immovable against the assaults of all tyrants since the beginning of the world. Therefore, the heavenly Father has dealt kindly with you, most illustrious prince, who has instilled in you a zeal for truth and wished to use you as an honorable vessel in His church. Hence, your piety will have acted wisely if it does not fail His calling and diligently cultivates truth in the fear of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Nor are we ignorant of what our enemies here object to you, that our doctrine is inconstant, factious, and heretical, and that we should be avoided as schismatic and seditious men. We know with what virulent tongues, with what calumnies they denounce and tear us apart. But since you have hitherto shown yourself to be a fair observer to us, we hope that you will not now be rendered unjust to us by such reproaches. For our doctrine has been proven holy and true by many writings of our predecessor of blessed memory, Huldrych Zwingli, and by the blameless life and incomparable learning of Johannes Oecolampadius. We still preserve that same doctrine, which we received from God through their ministry from the sacred scriptures, as disciples not of men but of God, whose servants they were, unblemished. This we prove in this my commentary on Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews, and indeed by the Pauline epistle itself. From which, if you could read it through your occupations, you would understand that we believe and preach nothing new, factious, or heretical, but entirely sound, catholic, and orthodox concerning scripture, the testament and law of God, concerning God, the unity and trinity of God, concerning Christ as God and man, mediator, priest, and sacrifice, concerning true salvation and justification, concerning the church, concerning the calling to the office of teaching, concerning true faith, concerning the sacraments and true worship of God, the primary chapters of our religion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since the matter itself proclaims that the doctrine we follow is holy and true, it will be your part, most illustrious prince, not to desert the truth and to be in reality what you are said to be, a prince consecrated to truth and justice, who is not irritated by the calumnies of the wicked against the innocent, nor deterred from the true and just by dangers. For Cicero truly thought that all the praise of an action is that without prudence there is nothing. Plato, in that little work entitled Laches, thought that knowledge without justice and other virtues is rather cunning than wisdom. And indeed, we do not doubt that so much strength has been given to your noble spirit by the divine, that it is not shaken by our Capellana disaster nor by the unexpected death of our Zwingli. For we know with what apparatus of speaking, indeed of trifling, the adversaries boast of victory, so as to harm our cause more. We know, I say, that some indeed shout that a factious man was oppressed by the just judgment of God through tumult, while others contend that his death is the surest argument of heretical doctrine. But listen, most merciful prince: He could not have fallen because of tumult, who was a lover of true peace, equity, justice, and country. Indeed, in war and tumult, not the worst but the best are often oppressed. However, I will not say more about this man in this matter, for I defend the man only insofar as he was connected with the cause of truth, and so connected that he either benefits or harms the truth. Otherwise, we acknowledge that Pauline saying: "Who is Cephas, Paul, or Apollos but ministers through whom you believed?" [1 Cor 3:4-5]. Nor will I write more about the cause or the right of war, whether it was war or tumult, since you are not ignorant of any of this, and since the most important of this kind were published by our most illustrious senate of Zurich before the disaster was received. I will add this, that whatever kind of death it was, it can neither prove nor disprove faith or doctrine. For you see the most impious men die with the happiest fates, and again you see the best men extinguished by the worst of mortals in the most dishonorable kind of death. For Isaiah, the prince of all prophets, was sawn in two under the prophet-killer Manasseh. Jeremiah, the most constant of prophets, and Zechariah, by far the most faithful, were stoned by the most wicked of mortals.</p>
      <p>What more should I mention of John, the son of Zechariah, than whom no one holier was born of women, or of our chosen vessel Paul? The former was slain in prison by the counsel of the most vile harlot by the most impure Herod of all, the latter was beheaded by the most cruel tyrant of all who are and have been, Domitian Nero, as a disturber of public peace. Meanwhile, no one but the most impious ever doubted the doctrine and life of these men because of their punishments. Why then do they draw the death of our Zwingli to the condemnation of his faith and doctrine, when it is well known that nothing is lacking in them from the pious? Or have they forgotten the words of the Lord: "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you" [John 15:20]? Also: "The time will come when whoever kills you will think he is offering a service to God" [John 16:2]. Do they not know that "through many afflictions we must enter the kingdom of God" [Acts 14:22]? Or will they preach the gospel to the world in such a way that they suffer nothing, always please, offend no one, enjoy delights, and promise security to their followers? A new way of preaching, unknown to the prophets and apostles. For they, taking upon themselves the hatred of all men, cried out: "If we pleased men, we would not be servants of God" [Gal 1:10]. And: "Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ" [Gal 6:12]. But if they think otherwise, why, I ask, are we so despised, and that especially for the reason that we are afflicted by the enemies of truth, subjected to insults, stripped of our substance, beaten, and daily anguished with the expectation of death? Why do they daily threaten that even the survivors of this (as they say) sect will perish? As if they had found a kind of doctrine to which whoever adheres stands beyond the reach of any weapon. But believe me, most illustrious prince: Our times are not such as to deserve leniency and security, nor are we today such as to be able or willing to bear free truth. Since, therefore, it agrees so well with us who preside over the word, with the world (for no one forbids us to be approved by the pious), it is to be feared that many things are done by us through flattery and many more are omitted through cowardly fear. And to speak freely with you, most merciful prince, it is no less to be feared that our affairs will soon come to such a state that we will wish with common prayers that we had been intercepted by that Capellana disaster along with those whom we now devote to curses, and we will say that they are the happiest who have been able to die bravely for truth and country, for we miserable ones will be forced to experience far more cruel things throughout all of Germany. And would that I were a vain prophet. But indeed, scripture records that in the times of Josiah, the book of the law was found, prophecy was restored along with true worship of God: yet a few years later, the most holy king Josiah was killed by the hand of the most impious idolater Necho, and so he was killed who had received an oracle from the Lord: "Because you have heard the law and humbled yourself before God, I also have heard you and will gather you to your fathers, and your eyes will not see the evil that I am bringing upon this place" [2 Chr 34:26-28]. For a few years later, with the greatest slaughter of both princes and people, Jerusalem, the most praised city, was plundered, burned, and utterly destroyed by the impious. Jeremiah gave the reason for this in 16 [11f]: "Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the Lord, and have followed other gods, whom they have served and worshiped, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law. You too have surpassed the wickedness of your fathers with your own evildoings. For each of you follows the evil thoughts of his own heart, so as not to obey me." If we compare our times with these, what, I ask, is more similar? For the law of the Lord has been restored, but the best men perish immediately. And what then? Truth is indeed preached somewhere, but it is nonetheless despised along with God. For of the prophets, some indeed prophesy lies in the pope, while others, who seem to stand with the truth, are more silent than they should be, where they should be most vocal, since they sweetly and with great applause of the crowd comment on charity, leniency, and divine mercy, where they should have been discussing justice and severely exposing the crimes with which the whole world is filled today. For the magistrate himself, whose duty it was to cultivate equity and justice, partly banishes and kills the innocent in the name of truth, proscribes the truth itself, and lives on the blood of citizens, partly simulates religion and therefore neglects both judgment and justice, indeed he himself commits violence, takes sides, drinks excessively, fornicates, consumes with luxury of clothing, gambling, immoderate hunting, pride, and pomp whatever was in the public treasury, and then weakens the strength and wealth of the people with new exactions, foreign wars, and evil arts. The people themselves also deceive, lie, swear and perjure, drink, and no less dissipate in luxury what they have gathered by evil arts. Meanwhile, we all sweetly comment on the gospel, but no one changes his life for the better, no one accuses crimes as he should, no one exposes and finishes them. But what shall I say of monopolies, cremators [!], publicans, and usurers, who have all sunk their roots of iniquity so deep that you would uproot an ancient oak with less trouble than bring them into order? They plunder the whole world with impunity, in their hands are the negotiations and treasures of the whole world, and though they have been raised to this by theft, fraud, and robbery, yet none of those who wish to appear as pillars of the Christian religion even moderately oppose them. Thus it happens that our affairs are conducted by force, the poor are oppressed, and the judge himself (as the prophet says) is in giving. What then is to be expected for us but some common plague, either Nebuchadnezzar or Sennacherib or Antiochus or another plague of the human race, which will once cleanse this accursed land with sword and flame, famine and pestilence? Therefore, that the Lord has taken Zwingli, that with him He has taken so many saints, so many good, so many learned, so many patricians and senators, so many innocent citizens and colonists in one hour, was indeed done by omen and divine counsel. Without a doubt, unless we are completely converted, more grievous things await us miserable ones.</p>
      <p>So now that disaster should encourage you more than deter you from your holy purpose.</p>
      <p>Therefore, neglecting the talkativeness of some, remember, illustrious prince, the words of your Lord, with which He addresses His worshippers and says: "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" [Mt 11:28-30]. Indeed, as far as we are concerned, we can freely report this about the truth and kindness of the Lord with thanksgiving, that He has never failed our church in the midst of the storms of afflictions, but has always encouraged His own, indeed He does not desert us even now, since our senate stands firm and prophecy, the laws against papism and luxury that have been enacted also stand firm, and the people stand firm. And may the Lord continue to do good. Therefore, entrust yourself entirely to such a powerful and gracious Father, cultivate His truth, stand firm in it, remain in it. If you do this, you will have accomplished what Paul aims for in this entire epistle to the Hebrews. Which, as it is illustrated by our commentaries, we wished to dedicate to your name. May the Lord Jesus confirm you with His Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 17th August 1532.</p>
