      <p>Greetings. I received your most friendly letters and first of all, I give and hold thanks for the news you were able to convey. Truly, the remarkable craft of Satan was revealed in Rome, where Tammerus presented himself as an instrument, a nefarious betrayer of the true religion, destined to receive the reward of impiety with Judas, unless he repents in time. That seat of pestilence spares no effort to be confounded by the mighty hand of the Most High. The Pope presses and urges Ferdinand and his son-in-law Albert, Duke of Bavaria, not to acquiesce to the most pious requests of their own; for the Bavarian nobility demands the same from their duke as the Austrians do from King Ferdinand; but through letters and envoys, the beast responds for both, that the administration of religion pertains to him, not to the princes. The people of Magdeburg have settled their grave and war-threatening dispute with their archbishop and the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg.</p>
      <p>There are those who predict that Duke Wolfgang of the Palatinate will wage war on the territories of the Cardinal of Augsburg, because of some plot against the Counts Palatine in Rome. The Noricans are imploring for aid; but it is unknown against whom; thus the affairs of Germany are in turmoil. I would not have written to you about the books if I had known you would gift them; however, I accept the gift with the most grateful heart and in such a way that I will be considering a token of gratitude, as is fitting. Farewell in Christ Jesus, as I cannot write more due to dizziness in my head; something I began to suffer today, previously unfamiliar to me. Kindly convey my greetings to all your loved ones.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 26, 1556.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter is a truly pious young man, as testified by all good people; whom I commend to you.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
