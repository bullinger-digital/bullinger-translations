      <p>To the man distinguished in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, Anne de Tserclas sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I have received your letters, most Christian man, in which, as if in a mirror, I have seen how concerned you are for us. Although I recognize myself as far inferior in repaying your singular friendship towards us, I will not cease to pray from the heart to the immortal God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may abundantly compensate for what I cannot provide in this regard. You will not learn the reason for Lord Hooper's imprisonment from me until I have communicated your letters to him, which is not possible at the moment; for he has gone to his bishopric as soon as he was released. I do not doubt that he himself will satisfy your desire once he has learned of it, and indeed this seems much more convenient to me than if I were to attempt this without his knowledge. Since you inquire about how my daughter Rachel is growing up, I have judged it my duty to write a little about her. First, know that she is skilled in the English language, and three months have already passed since she learned the form of thanksgiving, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, along with the first and second Psalms of David by heart.</p>
      <p>Now, since she recognizes almost all the letters of the alphabet, she is being instructed in the catechism. If I knew how to write in German, I would write more frequently. However, if it happens that your son comes to England, there will be a greater opportunity both for writing and for repaying in some part your fatherly affection towards us (which I value more than the most abundant treasures of gold or silver). I have nothing to write about Ireland, except that they say the King of France has equipped a fleet to invade it and bring it under his scepter, but through the diligence of a certain faithful Frenchman, his plans have been discovered.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a small gold coin, on which the image of the King of England is elegantly depicted, as a token for what you bequeathed to Rachel, for which she also thanks you with her childish eloquence and sends you many greetings. I implore you to advise Lord Hooper to moderate his labors: for he has four or at least three sermons daily; I fear, however, that excessive watchfulness will prematurely bring him illness, which would deprive many souls, very hungry for the divine word, of both teacher and teaching, whose hunger is known from their frequent inclination to hear him. The fear of disturbances greatly troubles us here; for there is a danger that great tumults may soon arise due to the scarcity of grain and other things, although there is an abundance of wheat and other things; but as to whom the blame should be assigned, you know better than I. I have sent your letters to Lord Hooper, and when he responds, I will ensure that his letters are delivered to you. Farewell. Greet Lord Bibliander and his wife, Lord Gwalther, Lord Pellican, along with their wives, Lord Zwingli, and his wife, to whom I also send a small gold coin engraved with the royal image. London, the 3rd day of April.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Anne de Tserclas called Hooper.</p>
      <p>My maid Johanna and her husband, the minister of the French church, send you greetings. If you write to Lord Hooper or to me, take care to seal your letters with all diligence; for some curious people are accustomed to open and read them, if by any means they can open them.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
