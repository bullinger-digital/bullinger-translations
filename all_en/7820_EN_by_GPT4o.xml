      <p>S. Yesterday, our consul returned and brought me your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, for which I thank you; for I see how much you love me, as you take so much effort to write so diligently about each matter. I am grieved, as I recently wrote, by the death of your Christoph. He could have been of great service to the country at some point; but the Lord has transferred him to a better homeland, to which we all aspire, where, freed from all evils, he reigns with Christ the prince. The excommunication from Heidelberg also greatly distresses me; for I fear the strange disturbances that will follow from it, and it is surprising that the prince tolerates these things.</p>
      <p>Zuleger also spoke very badly of Erastus in my presence; we defended him and discussed many things amicably with him on this matter. They dream of such a discipline, which, as it is impossible to establish, I do not know what good it would bring with it, namely a new tyranny and an inquisition somewhat more tolerable in many places than the papal one, if only the Genevans would restrain themselves and avoid public writings.</p>
      <p>It is regrettable that the prince so imprudently bound himself to a new marriage; I fear that eventually all arms will be turned against him. What you write about Spain, we also hold for certain; for the younger Wattenwyl, who has just returned from Burgundy, reported to me that several cities in the kingdom of Granada have already defected to the Moors and that they have already occupied some very fortified places, so that they can no longer be driven out; meanwhile, the Turk is preparing against Sicily; thus the king will have what he deserves to deal with, from all sides. He also reported that Alba recently executed 120 men in one day in Valencia. We have no certain news about the English; likewise, we hear nothing about Condé. The Count Palatine of Zweibrücken requested passage from the Burgundians, which they could not deny; thus he proceeds with a very well-equipped army, as I hear. They say that nearly 600 cavalrymen of the Aumale were killed by them; the name of the place escapes me. The Burgundians are very afraid for themselves. The Bishop of Basel fled to Biel; he arrived there last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter you wrote to me about, to perhaps appoint a preacher in Thurgau, I have informed my lord, the schoolmaster, who advises that it would be advisable to bring this forward; however, due to several reasons, and especially because my lord mayor has not been at home, it has not been possible to do so. As soon as it happens and I know the details, I will let you know. I cannot withhold from you that a good lord, who was recently in Basel, informed me how he was sitting at a meal where, among other things, they talked about images; there was a scribe, I think his name is Wild and he is either a council or court scribe, who said about the blessed Zwingli: "He was so vehement against images, and when he died and they undressed him, they found a golden crucifix around his neck, and I know this." However, Lord Bernhard Brand spoke against this and promised to address it. I write this only because it annoys me to see what people are seeking and not ashamed to invent such public lies about honorable and deceased people; it surely comes from the S[ulcer].</p>
      <p>As for these students of ours, we are sending them to you for the sake of their studies, since it is not very safe to travel to Heidelberg now. One of them is the one for whom we both stood as godparents at baptism, the youngest son of the pious memory of Musculus; there is no need for me to recommend him to you, as he will be most commendable to you by the name of the sponsorship and his parent; he has sufficient talent. The other is also the son of a good man among us and has conducted himself well with us so far. These two enjoy the stipend of the late Mr. Tillier, which he bequeathed in his will to support two such students.</p>
      <p>We would gladly promote the affairs of your relative Bullinger for your sake; but he continually hinders himself with various life errors, so that we cannot accomplish what we would most like to do.</p>
      <p>Thus, even now after the sad incident that recently occurred in our college, where the son of Lycosthenes was stabbed by another fellow student with a table knife, they could not restrain themselves, so that some of them broke out of the college with swords on the night of the Lord's Day, without the knowledge of the teacher, and wandered through unknown corners. When this was reported to the senate, six of them, among whom is also one here, were immediately captured by the officials and thrown into different prisons, where they still remain, although I hope they will be released today. This causes much outcry and annoyance, and they will be known for their misdeeds by my lords, so that they will have to pay dearly for it. Otherwise, I will do what I can, also to urge my lord mayor for the reconciliation of Muralt, although I fear that little will be achieved with the lady; for she is very strict.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I know nothing at the moment.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to preserve you and grant you long-lasting and perpetual health. Diesbach, Gravenried, Zehender, father-in-law, wife, and all of ours greet you and yours. Steiger is now spending almost the entire month in Münsingen.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 24, 1569.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
