    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's writing against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“] and forwarded the second copy to [Wolfgang] Musculus, but has not yet been able to read the book; sends a letter from Musculus [Nr. 1885]. Since the messenger is in a hurry, he must postpone the response to Bullinger's previous letter; Bullinger seems to distrust his doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Greetings from [Martin] Frecht. In Speyer, troops were granted to the Emperor [Charles V.] against the French [King Francis I.], but there is no news of peace for the Lutherans; [Duke Henry of] Brunswick is said to have secretly departed upon hearing that his case is to be brought before all the Imperial Estates; there are varying reports about the Swiss Confederates; the Papists are raging, perhaps because they foresee their imminent downfall. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord [through Jesus] Christ.</p>
      <p>I received the booklet against Cochläus, a servant of Satan, written by you; I sent another copy to Musculus. I am immensely grateful for the one you sent me; I received it with the utmost gratitude and will read it eagerly; for until now, I have been occupied with many church matters (as the situation required) and could not. Musculus, upon receiving your booklet, responds to you with these letters, which I am sending. The messenger is in a hurry to depart. I was unaware that he was leaving for Zurich; it was due to the negligence of my people, not the messenger. I would have written more; for I have not yet responded to your recent letters as I had intended, especially regarding my faith concerning the matter of the Eucharist. I fear you may have formed a negative suspicion about me. But I will write more extensively about these matters soon.</p>
      <p>My friend Frecht sends you many greetings. The Diet of Speyer is not yet concluded. The Imperial Estates have agreed to the Emperor's request to raise troops against the French; but I have heard nothing about peace for the Lutherans. [Duke Henry of] Brunswick is said to have secretly departed upon hearing that his case is to be brought before all the Imperial Estates. There are varying reports about your Swiss Confederates. The Papists, servants of Satan, are raging in a remarkable manner; perhaps they sense the imminent downfall of their kingdom.</p>
      <p>My wife and children are well. My wife especially sends her greetings to you, your wife, and your holy children. May our Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe for us and His church for a long time. Farewell and live in Christ.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, April 16, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
