      <p>But you, my Bullinger, if you have bestowed anything upon me, first know that you have done it for Christ; then, as much as I can, I will strive, if I ever recover, to make you feel that I am such towards you, so that you may never regret your efforts. It would not be out of place if you were to write back to this man from Brescia, an excellent man; for he is very influential in these parts with authority and favor, and he shows himself favorable and kind to the servants of Christ.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received those consolatory letters which our Lelio sent to Florence. For God has so willed that I receive consolation only in Him. I have nothing new to write to you; for I am in these places where everything is conveyed very slowly. If you have anything from England, please, let us know; but I had already conceived in my mind long ago that it would be so. That conspiracy of the Romans harbors some monstrosity. There is more frequent talk of Reginald Pole being chosen as the antichrist. Meanwhile, farewell and love me. Given from the fields of Brescia on the Ides of January 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Balthasar Altieri. To the most honorable lord Heinrich Bullinger, adorned with piety and learning, to be greatly revered in the Lord by me.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
