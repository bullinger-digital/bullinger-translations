      <p>My friendly greetings to you first, well-learned and beloved sir. I have received your letter along with the enclosed copy of the murderous events that occurred in Paris (I would have preferred to hear better news; may Almighty God have mercy on His own and turn all things for the best). I thank you for your letter, effort, and work that you have sent and done for me regarding this matter. I am returning this copy to you with the bearer of this letter, etc. Furthermore, I cannot withhold from you (dear sir) that, as I was riding in the evening, I happened to come by Rickenbach to Mr. Treasurer Thoma, and during our conversation, he mentioned to me that it would please my lords and him, and he thought the closer I was to my lords regarding these troubling events, the better it would be. Therefore, I seek your friendly advice on what should be done in this matter; if you also consider it good, I would send for my wife and child or make a ride up to Vorsteck myself and bring them down with me. I hereby ask you to let me know your advice and opinion through this messenger.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you and yours to the protection of God, etc.</p>
      <p>Given from Uster on the 5th of this month, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Your faithful friend U[lrich] P[hilipp] von Sax, Freiherr. 1572.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and friend, if you have a message to Heidelberg, I ask that you inform me of it at my expense, so that I can also write to my dear daughter; for she is in great worry about her brother.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my gracious, dear sir and friend, to his hands.</p>
