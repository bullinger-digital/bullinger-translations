      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write at the moment, most esteemed brother in the Lord, except to express my deepest gratitude for your remarkable kindness shown to Rudolf. May the Lord be your reward. Whatever you have done for him, I will consider as done for me. For I love the integrity and sincerity of the young man, who is otherwise an orphan. I therefore pray that you will be like a father to him, guide him in holiness, and lead him away from the temptations and foolishness of youth. Furthermore, I ask you to remind Grynäus on my behalf of what I mentioned to him about Rudolf when he was in Zürich, and to commend Rudolf to his care.</p>
      <p>This winter, I have revised those little books of mine published a decade ago, "De origine erroris," and have, in fact, made them anew with great effort for the benefit of students and in defense of the truth, which the papists attack in every way.</p>
      <p>I hope our labor will not displease good men. I am sending you and Grynäus a copy, so that the bond of charity that unites you may be strengthened by this shared gift.</p>
      <p>If you have time, read it and let me know what you think. Farewell in the Lord. March 10, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
