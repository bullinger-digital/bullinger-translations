    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks Bullinger for his letter [No. 2483], which he also shared with his brother [Thomas] and his cousin [Konrad Zwick].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He is only now forwarding Frölich's letter [No. 2486] to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Frölich will likely have also informed Bullinger that the Elector Palatine [Friedrich] has offered himself to the Emperor [Charles V] as a mediator, but intends to support the [Schmalkaldic allies] in case of war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] will soon move to southern Germany to attack. Saxony and the North German cities have many troops and good cavalry, as many mercenaries are turning away from the Emperor after learning of his intentions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Johann von] Naves expressed regret to [the Protestants] that [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, and the priests have incited the Emperor so much. Several priests and imperial officials are dissatisfied with the situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Many Swiss are crossing over to [Germany] without the consent of their authorities. It is believed that this might not end well. Moreover, these mercenaries (among whom are many sixteen-year-olds and some incompetent captains) demand quite high wages. There is also fear that they might be recalled by their authorities when they are most needed, as has happened in the past. Yet God will surely send everything for the best. The people of Zurich should continue [to pray].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings from [Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] In the evening, Blarer received Bullinger's letter [No. 2484] from July 2 from [Heinrich] Herrliberger's son [...], whose mother [...] was in Zurich. This does not require a response, as the envoys [of the Confederation] will soon go to the diet in Baden and will reveal the Emperor's deceit there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Blarer thanks Bullinger for his testimony [No. 2487] for [Konrad] Hofherr and also hopes that he will improve. Blarer is still undecided whether to recall Hofherr from Zurich (where the cost of living is said to be even more noticeable than in Konstanz) or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- He would write no less than Bullinger if he had as many messengers at his disposal as Bullinger does! However, this situation might change. Then Bullinger will realize that he boasted in vain!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- [Enclosure:] The people of Lindau are [now] neither accepting soldiers nor captains from the Confederation. The 800 mercenaries already recruited and destined for the assembly point in Kempten are behaving well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The people of Nuremberg are not attending the meeting [of the allies] in Ulm and have refused their help to the Confederation. When asked to account for the ammunition they sent to the Emperor, they claimed they only delivered what he had manufactured with them. This will likely be the downfall of their already controversial government.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- In Regensburg, an imperial councilor is said to have secretly approached [Wilhelm von Neideck and Philipp Erer], the envoys of Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg], and informed them that the Duke, whom he only wished well, should beware of the [southern German] cities because they had secretly come to an understanding with the Emperor and would abandon him in case of war. The envoys immediately reported this to their prince, who then promptly sent a message to Ulm, urging the cities to tell him the whole truth. They assured the Duke of their sincerity and their intention to support him with full commitment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The Emperor spares no trick to make the allies distrust each other. However, he does not succeed. Rather, he loses the trust of many in the process.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [Konrad Zwick] believes it is not yet time to use his war machine, especially since the allies are strong enough against the imperial forces and his invention could not secure victory for the allies if God did not wish to grant it to them. Zwick therefore wants to save the discovery for a better opportunity (which might present itself during the upcoming war) if its use would better honor God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- The people of Uri have informed the allies that they could provide many mercenaries. However, the offer must be verified. Every day, people from Uri are arriving by ship [to Meersburg] to the [Konstanz] Bishop [Johann von Weeze]. If the Bishop were to receive as many soldiers from the Catholic places [Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden] as the allies have in recent days, he might decide to attack Konstanz.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>First of all, all the best. I have given your faithful, careful letter to my dear brother and cousin to read. Thanking you diligently. Wishing to act according to the situation, as much as possible, as far as it concerns them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have enclosed this letter received from Frölich, but could not send it to you earlier. I believe nothing has been missed because he did not request to send it to you by a special messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>So I believe, Frölich has also informed you now, as he wrote to me, that our people will investigate today how the Elector Palatine is inclined, and that he has offered himself to the Emperor as a mediator; otherwise, in case of need, he intends to support us and remain steadfast.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>May God protect our people from lazy negotiations (agreements), and that they do not accept any bad direction and thus lose greater costs (efforts)!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Landgrave will soon move up here to seek the enemy. Saxony and the Lower German cities have gathered a large force, especially an excellent cavalry, as many have taken leave from the Emperor, indeed have fallen away from him, after being informed of his intentions, and have joined our side.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Naves has excused himself to our people in Regensburg and indicated that Granvelle and the priests have led the Emperor into this game. Many papal and imperial officials are now dissatisfied. They say the Emperor did not start the matter correctly. They are beginning to be uneasy about the matter. May the Lord God push his terror more and more into them, so that they lose heart and courage and are caught and shamed in their own plans. Amen. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Confederates are now running too much against their authorities. Many are concerned that it will not end well for many reasons. They want to have a large salary, although there is truly much misery among them and many young boys of 16 and 17 years, who also want to have 6 florins a month now! The other poor and naked servants 8 florins! After that, many more. There are also some very incompetent (unfit, unscrupulous) captains among them. People are worried about all sorts of things, especially when they might be most needed, that they will then be recalled by their own, as has happened before. But the Lord God will surely arrange it with grace. I am well comforted and undoubted, even if we were nowhere near as many, we would still not lie down in this good cause. Help us, as you do, by praying and begging that the strong God himself will lead the matter and bring it to a good end. Always do as your custom. We will do the same. We will see the wonderful power of God with joy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The comparison, that we wholeheartedly turn to him. Our people greet you, especially my dear brother and cousin Conrad Zwick. [The 7th of July 1546]. In the evening, I first received your letter through the son of Herrliberger, whose mother was with you, dated the 2nd of July. It requires no response, as the envoys of our people will now sufficiently and truthfully respond at the diet in Baden, that the Emperor is presenting with untruth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I gladly accept your testimony for Curione, and I hope he will gladly correct those faults to which he is prone at this age. I am almost inclined to recall him here, as there is much talk about the high cost of living with you, which is also severe with us, but still somewhat more tolerable than it is said to be there. I would never allow you to be superior in the duty of letters if I had as much convenience of messengers as you do; however, it may happen that soon I will have more than you. If that happens, you will clearly understand how you have boasted in vain against me!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Observing his friend and more than dearest brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>So you know, that the people of Lindau are neither accepting captains nor soldiers from the Confederation any further. But those who were already recruited earlier and are assigned to Kempten are behaving very well. They are doing everything they are assigned to. There are about 800 of them. Otherwise, everything is well organized, and they are gathering in Kempten.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The people of Nuremberg are also required to go to Ulm on the day. However, they have refused to visit and have presented many reasons for their business.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>And when they were asked how they mean it, that they are sending ammunition and the like to the Emperor, they answered that they are giving the Emperor nothing of their own, but only what he himself had made with them, they did not want to withhold from him. However, they have also refused help to our estates with the statement that they intend to remain steadfast in their religion with God's help. It is believed that this action will bring them great disadvantage, as their government is already very precarious. It is pure tyranny and must soon break.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>So you also know in confidence, that an imperial councilor in Regensburg has approached Duke Ulrich's envoys and revealed to them in great secrecy: Since he wishes Duke Ulrich all the best and would like to prevent his harm, he will not withhold from them that the Emperor and the cities have a secret understanding with each other. Therefore, Duke Ulrich should not trust the cities. For if it comes to a confrontation, he will have no support from them, but must remain stuck in the soup along with some others and expect great misfortune, with many other similar words. The envoys immediately wrote this down to their prince. He promptly sent a message to Ulm and called the envoys of the cities together and presented this to them with great seriousness and desire that they should once let themselves be heard, what they are inclined to, so that he knows and does not have to guess what he should expect from them. To this, the envoys of the cities answered that such things are being falsely imposed on them, and he should certainly and truly expect nothing else from them than that they will put body and life, goods and blood most faithfully to him and other allied princes, with the request that he should not give any credence to such unfounded, vain words in the future, as they intend to remain steadfastly by their plan; otherwise, he will not experience anything else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Thus, no cunning is left untried, how our people might be separated or brought to distrust each other. But thank God, who turns everything around, that thereby nothing is trusted to the Emperor and his people, and our party is caused to come together more earnestly. May God grant us that we place our best help and strength in him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>My dear cousin still does not consider the right time to reveal his armament, as it is otherwise said to be so well and strongly organized, so that even speaking humanly, our people are not inferior to the opposition or perhaps even stronger.</p>
      <p>If God does not want to give victory now, then everything else would not help either. If he then wants to give victory, even through ordinary means of people, then there are enough of them. Without a doubt, at some point, the need will arise in another way, that this war equipment will demand its use, where God's praise and glory can be better felt. It might also happen in this military exercise that the matter will develop in such a way that one must seek what is possible and humanly, alongside divine assistance.</p>
      <p>Some from Uri have also offered their service and spoken of many soldiers they know, but it will require verification. People from Uri are now coming daily to our bishop with chamois, etc. It is not known what the plans are. If so many soldiers from the lands were to be there overnight, as was the case the other night, and if the captains have something bad in mind and are laughing with the bishop, he might also easily have something and make a noise, so that our city would come into suffering. The human being can do much, and the enemy is in no way to be trusted.</p>
