      <p>Your letter, most illustrious man, was very welcome to me for many reasons, and especially because it clearly demonstrated your remarkable kindness, which I had already observed. However, to briefly explain what I wish: your young men informed me that Herr Froschauer was unwilling to disburse any money necessary for them to get through this summer, under the pretext that it seemed to the leaders of your school that Froschauer should only pay them what they owed to creditors at each fair. I do not know whether this is your plan and decision, as it brings many inconveniences; for if the young men are somewhat imprudent and extravagant, it may happen that they seek out many creditors for themselves if one does not seem sufficiently wealthy or generous in lending money, and creditors may also be more willing to lend, each believing that they alone are owed and have not chosen others from whom to borrow. Wilhelm's cause of great expenses was first his recklessness and imprudence and his most foolish generosity of spirit; this was encouraged by the ease of the creditors. They were deceived by this belief: each of them thought that he alone was lending to Wilhelm and no one else, and if they had known that it was entrusted to me alone, that if he needed anything, I would assist, I would easily believe that they would not have given him a penny in loan, and if I had known in time, I would have forbidden the creditors their ease. I omit that there are certain scoundrels who would gladly thrust their goods upon someone, but with great and unfair profit and advantage to themselves, if they hope to extort the debt or if the friends and relatives of some imprudent person are so honest and good that they would rather pay with loss than incur any danger to their reputation or any stain among anyone. You would seem to me to act more rightly if you entrusted this care to one good man, to distribute the necessary money to your young men, not making it free for all. If you think that one person cannot lend so much money to yours for half a year, perhaps due to poverty, and because he can use his own money, and yet you do not trust the young men enough to invest well if they have it at hand, then send a good portion of the money to be spent within the space of half a year to that good man, who will relieve the poverty and attend to the necessity of the young men at this time, and after that money is spent, he may add from his own if necessary, and in Frankfurt, he may reclaim it from Froschauer. Thus, it will happen that one can easily be present for yours, and others will be prevented from the opportunity of lending and the desire for profit, and the extravagance and recklessness of your young men will be removed, along with the loss. I have written this hastily and think it is enough if you only understand what I mean. Farewell, most humane man, and greet your colleagues, my lords and teachers. Yours, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher, to be honored with perpetual loyalty.</p>
