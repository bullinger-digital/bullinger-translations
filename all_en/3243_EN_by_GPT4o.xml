      <p>Greetings. I am now sending the last two gatherings along with your original copy, which you had ordered to be kept, and I have also included a single column in the last gathering, which still remained, so that, if necessary, it may serve the one who compiles the index. It will be your task, when the index is completed, which I would like to happen soon, to send it to me along with those two manuscript pages, in which the first column of the gathering D of the second alphabet is contained, at the earliest opportunity, so that we can put the final touches on the work. I could barely write this to you, as the courier was in such a hurry; otherwise, if there had been more leisure, I would have expressed to you and other friends there as much gratitude as would be fitting for the exceptional kindness and generosity with which you so liberally received and gifted my wife, who had come to you from the Baths. But I will make an effort to express my gratitude to each of you in whatever way I can. Farewell, my dear Bullinger, and if you have been able to ascertain anything certain from Mr. Bernhard or Peter Martyr, or preferably both, about this pontiff antichrist, who now sits in the holy place, which could serve to illustrate his life and be added to Bale's catalog, please send it to us at the next opportunity. Our Mr. Bale and Lycosthenes send you their respectful greetings. Farewell again and again. July 18, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, etc., his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
