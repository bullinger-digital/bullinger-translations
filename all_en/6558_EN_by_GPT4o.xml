      <p>S. I owe you the greatest thanks once again, most esteemed lord and compater, both for what you recently wrote to me and for the special favors you recently bestowed upon my daughter Delsperger.</p>
      <p>She could not commend and praise enough the kindness with which you and your family, Mr. Simler and Mr. Zwingli, received her, so much so that she even spent the night at your home with your most honorable daughters. May the Lord repay you and all of them for all these things! I am certainly unequal to the task of ever being able to repay you.</p>
      <p>As for us, we are still laboring under the hand of the Lord, who continually calls some from our assembly. The most noble and honorable man, Mr. Wilhelm von Diesbach, who had just returned from the Muretensian praetorship, passed away these days. Others are also passing away, though not in great numbers.</p>
      <p>The Lord has so far spared my family and my father-in-law; to Him be praise forever! May He continue to protect us from all evil! As for the French and Savoyard matters, they remain as before.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, things are also as they were.</p>
      <p>I greatly fear that someday a third party may reconcile us.</p>
      <p>Concerning the Rhaetian business, everyone asks that you share with us what happens there in the future; for everyone fears that this matter may eventually have a tragic outcome. The Valaisians acted far more prudently in the election of their bishop.</p>
      <p>We have no other news, except for those you also mentioned. You know that Mr. Farel has passed away.</p>
      <p>Viret has been forbidden to preach in Lyon; however, since this seems to have been effected by the suggestion of evil men, envoys have been sent to find out whether this was commanded by the king. A certain Erlach has also been sent by the senate to act on our behalf so that he may remain there; he has not yet returned. We hear that he has been granted permission to preach again; however, he does not wish to do so until those who bring the king's authority return from the court.</p>
      <p>I have Galeatius Capella in Latin; the German version, as translated by our Rümlang and printed here, I have not yet been able to find at our booksellers; if I find it later or if you want the Latin version, I will send it. Zehender finally writes; he lost his maid these days to the plague.</p>
      <p>Please, on my behalf, thank Mr. Lavater for sending me his Joshua; I praise his diligence; however, I have not yet been able to go through everything. I will do whatever I can for his brothers; Bernhard has again been bedridden for several days with his previous illness, but he is now better. As for the master, I hear he is also better than before.</p>
      <p>Also, please tell Mr. Gwalther that I took care of his letters to Mr. von Prato Romano, the consul of Freiburg; if he wishes to write to him again, he should send it to me; for the mother of this man, the widow of Mr. Wunderlich, a most honorable matron, is with us almost daily and continues steadfastly in religion, despite her deceased husband and sons wishing to draw her back. May the Lord confirm and preserve her to the end.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Steiger, Diesbach, Mülinen, my father-in-law, friends, and brothers, as well as my mother and wife, send their greetings to you. Greet all of yours.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you from evil!</p>
      <p>Bern, October 17, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his father and compater, to be honored with the greatest respect always.</p>
