      <p>Greetings and Peace. Since I changed my lodging, my lord and reverend father, I have written nothing to you, as I could not do so conveniently, and also to avoid bothering you.</p>
      <p>The old host Rovelasca, tired of the length of my illness, ordered two months ago that I should seek lodging elsewhere, for he needed the room (hypocaust) I was using. He did this against the advice of all his family and relatives, even his wife; but God, in whom I trust, was with me. An Italian doctor, whose services I was using, took me into his house and treats me like a father, thanks to God's kindness. My former strength is gradually returning, and I hope for better days.</p>
      <p>If I bathe in the Swiss baths, I do not doubt that, with divine favor, I will be completely freed from this illness. Colladonius and Peter Chevalerius, my old classmates and friends, are coming to you. The former, after greeting you, plans to go to England and would like to be recommended by you, the best of men. The latter, Chevalerius, intends to go to Venice and elsewhere in Italy, where he has heard there is someone outstanding in the Hebrew language. You will be able to hear from them what news there is here. However, I wanted to write some things, which I pray you will consider kindly, for I do not doubt that you have more certain and more numerous information. There is no longer any doubt about the surrender of Middelburg; we have understood this from letters written in Antwerp. The new governor, seeing that he could not help Middelburg with supplies, ordered by public proclamation in Antwerp that five hundred gold coins would be prepared and given annually to anyone who could, by some stratagem, bring aid to the besieged in Middelburg, but in vain. And what is most significant, it is written from Antwerp that the Spanish garrison was ready to betray the citadel with the consent of the Antwerp citizens, which the governor prevented. The Spaniards returning from Belgium and passing through here openly say that the new governor has no authority and that his edicts are not worth a straw, that he is neither heard nor approached, and that the remaining Spaniards are said to no longer wish well to their king nor serve him faithfully. The Belgians, on the other hand, are very ready to throw off the yoke of Spanish tyranny from their necks, and all the more eagerly because they hear that Count Ludwig of Nassau, together with Duke Christopher of the Palatinate, is coming with an army. A few days ago, they occupied the nearer part of the town of Maastricht, and yesterday it was reported that the further part, which obeyed the Spaniard, also surrendered to them either by force or by command. King Philip is said to be coming to Belgium, but the Turk, who is approaching with a very well-equipped fleet, may perhaps detain him. The treasure of Cologne, along with the three kings, was stolen; the citizens are very indignant and tumultuous, and they think it was done by the bishop to help King Philip's governor with money. The Poles, impatient with French arrogance, ordered the French who had accompanied the king, with very few exceptions, to return to France.</p>
      <p>Lord Goulard, a minister from Geneva, writes to me that the English are about to cross into France, unless they are already in France, he says. There is a persistent rumor among some about the death of the Duke of Savoy, who still holds the most excellent matron, the widow of the admiral, in chains because she is unyielding in her constancy to the true religion.</p>
      <p>I pray you will consider these few things kindly, my lord and reverend father; you will receive more from my friends here. If I were well, I might write more and more certain things.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the best and greatest God keep you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 15, 1574.</p>
      <p>Lord Zwinger visited me a few days ago and asked me to send you many greetings in his name. I ask you to greet in my name Lord Gwalther, Lavater, my godfather, and your entire family. Your most devoted and respectful, entirely yours, Johann Baptist MÃ¼ller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord and father, to be honored with eternal reverence.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
