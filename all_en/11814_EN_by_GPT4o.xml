    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the greetings directed to him in Bullinger's letters to [Johannes] Comander and [Johannes] Blasius and considers himself fortunate to be connected in friendship with Bullinger. Wishes to send three or four thirteen-year-old boys - including his son [Johannes] - who have so far been taught by Philipp [Gallicius], to Zurich for further education; asks Bullinger to look for a suitable host and to inform him of his suggestion and the costs; the boys would depart around September 29; [Johannes] Blasius will forward the letters addressed to Travers in the future. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the most renowned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, Johannes Travers from Chur sends greetings.</p>
      <p>How eagerly I received your greetings from the many letters sent to Comander and Blasius, my dear sir, is impossible to express in writing. Know that when I merely read your name, my heart leaps with joy, much more so knowing that I am noted in your register. What greater honor could I expect than to be counted among the friends of such a great man, which makes me exceedingly grateful. Even if fate has placed us at some distance apart, so that letters can rarely fly back and forth, it is enough for men that the friendship between Bullinger and Travers is stronger than any marble. May the gods preserve you, so that I may enjoy this for a long time and repay it with mutual exchange, which I delay due to my work. Furthermore, I have three or four young men - one of them is my son, the others are nephews by blood - aged 13, whom I have decided to send to Zurich for instruction in grammar and good morals. They have received the beginnings of their grammar from our Philipp; however, I am unsure to whom I should entrust their education. I wish for them to be well-fed, so that they can enjoy their studies without hunger. Indeed, that age is most impatient with hunger. Whatever decency requires, I would not hesitate to pay. Therefore, I have chosen you alone to find a suitable patron for the young men, both for the honesty of morals and the necessity of food, drink, and cleanliness, whose storerooms are full, so that there is no need to buy necessities every day. After making an inquiry about the patron and how much should be paid for each, you would inform me; I would like the young men to depart around the feast of St. Michael. Our Blasius will send letters to me in due time. May your kindness take on this task for our sake with an open mind; if I cannot repay you otherwise, I will forever extol Bullinger. Farewell. From Chur in Rhaetia, on the Nones of August 1543.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, the most deserving ecclesiast of Zurich, my distinguished brother to be extolled with all my might.</p>
