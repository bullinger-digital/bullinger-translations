      <p>Greetings. Behold, as the merchant is now ready for the journey, whom I thought would stay, I wanted to share with you what you might already know: From Strasbourg, I received news that the people of Münster are suffering from a great shortage of essential goods, such as salt and wood. There is still enough lard and grain. Meanwhile, several wooden forts (called blockhouses) are being constructed outside the city, so that they cannot be attacked or essential goods brought in. They refused to bear the bishop; now they are forced to endure the king, who, according to his whim, executes anyone he suspects of opposing his rule.</p>
      <p>In the Duchy of Württemberg, Schnepf is attempting to introduce many practices of the Saxon churches. Blarer and Grynaeus, with the reformed schools, will soon return to their own. Micyllus is called to teach Greek, and Paul Phrygio to act as a parish priest.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt, the preachers are gravely tumultuous, divided among themselves into factions, which Capito will attempt to reconcile as he descends there via the Rhine. Bucer, for the same reason, has been called to Augsburg because of Bonifacius Schwenckfeld, and will scarcely return after another month or two. Ah, miserable churches, where factions hold the helm! I would rather yield to my calling than preside over the shipwreck of the church through faction.</p>
      <p>Take care, since he will return to us sooner than another messenger who carries common letters, to respond to everything and, if you have any news, to share it with me as well, especially to inform me about the business of the Antronians.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>March 9, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>That messenger is most trustworthy. You can safely entrust everything to him.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
