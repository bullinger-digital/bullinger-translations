      <p>Most excellent Bullinger, greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received two letters from you at the same time, in which you thoroughly respond to all that I had requested from you; in this, I am fully aware of how much I owe you. I will indeed be grateful as long as I live, but what I can give in return, I do not know.</p>
      <p>In these assemblies, which were recently held among the Rhaetians, I could achieve nothing except for letters of recommendation written in the name of all; if not for the impiety of some, I would have also obtained procuratorial powers. They have entered into a treaty with the French; the Emperor's envoy was present, but achieved nothing. Many fear that some disturbances may arise because of this. May the Lord protect His own from the cruelty of the impious. I only wonder that Lord Vadian, after returning to St. Gallen, has not written back to me; he ought to have done so, at least for the sake of his humanity. If those copies, which were to be sent from Geneva to Froschauer, have been transferred, I greatly desire, as I have often written to you, that they be sent as soon as possible to Clavenna to Doctor Augustin. You will ensure that these are delivered to Basel. Farewell, and love me in the Lord and pray to Him for my and all the brothers' salvation.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, July 22, 1549.</p>
      <p>Always your most observant, Baldassare Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and learned minister of Christ in the church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-to-be-observed lord. Zürich.</p>
