      <p>Greetings. I truly do not know by what new circumstance it has happened, my esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord, that for almost an entire age, as it seems to me, I have written nothing to you, nor have I received any letters from you, when previously neither of us ceased in the duty of writing. I indeed acknowledge here, or by this name, the fault of my silence, that I should have long ago testified my gratitude towards you and the other most pious and learned men by letters, when it is not otherwise permitted, for those exceptional and very costly acts of Christian kindness, with which you all so abundantly and far beyond my merit treated me when I was recently there. Therefore, I implore and beseech you, whom it was more fitting to prove my gratitude, by whatever means you can be moved, shamelessly joining impudence to ingratitude, to kindly and dutifully fulfill my part here and on my behalf, but with your most elegant words, to give thanks as much as you can, and the greatest thanks, to those excellent and incomparable men, especially to you, whom I cannot but recognize as another self for the sincere friendship which we have cultivated for many years now, and I am not ashamed to interrupt and request anything from you, which I myself, if I could, would provide in every way, albeit less successfully. I, for my part, implore the most generous giver of all good things with supplicating prayers, that he may abundantly return thanks to each and every one of you from the treasure of his inexhaustible goodness for such great generosity towards me, who promises that not even a cup of cold water given in his name, much less such great acts of charity and benefits, will go unrewarded, etc. The main thing I greatly desire to know from your kindness is whether that little book by Mr. Jacob Andreae, minister of the church in Göppingen, written and published on the Lord's Supper, is approved by you. I greatly admire the pious effort of the good man, as I understand him to be so devoted to peace and concord, but I do not yet see clearly what success it will have, as some things, which ought to be especially clear and simple, he twists and entangles more than enough. Then, I beg you, let me know what you and your fellow ministers think about the confession of the most holy Farel and Beza made before the Württemberg assembly on the same subject. I have received nothing about the colloquy at Worms since it began.</p>
      <p>Written in Augsburg on the 1st of September, that the new alliance at Landsberg is being expanded; many bishops have now joined, such as Salzburg, Würzburg, Bamberg, Freising, along with evangelical cities, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Ulm, so that they may remain better with the gospel; namely, the gospel defending the enemies of the gospel! Polweiler has 20 horsemen around Horb as a rear guard, in case the English need them. The Palatinate and Württemberg have wanted to make the same servants on the coat; in this, a message has come from the king that they should be dismissed. Silvester Raid and the Count of Ortenburg are supposed to lead a cavalry expedition; they have not yet accepted over 500 horses, cattle, and cows; they are stationed in Augsburg and Roggenburg. The electors and all princes from our side are supposed to be assembled in Ulm, except for Saxony; he has ordered Mr. Lindemann and Carlowitz, who govern.</p>
      <p>The king does not pay the merchants for the annual profits he should have paid from such great goods that he took from them; he writes that he must now use everything for the war, which makes the merchants very dissatisfied. Our Welser writes and commands me to write to you many, many services and greetings from him; he thinks the merchants will not let themselves be involved anymore, as it is said. Saint Quentin is supposed to still hold firm and cause no less damage out than the enemies do in, although news has come recently that it is supposed to have been won; uncertain. Likewise, it is written in Augsburg that the pope has expelled 18,000 prostitutes from Rome, each first fined two gold crowns. But is this not, my Bullinger, to repent and seriously contemplate a new reformation of the church? However, everyone thinks that he would have also proscribed all the sodomites and entirely the sodomites, if he had not feared that Rome would be reduced to a complete desert (if he did), with no one left even in the papal court. About the very serious wound that France has received, and that in the very bowels of the kingdom, there is no need for me to write to you, who know everything better. However, I write that there is a danger that these are the beginnings of far more atrocious evils, especially since the Frenchman continues so bloodthirsty and drunk with the blood of the saints, undoubtedly soon to fill up his measure and to feel the same measure abundantly repaid to him. For the just God does not seem to be about to dissimulate any longer, but will soon strongly avenge the blood of his saints, so abundantly shed for many years now, with his mighty hand and outstretched arm, whom we implore with tireless zeal in prayer, that in the meantime he may graciously be present with the invincible power of his Holy Spirit and add to them unbroken spirits and superior to all human things, so that, having conquered the prince of the world with his arms, they may reign and triumph with him in spirit in heaven, and here on earth may fertilize the field of Christ's church with their blood and the example of their invincible endurance, so that a greater and more abundant harvest may happily rise from it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul more than dearest, you best brother, with your household, your church, and all the brothers and friends who love me in Christ, all of whom I uniquely desire to be aided by the advocacy at the throne of grace with mine. Commend me reverently and most lovingly to Mr. Peter Martyr, the most faithful witness of Christ, whom I was fortunate enough to see and converse with recently, and whom I will rightly count among the chief calculations of my happiness. And oh, three times, four times, and even a thousand times happy Zurich, which the Lord illuminates with the teachings and examples of life of so many incomparable men, may he graciously grant you that you may not be brought down to hell, exalted to heaven, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation. My Funck, along with Fuchs, Wittenbach, and the elder Mr. Jacob, especially my wife, bid me to write greetings to you and wish to be commended.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ preserve you all for a very long time, faithfully and happily ministering and contributing to the ministry of his church. Bienne, 18th of September, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Truly yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
