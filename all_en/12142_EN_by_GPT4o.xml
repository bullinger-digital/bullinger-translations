    <p xml:id="regest1">Cochläus thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 2078] and for the kindness shown to the messenger [...]. That Bullinger opposes the common Mother Church pains him more than Saul's and Jonathan's death pained David at that time. - Cochläus particularly mourns Bullinger and Melanchthon; as the only ones among the [Protestants], they have legitimate wives [Anna, née Adlischwyler, and Katharina, née Krapp, respectively] and are distinguished by their scholarship. The pious, formerly common "praeceptor" [Matthias Kremer or Johannes Caesarius?] from Cologne has informed Cochläus by letter that Bullinger obtained the master's degree at the Bursa Montis in Cologne in 1522, where Cochläus himself and Heinrich Glarean also studied. Therefore, it grieves Cochläus all the more to have Bullinger as an opponent. From that common "praeceptor," he also learned of Bullinger's place of origin, Bremgarten, as well as the explanation that Bullinger's one-sided argumentation is due to his disregard for dialectics and philosophy already during his studies. - Cochläus appreciates that Bullinger has not received monastic or priestly ordination and therefore is not illegitimately married like his allies Luther, Bucer, Musculus, or Osiander - if he even considers the Zwingli opponents Luther and Osiander as allies. - Bullinger dislikes Cochläus' call to the council, and he refers to the advice [of Christ], the prophets, and the apostles. However, the [Catholics], the Lutherans, and the Anabaptists do the same! Should one be satisfied with the church split because of this? The Church is and remains one, as it was before Luther's and Zwingli's rebellion in Germany. By what right does Bullinger now want to assert himself as an arbitrator, when the [Catholic] side has always endeavored to seek the opinion of other nations in disputes to prevent a one-sided judgment in the interest of a single nation? Luther and Melanchthon also appeal to a council, but they only pretend to do so. In this regard, Bullinger and Zwingli are more sincere. - Cochläus is surprised that Bullinger has not seen his writing "De sanctorum invocatione," especially since it was handed over by the printer [Alexander Weißenhorn] at the Frankfurt [Autumn] Fair [by Christoph Froschauer]. With the [“Brevis ἀντιβολή”], Bullinger indeed responded to [Cochläus’ “Replica brevis”]; however, the latter was written only after the writing "De sanctorum invocatione," in which Bullinger was admonished even more comprehensively than in the "Replica brevis." Cochläus also admonished Vadian in it (who, if he is still alive, must be very old, as he was already known in Vienna before Luther's and Zwingli's [appearance]). Certainly, Bullinger and Vadian are very well-read, but the [Devil] has blinded them and made them prisoners of lies. How gladly would Cochläus help them! - Even though he has decided not to polemicize further against Bullinger, he would still like to know how Bullinger reacts to the writing "De sanctorum invocatione" and to the [“Epilog”] of the "In primum Musculi Anticochlaeum replica." For although Bullinger surpasses Cochläus in scholarship and language skills, the latter remains invincible and undaunted because he trusts in the truth of the Church and the spirit bestowed upon it by Christ. - May the Lord compel Bullinger to insight as he once did with Paul, for Bullinger is particularly dear to Cochläus. - Greetings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings in abundance. I received your letter, Bullinger, which you gave to my courier in Zurich on February 1st, on February 18th. Therefore, I thank you for your kindness towards the messenger. And if only I could confidently thank you for your friendly disposition towards me! But your persistent intention to contend against the Church of Christ stands in my way, about which I am truly so saddened and grieved that I think King David did not grieve more over the death of Saul and Jonathan. For I justly grieve over the death of your soul - by which you will most certainly perish eternally unless you return to the Church from which you departed - more than he did over the slain bodies.</p>
      <p>How lovable you would be to me, O Bullinger, through your noble intellect, if you had remained an obedient son of our mother Church (which gave birth to and incorporated both of us into Christ through baptism) or at least, returning to her through repentance, you would say: Mother, I have sinned against heaven and before you! However, although there are many today (alas) learned men who rise up and fight against this common mother, who regenerated them as well as us in Christ, with what seems to me to be parricidal hatred and rebellion!</p>
      <p>Yet I grieve more for none than for you and Philipp Melanchthon, whom I know alone among your accomplices to have legitimate wives and to shine nobly with intellect and learning. A certain pious, learned, and serious man recently wrote to me from Cologne (whose name is well known and even venerable to you, if I am not mistaken) that you obtained a master's degree in the arts there in the year of our Lord 1522 at the Bursa Montis gymnasium, where I also studied good letters for six years. Hence, it pains me all the more that I must have you as an opponent, who also shared with me a common mother in the study of letters, which also made Heinrich Glarean, your compatriot, very dear and familiar to me. But lest you suspect me of seeking your favor with flattery and false words, I will add here the words that our common teacher from Cologne added in his letter to me: "As for the fact that he brings forth such prodigious and utterly incongruous arguments, I believe it stems from the persuasion during his time with us that the art of dialectics and all pagan philosophy were of no importance, so that unless we began to lecture on sacred letters at certain hours, it would have been over for the gymnasiums." This he said, from whom I also learned that your homeland is Bremgarten.</p>
      <p>From your letters, however, I gladly received that you never "swore to the prescriptions of any bishop, abbot, or prior," although you added an impious note in the margin, as if you would not regret the act if you broke the faith pledged to them, as Luther, Bucer, Musculus, Osiander, and others of your wickedly married accomplices have dishonestly and impiously done - if you even acknowledge Luther and Osiander as accomplices, who are publicly refuted by your Zwingli's doctrine.</p>
      <p>However, I see that it displeases you that I have called you to the council and invited you amicably; and you say you have the "angel of great counsel" and the "sacrosanct council of the prophets and apostles" and their assembly. But we also boast and trust in the same. The Lutherans also boast of the same; and indeed, they boast before you, as do the Anabaptists. What then? Should we therefore remain perpetually in discord and schism? But truly, the Church of Christ is one, as it was happily before the rebellions of Zwingli and Luther, and it will remain so until the end of the age. Consider, I pray, by what title of law or equity or pretext you can constitute yourself as a judge in this cause of discord.</p>
      <p>This discord was indeed stirred up by learned, but restless, proud, overly confident men, Luther and Zwingli, among us Germans.</p>
      <p>Our side has always desired the judgment and determination of other nations on all the articles of discord, lest we seem to rashly usurp judgment for ourselves in our own cause. Luther also appealed to a council more than once, but always and everywhere fraudulently, whose deceits Melanchthon imitated, having something different in their hearts than on their lips. Therefore, I prefer you and Zwingli to them in this, that you have acted neither so deceitfully nor so unstably as they did. And so I am very pleased with this word of your letter: "I (you say) cannot and should not speak otherwise than I feel in my heart and mind." But it grieves me greatly that you trust and rely too much on your own prudence.</p>
      <p>And I am surprised that you have not yet seen my booklet "On the Invocation of Saints" against you. Certainly, my printer affirms that your printer received several copies of my booklets against you at the Frankfurt fair, that is, at the upper market. You responded to the "Replica"; but before that, I wrote "On the Invocation," where indeed I reproached you for much more than in the "Replica."</p>
      <p>I also reproached Vadian, your fellow countryman, about whom I would indeed like to understand from you whether he is still alive. If so, he must be very old, who once before Luther and Zwingli illustrated your homeland with a splendid reputation for learning in Vienna. You both indeed read much, but the "Thousand Craftsman," by whose instigation you fell from the bosom of the Church, has blinded your minds, so that in such abundance of reading and learning you cannot see what is right, what is true and pious in the Church, which the apostle does not vainly call the pillar and ground of truth. For the father of lies holds you captive, having received power over you through the fault of full defection (which I say with sorrow), just as a wolf is wont to receive power over sheep straying from the flock or fold. This I lament with unfeigned sorrow in you and your accomplices, and if by any way or means I could bring any help to the present danger to your reputation and souls, I think nothing so grave or difficult that I would refuse to bear or undergo it for your sake, so that you might be redeemed from the captivity of such a bloody enemy. Believe, Bullinger, as you please!</p>
      <p>Although I have resolved not to contend with you any further, I would still gladly see what you can respond to both what I objected to you in the booklet "On the Invocation" or refuted in you, and to what I now repeated in the "Replica" against Musculus and said has not yet been answered by you. Indeed, I willingly yield to you in intellect and learning and skill in languages, but in the meantime, I trust so much in the truth of the Church and its spirit, which it received from Christ, that remaining in it by the grace of God, I wish to be and to be considered invincible and also undaunted by all of you, knowing well that truth can be conquered by no deceit or artifice.</p>
      <p>These things I write to you, grieving and sad - whom I would desire to embrace and love above all your accomplices in the Church, if you did not obstinately resist - and I pray to God to resist your ill will and, if it cannot be otherwise, to compel your will by his absolute power and even violently convert it to better things, as he did with the apostle Paul. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother in Christ, if you will be an obedient son of our ancient mother. Forgive me, I pray, and pardon the prolixity to which both the grief from contention and the desire for your salvation and good reputation have driven me.</p>
      <p>From Eichstätt, on the 11th day of March, 1545.</p>
      <p>Johannes Cochläus, your sad and unwilling adversary.</p>
