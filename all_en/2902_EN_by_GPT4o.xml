      <p>S. D. I am greatly troubled that the alliance could not be formed until now. We must diligently pray to the Lord that He may guide this difficult matter and bring it to a beneficial conclusion for all of us. Your envoys are now in the council. I do not know what response they will receive. This I know, your people are loved by ours. I truly rejoice that my apologetic exposition was so well received by you, my very dear and esteemed brother. I also thank my God who granted me this favor, that this booklet is also approved by other holy and learned men.</p>
      <p>In Austria and Bavaria, the number of true believers is greatly increasing. Meanwhile, they are wonderfully oppressed by the exactions of King Ferdinand. Yesterday, a messenger returned to us from Vienna, Austria, who brought the Syriac New Testament, printed at the expense of the King in Syriac and elegantly indeed by a certain Zurich citizen well known to me and now a citizen of Vienna, and reported that a truce was bought from the Turks for the price of 8 tons of gold, and now a large sum of money is being urgently demanded from the poor and otherwise exhausted subjects, and among them, clear signs of indignation and impatience are now appearing. It was reported in recent days that the papists are plotting war against the evangelicals in Germany, and for this reason, various pretexts are being invented. The most honorable magistrate of this city (I do not know what he suspects) orders his people to be ready at any moment.</p>
      <p>The illustrious man D. Johannes a Lasco also wrote to me about some hope of a colloquy. I have not yet replied to him, as I lacked a messenger. I will respond at the first opportunity. I (like you) have little or no hope: rather, I fear that from a moderate fire a very large fire will arise. Those indeed, with whom the colloquy will be held, are either of a more vehement and thus plainly Lutheran disposition, like Schneppffius, Brentius, Westphalus, and countless others of this kind, or of a more moderate disposition, like Philippus, Pacaeus, and a few others. These, according to their nature or softness, will not want to offend them. They will not yield even a straw, but rather will unload their wagons of insults upon us for our barbarism. And even after the colloquy (as we see happened after the Marburg colloquy), they will triumph in their letters and from their pulpits.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any reason to promise ourselves anything else or better with any sweet imagination. These Lutherans have been too well known to us for 30 years now. But some hope that this matter can be moderated by the modesty of the princes, by which the harshness of the barbarian preachers can easily be mitigated. But listen to what I hope here. If we yield from our opinion, or if we wrap up what we have clearly taught until now in some unknown coverings, we will feel the benevolent princes, and the form of concord will be the Augsburg Confession. If we do not accept this, we will be dismissed as stubborn and proud. I honestly say now that I cannot accept and acknowledge the Augsburg Confession, both for other reasons and because of the Apology attached, and because you have now experienced from Westphalus's writing what they think of the Augsburg Confession. What he writes and says, all the others feel. And you will find that not even Philippus will do what you hope in this matter. But why I judge the princes this way, listen. Most of the princes are professed Lutherans. All depend on Emperor Augustus. They presented the Augsburg Confession to him: in the same diet, they condemned the Zwinglians. Nor is there any reason to think that they acted more sincerely in the later diets. For in these last Augsburg diets, we Zwinglians were again excluded. What about the fact that the Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg, who now holds the primacy and is entirely dependent on Brentius, sent a well-Lutheran confession to the Council of Trent in this chapter and had it printed in both German and Latin. All the imperial recesses contain the condemnation of the Zwinglians. Here I can never be persuaded to believe that they will yield even a little from what they granted to the Emperor and the Orders of the Empire with such constancy and clarity of opinions. What then remains but that from this colloquy a great detriment and disgrace will return to our churches? Nor is there anyone who does not understand that when we depart with the matter poorly patched up, the scandal will be more serious than it has been until now. What about the fact that I do not fear in vain that contentions will be stirred up about more articles of doctrine than we now think. Moreover, examples terrify me.</p>
      <p>For, not to mention the Imperial ones, how much, I ask, harm did D. Bucer give with those Swiss colloquies? He certainly sought peace and seemed to want to care for the wound of the daughter of Zion with some good zeal: but the outcome taught that he acted imprudently and badly. This he himself finally obscurely indicated when he more than once answered the holy men asking about this controversy: I see that God does not want the church to be taught by me in this cause.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish D. a Lasco prudence and that he does not attempt anything of which he may later repent for his entire life. As for D. Vergerius, if he is doing anything in this cause, and D. a Lasco expects something from him, it is certain that the excellent man a Lasco is entirely mistaken and deceived. For D. Vergerius himself wrote to me with his own hand that D. a Lasco is striving for a colloquy but in vain. This was the sense of the words: I do not remember the words any more. I think the Bernese will not agree to any colloquy, as they still remember how much Bucer's colloquies exercised them and involved them in great dangers. As for ours, if they send a delegation, they will send it on no other condition than to listen, propose and defend our doctrine, and report the proceedings back to the council and the people. For this is the native custom, and they will not allow themselves to be persuaded otherwise. For they too are exceedingly hostile to colloquies, especially because of the many and great colloquies of Bucer with the Swiss ministers held with great danger and great expense.</p>
      <p>I write to you more copiously than usual so that you may well understand what I hope or feel about these colloquies with those people. If you were to hear our colleagues or fellow ministers, you would hear far harsher things.</p>
      <p>Yet I honestly say that I would rather have a colloquy with the most papistic than with this kind of people. For I see that they have stripped off all humanity and armed themselves with deplorable obstinacy, to say nothing harsher. Let D. a Lasco himself with his people experience what he can achieve with them. If he finds them benevolent and some hope shines forth, we will achieve more in writing than in a colloquy. Nor would it be ungrateful if you were to narrate these things of mine through your letters to D. Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>For he desires to hear my opinion. And I will write to him, but when I can have a messenger, I do not know. You may perhaps more conveniently announce these things to him. In place of the excellent man and of blessed memory, the old D. Pellicanus, we are thinking of calling the illustrious man D. Peter Martyr. May the Lord favor us. Pray to the Lord for us. Love us, for we love you and yours. Farewell with all the fellow ministers. All of ours greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 29, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man D. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. [Geneva]</p>
