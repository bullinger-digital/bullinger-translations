      <p>S. D. Although we entirely expected what you have reported, most esteemed lord in Christ and dearest brother, we have nonetheless heard of it being accomplished with great sorrow of heart. We have all read your letters diligently and cannot disapprove of your responses and requests. Therefore, since you wish to know our advice and our opinion on what should be done in these trials, we can say nothing other than to do what you are doing, that is, with all your hope fixed on God through our Lord Jesus Christ, without ceasing, implore His help. Then, modestly, bravely, and steadfastly present your requests, asking that you may enjoy the doctrine and customs of your church, especially since even the dying prince himself, God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has willed it so, and commands nothing else in His word. The ancient church was not lacking in distinguished lights, who judged that the diversity of ceremonies benefits the churches, lest any necessity be imposed on the churches because of them and their freedom be violated.</p>
      <p>But also, a change cannot be introduced into our churches without causing great offense to our neighbors, and it would not be useless if you were to write to the most illustrious Landgrave of Hesse, requesting that he interpose his authority here, so that nothing rashly be changed. For this reason, we think it would be useful if you carefully explained to him the points you have outlined in your letters to us. If only we could be of help to you in this matter; nothing would be lacking on our part. However, we fear that those who are dealing with you will become more enraged if they hear that you have even the slightest commerce with us or seek help from us, and we wish that they do not do what they do out of hatred for us. Therefore, we pray to the Lord that He Himself may assist the good cause, that is, His own, and you, His ministers, may He strengthen you in confessing the truth, even if this is connected with your peril, and may He graciously preserve you, and make the princes favorable to you. All our fellow ministers greet you all by name.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ and be prudent and strong. ZÃ¼rich, August 1, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men, Matthias Erb and Nikolaus Rhegius, ministers of the church of Riquewihr, esteemed and dear lords and brothers.</p>
