    <p xml:id="regest1">Rümlang's silence is certainly due to being overworked. - Bullinger sends [the "True Confession" or the "Orthodox Confession of the Zurich Church"] against Luther, even though he does not doubt that Rümlang has already seen this writing, as [the Zurichers] sent it along with a letter [No. 2100f] both to the Bernese council and to the [Bernese] brothers. However, they received no response. Rümlang should report how [the Bernese council] received the writing. - In Geneva, people who spread the plague are said to have been captured and 15 women burned at the stake. Bullinger doubts this news. If Rümlang knows anything certain, he should report it. - [Christoph] Froschauer could have sold more copies of the Zurichers' response to Luther at [the book fair] in Frankfurt. - Rümlang should report on the [Bernese] situation. - Greetings to Erasmus [Ritter], [Johannes] Wäber, [Peter Im] Haag, to the scribe [Peter Cyro], to the treasurer [Sulpitius Haller], and to the others.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am very surprised that not a single letter from you has reached us. The only thing that comes to mind is that you are so distracted by various tasks that you cannot do what you wish. For there are no reasons for me to think that you have changed your mind. So break the silence, brother, and make up for what I have so far lamented as lacking.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the confession of our church and the response made and given to Luther, although I do not doubt that you have seen this before as well.</p>
      <p>We sent a copy along with letters to the most honorable Bernese council, to which they have not responded, although we did not request any response.</p>
      <p>However, it would not be ungrateful if you would indicate how they received this duty of ours. We did everything with a kind spirit, whatever we did.</p>
      <p>We also sent a copy along with letters to the brothers, the ministers of your church. But they too have not responded at all. Perhaps they do not think much of our writings, that is, they despise them. For we do not wish to be held in high regard. We would prefer that love prevail among us and that the churches unite. We did what we thought was our duty. We entrust the rest to God.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that a pestilential faction has been discovered in Geneva, which has caused the death of many good men through poisonings, and therefore many are now being led and cruelly tortured, and thus 15 women have been burned at the stake in one pyre. The atrocity of the matter and the multitude of criminals make me doubt the rumor. However, I pray that if you have any confirmed information, you will let me know.</p>
      <p>Froschauer sold all the copies of our response to Luther, which he arranged to be transported to Frankfurt. He would have sold more if he had had them.</p>
      <p>Write back, I beg you, and indicate how your affairs are going. Greet Erasmus, Wäber, Haag, especially the scribe, your lord treasurer, and the other devotees of piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, April 14, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man by both piety and lineage, Mr. Eberhard von Rümlang, his singular and dearest friend and brother. Seckelschrybern.</p>
