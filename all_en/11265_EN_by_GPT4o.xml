    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Bullinger's friendly letter, he gladly reports on his activities. He reads Herodian in Greek, Cicero's "De officiis," Ceporin's grammar, and Erasmus's "Syntax" daily with the boys entrusted to him. He attends lectures by Grynaeus, Oporinus, and the recently returned [Hieronymus] Gemusaeus in Basel; he has undertaken the study of Hebrew grammar by Theodor [Bibliander] and the biblical books. He would be very grateful if Bullinger could influence Werdmüller's father to acquire urgently needed books - by [Grynaeus], Calepinus, Dolet, Livy, Augustine, Plato, and Demosthenes. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. By addressing me first with your letters, most kind father, you abundantly show your truly paternal spirit towards me, even though I have long had no doubt about your goodwill. Therefore, I rightly revere your name in the Lord, who combines such eloquence, learning, faith, and religion with remarkable kindness and love towards me and other students. Thus, I write to you about my affairs not only because I owe it to you as my superior, but because I wish from my heart for you, my second father, to be aware of them, and I gladly accept you as the leader and guide of all.</p>
      <p>Every day, I teach the boys entrusted to my care Herodian in Greek and Cicero's "De Officiis," Ceporin's Grammar, and Erasmus's Syntax, and I review with them after dinner what they have learned during the day. I also attend daily lectures by Dr. Grynaeus, who interprets Hermogenes' rhetoric for us, and to avoid being completely ignorant of histories, I listen to the Greek lives of Plutarch read by Oporinus. Recently, Dr. Gemusaeus has returned, who will continue with the latter analytics, a man highly skilled in every kind of discipline; I especially admire his lectures and am least likely to neglect them. I have also undertaken the study of Hebrew grammar by our Theodor and have dedicated hours to the sacred scriptures, so that I may somehow understand the reasoning and demonstration of the principal places in theology and also be able to instruct others in them at some point. For there is no doctrine that makes the conscience so peaceful and reconciles it to God.</p>
      <p>These are my studies, to which I am solely devoted, and hardly any time remains for the exercise of writing.</p>
      <p>However, I complain to you, most kind father, that I suffer from a great lack of books and am burdened by a large amount of debt. Meanwhile, my parent abhors the expenses I incur, although I consider myself very frugal. I wrote back to inform you of the books I cannot do without: I lack the recent Lexicon by Walder; my old one is hardly satisfactory. I lack the new Calepinus, for I only have a very old one. I lack both volumes of Dolet's commentaries on the Latin language. I have never had Titus Livy. To purchase these five volumes, which I have long needed, barely 10 florins would suffice.</p>
      <p>I omit the works of St. Augustine, Plato in Latin and Greek, Demosthenes, etc. But I could remedy all this if my parent would pay even half of the debt to Froschauer, which you alone could easily obtain from him; for you alone have influence with him through your authority and reputation for wisdom and piety. Therefore, in your immense kindness, look upon your most obedient son Otto, whom you have always pursued with singular love and who will direct all his studies to the glory of God and the benefit of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>I wish well to your family, Dr. Pellican, Dr. Theodor, Dr. Amman, and all the others.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 30, 1539.</p>
      <p>Otto Werdmüller, your most loving.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father. Zurich.</p>
