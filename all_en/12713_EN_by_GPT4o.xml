    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Enclosure:] When the [Schmalkaldic League] set out from [Ballmertshofen] to the camp near Giengen on October 14, the enemy appeared on a nearby hill. So, they sent some cavalry squadrons and foot soldiers to meet them. The enemy initially waited but fled in great disorder as soon as they were attacked. Had they been pursued (which was not done because the military leaders feared an ambush), they could have killed several thousand men, as [Emperor Charles V with the majority of the army] had already set out towards Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When the [Emperor] learned of the arrival of the Schmalkaldic League, he turned back. A significant Italian prisoner [Hannibal Guerini] reported that [the Emperor] was so annoyed by the defeat of his soldiers that he decided to avenge them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He undertook this on October 16. He sent out three cavalry squadrons to steal several supply and fodder wagons from the [Schmalkaldic League]. In response, the [Schmalkaldic League] dispatched four cavalry squadrons, pushing the enemy back to a forest. There, almost 2000 Italian and Spanish shooters were hidden, who fired so hard on the [Schmalkaldic League] that they had to retreat. Subsequently, the [Schmalkaldic League] attacked the enemy with reinforced troops and took the forest and the hill. Both sides lost many men and horses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] When the Schmalkaldic League wanted to advance further, the enemy occupied a small [barren] hill in the forest with 3000 arquebusiers and stationed several cavalry squadrons behind it. The [Schmalkaldic League] also reinforced their arquebusiers and attacked the enemy. After initially being pushed back, they finally managed, with the help of the shooters, cavalry, and armored double mercenaries, to push the enemy back. It was a bitter fight, with many wounded and dead on both sides.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] They could have pursued the enemy, but feared heavy losses, as the enemy had deployed a very large number of cavalry, arquebusiers, and other soldiers, and had also positioned large cannons and many cavalrymen and mercenaries on all the hills of the other [Brenz] bank, while the main army of the [Schmalkaldic League] was too far away. Therefore, the [Schmalkaldic League] remained on the hill they had won and defended themselves with all their might for half the afternoon, even though they were being shelled with heavy artillery. They only set out for the camp after the enemy had retreated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] More than 400 people fell on both sides. Among the victims of the [Schmalkaldic League] were two noble landsknechts and four noble cavalrymen. Among the Imperial forces, many high-ranking Italians, who were nobly dressed and wore golden chains and gilded armor, were killed or captured. Additionally, a friend [“Hocherdus” from Oranien] of [Maximilian of Egmont, Count] of Buren, was shot. We will see how God continues to guide the matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] On October 20, the enemy laid another ambush behind the previously mentioned grove. Afterwards, several imperial soldiers ran towards the [Schmalkaldic League] to lure them into the forest. However, they smelled the rat and remained cautious. In the open field, however, they went hard against the enemies. Cavalrymen and riders launched a fierce attack, in which over 200 Imperial soldiers were killed and about 200 mules and horses were captured.</p>

      <p>What happened on October 14, 16, and 20, 1546. - F.</p>
      <p>When we set out on October 14 to move to the camp near Giengen, the enemy appeared on a hill not far from Giengen and made a show of force. In response, we dispatched several squadrons of cavalry and foot soldiers. As they advanced, the enemy waited for a short time. But as soon as our forces attacked, the enemy fled. Such a flight occurred among them that if we had pursued them (which was not done due to the concerns of the military leaders), we could have killed a man or several thousand, because the enemy had broken camp and intended to move towards Ulm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>When he heard of our arrival, he turned back. The fact that his men fled so disgracefully annoyed the enemy so much that he tore at his beard, as reported by a great lord, an Italian, who was captured and said he would account for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On October 16, he attempted to avenge such disgrace and sent out about three squadrons of cavalry to capture some of our supply and fodder wagons. As soon as we became aware of this, we sent four squadrons of cavalry against them, which drove the enemy back to a forest, where about 2000 Italian and Spanish shooters were hidden, who fired so heavily on our cavalry that they had to retreat. Subsequently, we reinforced our forces with cavalry and arquebusiers and attacked the enemy again, so that we took the forest and the hill by force. There was great damage to men and horses on both sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>When our forces wanted to advance further, the enemy occupied a small hill in the forest with 3000 arquebusiers and had several squadrons of cavalry behind it. We also reinforced our arquebusiers, and our forces attacked the enemy in their advantageous position. Initially, our forces were pushed back. Then, our shooters and some cavalrymen, as well as double mercenaries with armor, forced the enemy back with great force. A mighty, fierce skirmish ensued, with many good men on both sides wounded and dead, and it lasted long among the foot soldiers and cavalry, so mixed up that it was unclear who was friend or foe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our forces could have pursued further with might. However, the enemy had gathered all their forces, with many cavalry and arquebusiers, and behind them their powerful forces on horseback and foot, and on the other side of the water, on all the heights, they had their large artillery and many troops on horseback and foot. Moreover, our powerful forces behind us, who were skirmishing, were far away, so we did not know how to advance further without significant losses. We remained with our forces on the hill, and the skirmish lasted fiercely for half the afternoon, with heavy artillery fire. We did not withdraw until the enemy had retreated with all their forces. Then we returned to our camp.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is estimated that not fewer than four hundred people were killed on both sides. On our side, we lost two noblemen among the landsknechts and about four noblemen among the cavalry who were shot. On their side, many Italian nobles, who were well-dressed and wore golden chains and gilded armor, were partly captured, partly shot, and killed. Notably, a close friend of the Count of Buren was killed and shot. Whatever Almighty God will send further, let it be according to His divine will.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>On October 20, the enemy laid another ambush behind the previously mentioned grove. Many of them ran out towards our camp to lure us. However, we sensed the trap and knew they had hidden their shooters in the forest. Therefore, we did not let our forces engage them. But in the open field, they made good use of their equipment against them. On another side, we organized a force on horseback and foot, which caused a great commotion, killing over two hundred of the enemy, and also captured about two hundred mules, cavalry, and other horses, which they brought here to the camp, etc.</p>
