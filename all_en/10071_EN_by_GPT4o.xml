      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Although I have not written to you, dearest Ambrosius, since, if I am not mistaken, two or three letters, I cannot even think that I have fallen from your mind. For true friendship and Christian love do not diminish once begun, but rather increase daily. Relying on this, I commend to you our Gervasius Schuler, my fellow student, who, a few days ago, was expelled from our homeland Bremgarten along with me and now lives in exile among the people of Zürich. He is a man distinguished in both learning and piety, faith, and fidelity, to whom you could safely entrust a distinguished church, if there were one. He is from Strasbourg, and besides, he has a wife and, if I am not mistaken, two little daughters. Until now, he taught Christ purely in Bremgarten; now, through the tumult of war, he has been expelled along with me. Meanwhile, I, also condemned to exile, live in Zürich, waiting to see what outcome God will give to these matters. We know, however, that both the prophets and apostles, and finally Christ himself, endured and foretold persecutions. Hence, we bear all things with a patient mind, knowing that we will be glorified with him with whom we now suffer. If you have need of Gervasius's services, write to our Leo or to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us and our unfortunate Switzerland.</p>
      <p>1531, on St. Andrew's Day, in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Ambrosius Blarer, preaching the gospel in Esslingen, dearest friend and brother.</p>
