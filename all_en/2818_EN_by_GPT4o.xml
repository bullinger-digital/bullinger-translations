      <p>I received your letter along with the most learned books you sent, my dearest and best Bullinger, and I am more than extremely grateful. You act out of your love, you honor and burden me with your perpetual benefits beyond measure. In return, I do nothing but support your endeavors with favorable omens at the throne of grace, never failing. May the Lord grant you strength of body and cheerfulness of spirit, so that you may continue to do what you do for a long time in His house. Pray for us. I learned late about this godfather's journey to you, and now I have received letters from Augsburg, to which I must respond whether I want to or not.</p>
      <p>Bartholom√§us Welser has indeed written to me recently, and if I have a message for you, I should wish you much goodwill and good years with the request that you earnestly pray to God for him. He writes a very Christian letter as always. May God preserve him in the increase of all good. He sent me the entire imperial decree from Mainz printed with privilege; it consists of 226 folios. I assume you have seen it, especially the extract concerning religion.</p>
      <p>I am sending you herewith writings from the Austrian hereditary lands to the king; he also sent them to me. I ask you to send them back to me soon; I have not yet fully read them.</p>
      <p>He also writes to me that the emperor no longer governs at all, having become entirely like a child; his illnesses have consumed him to such an extent. The Bishop of Arras is a powerful man.</p>
      <p>He also writes that the pope has great hope that, upon the peace made between the emperor and the French, as well as with England, etc., a united persecution of the Lutheran heretics will be undertaken, to which he is working much more than to make a stately resistance to the Turks.</p>
      <p>I would have much to write to you about our affairs as well; however, it is not possible for me. Lord Peter Fuchs is no longer anything, removed from small and large councils, completely despised, so that they no longer invite him to them. The old man is hard-pressed and deeply troubled, although he dissimulates strongly; he is in a very poor condition. They have made a very shameful song against him. In short: he has completely fallen into disgrace. We preachers cannot really manage to get out of it, thinking that some things are happening too briefly; we nevertheless continue to walk with him and are friendly to him as is proper. He has indeed always faithfully helped with good things and earnestly helped to punish vices. He has requested leave from office, perhaps he sensed something beforehand; he was immediately let go and not asked by anyone, as was otherwise customary, to continue doing his best. He was once elevated and then brought down again, having had Palm Sunday and Good Friday one after the other. May the Lord gladden him with a gracious Easter day and make him great in His kingdom. He has two beautiful children, a son and a daughter, with the young woman; she has also become loveless and weak. If it were your will to write him a comforting letter now or later, it would be a work of love; he relies much on you.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Basel will come here the week after Quasimodo Sunday, and he is to be sworn in here; he wants to see if the peasants in the valley will also swear to him or not; unrest could well arise from this. The peasants are running after the Solothurners, wanting them as protectors and patrons, they are very wild and unruly. May the dear God grant peace and all good.</p>
      <p>Along with this letter from Welser, I have also received a similar copy from another with the king's attached response; I have first sent it to Lord Meuslin in Bern; it will be returned to me in 2 or 3 days. However, in summary: the king is preparing for the upcoming imperial diet in Regensburg, with a long explanation of how his royal majesty is in no way against the gospel, but according to the correct interpretation of the holy church and teachers, etc. He also points out that the breaking of the sacrament in one form is not new, but has flowed from the old apostolic church, so that one cannot sufficiently wonder that such wise, learned men allow themselves to be so blinded.</p>
      <p>Greet your household with all good lords and friends and earnestly pray for us.</p>
      <p>It deeply pains me that the Bernese do not agree with the Genevans; let us pray with the most fervent wishes to the Lord, that through the true and solid peacemaker Jesus Christ, He may unite their minds most closely, so that this unpleasant discord does not become the seed of much greater evil. About which I wish I could discuss some things with you in person, which cannot be safely entrusted to letters. January 26.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
