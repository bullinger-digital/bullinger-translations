      <p>S. We give and express our greatest thanks, most kind Mr. Bullinger, for the two booklets you sent us as a gift, and if nothing else, we will diligently pray to the Lord that you may have the strength of every kind to bear and accomplish the burden placed on your shoulders, as you have done so far, which has been glorious to the divine name and most useful to the church itself. We highly approve of those booklets, which contain the sum of all matters concerning our true and pure religion, and also respond, though familiarly and amicably, to the slanders of some proclaiming I know not what horrors. Among these are not the least the preachers of the word among the people of Ravensburg and Jakob Necar, minister of the church of Lindau, certainly worthy of being dealt with more harshly and answered, who act not with scriptures or probable reasons, but only with clamor, surpassing even Luther himself in blasphemies and slanders. But I hope the Lord will someday confound these new papists as he did the old ones with the spirit of his mouth.</p>
      <p>Then I also received a bundle with letters and took great care of it and will continue to do so in the future, but I ask that both you and Mr. Vergerius consider the delay favorably; for it is not to be attributed to my negligence, but because those to whom I can more certainly entrust such matters offer themselves more rarely, and even if there are some about whom I would have no doubts, yet because of various rumors and dangers, they are less willing to undertake it; therefore, I must, whether I want to or not, wait for and observe opportunities.</p>
      <p>As for the people of Locarno, it is certainly not forgotten that we appealed to our magistrate, indeed urged them to grant them as much as possible, offering our service in this matter if collections were to be held; but they replied that if they were asked by them, then they would do what is proper. You wrote back that the needy should be anticipated with kindness, as the Lord loves a cheerful giver. We therefore continue to urge, but we make no progress.</p>
      <p>However, our synod will meet these days, where we will consult on how the matter should be further approached, so that our compatriots do not neglect these good people above others. And I hope you will soon hear what has been done.</p>
      <p>Moreover, lest I omit this, since your synod is also about to convene, we have learned something that should not be kept silent.</p>
      <p>Weaker infants recently born are baptized by midwives in the fields of Zürich, thus the evil serpent tries to reintroduce errors long since expelled. But we could hardly believe it, we defended the people of Zürich as not allowing this. The women replied that this is permitted to them by their pastors; we did not yet believe it. Finally, we elicited where and by whom this was done. The place indicated is Wösterspys, inhabited by a certain citizen of Schaffhausen, whose wife gave birth a few days ago. The midwife was a certain woman from Martalen, other women from Andelfingen were present. The midwife baptized, as her pastor did not disapprove of it, and the women of Andelfingen confirmed and confessed the same about their pastor. What now needs to be done, we entrust to your humanity; however, it seemed right not to remain silent, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, Mr. Martin Peyer reported to us a story he heard from the French envoy, namely about the English Bishop of Canterbury; but since we believe you have long since heard it, I cease to be troublesome. He said that after long imprisonment, he finally, wearied, subscribed to his adversaries and recanted, evidently out of fear of death and overcome by imprisonment. However, finally condemned to the fire and led there, moved by repentance, he confessed his gravest sin, namely that he falsely subscribed, but what he had previously believed and written was the truest, and that he thus believes and will always believe, having delivered an excellent speech to the people, he thrust the hand with which he wrote into the fire and burned it; the impious, not yet satisfied, threw him entirely into the fire and burned him.</p>
      <p>These things seemed worth writing, so that if there are any new things for your humanity, you may also inform us about them.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor of a huge army approaching Germany; the Swabian cities are being fortified, fearing great danger. The Duke of Württemberg is equipping the castle near us called Hohen Twiel with all kinds of fortifications.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and as always, love us and keep us commended along with our church.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, April 29, 1556.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Gualther, Volfius, Theodor, etc., in my name.</p>
      <p>Simpertus, Grübelius, and others greet you. Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your humanity.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zürich, most respected lord and brother in the Lord.</p>
