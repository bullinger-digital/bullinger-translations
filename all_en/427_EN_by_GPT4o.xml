      <p>Worthy and gracious, dear sir. I have received your letter well, understood all its contents, and satisfied the messenger. I perceive in this your diligence and faithful promotion, for which I thank you most highly and will thus follow your advice, as well as that of Mr. Bernhard, the honorable man, and follow his good counsel and opinion.</p>
      <p>The leaders in Basel offer to uphold their freedom and to act well on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Also, the king's envoys, to whom I am now writing, are to moderate my case with the five places.</p>
      <p>And when I can now be accompanied to..., I hope my case will turn out well.</p>
      <p>If then I am to be treated so inhumanely, as I do not expect, then He who created heaven and earth will help me.</p>
      <p>I was highly sought after, but not immediately... it is meant, they want to see how soft other people are, how to deal with them, and when I am expelled, then the freedoms of the Confederates will first be disputed, etc.</p>
      <p>I will also make my defense in writing and can endure that it be sent to the emperor, and I will also solicit that those from Basel write about me and say whether I conduct myself well or poorly. I also do not intend to act violently against the Confederation and have not done so.</p>
      <p>My king has now been reminded by me several times to renew the confederation with the Confederates; why he delays, we do not know. But regarding England, he should soon be approached with good reasons, etc., diligently.</p>
      <p>Herewith commended to God's grace. I ask that the other letters be assigned to their place.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, February 5, anno 49.</p>
      <p>Your very willing S[ebastian] Schertlin subscribes.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in ZÃ¼rich, my gracious lord and trusted friend.</p>
