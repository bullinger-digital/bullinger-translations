    <p xml:id="regest1">Faces a dilemma, as the people of Zurich advise him against [accepting the doctoral degree], while those from Bern and Strasbourg urge him to give in; he will not accept the title in any case, but would possibly be willing to be commissioned to the ecclesiastical teaching office through the laying on of hands, and asks Bullinger to inform his colleagues of this as well. Thanks them for their comfort and promise of help. His proposal should remain confidential, as he would prefer to avoid this compromise.</p>

      <p>I am now twice miserable; for not only can I not satisfy my adversaries, but neither can I satisfy my friends. As much as you call me back from this, the brothers from Bern and Strasbourg urge me on. What should I do, Bullinger? I think nothing at all, lest I begin to harm you as well. However, a way is needed, and something must be done. If only the judgments of the church were constituted as they were in the past; it would be possible to resolve matters without quarrel, if any error arose, by the common judgment of good men. Now one says yes, another denies, the rest stand doubtful as to where the matter will end, the good not without pain, the wicked not without joy. If I allow myself to be the only one in this matter, you see how burdensome I am. But however the matter stands, it is certain that I will not admit this papal title and mask in any way. However, so that I may do something and not be said to be the only one who is not moved by the authority of the whole republic, nor by the synod and assembly of the church, I would allow myself to be marked and designated not by the pope, but by the church as a teacher, by the laying on of hands, in the apostolic rite and manner, and that not by the authority of any doctor or pope or bishop, but by our pastor. And this is what I want to allow the good to think of me, no more. If this can remove the dissent, it is well; if it cannot, I am well aware that I am not the author of the dissent, but of Satan's titles. I wish you to communicate this to all the brothers through you, so that if you approve this plan, a way may seem to be found by which matters can be addressed, and that indeed in a right and legitimate manner, and free from all unhappy ostentation and pomp.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I give the greatest thanks for the most honorable consolation and invitation of all of you. I recognize the genuine charity and spirit of Christ in you. May the Lord preserve us in His holy will. Amen.</p>
      <p>S. Gryn√§us, your brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the first of January.</p>
      <p>You will tell no one of this my plan; for I would wish to avoid even this necessity, if I could.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
