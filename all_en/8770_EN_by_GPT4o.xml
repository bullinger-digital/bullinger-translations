      <p>I recently wrote about our meeting held in Maienfeld, which our malevolent critics have attacked with various voices and slanders, saying that disturbances are now arising, which we have long since given birth to with our congregations. Most of the brothers, instructed on the nature of this preposition and the whole cause of the Rhaetian, diligently performed their duty. Two of them from the Engadin, pastors of the Rhaetian valley and the same place where Captain Conradin Planta resides, were asked to stay with Conradin when they passed through the village of Fideris on their return. After hosting the two along with the pastors from Davos and S-chanf with an excellent feast, he finally took aside one of the two, namely Mr. Johann Scheckius, who returned from Basel two years ago and spoke highly of your many acts of kindness. After addressing him flatteringly, he sought to learn all the secrets of our synod and meeting. The good brother, having forgotten himself, reported everything and gave this meddler ample material to attack us with our own sword. However, when he had already gone to sleep and rest, he saw in his dreams the devil and its monstrous form approaching his bed and threatening him so many times that he feared being snatched away with each approach.</p>
      <p>Awakened from sleep, he miserably cried out and confessed this betrayal to his fellow sleepers, barely regaining his composure after being comforted. This mockery of Satan served as a lesson for him to keep faith and perform his duty, so that he resisted the greed of Mr. Rhaetian more strongly than others and vowed not to remain silent or betray anything further in anyone's favor. When he later spoke about these matters, that cunning and impostor of human salvation presented him with a new obstacle. A certain Ammann, not very Christian and a friend of the Plantas, aspiring to some prefecture through their arts, publicly interrupted the brother and pastor in the temple while he was preaching, accusing him of lying and was very reluctant to reveal such things to the people.</p>
      <p>These are the arts of those men who try to suffocate such a matter with gold, prayer, and price, as well as tyranny, and to suppress and block it in the throats of good men. Scheckius told us all this with tears the day before and earnestly begged us for forgiveness, as he does not cease to obtain it from the Lord with unceasing prayers, by whose benefit and grace he now feels more uplifted. The remaining brothers of the House of God performed their duty so well that it was almost unanimously concluded in this Covenant to relinquish the administration of the Guicciardis preposition and to make the Rhaetian bulls public to the communities. Thus, the people of Bergell and the Engadin, despite our dissuasions, became so enraged that they were not content to assign not a few observers to their envoys to deter them from corruption and to keep them in the faithful and sincere duty of their legation as a public guard; but the people of Bergell, on February 3rd, along with two hundred armed men led by Baptista von Salis (who, along with another knight of that place, was forced to renounce this order of knighthood with punishment imposed and spurs and collars removed) reached as far as the Septimer Pass, intending to compel the Rhaetian lord to plead his case from chains. But hindered by the mass of snow, they could not break through the mountain and abandoned their attempt. However, this decision, which was made by the House of God, was not so unanimous with the Ten Jurisdictions after collecting votes; but most communities, not properly understanding the matter, entrusted all these things to the lords to arrange and left the Guicciardis and Rhaetian preposition, once taken away, to be destined for new uses, either for a school or for the poor, in the power of the lords, as if those goods had not long since been consecrated to the school in Tschlin and all the churches of Valtellina and had been most faithfully converted to these holy uses by the Guicciardis stewards, as testified by all the ministers. Fearing not one danger from this, we severely admonished the Ammann of Davos, Peter Guler (who not long ago, when he had gone to the Valtellina for some matter, was falsely instructed about the nature of this preposition), that they should not join this Covenant with their opinion, having found some new way; for it would be that through this aggregation, the goods of the House of God, which abundantly serve the church of Tschlin, to which they properly belong, and the poor ministers and exiles, as well as the well-established schools, would be taken away and in time either return to Mr. Rhaetian or lay the groundwork for a Jesuit school or be converted to profane uses with the churches despoiled; we can make everyone believe with public instruments and the supplications of the Italian churches: namely, that these goods have been faithfully administered and that the churches desire no other steward than this one, not to mention how alien it is from the best prince, if he takes away what he has granted to a faithful subject without any cause, rather than appointing a good steward to greater things. The Ammann seemed to be so softened by our exhortation that, leaving his previous opinion, he considered taking a better path.</p>
      <p>Soon, with a deliberate mind, he replied to us: this matter must be entrusted to the lords once; but if anything had been neglected through inexperience, it could be corrected with this single remedy, that this preposition be referred again to the communities, which would then direct it to whatever uses they wished; having obtained this, he would then strongly strive to ensure that not only are these revenues confirmed for the Italian churches illuminated by the light of the gospel, but also that the ministers' work is free for them to have whatever steward they please. Thus, on February 4th, it was decreed by the lords that the entire account of these goods be commended to the communities, from which we have the best hope that these goods will be left to the Guicciardis stewards and that, against the will of these Jacobites, that is, supplanters, these revenues will be consumed for the journey of Christ. - Now I come to the first session, which was on February 2nd, in which the president of the Rhaetian Valley or the Eight Jurisdictions, having returned from Innsbruck, reported a certain example of letters to the senate, which the Upper League had secretly sent to Ferdinand, so that the opinion of the other Two Leagues, by which the president was justified, was called into question and again involved in new suspicions. But what that cause is, unless I am mistaken, I have already informed you. The allies were very displeased with this clandestine scheme, and the chief judge of the Grey League, who does not hesitate to seal such letters, will be summoned to court with a new promise of bail from both sides by the president. Meanwhile, while these matters were suspended, nothing memorable was done, except that efforts were made to obscure the most straightforward and clear matters of the Rhaetian cause with corruptions (as some who were solicited reported), which would serve to lull and at least mitigate the cause. I would be very wealthy if only a hundredth part of the money spent had returned to me. After spending Sunday on such usual exercises, they sat again on February 4th to discuss this arduous and most pestilent Rhaetian cause. Where first the Rhaetian began to clear his deed and case: 1. that he had attempted nothing in the country by the authority of these bulls, especially since mention is made in them of the monastery of Bender outside the territory of the Rhaetians, which he would have wanted to demolish, not build or propagate, having expelled those drones; 2. that what he had done regarding the preposition, he had not done by papal law, but after consulting the lords' praetors; 3. that the people of Bergell had committed a more serious offense by choosing two hundred, whose power could exacerbate, not settle, the matter. Mr. Hector von Salis, the syndic of Solis in Bergell, replied: 1. it is indeed true that they made a selection, but not to the detriment of any person or thing, but to repel the force of others and to ensure that no violence or injury is inflicted and that the freedom of the country remains unshaken; 2. that the Rhaetian excuses himself as if he had not relied on these bulls to attempt anything in Rhaetia, seems most alien to the truth, since he had cherished these bulls in his bosom for a year and a half and had not freely disclosed them to the republic, as his duty would have been, by which the danger to the country could have been more happily prevented and averted; add that by the argument of all three bulls, he had invaded and occupied the preposition on October 22nd, despite the people's and community's protest, whose sole right it is to elect and confirm, not without the knowledge of their lords and magistrates; 3. that not only is mention made of the Bender cloister, but of the entire bishopric and all benefices, which they hold in a heretical manner, as they think, in Rhaetia and the regions subject to the Rhaetians. Seeing where the matter was heading and what the people of Bergell and both Engadins, along with the envoys of the Upper Saxons, had in their mandates, the Rhaetian began to plead his fault, though not freely: that he did not think he had erred much here; if, however, it seemed so to them, he would most humbly submit to them.</p>
      <p>This ice then began to be cut all day: 1. whether the bulls should be made public to the people, which all those who wished well to the Rhaetian tried to prevent; but the more it was dissuaded, the more fervently the rest urged it, and some envoys, even papists, left six times, refusing to communicate further with the rest unless the bulls were made public and allowed to be disseminated among the people; some even had orders not to sit if they decided to obscure the matter; 2. whether they themselves wanted to impose a penalty on the Rhaetian or entrust it to the communities.</p>
      <p>Immortal God! What disturbances, what rumors, what shouts and quarrels of those entering and leaving resounded almost all day. They labored anxiously inside to present themselves as excellent mediators; we outside had to fear that through such compositions the goods of the preposition would be plundered. The crowd, which always surrounded us unwillingly, shouted that they wanted to know the content of the bulls.</p>
      <p>Finally, when it was evening, we greatly feared that, against everyone's will and with the bulls annulled, they would remove the memory and convert the gold of the preposition to another purpose. Therefore, having waited in vain all day, Hector, who was recalled, promised us entry with his entrance; but when the crowd, so large that they pressed against each other, quickly added itself to us, we were again unable to be admitted, while Mr. Campello and the chief observers from the bystanders (who, with the consent and mandate of all the Lower Engadin communities, provided themselves as our inseparable companions) and also other leading men and men of middle rank shouted under the threshold of the door: "Do you not want to hear the preachers too?" Later, when many knocked on the doors out of madness to prepare an entrance for us before the matter was destroyed, we decided to extricate ourselves from these crowds and, leaving the threshold of the door, to withdraw for a while. While we were doing this, the Rhaetian (who was not far away with his people, waiting for the decision) looked at us intently and quite obliquely. Finally, when we hoped every moment that we would be heard on this day and evening before they concluded the matter, the senate of the Three Leagues rose and left sooner than expected, defining nothing certain in the matter of the bulls and postponing this part to the following day. They replied to us that we should return early the next morning; for they would first of all inform us.</p>
      <p>Although we did not advise so well, since they were prepared to hear our reports with no less benevolence than they had heard the Rhaetian at length, and therefore we once had the mind to commit the whole matter to God, yet since they said nothing was determined, we did not want to let that opportunity slip away, especially since Mr. Consuls and some Ammanns asked us not to interpret that delay unfavorably.</p>
      <p>Therefore, on the next day, which was February 5th, when they had sat for the third time, we were admitted early in the morning (there were nine of us from the ministers, but more from the Engadin observers), and if we wanted to propose anything, we were given the opportunity.</p>
      <p>There we first vigorously washed away the stains cast upon us by our adversaries. (1.) First, the opposing party did not cease to spread most criminally that we were the authors of all the disturbances and turbulent sermons and that we had been the authors of the disclosure of this cause, which otherwise would have remained deeply buried and would not have stirred up the people of Bergell or others; indeed, some were so shameless that they did not blush to lie that we were born for disturbances and had conspired in them at Maienfeld. 2. There were not lacking some great men who, wanting to cover the disgrace of the Rhaetian and to color it with horrendous lies, openly asserted that we were lying both in speaking and writing about that matter, from which not a few communities began to hesitate for a long time as to which party to believe and, suspended in their duty, later conceived greater and more fervent fires. 3. The third lie, which among others far excels, had not moderately struck our minds; for in order to make the plundering of these goods easier, they spread everywhere that we ministers were so keen and fervent because we were using a good part of this preposition for our private uses or the needs of the synod, the loss of which we now so miserably feared, and thus they not only launched the stings of disturbances and lies at us but also of theft and sacrilege. We replied (to summarize everything briefly) to the first calumny: that by performing our duty with all modesty, we had given no material for disturbances or misfortunes of others; that they were the authors of disturbances who pour cold water and sow the causes or seeds of disturbances; that we had taken every care with the brothers not to be too immodest and not to be the authors of disturbances for the rustics, who were already sufficiently irritated and burdened; indeed, we could make everyone believe with open testimonies and witnesses of those who strive for peace that everything would now be full of disturbances and tumults if we had not restrained the brothers with our letters and exhortations. (2) Secondly: that we had never said or written anything in that most odious cause that we could not prove by the argument of the bulls themselves; that no honest or honorable man had or would in the future spread anything otherwise about us, and we greatly desired that whoever judged us so sinisterly and unjustly would come forward; that we were most ready to give an exact account of all the syllables we had written to anyone they wished and at any time. However, no one wanted to come forward, although there were those whom we had skillfully touched in the assembly, who rather defiled themselves than proved us to be liars. (3) We countered the third calumny in such a way that everyone admired both our constancy and innocence. For besides that it had never entered our minds to apply even a penny from these revenues to ourselves, it does not follow that we are sacrilegious, even if we were to use all these things, let alone a part, for the uses of the synod; for these goods serve this purpose, as the letters of the lords abundantly testify; this is also the primary reason why the greatest enemy of our country, that Roman pontiff, covets these goods, so that he may cut off the material and occasion for us to deliberate and act against him with schools and ministers; there are many from our flock who cannot attend the annual synods due to poverty." If something were decreed that could benefit the public good, would we therefore be thieves? Would we therefore be said to have sought our own advantage? Far from it. But what does this mean, that the diploma granted to the Guicciardis expressly states: that these goods are to be used for evangelical discipline? Is not the governance of schools also confirmed by the mention of discipline, which would entirely collapse, especially in Tschlin, if the use of these goods were to be weakened?" We are also greatly surprised that they have stripped the steward of his function and economy before demanding an account from him; for the lord in Matthew 25 did quite differently, who, after demanding an account, rewarded the faithful administrators with greater honors, but assigned the unfaithful to outer darkness.</p>
      <p>We are also surprised and do not take it well that in the past subcommittees they placed the ministers in the number of priests, forbidding anyone to be restless in this matter, with a severe penalty imposed, which our adversaries interpret as if it were denied to both priests and ministers to refer anything further to the senate of the Three Leagues; we are very surprised by this and not without excellent reasons, especially since they themselves are not unaware that our situation is far different from that of the priests; for we, neglecting episcopal jurisdiction, seek help from the Christian magistrate, who is our highest and only one, according to the word of God, and are not so audacious as to wish to extort ourselves from that obedience, as the antichrist has long been accustomed to do; we also do not know of any other power in this world to which we should be subject, and from which we should seek defense, which if it is denied to us to appeal, only God remains, to whom we can and will complain of our injuries; to that extent, however, we can render obedience, as long as divine law can remain inviolate, and it is not for anyone to expect silence from us in such causes, in which the Lord commands us to be more vocal with the trumpet blown.</p>
      <p>After all these things were proposed at length, the Rhaetian lord, wanting to defend the second head of the calumnies, entered against us: that it is not contained in the bull as we have made public; that only mention is made of demolishing the Bender monastery, not building it, etc. Mr. Campello, who is skilled in the Roman or Tuscan language, replied that there is open mention in the bulls of all the monasteries and benefices in all of Rhaetia, etc. To which the Rhaetian, very saddened, responded little or nothing.</p>
      <p>After we had clearly explained that we have a cause and dispute with no one but the pontiff, our greatest enemy, who has attempted to introduce change with his bulls, even if those who received the bulls did not intend this, and after we had requested a declaration on this clause, which was mentioned above, having handed over all the instruments and letters, we withdrew from the senate.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while we were waiting for a response, the people of Bergell, the Engadin, the Four Valleys, three of which are of the papal profession, asked the senate of this city to urge the senate of the Three Leagues, with the chief tribune granted to them, in their name and their own, not to suppress these bulls, but to present copies of them to the communities. Then they asked with singular diligence to rein in the Italian monks, so that their accession and increase, already long since abolished by public edict, would not grow infinitely. I was amazed that the papists were in favor of diminishing their monks, whom others wanted to propagate, etc. After these matters were completed, they were ordered to withdraw, except for us. They received our purgations, promised us free access to them and all benevolence, and that what they had decreed in the past subcommittees was not done to block our throats to the hindrance of truth, but to find a more suitable remedy for the disturbances to be feared and not to give the communities (which is provided for by the laws of the country) an opportunity to educate the people to tumult. We, having given thanks, proved that we had written nothing to the communities, but had always admonished the brothers according to our laws and decrees of their duty and had always exhorted them to use such modesty that there would be no material for the rude people to rage, and that we would continue to do so in the future with a zeal for peace.</p>
      <p>After all these things were explained and we were leaving, after a long deliberation, such points were decreed: 1. that anyone who wishes to present a copy of the bulls to their community can obtain and receive it; 2. that the entire account of the preposition, to whom it should be entrusted and to what it should be converted, should be decided again by popular vote. In the meantime, the Guicciardis must render an exact account of their administration to six men appointed for this purpose. 3. The Rhaetian lord was fined two hundred crowns, and it is up to the people's pleasure whether they want this to be the penalty. 4. The swarms of new monks, which have long since flown into their hives or rather most foul dens in Valtellina against the laws of the country, must be expelled and driven out, so that the old ones gradually decrease and the monasteries are finally cleansed of this filth. 5. Those who have bound themselves by the oath of foreign lords to serve them and manage their affairs shall not be admitted to public offices and honors anywhere; no one shall henceforth receive letters or any degree or title of honor or office from the pontiff. 6. And because up to now such a large number of syndics from the Grey League have sat in public diets that they could easily outvote the rest, unless they were very unanimous, this matter will be weighed by law, so that according to the articles once established, each community (which our chief tribune, along with the Four Valleys and the rest, as I mentioned above, urged in the name of this city) shall not send more than two envoys. Now, however, since the Upper League, according to ancient custom, should not have sent or elected more than sixteen, there were twenty-nine of them, which almost equaled the number of the other Two Leagues; from which abuse those who could have been superior by reason of the league were often inferior. This reduction, once obtained, could bring great benefit if anything is to be decided in matters of our church and religion.</p>
      <p>These, most esteemed father, are the primary points that our assembly has produced, and since it has always been of great importance for the ministers and watchmen of the church to be rightly instructed about the dangers impending on the church, which they can then instill in their sheep and predict early to avert the wolves, the brothers have decided to hold a synod in Davos on February 26th and to cut off all occasion for the adversaries to invade this preposition anew. When the opposing party learns of this, they will not cease to plot against my life and safety.</p>
      <p>Immortal God, what arts are they not devising against me, because I did not want to dissimulate anything in such a cause! Yesterday, summoned to a certain singular friend of mine, he revealed to me a conspiracy made against me at this fair. For openly, while they were feasting at the Rhaetian's expense, someone said: "I will blow out the light for this one and that one and shoot or kill him, wherever I can, or not live."</p>
      <p>Having been warned many times already, whom I can trust and where I can safely set foot, I do not see. Some friends dissuade me from even going to the synod.</p>
      <p>If I am absent, the brothers will miss many things in me, because I do not perform my duty due to the horrors of human arts; if I go, I will have to face danger to my life everywhere. I would like to be relieved here by your paternal and prudent advice on what I should do most. I have long humbly asked you to take pity on me and finally deign to rescue me from the present danger; but since this one refuge, which I hoped would be open to me in you after God, is denied, I fear, I certainly fear, that you will be too late led by repentance to follow my case with miserable tears. Now the tenth year is being completed since I have faithfully served the Rhaetian churches, which, as few or none even of your stipendiaries have done in such storms, so I see with sorrow that very little hope of escaping from here and there ever shines for me. I know and gratefully remember without interruption that what we do and suffer has no weight if compared with your labors and those of our other fathers; but when I consider how poorly equipped and inflamed I am with the small sparks of those things that serve to defend this station, I do not see with what fruit I can perform what has been denied to my shoulders. I am a stranger and poor here.</p>
      <p>Those who are citizens and wealthy are tormented by envy because I occupy more famous places with my rights and merits, to which, however, I have never aspired through my own fault, which remains my only consolation in adverse circumstances.</p>
      <p>I humbly commend myself to you again, whom even humanly the abundance of offspring and the poverty of family affairs wonderfully affect. - Mr. Anthony von Salis, the vicar of the Valtellina, gave me 20 crowns from French testons, which I send to you through Mr. Jacob Gesner, as to him to whom he affirmed they belong."</p>
      <p>[...] so that what I have recorded in order due to my weak memory may also serve my uses if I ever need to refer to them.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 9, 1572.</p>
