      <p>S. D. I rejoice in the Lord that my third Decade pleases you so much, venerable brother; for you are a veteran, almost a retired soldier, indeed a leader of the Christian army, and the judgments of the elderly and those long experienced in this matter are most excellent.</p>
      <p>You encourage me to proceed with a more eager spirit to the remaining tasks. Meanwhile, I await your judgment on the sermon given on repentance; it contains some controversial points; but I hope it was not displeasing.</p>
      <p>The same is written by other friends, as also by you, that the Emperor is planning a great assembly to be held in Augsburg, either in June or July. The topics to be discussed are said to be: 1. About a certain and firm peace for all of Germany. Under this title, he will impose new taxes. 2. About uniform religion. Under this pretext, he will either prepare a council or, without a council, attempt to suppress the truth. 3. About restraining rebels and bringing them into order. By this art, he will sow wars and try to subject all of Germany and France to his desires. May the Lord hinder him and repay upon his head the reward he has long deserved. I truly fear that a reformer, that is, an executioner, may also be given to us; for we know what we are doing, we are shamefully and impudently rebelling against God; unless indeed God's mercy, which does good even to those who deserve ill, comes to our aid, I doubt what will happen. But let us pray to the Lord, that having mercy on us, he may make the best out of the worst.</p>
      <p>Up there in the Grisons, Gonzaga, the governor in Milan, has his messengers traveling without escort here and there for the communities (those that are restless and unruly), urging them to abandon the French alliance and give it up, etc., promising much. On the other hand, the authority is not pleased with the audacious actions, seeking counsel; be aware, it is said that messengers from other places of the Confederation have ridden there and are riding; for soon an unclean game will arise. The unrest in the Grisons has previously been settled for the right until mid-May. That French alliance is very fertile in the worst things; if only it does not also involve us in a very serious war. If we Confederates had remained and had the French as good neighbors. But such wishes achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>May God make all things good.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for a long time; live and farewell. April 30, Zurich, in the year 1550. I think Gastius is dead; otherwise, I would greet him.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Oswald Myconius, Bishop of the Church of Basel, his venerable and most beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
