      <p>S. P. I received your letters, dearest Truber, along with the pages of your translation.</p>
      <p>I greatly approve of your work and encourage you in every way to continue in this most holy and useful endeavor. For what could be more fruitful than to present the saving words and deeds of our Savior, and finally the most sincere doctrine of his most holy apostles, to the barbarian nations for reading? I doubt if you could do anything greater today.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I pray to God to strengthen you in this most holy undertaking and grant you the strength to faithfully complete what you have begun.</p>
      <p>We approve and praise the modesty and peace-loving spirit of D. d. Jakob Andreae, but we do not approve of his booklet in the same way. He does not attempt to reconcile the dissenting parties (as I hear many believe), but rather to educate the simpler ones on what they think about the supper and sacramental doctrine in these conversations. With a few exceptions, he has condensed the entire doctrine of Luther into a summary and instills it in the readers. I cannot approve of what he disputes about heaven, nor that he contends that even the impious truly partake of the body of Christ and his precious blood. However, I do not intend to judge that booklet now.</p>
      <p>I wish that good man were better known to me than he is. It has never been our practice to persecute or cover with hateful insults those who, in this matter, think differently from us than the Lutherans, as is the not very commendable custom of some of them. Perhaps some tolerable agreement could be found in due time, if only bitterness were removed from the hearts... We often see that others among the blessed fathers and others have disagreed, but they did not therefore dissolve all friendship. But today, such madness has seized the minds of some, and they are so bound as if sworn to the words of their teachers, that if they understand someone to disagree even slightly with them or their teacher, they almost cry out heresy and furiously seize arms. It has never been our fault that concord was not achieved; but many knew that we could not and would not (unless taught by the scriptures) agree with their opinions in all things.</p>
      <p>We have seemed unworthy to be heard, whose books are read and with whom even some society is formed. Due to the intemperance and clamor of these people, it has so far been the case that this unfortunate fire could not only not be extinguished, but has rather increased day by day. We wrote our agreement some years ago and published it, not to provoke anyone to fight, but rather to appease many who thought we were establishing and defending empty symbols. And while we were full of good hope that those who have been more hostile to us would begin to be more peaceful towards us, that Westphalus suddenly attacked, driven by no necessity but mere desire, and published a medley of dissent. What kind of book it is, I would rather let it speak for itself than repeat much myself.</p>
      <p>Here indeed, to appease the minds of others, Calvin wrote a defense of our agreement. To which Westphalus soon opposed a hostile writing and almost armed the entire Baltic Sea region and attracted them to the fight.</p>
      <p>Thus, like stones, confessions, indeed condemnations, execrations, and anathemas fly. For our churches are condemned, our faith and doctrine are condemned, and whatever is foul and intolerable is poured out upon us more fully. For we are called sacramentarians, sectarians, seditious, schismatics, heretics, sacrilegious, impious, and what not? That these things are so, the books declare, the series of events proves, and the truth of history confirms. Why then do they now indeed turn the restoration of the sacramentarian conflict upon us as if we were the authors? But I have written more about these things than I thought I would at the beginning. What did I think about the Grybald affair, my dear Primoz? I adhere to the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed, and I abhor contrary doctrine from the heart. I once dealt with this man on this very matter, and he left a confession in my hands that is not entirely to be rejected.</p>
      <p>But I see that he has used slippery faith. Recently, having been thrown into chains in Bern, he promised to recant; he barely escaped with his life. If you have any news of Turkish and Austrian affairs, you would do me a favor by sharing it. For the shared information, I give immortal thanks and return the letters entrusted to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 10, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
