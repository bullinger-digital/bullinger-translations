      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, we have received your letter along with the enclosed booklet of the Confession, read both, and sufficiently understood their content. In response, we briefly express our brotherly opinion as follows: Since we, who preach the holy gospel here in Chur, as well as in the communities of the Three Leagues here on this side and beyond the mountains together, have previously established a confession, which we have all signed individually, and since it agrees entirely with your recently established one and completely coincides with it, and since we have always and entirely agreed with the Church of Zurich on the main points and have found no disagreement in them either now or previously, we have willingly committed ourselves, in our name and in the name of the other brothers, to stand by you. The brothers have also been informed of all actions as much as was possible in such a short time, and so far, we have sensed nothing but complete unity. Therefore, you may rely on this Confession from the ministers of the Church of Chur along with all other church ministers who preach the holy gospel in the communities of the Three Leagues here on this side and beyond the mountains. May God grant that this Christian endeavor of yours and ours may serve to the honor of God and the welfare of the common church! This we do not wish to withhold from you, honorable Lord and Father, in such a short time.</p>
      <p>Praying hereby to God that He may keep you in long-lasting health for His church. Given in Chur on the 23rd of February, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, servant of the Church in Chur at St. Martin, Philippus Gallicius, servant of the Church in Chur at St. Regula.</p>
      <p>We have also spoken as needed with Mayor Tscharner, who is currently in office, about these matters, who praised your and our endeavor and urged us to proceed with it without delay. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
