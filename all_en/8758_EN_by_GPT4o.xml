      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I have received your letter, and I am pleased with your advice regarding Margrethli. I am happy to have her with me; she is a wonderfully blessed child. However, I am sorry about your poor health; may God grant you health, as He alone can and therefore should be prayed to. Keep yourself, as is proper, healthy. What news I have received, I send to you here. Additionally, I have included a letter to a person, to whom I show how the campaign against the Turks pleased me; I have since sent this copy to a captain; I do not yet know how he received it, etc. I send you both copies so that, when Mr. Hans Peyer (whom you should greet sincerely for me and convey my willing service) and you have read it, you send it to the salt master Beato (whom you should also greet sincerely for me) with the instruction that, once he has read it, he should give it without delay to Mr. Hans Conrad, to whom I wrote today that I am sending it to him through you and him without delay; he should seek it from Mr. Beato. And the campaign against the Turks does not please me at all; I pity the poor people who are going; for they will be badly misled, and in Italy, they will face great scarcity and hunger. For the Italians and Spaniards will take precedence over them in all camps and will enrich themselves, so that they will find little. And they have already shared the Turkish loot with those from Venice, as those from Colmar did with the Rhine. Yet there are people who want to be unfortunate by force. There will be a day in Baden; those from Lucerne complain that certain people are secretly leading people away from the authorities, which should not be allowed, etc. We will hear what it is. You should ensure that everyone waits for my lord and that we do not shoot so miserably. Although it is expensive here, I fear that when the good fellows go to Italy, they will find a much rougher St. John, which they should be warned about. What do they want to take and go with the untrustworthy, disgraceful people? God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and children. Most hastily, January 25, 1572.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
