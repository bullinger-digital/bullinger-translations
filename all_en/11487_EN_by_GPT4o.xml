    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a [book] gift. Laments that the evangelical way of life is only insufficiently taking root due to the waning zeal of those responsible, and calls for determined discipleship in view of the heavenly promises. Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I give thanks. You should stop giving now, unless you want to make me ungrateful, while I also respond to your kindnesses, among which the most splendid is that you deem me worthy to share the spirit of Christ with you. Let us therefore continue in this way.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if not only do we look out for each other's good, but for everyone, it is very important for us, who certainly hold some position in the church, to see how the discipline of Christ will proceed publicly. It is very bitter in the new light of God's benefits for us to grow mostly in vain, if no time has been more favorable.</p>
      <p>We often look around to see what the cause might be. For zeal and fervor seem to be languishing. If this is because the enemies are now at rest, we do not look around rightly or carefully enough. They pretend to have gone away, but they are lying in wait, planning something greater.</p>
      <p>I call the Lord to witness that somehow in this tranquility of our church, everything seems suspicious to me. The gospel is praised, meanwhile charity and zeal for the truth gradually diminish. Ah, Lord Christ, show us the very harbor, the very harbor of life, lest we, weary in such a great matter, lose heart!</p>
      <p>We seek heaven, there is no dwelling here, no place. In this is the wisdom of life, to know that life is sought from here, not to be here. Holy God, what is this voice, and how deaf we are to it! We do not indeed resist, rather we even praise it, but how little force and sense it has in our minds. The promise of the lightest man about the lightest matter more easily inflames the mind than the heavenly promises of Christ. I speak of myself, Brother Bullinger. I feel my intolerable coldness. I wish to settle everything here first, to be everything, to do everything, before following Christ. But come, let us renew the pursuit of heavenly and true things with all our heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his friend.</p>
