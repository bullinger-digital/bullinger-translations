      <p>Greetings and Peace. I do not think it necessary to write extensively about the state of this kingdom and the condition of the English churches, both local and foreign, since you can learn everything more accurately from these honest young men and from the letters of others than I can safely and easily write now. The tumult that suddenly arose here from the second captivity of the Duke of Somerset, his wife, and other nobles has greatly disturbed our minds; and this is more so because the cause of his captivity is being spread in various and uncertain ways among the people. But the Lord will undoubtedly turn everything to the salvation of His church. Master Hooper is very vigilant in his ministry. I am sorry that he receives so little help from others. Therefore, he should be supported and encouraged by your letters, and at the same time advised to join prudence and Christian leniency to the severity of discipline.</p>
      <p>The foreign churches are in a good place, thanks be to the Lord! They make great progress daily in doctrine, consolation, exhortation, and public discussions of the scriptures, both in Latin and German; also in the diligent practice of church discipline. We certainly sometimes feel attacked by Satan through the enemies of Christ, hypocrites, bishops, and heretics: but the Lord protects us, whose role it is to build the church, and to maintain and preserve what is built. Master a Lasco, our superintendent, a man (to put it in a word) truly divine, is very useful not only to the foreign churches but also to the English ones, by teaching, exhorting, advising, and writing: I would wish that this man be especially commended by all learned men who dedicate anything to the king or his council, so that something might be added to his authority (which is great here) for the benefit of his churches in this kingdom. He will soon publish a most learned writing on the sacramental matter, of which he gave me some part to read. On the seventeenth day of the previous month, a certain pious brother, pure in religion, handed over his holy soul to Christ the Lord, having been burned at Antwerp for the sacramental matter. London, November 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Be so kind as to greet Master Bibliander, Master Pellican, and Master Gesner, my esteemed teachers, in my name.</p>
      <p>Master Utenhovius would have written to you, had not ill health prevented him; therefore, he asks to be excused by you for this reason, promising to make up for his silence with very extensive letters at another time.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as he is, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
