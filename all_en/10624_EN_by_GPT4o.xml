      <p>My lord, your request to my dear lord Mayor of WÃ¤denswil, and then to me, whether we have any news to send to you by messenger, I have personally been with my lord and asked. He, as well as I, have nothing special. Although the pastor at this time, when I was with him, wrote about the matter of the troop assembly, which all aligns and almost completely agrees with the report I wrote to you the other day from him and me, by a citizen of St. Gallen, who received the message on the way, etc., all sorts of things that I wrote to you about. You should (as we know) earnestly discuss with Master Haab.</p>
      <p>Yours, greeting my wife and your whole household.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, on Tuesday, the first day of the month of June in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your obliged, willing Hans Vogler, etc.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
