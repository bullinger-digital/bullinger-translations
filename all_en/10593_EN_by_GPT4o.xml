      <p>Greetings. If it pleases you, dearest brother, to be overwhelmed by my ineptitude on any occasion, you are soon offended, not to say fatigued, so that you can no longer be asked for anything. Countless messengers come and now also your most certain envoys, whom I wanted to burden with this, because I have a new matter to consult you about.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of how much wealth our senate annually receives and spends from the monasteries, not into the public treasury, but rather into the hands of some idle stewards, so that it is a perpetual debtor to these stewards. From this, I can hope for nothing else than that both the ecclesiastical, as they call it, and the treasury's goods are disgracefully squandered and will eventually be dissipated, so that neither the poor throughout this vast dominion, nor the ministers, nor the schools, nor even the senators with their overly generous stipends can be provided for. For they begin to have no regard for the former, they care for the latter first and solely, and they do not distinguish these ecclesiastical goods from temporal ones in terms of use and purpose, but occupy them as their own entirely. Thus, not caring for the last will of the deceased and the intentions of the legators, they do not shrink from either abusing or miserably losing these. They have our college under their control. When they had decided to completely dissolve it, I opposed them with your example and your arguments, which you had used two years ago, and with my own, and finally, because none of the canons except me knows this college's economy, I barely obtained from the 4 tribunes or banderets that they would restore it, at least in part, to its former order. These agreed. It remains for the senate to consent as well. If they refuse, we will appeal to the dioceses, intending to act on behalf of not only the college but all the monasteries. Therefore, so that we may effectively touch their consciences with arguments and writings, to the extent that they have far greater regard for ecclesiastical goods than for other revenues and taxes - I believe we must have more work with church property than with pensions -: Therefore, help and advise, dear brother, how I should handle the matter. At Easter, we have noticed again, perhaps Burkhart the clothier or others will come, through whom you can send it to me.</p>
      <p>Our consul, because he has served for two years, alas, will be changed. A new tribune and at least two will be added to the senatorial order. Oh, how I wish to speak with you to my heart's content about our republic!</p>
      <p>This is what I had to write now. I know less about the Geneva matter than you do. However, your envoys will report everything. Megander has spoken with them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell.</p>
      <p>March 18, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, both well-known and most devoted</p>
      <p>B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
