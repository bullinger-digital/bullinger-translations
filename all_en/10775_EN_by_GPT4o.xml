    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the invitation to the Basel meeting on January 25; since the council has rejected the sending of a delegate, they are taking a written position. No new formulas are necessary for a concord with Luther, as the Lutherans and [the Upper German cities] have mutually recognized their confessions and apologies presented in Augsburg [1530]; the people of Konstanz recommend that the Swiss join an agreement on this basis. Moreover, they have never ceased to recognize Luther and his followers as brothers. A concord with the Pope, on the other hand, can only be considered if he abandons his hostility towards the Gospel. The question of a general council does not need to be discussed now; true concord is based on the effectiveness of the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel, not on uniform ceremonies, therefore such a gathering can no more guarantee the unity of the Church than the councils of earlier centuries. However, the people of Konstanz place great value on mutual admonition. Recommend Bucer, if he is present. Urge not to tolerate any violation of faith and love.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most esteemed men and dearest brothers in the Lord, we received and read your letters on the twenty-fifth day of this month, in which we are invited by you to the thirtieth of the same month to this venerable assembly of the Swiss brothers and fellow ministers in Basel. Although the time was shorter than the matter could bear for a longer consultation, since it was nevertheless not obscurely requested in the same letters that our magistrate should also mix his authority (by sending a delegate) into the matter, we indicated them without delay (as was proper) to the senate. The senate, after mature deliberation, judged, decreed, and decided that none of us should be sent to the present assembly of brothers with you. Otherwise, dearest brothers, we are so far from neglecting to approach and hear the more learned, that we would have had nothing more important than your assembly of all, if it had pleased the divine will. Now, however, with the assembly once denied, come, we will compensate with the pen whatever inconvenience there is.</p>
      <p>Your letters first propose to discuss concord with Luther. Here, brothers, there is no reason for us to be so anxious, since the way to concord is most evident. You know the confessions and apologies presented on both sides at the Diet of Augsburg, in which, as far as doctrine is concerned, both our people and the Lutherans did not hesitate to mutually subscribe. In these, nothing has been changed, nothing innovated, nothing recanted among us so far, but our churches remain consistent in all things. We wish to testify this to you, brothers, through these presents, if anyone perhaps again requires from us a certain statement of our doctrine. Since nothing is clearer than these, we ask, what necessity is there to involve ourselves again in darkness? What necessity is there to devise so many forms of conciliation and then new ones, by which, however, you achieve no more than with this one? And in the meantime, with new and unusual ways of speaking, you only cast a snare for so many churches? But if Luther and his followers are those whom we trust they are, namely, they are not yet repentant of the mutual subscription, just as we have not withdrawn the votes of the given confession and apology, we wish and hope that you and the remaining Swiss churches will agree in the same, not because your confessions are disapproved by us or because we wish to burden you with our prejudice, but because we think that there is no more convenient or clearer way to concord with Luther in these narrow circumstances of pacification. For what would not be enough for Luther from you now, which he received from us five years ago? Again, since Luther swears that he has hitherto suspected you of denying the true presence of Christ in the supper, how could you make your different opinion more evident to Luther? But we leave to you, with more exact judgment, to examine what we write. This indeed seemed to us the first and most important reason for establishing the holy concord of the churches.</p>
      <p>The second reason is that which also pleased Luther himself, that if indeed we do not agree in all things and in all respects, and it happens that neither party can in all things approach the other with a sound conscience, yet minds should be so fortified against quarrels and dissensions that we learn to bear one another through charity. For once the wound of dissenting minds is healed, there is no reason why concord cannot stand because of some dissimilar forms of speaking or different understanding of matters. Here, brothers, no one has anything to desire in us. For we are so disposed, as many as preach Christ here, that we wish peace and charity with Luther and his followers, indeed with all who believe in Christ, from the heart. Indeed, we acknowledge, embrace, and venerate Luther himself as a father and brother beloved in Christ, to whom above all we owe the firstfruits of the reborn gospel as to the chosen instrument of the Lord. We have long since conceived the same hope about Luther, that he also in turn acknowledges us, and if not as eminent, certainly as faithful and sincere ministers of the church of Christ and his brothers beloved in the Lord, and we also wish to testify this to you through these presents, if anyone perhaps still doubts our mind towards Luther and his followers. Therefore, since both we and our churches have so constantly persisted in the opinion of our confession and apology that not even by a finger's breadth has it been departed from, and since we have so often testified that we are of this mind towards Luther and his followers, concord with them remains firm through us, nor is there anything to be repaired by us, which was never torn apart by us.</p>
      <p>Now, as for what you write about discussing concord with the Pope, we respond briefly. We will agree with the Pope when he agrees with Christ and his gospel. But if anyone has hope of concord between Christ and the Pope, there is no reason for anyone to fear that concord with him will not be achieved through us. But what if even today the papists strive with all effort not only to destroy us but to write an epitaph for the gospel itself? Shall we in turn set a day of concord for them? Let the Pope first cease to be the antichrist, let the bishops first unlearn the sycophancy and cruelty against the gospel that has become ingrained in them through long use. When this is done, we will ensure that we do not seem rashly to have rejected concord with them.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we hear that some are also meditating a third concord among all ministers of all churches, for the propagation of which a general assembly of all bishops is decreed. What kind of plan this is, brothers, is not the place to examine now. We most simply feel and confess that no better way of unity can be initiated by anyone than that which has so far happily stood for several years in many places, however far distant, through the pure preaching of the gospel by the power of the Holy Spirit. This unites even the Indians and Africans with us. This extends to the remotest parts of the world with the gospel itself. Nor is a similar observation of ceremonies required for it among all, but a single faith in Christ. He falls from the fellowship of that unity, not who has departed from the ceremonies of this or that church, but who has defected from true faith in Christ. Therefore, we think that this assembly will not greatly benefit either the expansion or extension of the kingdom of Christ or the establishment of ecclesiastical unity. We also consider, due to the various minds of those convening, various opinions, and due to odious prejudices, various and dangerous outcomes of those assemblies, so that we may remain silent about the fact that in previous centuries hardly any synod was ever held from which Christianity did not begin to fare worse than before.</p>
      <p>However, for the protection of the true discipline and tranquility of the churches, an effective (in our judgment) way would be if the ministers of the churches have the free use of mutually admonishing, correcting, and reproving each other. This freedom we not only grant to you towards us through these presents, but we also beseech and adjure both the people of Strasbourg and all the remaining ministers of the churches through our common Christ, that you freely and fraternally admonish us, as is our duty, concerning what is desired for the right institution of our church or for our doctrine and life. You will indeed have done for us in this matter the most pleasing thing of all.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we ask you, brothers, again and again in the Lord, that if it happens that Bucer is present, you have him uniquely commended to you, as his zeal, labor, work, and all effort fervently strive to help the churches and promote the evangelical cause, in which we pray from the heart that he may be equally skillful.</p>
      <p>Finally, we beseech you by the Lord, to whom you owe yourselves entirely, that you have no less regard for the peace and charity of your churches, diligently attending to this, that nothing is committed beyond the common rules of faith and charity that are ours. May Christ himself, whose cause you are managing, with his spirit, govern both your hearts and mouths to his glory and the salvation of the churches.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>January 27, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your brothers in the Lord, as many as</p>
      <p>preach Christ in Konstanz.</p>
      <p>To the learned and truly pious people of Basel and the remaining ministers of the churches gathered in Basel in the Lord, their most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
