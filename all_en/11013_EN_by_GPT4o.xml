    <p xml:id="regest1">Has so far only learned from the envoys who returned the previous day [from Schmalkalden] that [the Bundestag] went well, especially concerning the Pope and the response to the Emperor [Charles V]. Due to preaching commitments, can only respond in detail later and requests to be informed of what the people of Strasbourg report.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Yesterday our envoys returned, dearest Bullinger. Since I have not been able to inquire anything specific from them due to my commitments, I am not writing anything to you now, except for this one thing: they all testify that everything is going exceedingly well, especially concerning the Pope, to whom a response was given as befits the Antichrist. A response was also given to the Emperor, both prudently and wisely. In summary: the Lord was with us; may we recognize His benevolence with much gratitude!</p>
      <p>You will hear from me soon regarding your letters and the rest in order. Now, since two sermons are incumbent upon me, I can add nothing more. I will indeed make up for this brevity. Our people testify that everything is going well in every respect. Observe what the people of Strasbourg will report to you, and let us know as soon as possible. We will not fail in our zeal for fostering peace and unity, but neither should you stir up any disturbances.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest heart.</p>
      <p>March 18, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother to be respected in faith.</p>
