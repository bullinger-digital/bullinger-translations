      <p>S. Your father, the treasurer of our Paul Paulen, is coming to you, father; I think it is entirely advisable for you to speak with him; he himself wishes to see you. He is the Landammann in the courts, sits on Davos, a serious man, of few words, clearly reminiscent of those ancient Swiss both in gravity and simplicity of manners, he favors religion, and therefore you can speak to him boldly and securely. It is in the courts as well as in God's house.</p>
      <p>But you must absolutely instruct the consul to observe the envoys of the Upper League. A word to the wise is sufficient.</p>
      <p>Then, as the envoys were supposed to meet here on this very day, the envoys, that is, that Doctor Planta, who came to Baden, and his companion, did not want to explain themselves, so that the others had to appease them to a good extent. If they did this in Chur, what will they do in Baden? Therefore, urge them, and since it is in the lands, they rely on the land and on bringing it back. This to you and the consul. - Otherwise, war councils have been arranged, and if someone lays something on the city of Zurich, you may write the same to them with more confidence. - Those who come from Constance say that the day in Baden began on the 22nd of October. Likewise, those who come from Glarus say that the 5 Orte are meeting anew in Beckenried.</p>
      <p>Others say secretly (meaning from the abbot of Ragaz-Pf√§fers), they suspect they will take the law; but if something is decided against them, they will nevertheless resort to the sword; for they believe they have good letters. Now all depends on who gave the letters.</p>
      <p>Between the Landammann Schorer of Schwyz and Gilg Tschudi there is a double kinship; it is suspected that more letters have been given than anyone knows. But if they nevertheless resort to the sword, should something be decided against them, I do not know how that would be called justice. I write poorly and hastily, but also so that you alone may read, accustomed to my characters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the 25th of October in Chur, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>In the evening, letters came, written very sharply by the Three Leagues, which deal with the expulsion of Mr. Beccaria and another, his associate.</p>
      <p>You will learn what has been done from the consul.</p>
