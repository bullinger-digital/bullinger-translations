      <p>Greetings. Do not wonder any longer, incomparable friend, why I have neglected the duty of writing to you for so long. Know that I had already decided some time ago to set out on a journey to you, intending to be a living letter myself. However, when Spanish soldiers entered Kaufbeuren almost two months ago, intending to trouble the already miserable common people, I was not able to leave my home.</p>
      <p>And when they finally left after staying there for six weeks, and no further danger seemed to threaten from them, I had come to Kempten to visit the Swiss. Behold, through a courier, I was informed that the Spaniards had unexpectedly returned to Kaufbeuren and, as it is said, stormed into my house at the first assault, forcing my wife, children, and son-in-law to retreat under the roof from their lodgings, seeking me and spreading fierce threats because of some unknown slanders, which, as I hear, the ungrateful and blind populace has imposed on me, so that I am not even safe in my own home, nor is it advisable to travel far from my family until I hear where the end of this tragedy will lead. Therefore, I have decided to hide here and there and consider whether to handle the matter by fleeing or by some other plan. However, with God as my guide, I will certainly visit my Bullinger this summer; he himself prays to the Lord for me, that I may not be tested beyond my strength. Furthermore, I am uplifted by God's kindness and steadfast in my resolve of piety, no matter how much the world rages. Consider with yourself how Laetus with his own should arrange the remaining course of this life.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg still stand firm against violence and give evidence of long-lasting perseverance; however, I fear for them because of their not entirely pure religion, yet I hope the Lord will have mercy on them if they walk with good consciences.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Spain is hurrying away from here and would have already left if pirates, as it is rumored, had not made the journey unsafe. It is not permitted to write a single word about the Emperor. I wish the Lords Blaurer brothers, Zwick, your colleagues, the Lords Consuls, also Haller, Dietrich in Rohr, and all good people, especially that exiled treasurer, to be well; see that you do not overlook my Gwalther. Kempten, May 14, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his incomparable lord and friend.</p>
