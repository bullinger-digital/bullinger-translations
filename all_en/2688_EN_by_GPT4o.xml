      <p>Greetings, most esteemed Bullinger, Mr. Simon Sulzer entrusted me with this letter to be delivered to your kindness; since I had to hurry home at this time, I entrusted it to Mr. Johann Hiller, who promised to send it to you at the first opportunity and with a messenger. Indeed, the brothers in Basel have labored and moved every stone, so that the council would remember religion in that ill-fated oath, which our Confederates are trying to extort from us; but, they were ashamed to write what they have achieved. May the Lord direct the most deplorable affairs of our Switzerland to a good end for His own. Mr. Zeller and my brother Hospinian wish you well along with all the brothers. Dr. Oswald, the physician, sends greetings to the venerable father Mr. Pellican. Farewell and keep me in your commendation. From BÃ¼lach, August 7, 1555, hastily in transit.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Wirth (Hospinian).</p>
