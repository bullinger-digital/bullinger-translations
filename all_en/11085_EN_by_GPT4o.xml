    <p xml:id="regest1">Your friendship cannot be affected by his long silence. He traveled to Isny at Bucer's invitation, but did not find him there, so he visited Simprecht [Schenck] in Kempten, traveled with him and Benedikt [Euander] to Memmingen, and finally returned home via Lindau. He found the churches in good condition, but they could suffer from a lack of love among the pastors and insufficient alignment of the authorities with God's word. The dispute over the [Wittenberg] Concord has calmed down; the Swiss churches are held in esteem, and a visit from Bullinger would be beneficial for both sides. He asks for a report on the discussions of Capito and Bucer in Bern. He regrets that his brother [Konrad] did not come to Zurich. He wants to accompany Gervasius [Schuler] there. [Jakob] Fehr agrees to stay in Bischofszell. Greetings. The supplement to [Jakob] Ziegler's ["Terrae sanctae... descriptio"] will be delivered by Pellikan. Thomas Blarer is ill; further greetings. He sends a genealogy of the Antichrist as an attachment.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Good, good God, how many years it seems that I have not written to you, Bullinger, most sincere of friends! If you were not steadfast in your feelings towards me, how easily you might fall into suspicions of a weakened friendship due to such a long silence. But as far as I am concerned, you should know that no loss of love between us will occur. As for you, I know that your friendship towards me cannot be tainted in any way.</p>
      <p>The reason for my silence was that I spent a month and a half visiting certain churches. This was indeed arranged by the Lord. Bucer had called me to Isny. On the day I arrived there, the good man had already left. However, at the request of all the good people, I could not leave before the eighth day. Then, since I could reach Kempten in six hours, I decided to visit Simprecht with other brothers. Invited by many and at the serious request of the council, I also spent eight days there. Since it was only half a day's journey to Memmingen, I went there accompanied by Simprecht and our schoolmaster, Benedikt, a man more than dear to me. I stayed in Memmingen for a little less than three weeks. Finally, I stayed in Lindau for six days and, with this journey completed, returned home under the Lord's guidance. All these churches are in good condition, and nothing can harm them unless the brothers do not persist in love or the authorities do not perform their duty according to the word of God. The contention over the concord of the articles has been mostly settled, and I did not raise the suspicious issues among the brothers, except as seemed relevant to the matter. I was entirely focused on building up the spirits of the people with the little grace given to me. Everywhere I was asked about the state of the Swiss churches, which I described diligently and truthfully. And indeed, no one does not love you. If only you were sometimes compelled to visit the churches on our side! I would swear by the living God that it would be beneficial in many ways for both sides, especially for fostering the sincerity of hearts.</p>
      <p>When I returned home, I found your letters, in which you mentioned a few things about the Bernese towards the people of Strasbourg. Now, I especially ask you, if you have anything, not to hesitate to write back. For I hear that Capito and Bucer had some dealings with them on the 10th of this month. I heard nothing about Bucer when I left, as he was at the baths.</p>
      <p>I am very angry with my brother for not being able to satisfy you with his presence.</p>
      <p>Gervasius from Memmingen has decided to visit you, and I will accompany him if church matters allow. Jakob Fehr from Bischofszell also agreed with my advice not to change his place.</p>
      <p>Capito, writing to me recently, instructed me to greet you diligently, and also Leon himself with Theodor, whom you should also greet in my name. What was added to Ziegler will be given to you by Pellikan in my name.</p>
      <p>Thomas Blarer, our consul, has quartan fever, which is common with many. He sends you his most earnest greetings along with his brother Konrad. I wish your wife, mother, children, and all good people to be well in Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Constance, December 15, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here the genealogy of the Antichrist, both true and learned, which you should share with Theodor, Pellikan, and Leon.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
