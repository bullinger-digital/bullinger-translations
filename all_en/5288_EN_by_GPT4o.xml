      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, at present we have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Vegerius has gone to Bregaglia and will soon proceed to Chiavenna. I believe his nephew was with you.</p>
      <p>We sent Vergerius away from here with good grace, but we observed the man, and by the grace of God, he has not yet caused us any trouble. Those who write from Italy affirm that the Pope is once again near death.</p>
      <p>I wrote this before your letters were returned to me; for Philip and I were going to Jenins with Mr. Tscharner.</p>
      <p>When I mentioned in my previous letter about a German schoolmaster, the matter has now come before our honorable council. They do not want Lindiner as a schoolmaster again for many important reasons. Therefore, my lord mayor Tscharner advised me to let the matter be pursued, but with the condition: since Master Hans Lindiner is so grossly disliked, my lords are not willing to write for another as long as Lindiner is involved; but if a good man would come here on their trust and make a trial, my lords would graciously acknowledge his service and, if he were diligent, would be entirely inclined to promote him in every way. Therefore, my very sincere request to you, my lord and godfather, is that you would consider this matter. If it were possible to persuade and bring forth the good man you wrote about before, I think he would not have a bad service; if not, then for God's sake, we ask you to help us find another good and diligent man who can write well and is not a drunkard. If you then find a suitable person, he might send an experiment, and if my lords liked it and he had a recommendation from you regarding his conduct, he might then, upon further writing from us, come to us at a set time and day, also with conditions as he would hear from our writing. What you hope to accomplish, let me know in your next letter, as soon as you can, considering your business; we can rely on that. This is all for now, reverend father, eight days ago.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, your letters have been returned to me, which inform us about the afflicted state of France. That news struck me greatly, and I see no remedy for the evil other than in the mercy of God alone. There are many things that trouble me.</p>
      <p>I have communicated with the councilors, and I will also communicate with Mr. Carlin, whose authority in royal affairs among us is by far the greatest.</p>
      <p>I was recently with him, discussing many things; he solemnly affirmed that the French should neither hope for the renewal of the alliance nor for soldiers unless it was first clear to us about their will towards religion.</p>
      <p>Now we must be all the more vigilant.</p>
      <p>I would very much like Prince Cond√© to write to our people as well, not only for the evangelicals but also for the papists, so they would not have an occasion to slander him, as if he were plotting against the king, but that it would be clear to everyone that he is repelling the force of the Guises, who are greatly envied among us. But where is Beza in the meantime, or in what danger is he involved? I earnestly ask you, my father, to write to us about every detail of the state of France; you will do a worthwhile work and will find me placing it cautiously and fruitfully among the faithful; for not even the smallest moments in such serious deliberations should be neglected. If only I could have been the bearer of such an auspicious gospel, as you write; certainly, with this Pope dead, the power of such men would be cut off. In the meantime, however, we hear nothing certain; I await what will be announced from Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I know nothing new.</p>
      <p>The reason I did not return your writing earlier was due to the delay of the Zurich courier; but it also had to be copied. I expect the courier today, and I do not know where he has been delayed for so long.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, April 20, 1562.</p>
