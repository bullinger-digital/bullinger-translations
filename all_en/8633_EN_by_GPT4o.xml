      <p>S. I have absolutely nothing to write at the moment, except that I received your letters sent through Anton Stadler, your relative. If I can render any service to him, I will gladly do so, both for your sake and for his father's, who was well known to me.</p>
      <p>I have not encountered the treasurer yet; he is occupied because of Count Valangin (Valendijs), a citizen of our city, who is currently causing much trouble for us due to a lawsuit he has with a certain relative, who also claims part of this county, and with the Duke of Longueville, lord of Neuchâtel, whom he refuses to recognize as his superior. He has been here for ten days, I believe, very courteous, but a great papist, who nevertheless does not dare to take away the doctrine of the gospel from his subjects because of the treaty or the city rights, as they call it, which they have with our republic. I will press the treasurer as soon as I am able to meet with him. Our Aretios has not yet returned; we therefore hope that he will bring Ursinus with him. But what do I hear about Neuser? Has he escaped the elector's hands? I suspect this could not have happened without the help of some. Benedictus will explain these things to us when he arrives. It is also strange what I hear, that Jakob Andreae was secretly in Zurich and yet did not dare to enter into a conversation with you or reveal himself to anyone; thus they show what spirit and conscience these bats are endowed with. May the Lord grant them a better mind!</p>
      <p>Next Sunday, new prefects will be elected again; da werdend wir aber nüwe zytungen haben; that is our church fair here. May God grant that it turns out well!</p>
      <p>Your friends and brothers all greet you in return, Steiger, Diesbach, Manuel, father-in-law, Zehender, etc.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 10, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
