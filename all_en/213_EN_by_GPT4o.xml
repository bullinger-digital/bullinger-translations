      <p>Blasius Hollerius wishes peace and health through Jesus Christ to his lord, Heinrich Bullinger, the vigilant minister of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>When the person to whom we are giving this letter to you, most Christian man, was preparing for his journey, he was introduced into the register of the Zürich class. I was asking him. He persuaded me to consult your humanity, which is far superior in this matter, through letters. For this reason, we earnestly pray, by your candor of spirit, that you defend us in part from the injustice of this age; if you do this, you will not be able to bind me with a greater favor. Daily, those things which I acquired from a young age are slipping away, because I do not have anyone with whom I may confer; for, to confess frankly, a good part of Greek literature is lacking in me, without which, as you well know, the Latin language falters and wavers everywhere, just like a tree that has not cast deep roots. Therefore, see whether it pleases you to support me in this. For if you think there are those who would prefer me for their sons, I will combine French, if they wish, with Latin, and, when possible, Greek with Latin. However, I know that the republic of craftsmen for educating youth does not suffer from a lack; but not only from charity, lest we seem to be favorable only to ourselves, as your monuments, if I remember well, attest.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and forgive what little I have thought out, so as not to be burdensome to the courier.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, the sixth day before the calends of August 1548.</p>
      <p>I would have greeted through letters the most learned man of our journey, Conrad Gessner, the Zürich physician, if time had permitted. Farewell again. May Christ keep you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Blasius Hollerius, physician of the journey. Hastily more than is right.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and most Christian lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
