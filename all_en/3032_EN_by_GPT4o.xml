      <p>S. D. First of all, I give you, honorable lord and compater, great thanks for your kindness and generosity, with which you received me recently when I was with you. I wish I could see you here sometime and also welcome you to my home! Certainly, nothing could be more pleasing to me. Then, regarding your letters, which you sent to me in the meantime, I received them, and concerning Froschauer's plan, the situation is as follows: My lords had previously appointed for the printing my lord Venner von Grafenried, court clerk Hans von Rüti, Eberhart von Rümlang, and myself.</p>
      <p>Eberhart is gone, and since then no one has been appointed in his place. This year, the other officials have also gone to offices and no one has yet been appointed in their place. When Apiarius heard of Froschauer's opinion, he sought other lords; for I did not want to leave him alone. Today he was first before the council; I do not yet know what was decided; if that happens, they will deliberate and give Apiarius an answer, which he will then let the lord Froschauer know. Therefore, his boy is waiting for the answer. However, to bring the whole matter before the council, we have not yet wanted to consider it good at this time; for it is not customary, moreover, that one understands the matter, the other does not. It is well considered that Froschauer is looking at the Apocalypse because of the Lutherans; yet it is well considered that your discretion is such that nothing improper is in it. However, they will talk further about it once the lords are appointed. Otherwise, it is considered a great honor to you and Froschauer that you want to have this splendid work printed here. As for my version, I am not eager for it to be printed, especially since you have summarized the whole matter briefly in the Ten Articles; yet if it pleases you and them and can bring benefit, I am not against it. So it stands regarding this matter. The boy will, as I think, come soon.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new otherwise, except that in these days the envoys of Geneva and our city have met again at Payerne, but nothing has been accomplished. Less, as I hear, than ever before, although the controversy is not about great matters. Various things are reported about our people in Palestine. Watches and guards are held in Zofingen; it is not known what monster they are nurturing. Certainly, we must be vigilant and pray to the Lord to protect us; for they are intent on every opportunity to harm us and suppress us. Musculus has some things from Poland, but of almost no importance. If you have anything more, let us know as well.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, honorable and dearest lord. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 10, 1556.</p>
      <p>Burcher has obtained what he wanted, and your recommendations have been very helpful to him. Dr. Hagius and Dr. Nikolaus von Diesbach greet you in return.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and dearest compater.</p>
      <p>October 10, 1556.</p>
