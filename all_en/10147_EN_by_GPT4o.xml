      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly remember what I recently discussed with you and with Leo about allowing us a synod. We have explained the same to our prefect. We found him very agreeable in all respects, and he even voluntarily promised us his support to further gratify us. However, to ensure nothing is done rashly, he advised that the Zurich council should first be informed by letter, so that they may report this matter at the Baden assembly either in writing or through delegates, as conveniently as possible. Therefore, we ask you to deliver these letters to your consul and to highly recommend both us and the matter itself. Given your faithfulness and kindness, we have no doubt that you will do this with the utmost diligence.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
