      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, Lord Heinrich von Bourbon, Prince of Condé, my dearest lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ, our only savior, bless you, most illustrious prince and most merciful lord, and keep you and yours from all evil!</p>
      <p>I read your letters, which the noble Lord of Beauvais, whom I must honor with the highest respect, brought to me, not without immense joy, especially because from them I understood that you were freed from the most imminent danger to your life and were once again united with the church of God through the singular grace of God. I sincerely congratulate you on this and give the greatest thanks I can to our Lord God, who, having had mercy on you, snatched you from the lion's mouth and has again fitted you into the number of His saints.</p>
      <p>I earnestly pray to the same that He may preserve you and confirm you in true faith and enrich you more and more with His heavenly gifts for your own salvation and that of many others. Certainly, the more intense the grief I suffered when I heard that the Prince of Condé had joined the camp of the papists with King Henry of Navarre after that horrendous massacre in Paris, the more I am now filled with fuller joy, as I understand from your own sincere confession that you have returned to the path and are holding yourself in the camp of the holy church of Christ with true humility and modesty. Sweet indeed is the voice of our savior comforting those who have fallen from weakness and saying to Peter, the denier: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail, and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers." This sole saving sentence of our savior, not to mention the countless examples of the old church, can heal the wounds of your soul and calm the anxious mind due to the fall.</p>
      <p>The Lord has decreed by His eternal testament that He will no longer remember the sins of His faithful. Therefore, praise this immense mercy of God, give thanks to the most merciful Father, who has called you back from death to life, and serve Him alone in truth through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>However, I would not want your piety to doubt my, indeed all of our, constant intercession with God, through which we commend your salvation and that of the entire kingdom of France to the Lord; for we have no other present remedy on earth in all our labors, affections, and calamities than prayer to our Father through the Lord Jesus Christ. In which I also urge you to be constant in all your needs. I have before my eyes the most evident example of the most powerful King David, who, as the work of the Psalms abundantly testifies, obtained the greatest victories through his faithful prayers and finally reached a sufficiently peaceful kingdom. You undoubtedly know the example of the glorious King Jehoshaphat, which is most elegantly expounded in 2 Chronicles, chapter 20.</p>
      <p>Therefore, arrange all your affairs with faithful prayers, and the Lord will bless you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the state of the once most flourishing kingdom of France is now so disturbed by the work of some who seek not the salvation of the kingdom, but rather their own advantage, that it grieves us all greatly; so we pray to God that He may deign to pacify it.</p>
      <p>The noble Lord of Beauvais proposed several questions to me and discussed many things with me, especially about seeking aid, either in money or arms, from the most ample evangelical republics of the Swiss, and all these things with the utmost faith and accurate diligence, so that, although I loved him greatly before, now because of that singular diligence and in executing your affairs, most illustrious prince, I love him much more earnestly. I indeed faithfully reported to my brothers and fellow ministers what he had explained to me in many words, so that I might consult with them on each matter; for I knew that they favored you and the kingdom of France no less than I did, without any deceit. But it also seemed safer and better to have the counsel given by many pious and prudent men, who had carefully considered all matters among themselves, than by any one person.</p>
      <p>This is the unanimous counsel of all of us in the matter proposed to us:</p>
      <p>Since you recognize the Duke of Anjou or the King of Poland, after the death of Charles IX, according to the French laws, as having the right to succeed his brother by divine and human law, and thus as already declared king, we certainly cannot judge otherwise than that all good men should recognize this king, whom the Lord has given, and obey him in all things in which our God commands His people to obey kings. Hence, we can in no way advise that arms should be taken up or used against him, whom you openly acknowledge as your legitimate king, unless you wish to incur the crime of rebellion and sedition and provoke the wrath of God upon yourselves according to Paul's doctrine.</p>
      <p>However, since many things are now being done in France against the Salic laws, which among other things prohibit a woman from governing the kingdom, and certain other things are established by them, which are not at all observed in today's troubles, moreover, most illustrious princes and these innocent ones, as well as the distinguished officials of the kingdom, faithful ministers of the king, are held captive, and there is a danger that the new king may proceed more severely against them according to the suggestions of certain slanderers, and the same new king, instigated by papists thirsting for the blood of the good and innocent, may cruelly persecute the holy religion of the gospel with proscriptions and arms, following the example of his brother Charles IX, and accumulate calamities upon calamities in the kingdom and utterly overthrow the entire kingdom, which God forbid, it indeed seems to us most advisable and even necessary that you, most illustrious prince, send a delegation of all the Huguenots (whom we understand will not oppose you in these matters) to the new king to congratulate him on obtaining the kingdom, but in the meantime also to offer him faithful obedience, and to supplicate him to release the captives, not to reject sound, peaceful, and moderate counsels of the good concerning the safety and welfare of the kingdom, and especially to kindly and freely grant the holy profession and use of the evangelical religion throughout his kingdom. It will also be of great benefit here if the delegation of the more eminent princes of Germany and the four evangelical republics of Switzerland is joined to yours, which may request these things from the new king in concord and seriousness, presenting at the same time reasons by which he may be moved to clemency. And here it is evident that the hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord, and He directs them like streams of water and draws them wherever He wills. What if the Lord, having finally had mercy on France after so many and such great labors endured and calamities suffered, were to incline the king's heart to those requests, which contain nothing unjust or absurd? Thus indeed peace would be established, which could not be composed and obtained for many years.</p>
      <p>We also think that we must fervently pray to the Lord, the author of peace, to bless this delegation and have mercy on the most afflicted kingdom.</p>
      <p>But if such a delegation is requested by you, most illustrious Prince of Condé, from the most ample magistrate of the city of Zurich, from our most merciful lords, we indeed, the ministers of the church of Zurich, promise all our faithful effort by interceding and requesting that delegates be kindly granted by our lords. As for the aid now being requested, we have considered it not to be attempted at present for the reasons we have explained to Lord Beauvais.</p>
      <p>However, we think that in this matter, if it seems fair, decent, and useful, it should be expedited for many reasons better understood by yourself than explained by us; for who does not see that there is danger in delay and hesitation?</p>
      <p>Moreover, if the king, which we do not think will happen, rejects all these things and decides to break through with tyrannical force, the minds of many will be moved against him, breathing cruelty, and the Lord, who has mercy on the oppressed, will then also provide salutary counsels to His afflicted people, who sought peace and the most just things with a sincere heart, but could not obtain it. He will give, it is to be hoped, what the prayers of His saints will desire; for He who now exercised His just judgment on Charles IX, still lives and will live as the avenger of His own forever. To His grace, help, and protection, we commend you, most illustrious prince and our most merciful lord, and we pray to the Lord to preserve you in soul and body.</p>
      <p>All who, together with me, gave this counsel, my faithful fellow ministers and dearest brothers, Rudolf Gwalther, Rudolf Furt(?), Josias Simler, Ludwig Lavater, Wolphius, Haller, Johannes Jacob Wick, Burkhard Lehmann, etc., commend themselves to your mercy and we pray that you consider this our moderate counsel, alien to all cruelty, as fair and good.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich on the 28th of June in the year of our salvation 1574. Most devoted to your mercy, Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
