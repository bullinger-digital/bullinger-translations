    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not study Bullinger's writing on predestination due to the church visitations in Bern. Capito is also expected at the Basel Synod. The French envoys are trying to influence Bernese politics. Dangerous situation for the Reformed in Solothurn. Bullinger's response to Johannes Fabri is highly appreciated in Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace.</p>
      <p>Dearest Heinrich, I have not yet had the leisure to contemplate a response to the matter of predestination, but I will be able to once we have convened at each chapter throughout our Bernese region. One chapter remains, which we will visit on May 28th. Meanwhile, the people of Basel have called for a synod on the same day, and we have sent a brother from our region. They hope Capito will be present.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, envoys from France have come to our city and attempted to divert our council from the Duke of Savoy, who daily seeks to renew the old alliance, but they could not succeed. I suspect that under this pretext, they are attempting to bring back pensions and the disastrous alliance. For the Frenchman was not ashamed to whisper to some friends that in 14 days the people of Zurich would enter into a French alliance, as would the Five Cantons. I do not doubt that the same is said about us among your people. But certainly, if they had not hastened their departure, they would have disturbed our people. The crowd shouted at them in the streets: "You butcher's servants, did the devil bring you here?"</p>
      <p>In Solothurn, there is great dissension among the citizens, so that at all hours we fear the destruction of one party because of the word of the Lord. They have suspended the evangelical preacher they had from his duties. "They are a stiff-necked people" [Exodus 32:9 and others]. Those who are more influential are corrupted by the gifts and feasts of the French, so they neither dare nor wish to promote the word of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Finally, we are all otherwise well. But we have not heard a word about what is being done or has been done at the Baden Diet.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell and continue as you have begun. You are well spoken of among us, indeed even among your own people. May the Lord keep you faithful and blameless in His ministry.</p>
      <p>You have treated Fabri with dignity. The booklet pleases all readers and has been sold in large numbers among us. Its modesty and the appropriateness and gravity of its language are commended. Again, farewell, my heart and second soul.</p>
      <p>May 25th.</p>
      <p>Your B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
