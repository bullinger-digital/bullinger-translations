    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks Travers and his people to advocate for Johannes Blasius, who is in danger because of a [manuscript-distributed] dialogue attributed to him, in which the view is expressed that the people of Chur should not swear an [allegiance] oath to the bishop; Blasius probably feared that the oath would open the door to further claims by the bishop; Bullinger does not know the Bishop of Chur [Lucius Iter] and his views, but thinks that what happened to Blasius could also happen to him, for he too would defend himself privately and publicly with the pen and with speeches if he saw his congregation in danger. Philipp Gallicius has shared some news that is also intended for Travers; the [Arch]bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and the Bishop of Münster, Minden, and Osnabrück [Franz von Waldeck] continue to promote the cause of the Gospel undauntedly, despite imperial resistance. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. It has come to our attention, most esteemed and much beloved in the Lord, that our dearest brother, Johannes Blasius, is in danger because of a certain dialogue, which he is thought to have composed, concerning the fact that an oath of allegiance should not be sworn to the bishop by the people of Chur. However, if this is the case and our good brother has undertaken something of this kind, undoubtedly he wrote it for himself and the Muses, as the saying goes, not to be published, but to exercise himself in the matter that has come into controversy and to seek the truth. For this reason, he deserves pardon if he has erred in any way, about which I do not pronounce, as I neither ought to nor willingly judge such controversies. Certainly, you and men like you, good and lovers of truth, should help him in danger, if indeed the situation is as reported. Perhaps he was anxious for the flock entrusted to him, as a pastor should be; he surely feared a trap being set for the free, so that after the people of Chur have sworn the oath to the bishop, they might also be compelled to accept other things that most bishops of our time wish to establish. I do not know the Bishop of Chur, nor have I ever heard from anyone whether he is hostile to the truth or somewhat more just. However, I think that what happened to that good brother could also happen to me: for I would oppose, both privately and publicly, with pen and speeches, if I suspected that snares were being laid for the sheep entrusted to my faith. Therefore, I wish to ask your piety and humanity to help him in danger, if you can advise and assist him. Indeed, I have no doubt about your faith, diligence, and zeal towards all who are devoted to the truth, but I also commend myself to you. I wrote a few days ago to our Philipp Gallicius about some news, which I also wanted him to share with you. I have nothing new now, except that the Archbishop of Cologne and the Bishop of Münster, Minden, and Osnabrück continue to promote the Gospel fearlessly, despite the resistance of the Emperor. Farewell with all yours. Zürich, 12th of October, in the year 1543. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, Johannes Travers, most esteemed senator of the Rhaetians, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
