      <p>Greetings again and again. It is not surprising that everything breathes war and indicates the devastation of Germany; our sins should have borne this long ago. Our adversaries want to destroy the Gospel of Christ and uproot it completely in one blow, although they do not consider that Christ will have His church despite the gates of hell being against it. If only Switzerland would finally wake up and seriously think about peace; for if those internal dissensions increase, they will utterly destroy us and give our hereditary enemies the courage to attack us, and that not in just one place. Konstanz will be a strong bulwark against your land; Dole is fortified against the Bernese; the Pagans will have much trouble with Gonzaga of Milan, and the Rhaetians will have their own enemy, who will harass them. The French have suffered a great defeat by the English, who will inflict much damage on the French unless they resist with all their might.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's tricks are apparent here. After both kings have exhausted their own forces and spent money on war efforts, he will come at an opportune time and try the fortunes of war with the weary and depleted. If only Switzerland would consider these things and not disdain peace for the fatherland. For what evil spirit clouds our hearts, that we do not think of what is to come. Certainly, we and our sins are to blame. I often think of Luther's prophetic saying about Switzerland being dissolved and brought under the yoke, and that dissension will give our enemies the opportunity to fulfill that saying. But about these matters, another time.</p>
      <p>You owe Froben 3 florins, and you will give that money to the lord with whom his son is staying as a boarder.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Lord Rihel to send me the books of Sturm, which you indicated on the list, and he promised to send them shortly; for this reason, do not be anxious about receiving these books. The Diocesan assembly gathered today and heard Captain Fr√∂lich speaking, and with added conditions, our people agreed to the French alliance.</p>
      <p>May the Lord prosper that business. That alliance will undoubtedly be sanctioned not without the blood of innocents. August 26.</p>
      <p>Yours, G.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Bullinger.</p>
