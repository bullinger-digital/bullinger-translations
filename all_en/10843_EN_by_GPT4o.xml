    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the expected continuation of the conflict over the captured Solothurn ["bandits"] beyond the current Diet, wise men recommend urging the Swiss arbiters to take a firm stance. Two [Solothurners], who tried to prevent [Hans] Hugi and Hans Heinrich Winkeli from attending the Aarau Diet, were convinced that Solothurn would relent if the envoys acted decisively enough, and spoke of a willingness to accept the Lutheran, though not the Zwinglian doctrine. The unpopularity of the Catholic priests in Solothurn is demonstrated by the physical altercation between the bailiff of Dornach and his pastor. Myconius has heard nothing more about the Concord [with Luther]; the city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] mistakenly sent him the Confessio [Tetrapolitana] along with [Bucer's] Apology instead of the [First Helvetic] Confession, the German version of which he and Gryn√§us still do not know, which is why they could not fulfill Bullinger's commission [to align the Latin with the German text]. Occasionally, he doubts the sense of their efforts; the people of Strasbourg remain silent, Bucer has gone to Augsburg, and disturbing war rumors are circulating. Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here, wise men do not doubt that the assembly currently convened because of the captured Solothurners will not resolve the controversy. Therefore, it seems to them that the following should be done: The envoys, upon their return, should be encouraged to adopt and maintain a firm stance against the Solothurn adversaries, for it is certain that they will eventually yield. Indeed, I will tell you what I know: Two of them were here, who tried to delay Hugo, the old standard-bearer of the Solothurners, and Johann Heinrich Wincelius, a relative of Leo, from going to Aarau; they feared that their presence would aggravate the situation, preventing peace from being achieved. Then they said to them, in a whisper, that the Solothurners are indeed seeking peace: "They want to have peace." Meanwhile, however, they will present themselves in the first meeting with words as if they trust in their cause. If they find the envoys somewhat weak, they will continue as they have begun; otherwise, they will direct their path towards peace. Furthermore, they repeatedly said: "The Lutheran faith would not burden us if someone asked us; it has the mass and the images of the saints. But the Zwinglian faith is so far from being acceptable to us that we cannot accept it, as it would violate the oath we have given against it." They speak thus among themselves and their own; for they pursue the papal priests with such hatred that it could not be greater. Recently, the bailiff of Dornach wounded his own commoner with a sword through the sheath because he had accused him before the council of not fully paying the priesthood. He, who lost his witnesses, went to Freiburg with great complaint that the council did not fulfill what it had promised. And I could recount many things of this kind. Therefore, use this information with your people, after you have heard what has been done, so that, if necessary, you may instill firmness against the adversaries. This to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of concord, I hear nothing. Recently, our scribe mistakenly sent me the Strasbourg Confession with the Apology, all in German. I immediately returned it without reading; for I had requested not this one, of which I was unaware, but our German one, which I have not yet seen to this day. He had indeed promised, but only with words. Neither has Grynaeus seen it yet, which is why we cannot comply with your request. Indeed, I have been of the opinion several times that the effort we have expended is in vain. The people of Strasbourg are silent. Bucer, I do not know what he is doing, has been called to Augsburg. Rumors of war are flying around everywhere; plans are secret. Sharp and watchful eyes are needed, especially by our magnates. These things sometimes begin to disturb me. But all disturbance vanishes when I look to the common ruler of all.</p>
      <p>Farewell healthily with your people and with our Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 21, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myco.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
