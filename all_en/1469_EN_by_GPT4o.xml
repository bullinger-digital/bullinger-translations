      <p>Most illustrious man, a new soldier of Jesus Christ has fled from the camp of our enemies; he is Hieronymus Francus, a native of Bergamo, who was living among the regular canons, well-versed in languages and truly pious; so he seems to me. For he came directly to me and to my little hut. We are now seven, to God be the glory, who will care for and nourish his children, as he has nourished us, even when we were enemies. From Italy, we have heard that a not insignificant city, named Cuneo, which is in Piedmont, has surrendered to the King of the French. From Trento, I still expect something daily; for I sent some things to you three days ago, which I had finally discovered. I am now preparing the library for myself and the brothers who dwell in these valleys. Tell, I beseech you, Michael, to bind together for me all that you have written on the Gospel, on the Acts, and on the Epistles, and also the Decades, and to cover them with white leather; for I will soon be there and will pay for everything generously. Farewell and greetings to you with the whole family, school, and church. Pray for me. All these brothers send you many greetings. Vicosoprano, on the Ides of November.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
