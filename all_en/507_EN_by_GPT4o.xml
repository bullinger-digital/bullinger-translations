      <p>S. In Strasbourg, Satan has disturbed the church, Bucer and Paul Fagius have been acquitted and ordered to leave, and Hedio has also agreed with the others in [...]. In the meantime, fasts have been commanded, and feast days restored according to Bucer's letters, the laws which D. Musculus writes. How miserable and weak we humans are. The word of the Lord has taken no root in Strasbourg; we owe this to our sins and lack of repentance. This should have encouraged them to be more steadfast against the Emperor's edict, which they heard and certainly knew that the Saxon cities had formed a new alliance with the King of Denmark and many princes. What does this mean? Maurice, Duke of Saxony, was sent with the Bishop of Augsburg to the Venetians, fine and honest envoys. If only they would be hanged on some very tall tree on their journey, so they would be visible to all for a long time. Schertlin had a servant whom he sent to Magdeburg, who returned on March 2nd; he reports much about the steadfastness of the cities, and Lord von Riffenberg, who stayed with us for a long time, is now acting in the city of Bremen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the betrayal of the city of Siena, you probably know better than I do. These few words to you; the courier is pressing. Write back when you have leisure, why Musculus left.</p>
      <p>You recommended Thomas, who married the abbess of Seckingen; for he spreads strange things about you, who has now taken another noble wife. I fear he may be thrown into prison; he is indeed a notorious scoundrel, whom I hear was recommended to you by our Myconius. It pains me greatly if he recommended him to you in his letters. The abbess, an honest matron, still steadfastly confesses that marriage once contracted with the scoundrel and does not want to retract. She could live freely without custody if she would deny it. I do not care about the letters, which he may have extorted from the episcopal authorities, in which they write that he is free and cannot marry because of a vow once given. Why does the Emperor allow this in his Interim? See the deceptions of lost men.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>March 5, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet D. Bibliander, Pellican, etc. Yours whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, kind lord and friend, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
