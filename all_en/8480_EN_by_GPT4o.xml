      <p>Most Reverend Fathers in Christ, honorable lords, and dearest brothers. I confess that I owe much to your piety, who, although we are separated by such a great distance (you indeed dwell across the sea in England, while I live not far from the Alps in Switzerland), nevertheless, your piety so diligently cultivates, preserves, and increasingly promotes our friendship and brotherhood, once established, with frequent letters. Hence, I ought rightly to show myself grateful and obedient to your piety in every way.</p>
      <p>And since, in recent days, you sent the bull of Pius V, the Roman bishop, which I had not seen before nor heard anything about, you have provided me with the opportunity to act or at least attempt something for the glory of Christ, our only redeemer, and for the salvation of the church in England against the Roman antichrist. Behold, I dedicate this refutation of mine, opposed to the bull, to your piety and submit it to your most exact judgments, so that it may stand or fall entirely according to your piety's good pleasure. I pray, however, that you kindly accept this my effort and my spirit, most devoted to the good cause and to your piety. Otherwise, I freely confess that my abilities are very limited, while your erudition is very extensive, so that you could have handled this cause far more successfully, if indeed it had pleased you to do so. But since I understood that by this my labor, however modest, I would gratify your piety, I did not want it to lack anything in me. May Christ the Lord grant that I may speak much with abundant fruit. Please deign to greet my reverend lords and dearest brothers, Robert Horn, Bishop of Winchester, Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, and also John Aylmer, Samson, Humphrey, Lever, Fox, and the rest of your former companions in exile in Switzerland and throughout Germany, to whose prayers I commend myself. But also all the ministers and brothers who are here wish you all happiness in Christ Jesus, our Lord. May the Lord Jesus bless the ministry of your piety and keep you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of February, in the year of our salvation 1571. To the most reverend, pious, and vigilant bishops of the renowned kingdom of England, Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of York, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, and John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, my honorable lords and dearest brothers in Christ.</p>
