      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and cousin, I want to let you know that I am fresh and healthy. Hearing the same from you would be a great joy for me. Dear cousin, I want to let you know that things are still well with us, though there is concern about a war. May God avert it according to His will.</p>
      <p>I also plan to be with you after Easter, God willing. Therefore, I will not write much. I also do not intend to stay long in Zurich, as two companions will travel with me. With them, I intend to journey again, as it is not for me to remain in Zurich.</p>
      <p>No more for now, may God be with us all. Amen. Greet your wife and my guardian for me.</p>
      <p>Written on St. Matthias' Day at night in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>From me, Jörg Stadler, always your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossmünster in Zurich, by hand.</p>
