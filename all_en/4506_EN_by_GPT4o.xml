      <p>Greetings. I am expecting here a pious and learned man, who, with the help of God, will shape the character and morals of my son. I spoke with Lord Martyr on the day I left you, which is why I would not allow my son to remain with you any longer. I have not received a response from France to the letters to which I had added a copy of yours.</p>
      <p>If you have learned anything about the assembly in Stuttgart (Stuthard?), its progress, or other matters worthy of knowing, I beg you again and again to inform me of them by letter. I am uncertain if I will be able to attend the assembly called this month in Baden, because the people of Lucerne want the judgment on the shameful profit, namely the interest of 16 percent, to be made on the appointed day of the 3rd of the next month, about which they do not want to remit anything nor allow any delay. The turmoil in France increases daily.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Duke of Florence has occupied Corsica, the Pope is gathering soldiers and wants the provincials and guardians of the convents to attend the national council of France, if he cannot disturb it either by himself or through Philip. Bolweiler is seeking a sum of money from the people of Basel under interest, to gather soldiers.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the Lord will not be idle and will conduct his business among the works of others. I am writing to Mr. Fabricius and the doctor from Chur.</p>
      <p>My Margaret sends your wife quince jelly and preserved apples, which are beneficial for the stomach, and French knives in place of the book you gave her, and she sends you many greetings. You will greet all friends in my name and love us, as you do, and ask for your right if you desire anything that is within my ability. Solothurn, October 21.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor. Zurich.</p>
