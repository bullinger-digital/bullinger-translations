      <p>S. D. P. Most distinguished lord teacher, reverend man, since you have shown me many merits, I do not consider it inappropriate to inform you about the state of my affairs, which the present lord Johannes Schleher will explain to you more clearly. For whatever progress I have made in the study of pure doctrine and the fact that my affairs, which seemed to be at risk, are now safe, I can truly say that it has happened to me through your kindness. Therefore, I will never forget these benefits and will not only gratefully recall their memory and pray to the eternal God with fervent wishes that He grants you the happiest times of life for the salvation of His church, but I will also strive, so that if ever better fortune favors my wishes, I may be able to repay and return the favor in deed and action. You will gather that I did not linger long on the journey, as it pleased your reverend dignity, since I passed through the royal cities of Basel, Freiburg, Strasbourg, and Speyer and did not stay in any city for more than four hours, unless you speak of Basel, where I spoke with some learned and pious men, especially with Mr. Simon Sulzer, who, although he does not agree with us on the orthodox doctrine of the Lord's Supper, nevertheless received me generously and solemnly affirmed that he is not accustomed to rant against anyone of our opinion, and he also listened to me calmly, which deserves the highest praise in a preacher. He also offered me many services, among which I count this, that he would not be burdened to provide me with food for two or three weeks and indeed for free. But I, mindful of the promise made to you, thought of nothing day and night but to reach Heidelberg with good omens, which I entered on April 26th around the tenth hour, the tenth day after my departure from Zurich. There, in the house of Mr. Ehemius, I found all those to whom your letters were written, and I was ordered to take food in the house of wisdom, where Mr. Ehemius led me for a whole week, and if it had seemed good to me, I could have stayed there for some time. Finally, after giving a sermon, I was sent to Germersheim, where I was joined by Dean Master Sigismund Kintinger, a man very skilled in the Greek and Hebrew languages, who, due to the recent figment of ubiquity and the bodily presence of Christ in the bread, left Neuburg, whose inhabitants obey Duke Wolfgang, and came to this town. Relying therefore on the goodness of the cause and the protection of Christ, the Son of God, we endure great struggles here, so that we seem to act entirely in the midst of wolves, and indeed I know no one in this whole region among the preachers besides us two who agrees with us.</p>
      <p>The entire magistrate still thirsts for papism or Lutheranism and plots many things against us. Some even refuse to enter the temple because of the corrupted, as they say, doctrine; for we do not hide the true opinion, but publicly in the sermon we argue, rebuke, and strive to correct that horrendous monster of ubiquity, which I pray with the most fervent wishes that the Son of God may slay and destroy with the spirit of His mouth. It is also amazing how many various snares Satan devises to ensnare and deceive the little sheep of Christ.</p>
      <p>Someone was expelled from this town before my arrival, who opposed Master Sigismund and acted as pastor here for ten years or more; but behold, he who has hitherto been hidden now moves himself. For after we had built the church and delivered the true doctrine of the Supper and traveled half a mile, the dean and I, there suddenly he, who was appointed in the place of the said pastor, began to condemn our opinion in the sermon and to misrepresent it with these or similar words: "It is indeed true that Christ ascended into heaven; nevertheless, it is also true that the bread does not signify the body, but that under the bread the true body of Christ is taken and that not spiritually, but substantially," etc. But we later spoke familiarly with the man and also informed the ecclesiastical senate in the academy of Heidelberg. I am certainly glad that you sent us this present good and pious man, who will bear the office of preaching in the village, which is called Ceskaim and is one mile from the town; he will have there the best convenience and liberal income.</p>
      <p>To add this as well, I am annually paid 71 gold coins, 25 bushels of rye, and a cart of wine; I also have two gardens and a meadow, etc. What remains, I pray, that you serve this fellow countryman of yours in whatever matters you can and recommend him to our (your?) senate, mentioning the most generous promises of Christ. If you do this, I will consider the same benefit to have been shown to me, and you will bind even Johannes with perpetual goodwill and services to you.</p>
      <p>[Fare] well and prosper, my venerable lord teacher. June 21, 1562. In Germersheim.</p>
      <p>Joachim Multavius of Wismar.</p>
      <p>I pray that your reverend dignity writes back to the present lord Johannes Schleher. Greet in my name your sons-in-law Mr. Josias Simler, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, Mr. Huldrych Zwingli. To the reverend man distinguished in doctrine, piety, and virtue, lord Heinrich Bullinger, who piously teaches the gospel in the imperial city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and teacher.</p>
