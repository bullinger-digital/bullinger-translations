    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Pfister received news of Bullinger's illness through Kaspar Megander, which greatly worried him. May God grant that more pleasant news about the [health of the] people of Zurich is heard soon!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [2] When the people of Chur inquired with Bullinger about the booklet [Amorum libri IIII] by the mad poet Simon Lemnius, it was not because they intended to circulate it widely (and certainly not among those who understand little to nothing about such matters), but because they wanted to transcribe at least the most obscene and repulsive passages (of which this book is said to be full) to silence those who praise this lewd poet above all and thus harm the public (the astute Bullinger understood [the intention of the people of Chur] well!). Therefore, they earnestly request him to allow them the use of the booklet for at least one or two weeks. They will certainly return it to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [3] Greetings. Pfister does not want to trouble Bullinger any longer this time. He will write more extensively soon. Johannes Comander and Johannes Blasius send their regards.</p>

      <p>Nikolaus Balingius to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings. Our Megander wrote to me about your ill health, most learned man, which, believe me, greatly disturbed me. May the Lord grant that we soon hear more pleasant news from all of you!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, Bullinger, we do not seek the booklet of the mad poet Lemnius to spread it widely, especially among those who understand little or nothing of these matters, but so that we may at least transcribe the most obscene and repulsive parts, with which the book is said to be full, and silence those who praise this lewd poet with unknown praises, to the detriment of the public good. You understand me well, as you are astute! Therefore, we all earnestly ask you to allow us to use this booklet for at least one or two weeks. Do not doubt, we will return it!</p>

      <p>Farewell, most learned Bullinger! I did not want to trouble you with more at present. I will write much more soon. Comander and Blasius send their regards.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man of gravity and endowed with much learning and piety.</p>
