      <p>S. Favorable, dear Mr. Bullinger, especially highly trusted, I have received your letter along with the enclosed note from our mutual friend, and it is not without reason that my situation has somewhat improved on this recently past day; this has happened because the king has taken up my cause so vigorously and it is included in the eternal peace that your majesty's servants in the Confederation may act and move, and it is also good that the evangelical places favor me, which gives me the opportunity to earn their favor. God does not abandon His own.</p>
      <p>I also hope that my situation will become entirely good for the sake of attendance, when the point (as I hope in God) will be completed; may Almighty God grant His grace.</p>
      <p>Some great houses in Strasbourg have received news that the emperor's situation is supposed to be very bad; this has been heard from them in part, but it has not yet been possible to understand thoroughly whether it is concerning his life or other matters; but I will soon find out. They are indeed against us, like Sturmius and others, and with these words: "If it is true, it will go badly for us." Thus, things are bad there; the Interim has been arranged, Bucer and others are gone; but the common people are very difficult.</p>
      <p>A colonel named Bernhard von Schaumburg and Schwickhart von Sickingen are supposed to have their muster place half a mile from Kilmar with horsemen and foot soldiers, and several other colonels of the emperor are all summoned to the court in the Netherlands. However, it is not supposed to start before Pentecost. A trusted man has seen the letters of banishment against Mulhouse, Basel, Zurich, and Schaffhausen; they are supposed to, because they do not want to give taxes and levies like other imperial cities, etc.</p>
      <p>But I am sending there and will thoroughly find out everything and not keep it from you. The prince from Hispania is in Heidelberg. May the Almighty keep us in His protection and care.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 12th of March, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your willing S. Schertlin, knight, signs.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, etc., my favorable lord, to be delivered.</p>
