    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the transmission of the letter from [Martin] Hentius, who is in Transylvania, and asks how he can send him a reply. God will reward Myconius for the help shown to the recommended monk. The [also] recommended Johannes Fabricius [Hans Schmid] lacks the quick comprehension necessary for science, but he is good-natured and reliable; people who possess both qualities are most favored by fortune. Displeasure due to news allegedly not believed by Bullinger; although one should not believe everything, even if it comes from a reliable source, contrary to Myconiusâ€™ opinion, it is not to his detriment if Bullinger asks others for news. The [recently mentioned by Myconius] persecutions [of the Protestants] by Emperor [Charles V] and the Imperial forces in the Netherlands have long been believed true by Bullinger; both [Charles V] and the Frenchman [King Francis I] are sworn enemies of Christ. News from friends in Italy about the destruction of Talamone by [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa, his threat to Orbetello, and the fear of the inhabitants of Siena; Bullinger is certain that soon Italy, France, and Germany will be devastated. Exhortation to constant prayer.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I have received what you sent, accepted from Martin Hentius in Transylvania, and I give you, most esteemed Myconius, immense thanks for your faith and diligence. However, I would like to understand from you by what route or in what way I might be able to send a reply to him. There are indeed very important reasons why I must write to him.</p>
      <p>The kindness you showed to the monk recently recommended by me will be repaid by Him who is the most faithful and generous rewarder of all good deeds. I love and support Johannes Fabricius not so much because you have recommended him to me so many times, but because I see an uncommon goodness of intellect shining in him. He is rather slow with letters, but otherwise good and honest, and I prefer that goodness of intellect to sharpness. However, I consider those to be most fortunate who have received both from God and cultivate and adorn both.</p>
      <p>I do not know what new things you have written, which have found no belief with me. Certainly, things are often written to you and me which, even if they come from reliable authors, are not entirely verified. However, I do not see why this should trouble you or how you write that you feel a considerable loss since I began to seek knowledge of new things from others. It indeed seems new to me if I cannot seek knowledge of new things from others without it being to your detriment.</p>
      <p>What you write about the emperor and the persecution by the imperial forces has long been believed by me. For I have long known the emperor to be a sworn enemy of Christ. Since the Frenchman also persecutes Christ, therefore these bloodthirsty scoundrels wear each other out with mutual wars. Meanwhile, Barbarossa, the leader of the Turkish emperor's army or rather the barbarian fleet, attacked Talamone, the port of the Sienese, around the beginning of June, captured and burned the fortress and the city. He also captured and burned the neighboring areas; he now threatens Orbetello, indeed the Sienese fear that this wave of war will also overflow onto them. Thus friends write from Italy; how true it is, I do not know. However, I fear that it is too true. For I certainly believe that soon Italy, France, Germany, etc., will be devastated.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord constantly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 12, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, Bishop of the Church of Basel, his esteemed brother and lord. Basel.</p>
