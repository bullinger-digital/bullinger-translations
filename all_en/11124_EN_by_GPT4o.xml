    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not written himself yet, as Megander and Rhellikan agree with him and they have so far been able to assert themselves against resistance; the catechism drafted by Bucer, already sent by Rhellikan to Theodor [Bibliander] and now enclosed again, is a new attack on their common position, as it does not agree with the Bern Disputation, the [First Helvetic] Confession, and the response [of the reformed cities of the Confederation] to Luther. [Megander and Ritter] have presented the deviations to the councils: The statement that the symbols received their names from the designated things was deleted by Bucer; that the receiving follows the eating of the body of Christ as a fruit was blurred; it now says that with the signs the communion [of the body and blood of Christ] is "handed over," while the mentioned writings speak of "proclaiming" and "offering." Nevertheless, the council decided on December 2 to print the catechism and to punish resistance with dismissal. In negotiations with Sebastian [Meyer] and [Peter] Kunz, Ritter was able to enforce mitigations: The unbelievers receive only bread and wine, the receiving is subordinated to faith, and the communion of the body and blood is now explained in reference to the disputation; nevertheless, he fears an overestimation of the creaturely signs and an alienation from the Zurichers. Their letter [No. 1073] did not change the councilors' minds; they believe it is only theological quarreling. A Zurich delegation could still bring about a change; otherwise, [Megander] will leave Bern, while Ritter has requested time for consideration. They find themselves in a dilemma and can no longer achieve anything themselves, but hope for help and advice from Zurich. Possibly a meeting of the confederate churches, to which Constance as well as Bucer and Capito should be invited, could bind Bucer back or at least align the catechism with the confession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Beloved lords and brothers, although I have not written myself since I came to the church in Bern, my dear lords and brothers Megander and Rhellicanus have reported on my behalf, as we have unanimously conducted ourselves in the way shown and taught to us by our faithful fathers Zwingli and Oecolampadius, continuing in the same path alongside you, our beloved brothers, and other Swiss churches, with the utmost diligence, and with God's help, achieving good success against various attacks, which we have endured much, until recently, when Bucer, who is cunning, has been among us and, among other things, has prepared a catechism for us concerning the sacraments in Bucer's manner, which, however, does not agree with our held disputation, confession set in Basel, nor the response to Luther, and is entirely a new way of speaking about the sacraments in our church in Bern, also unheard of in other Swiss churches, which Rhellicanus has sent to Theodor in these days through Huiuff, the merchant. Whether it has reached him, we do not know, but for greater certainty, we send you a true copy of the same.</p>
      <p>And although we have diligently insisted with the councils and citizens and shown how it contradicts God's word and disputation, namely, that symbols derive their names from the things they signify, as in the disputation in Bern in the large print folio 116 face 2. Oecolampadius and folio 149 face 2. Zwingli, then showing how some parts have been changed and obscured by the change, such as the question: "What is eating the body of Christ," answer: "It is believing," they have meanwhile inserted "in thus receiving" etc., which is the fruit that follows the eating, as the confession set in Basel shows. Then they have imposed on us, with the signs of bread and wine, the Lord hands over the communion etc., but the disputation reads folio 143 face 1: Oecolampadius: "But our covenant is assured only at the cross according to the eternal counsel of God, who has given his only begotten Son for his unspeakable obedience unto death to the elect; and yet at the time such distribution and sprinkling is granted to each one and will be granted, as he is moved and sanctified by the grace of the Holy Spirit" etc. And soon after: "But it is true, such grace of God and distribution is proclaimed to us here, therefore one also gives thanks to God" etc. Item folio 145 face 1: "And those who want the testament to be fulfilled only in death, as it clearly stands in Hebrews, the true faith gives us the natural interpretation, as it stands: 'This is the cup of the new testament' [Lk 22, 20; 1Cor 11, 25], or also: 'This is my blood of the new testament' [Mt 26, 28; Mk 14, 24], which teaches us so much that we have here a proclamation through the cup of thanksgiving, what comfort we shall receive from the suffering [...] of Christ etc. The same our confession shows: through the signs of bread and wine, "the true communion [...] is presented and offered to the believer." About baptism: "through the visible signs [...] offered and presented." Response to Luther, about baptism: "Baptism is a sacrament, in which the Lord attests and presents his grace with a visible sign." About the supper: "The supper" etc., "in which he renews and attests to us" etc.; "for with the bread and wine he proclaims to us, what he" etc.</p>
      <p>And although all this has been shown faithfully, Bucer has sown such a seed among us, and the practice is so great, and all the papists have joined him, that we could not resist, but it has been decided that the catechism should be printed, and whoever does not want to consent to it or act against it will be given leave. Happened on December 2.</p>
      <p>In this, the matter has been delayed, so that I have amicably negotiated with Doctor Bastion and Contzeno and have achieved so much that they have mitigated the catechism: "With the signs of bread and wine, the Lord hands over himself or the communion of his body to his believers; for the unbelievers receive only bread and wine." The same question: "What is eating the body of Christ," answer: "It is nothing else but believing" etc., they have left as before, and what they have inserted in between has been placed at the end, namely: "in thus receiving, that he lives in us and we in him" etc. Thirdly, whenever it says "the communion of the body and blood" etc., a question has been added: "What is the communion of the body and blood." Answer as Oecolampadius defined in the disputation folio 126 face 1; then the same from the disputation has been written there word for word. But that "with signs of bread and wine he hands over" etc. I would have liked to see it set according to the confession or response to Luther, but they want to print the catechism by force. But I could not achieve it, and it troubles me greatly, as I fear that the effective power of God might be attached to the creatures, or at least, that it may bring misunderstanding at the time; secondly, that through such a catechism we deviate from you, engage further, neither disputation, confession, nor response can achieve.</p>
      <p>Therefore, and after you have written, done to us, we have handed it over to the councils and citizens. But they have recognized as before, and this is the reason: They do not say it is clearly against the scripture, so they think it is only a quarrel from us, they are also convinced it is not against the disputation, confession, response etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, beloved lords and brothers, it stands badly with us because we have done as much as we could. But still, there is hope, if one of you, if not two, would come with a council delegation and explain the matter to my lords in detail, there would be hope that everything would be reversed. Otherwise, Gaspar will leave from there, take leave. So I have requested time for consideration, I want to consult further with learned people. And what I can do with a good conscience, I will not refuse (for they have recognized, we should sign the catechism or have leave); what I cannot do, I will inform them. Therefore, they may act against me as they see fit.</p>
      <p>Therefore, beloved lords, we stand between the altar and the rock and the church in Bern. Therefore, it is my earnest, diligent request and desire that you take care of the church in Bern and, as you can, come to its aid, then for God's sake advise us as soon as possible how we should conduct ourselves in the future. For if we sign, we are separated from you and go into a new dark way of speaking about the sacraments; if we do not do that, we must leave the church. We do not know if we should do it for such a matter etc. and thus the glorious church would become entirely corrupt. Therefore, beloved lords and brothers, do not spare effort and work, costs, if you might help the matter. There are still many good-hearted people; but the papal faction has joined the Bucer faction. There are many pious people who are convinced there is no danger in it. Gaspar is too hated; I do not have such great authority that I would outweigh Bucer, unless I would stand there and engage against Bucer to dispute etc. And therefore there is good hope, if you act earnestly, you would achieve something good; but if you want to leave the matter as it is, we ask you for God's sake, please share your advice with us through a quick message. With that, God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, December 21, 1537.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely etc.</p>
      <p>But if the proposed advice does not please you, we think it is useful and good, so that the Swiss churches remain united and undivided, that you could influence your lords to quickly set a day for all Swiss churches, also Constance, and that the same, if it could be found in council, be set in Bern, also Bucer and Capito would be invited; so one could remove all displeasure and negotiate with Bucer, that he leaves us undisturbed and undivided. Also, the children's instruction could be postponed, or at least aligned with the confession. We have no doubt about that; for it all depends solely on our lords being properly informed about the matter. Many meetings have been held on this matter, where it was not as necessary as it is now.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious brothers, pastors and lecturers, deacons, ministers of the church in Zurich, dearest brothers.</p>
