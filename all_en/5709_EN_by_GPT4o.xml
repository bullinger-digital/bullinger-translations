      <p>To Mr. Francesco Lismanini of Corfu, superintendent of the churches of Lesser Poland, these letters are given.</p>
      <p>Greetings. For a long time now, I have not sent you, Francesco Lismanini, any letters, for no other reason more than that it was reported to me from Poland that you do not fully respond to our testimony and our recommendation, with which we had liberally commended you to the churches and ministers of Poland when you departed from us. Indeed, as you displayed at the time when you lived with us, we believed that you sincerely embraced the pure doctrine of our churches concerning the Christian religion and steadfastly opposed all those who foster a different doctrine with false hearts and strive to instill it with wicked arts. And lest you think I am proposing riddles, I speak of those who think and teach differently about the worship of the Trinity and our Lord Jesus Christ than is believed or taught in our churches. And indeed, what we believe and teach on these matters, if not in our other books, we have at least briefly and clearly set forth in that letter of ours, which we sent to you in March of the year 1561, also printed, which the same Josias of ours now defends against the calumnies of Stancari, so that there is no need to repeat the same with annoyance. And you indeed, who lived with us for some time and observed our customs, know that it is not our custom, as it is with some, to change the kind of doctrine almost every year and to express it differently. For we know whom we have believed, and that what we believe is most true and certain. Therefore, still standing on the same foundations, we do not now feel differently than we did when you were with us, and when that letter was written. Nor indeed in the meantime has anyone overturned that doctrine of ours delivered in that letter or convicted it of error. Indeed, ill-fated writings are circulated, but they are not such as to move us from our most firm purpose. Therefore, we do not at all agree with those who say that we would not disagree with them if we were not reluctant to retract our views. And you are said to not only embrace but also support and gather those who dissent from us in every way, and to commend them to the Poles. It is said that through the tricks and arts of these people, some of the Polish ministers have even begun to doubt the orthodox and catholic faith. This can be inferred from the fact that they question whether the Athanasian Creed is by Athanasius or by some other unknown person, about which religious antiquity for a thousand years and more has not doubted. Those most learned men who first restored true religion to us against the papacy by the grace of God did not doubt the same, and they all acknowledged and received it. But the arguments used by some in this cause differ little from those that were once refuted by the blessed fathers and indeed by the authorities of the scriptures. This can be seen in the writings of St. Augustine in the response by which he refuted the discourse of the Arians, and in the three books written about the action with Maximinus the Arian bishop. And it is indeed strange that they bring forward the testimonies of Hilary and some other ancients, when no one is unaware that the more obscure should be interpreted by the clearer, not to mention Hilary himself, who died as the most bitter enemy of the Arians and did not deviate a hair's breadth from the doctrine of both Athanasius and the church. Certainly, if they were wise, they would never have brought this cause, so diligently examined by the ancients, into contention again. This is what the most fortunate Emperor Constantine once objected to the most unfortunate Arius in a written letter. But I do not intend now to engage in a more laborious dispute on this matter. For I do not think I can handle this cause better than it has been handled by the testimonies of the scriptures by the ancients. Rather, all these things I say tend to this, that if you wish to continue as you are said to have begun, to present yourself as a patron of new men and doctrines, you should no longer use our recommendation or our testimony. Otherwise, we will ensure that our testimony is more correctly understood by the Poles through our explanation, so that it is not reflected on those matters of which we do not wish to be authors or supporters or associates, and we now urge you, Lismanini, to leave those turbulent men, whom, as you could have learned in Geneva if you wished, adhere to the sincere truth rightly sounding by the grace of God in our churches, as you yourself once confessed and, if you are wise, will continue to confess. May the Lord Jesus enlighten you with His spirit and keep you.</p>

      <p>We also gave this open letter to Tretius, so that if it perishes on the journey, another copy remains, which belongs to Tretius himself.</p>
