      <p>Greetings. I would have gladly responded to your letters long ago, most esteemed lord and godfather, and returned these to you; but until now, I have been without reliable messengers and did not want to entrust these letters to just anyone, as there is now danger almost everywhere for good men from the transmission of such letters. I would have sent my own messenger to you on the advice of Mr. Steiger, if the council had not decided today to send this courier. The reason for the mission would have been the same for which he is also partly sent here, namely regarding the dispatch of the embassy to the new king; for my lord mayor Steiger is concerned about it and would like the matter to proceed, God grant that the nine places send or not, that at least the four cities do their part; for he hopes that even if not much is achieved, the king's disposition and much else will be better understood. He has therefore instructed me to write to you earnestly about it. My lord mayor of Mülinen has indeed written to the ambassador in Solothurn (with whom he has much in common), to inquire whether he hopes that something fruitful can be achieved. We have not yet received his reply; but whatever the case, my lord mayor Steiger thinks that one should not refrain from sending. He would like it not to be hindered by yours, but rather to be promoted as much as possible not only with you but also with the other two cities. The messenger should leave here today; but he will be held up until Saturday because the other places are to give their answer to Zurich in the meantime. My lords would like to be informed by this messenger. We hear from the king that he is supposed to arrive in Turin the following Sunday.</p>
      <p>Some say he is already there and will come to Chambéry that day. In all of Savoy, preparations are being made for his arrival; all the nobility have been ordered to dress in black clothing to receive him.</p>
      <p>The old queen wanted to come to Lyon to receive him there; but I do not know what happened to her, it has been canceled, and she is not coming. Moreover, the Duke of Nemours has gone there to receive the queen; but whatever he heard, he suddenly left and rode to Paris. The people of Geneva, it is thought, will be more secure because the plague is raging among them; a minister and the head of the gymnasium have died.</p>
      <p>Regarding our people who are imprisoned in Milan, I think you have all heard the report from Mr. Gimper, who was a messenger from Zurich over the mountains. My lords are greatly burdened by the matter. The substance is that de la Val and the admiral's people, who are here, sent with our messenger, young Wolfgang Meyer, one or two of their servants with precious jewels to Lucerne and from there to Milan to sell them there or in Venice under the title and name of some lords here, to whom these jewels had come by purchase. When they arrived in Milan, a bankrupt merchant, who still owed much, came and claimed some of the jewels, for which the Cardinal of Lorraine had once given the late admiral 7000 crowns, and reported that they had been robbed from him at sea, also brought up some Lombard acquaintances of some who confessed to having worked on the items, therefore he had the seller arrested. He wrote back to Mr. Meyer in Lucerne about how things were going, who then brought the matter to the attention of the Confederates, also went with the others to Milan and brought the matter to the point that the other was dismissed and the jewel was awarded to him. After that, Mr. Meyer rode away, but he stayed and first bought some costly horses, which made the Milanese suspicious. Moreover, his adversary meanwhile reported the matter to the inquisitor, who came and attacked him and his companions by night and captured them. The messengers wrote back, but in vain, and in the meantime, the matter came to my lords, who also wrote very sharply about it; but the answer has not yet come back, and one is not only worried about the goods but much more about the good people's harm, and the matter could well turn into a bad game; for if they are not released, it is intended to seize all Lombards who are always in our country and buy cattle. God protect us from evil! It could soon lead to a bad end.</p>
      <p>The Saxon tragedy distresses good people greatly, and they wonder that the elector comes to such a foolish decision. Yet we hope that the truth will only be promoted and become more apparent through it. We are sorry for the good people who are thus recalled; but forced oaths are displeasing to God. He who flees will fight again; the Lord will give them, if God wills, another and stronger spirit; therefore, he is to be prayed for. I have informed Steiger of everything, who read it with sorrow.</p>
      <p>Our Hasler (I do not know what he has tasted) has made himself to Leipzig and has come to Strasbourg; from there he has sent his testimony from the University of Leipzig here, as well as one from a doctor there, named Thomingus, I do not know who he is, to whom he privately instructed his children. However, he did not send such testimonies to us generally, but only to his patron Mr. Fedminger, who ran around with it to Mr. von Diesbach, who particularly favors him, and to Steiger, to whom he also wrote himself, as he can insinuate himself quite well, although I have warned both mentioned lords faithfully and do not doubt Steiger's loyalty. What he has brought up, I do not know. But I wonder what he wants to do in Strasbourg if he is supposed to study medicine. I suspect that he intends to do harm to young Blauner, who is now a professor of arts here, because he discovered his deceitful, foul Arian tricks; for he studied with him in Leipzig. God protect us and our churches from evil! The world is full of the gospel and preachers; if we soon had others and something new, that would be our matter.</p>
      <p>We are all deeply sorry for the miserable damage to the city of Chur. I have shown Mr. Mayor Dr. Tobiae's letter; he brought it to the council today. I hope my lords will also act according to their honor. God protect them and us further from misfortune!</p>
      <p>We hear nothing specific about the Confederates who went to France and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>We hear that they are remarkably divided in the countries. God knows what he wants to make of it.</p>
      <p>As far as I am concerned, I do what I can; but it is a great hindrance to me that I cannot move well, therefore I must leave many things undone that I would otherwise pursue. But it pleases the Lord so; may he give grace and strength to you and me and all who mean well with the truth. My wife sends you many greetings, especially to my lord mayor Steiger, Mülinen, Diesbach, Hagenberg, my fellow sufferer in gout, and others. L. Zehender, bailiff in Hinderlappen, has particularly instructed me, who was recently with me and sent me a good wild hen yesterday. God knows, you would have it! But the heat does not allow it to be sent further.</p>
      <p>Given on the 20th of August, 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours always.</p>
      <p>As I wrote this and waited for the messenger to take the letters, he went away without the letters, and when I wanted to send them to him, he was already gone. Therefore, I sent this after him, in case he still catches up with him, if not, that he goes to Zurich. The courier must be reprimanded.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, my esteemed lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
