      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Considering your kindness towards us, most learned man, and the conditions, by which we have been admonished by you not to accept the most unfortunate Interim, we cannot help but always remember you, especially since we daily see so many dangers, about which we have been warned by you, looming.</p>
      <p>Alas, how great is the lamentation of the pious! The sacraments, especially baptism, have been taken away. We have preached the word of Christ most sincerely until now; we hope that we will soon celebrate the Lord's Supper, albeit with great danger. The papists plot cruel things against us, distort our sermons, denounce us, babble, and invent unspeakable things against us in their usual manner, accusing us of anything to finally drive us out of the city.</p>
      <p>We have many, thanks to God, who are zealous for our cause and fervent for God, who in these distressing circumstances have become more ardent and have cast off all fear, preferring to face death rather than endure that unfortunate Interim. Very few attend the mass.</p>
      <p>The sermons of the papists are almost universally despised by all; everyone perceives traps being laid for them, snares with which they strive to ensnare the minds of the simple, are clearly seen by all, they are mocked and scorned.</p>
      <p>No one shows them honor (as is fitting). Seeing this, the wretched papists threaten us with the emperor's indignation, that the city will be occupied by garrisons, and that some of us will be taken away by the sword; they thirst for our blood; if things go according to their wishes, dreadful evils await us. But we, relying on the kindness of our God, promise ourselves better things, etc.</p>
      <p>Various rumors are spread here and there: that the emperor is preparing a great army against the Swiss and our homeland; some say that he will soon come to Strasbourg with his Spanish dregs and there consult on how he might undertake the matter.</p>
      <p>May the Lord scatter their plans and turn our hearts to Him, so that, led by repentance for our sins, we may come to our senses and avert His wrath!</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted you to know out of my gratitude towards you. Farewell and keep me in your thoughts. Greet Theodor on my behalf along with my other brothers. From our Lindau, October 12.</p>
      <p>Write back, if you may, or at least with a few words, if you have anything. Yours sincerely, Jakob Fehr.</p>
      <p>To the outstanding man in piety and manifold learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
