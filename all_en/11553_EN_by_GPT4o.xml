      <p>Greetings. As it was written to me, so I will write to you as well.</p>
      <p>The preachers of our side are preaching one after the other in Regensburg in the inns of the princes.</p>
      <p>Before Pest, the Turks are said to have lost several assaults and their leader is reported to have perished; consequently, they have withdrawn.</p>
      <p>The personal arrival of the Turk is said to be certain and exceedingly powerful. Luther is said to have written to Regensburg, perhaps thinking, quod agunt comędiam inter homines, sed tractare eos tragędiam inter deum et satanam, therefore it is worth paying attention.</p>
      <p>Philipp [Melanchthon] recently sent Jakob Sturm a small golden cross from a mine and these verses with it: Exiguam tibi mitto crucem, facunde Iacobe, Alterius signum, sed crucis esse puta.</p>
      <p>He himself, the Son of the most high Father, redeemed us through death and forbade us to fear the threats of death.</p>
      <p>The colloquium has begun, yet several persons from both sides have been appointed to discuss a reconciliation, namely: on the papal side: 1. Doctor Eck, whom you know well, 2. Johannes Groperus, a man from Cologne, said to be a wise and educated man, 3. and Herr Julius Pflug; he is indeed a righteous man, with whom I stayed in Bologna for 3 years in one house, he is a canon in Mainz; on our side: 1. Philipp [Melanchthon], 2. Bucer, and 3. Pistorius, a Hessian preacher.</p>
      <p>Also, as assessors are appointed on the other side: 1. a councilor from Cologne, 2. the chancellor of Mainz, 3. the chancellor of the Palatinate; on our side: 1. the Saxon chancellor, 2. the Hessian chancellor, 3. Jakob Sturm.</p>
      <p>As presidents are appointed the Palatine Friedrich and the emperor's chancellor, Granvela.</p>
      <p>The three appointed from our side have been admonished by our people, and they have been instructed:</p>
      <p>1. that they approve nothing that is not justifiable, 2. that they conceal nothing, 3. that they maintain the order of the articles of the confession; for the opposing side wanted to start with the article on the sacrament and finally on justification; perhaps thinking there might be a division among our own people regarding the sacrament. May the devil thank them for this deceit.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned six appointees have been sent by the emperor; he has shown them the arrangement, and that they should consider only the honor of God.</p>
      <p>On April 25, they began the matter. I do not know more at this time.</p>
      <p>Fabri is said to still be alive. Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Share this with the others, especially with Leo. Greet all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his most sincere brother. Zurich.</p>
