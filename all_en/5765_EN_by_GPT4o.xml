      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The arrival of your Blasius and his wife was most welcome to all of us. His presence, previously dear, has now become even dearer. The Lord has truly blessed you by giving you such a son-in-law. We wish them and you and yours all happiness and that He may continue to bless you perpetually. Regarding the affairs of France, the same things were written yesterday as were written to you, except that this new information was added to yours: the Parisians gave the king three hundred thousand francs; by this, they obtained that no one will be admitted further into judgment or office unless they enter the safety of the Roman See. From this, I understand that the hand of the Lord is still extended over France. It is also added: If Admiral had come to the court, traps were laid and hands were set upon him. Therefore, he wisely and indeed with God as protector turned elsewhere. It is said here that he warns the prefect of Lyon not to surrender the city. It is said that Admiral is with the Constable, who also left the court. For there seem to be new Guises, who claim royal authority and power in France for themselves. May the Lord have mercy on France. As far as your business is concerned, I cannot see that it is of benefit to the doctrine and the church that you involve yourself. For how it turns out later, and especially if it turns out badly, all the blame lies on you, and thereby the doctrine is despised and hated, so that you are of little more use to the church. I do not allow myself to be involved in such cases, although there are always people who think that the preachers should fall out. However, since our office extends far and requires much, we must also do what is right and thereby support the truth and the right and build up the church in good, also avert evil as much as possible. So you can always strive for peace and work for the good of the cause, and not for war, flee the war, wherever it may be inclined. That one may also faithfully help the honest people, that they may remain in the faith, and help through peaceful, appropriate, steadfast means, etc. And if one could achieve with these means that the three dominions might remain unchallenged by the true religion and be appropriately assured, etc., it seems to me that it would be better to give them back than to keep them. For I hear well, if Bern should argue about it, little would be gained. If one should then lose it with right, one could then keep the poor people less in the faith. Bern would also not be able to refuse the right. Or would have to expect the displeasure of all the confederates. Besides, they have enough to do with the Duke. But if concerning Geneva the matter could be brought to the point (as one hopes) that they might remain with the citizenship, and if they owe something to the prince, that they fulfill that and remain with their freedom, justice, and above all true religion, that would not be to be rejected. So then the whole Vaud might belong to the city of Bern (except Neuchâtel, but instead Vevey, Thonon, Neuchâtel, and Cillon), I think it would not be a small thing, especially to keep the whole land by the true religion, which is great in my view. And it does not seem to me that it is good that Bern allows itself to be persuaded by the French to enter into an alliance with them and reject the separation. For if you should go to war, you will have a hard resistance and little help. Would to God that the confederates do not turn against you themselves if you reject reasonable means. The Duke has Spain and Italy at hand. France is exhausted and destroyed. The princes will eventually reconcile with each other. For you are alone in the soup. And you cannot know how willing yours will be to war. The land is otherwise exhausted and has little or nothing from the world. How then will one maintain the war? The city will not be able to sustain it for itself in the long run. If then misfortune should strike, instead of being able to protect the newly won land, you would lose your own, send wife and child into misery, thereby extinguishing the true faith and helping the papacy. This and the like is indeed well worth considering for you. Perhaps there are people who would like to become rich in the bailiwicks, to whom the faith is not so important; it is to be feared that this would bring less fortune. And those same ones might also lose what they now have. So now the Duke, while he is before France, having received back the cities in Piedmont, can go into the direction; later another wind blows, then he does none of these things. This is also well to be observed. If he then now destroys everything, then the matter is to be handled accordingly.</p>
      <p>So much I write at your request; please, you will send me this letter back enclosed in yours after some days.</p>
      <p>Finally, my advice is that you strive for peace, not war. If it cannot be otherwise, then if, while seeking peace, you are attacked - in the name of God, then God will give advice and help. May He keep you, your house, father-in-law, my dear good friends and honorable gentlemen, Mr. Schultheiß Steiger, etc., Diesbach, Haller, Hag, and others in His grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 11, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours always, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Lord must be prayed to without ceasing, and the people must be urged to pray, so that the Lord may give good counsel and govern these difficult matters kindly, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Haller, most faithful pastor of the church of Bern, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Bern.</p>
