    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Vadian [the messenger] Alexius [Knoblauch] did not deliver his letter intended for Bullinger, he has received nothing more from Bullinger. He also does not know if Alexius has returned. Meanwhile, Vadian and the St. Gallen council have written to Bullinger and the Zurich council regarding an urgent matter. The St. Gallen merchants, who returned yesterday [from the Lyon All Saints' Fair], had drawn the attention of the Bern council and shortly thereafter also the St. Gallen council in writing to the sad fate of the skilled and exemplary merchant from Tours named Octavien Blondel. Shortly after December 1st, he was accused by a hardened French nobleman [Gabriel de Saconay] (who was staying in the same inn [“La Couronne”] as Blondel and posed as a promoter of the Christian faith) to the vicar of the bishop [Ippolito II d'Este] as a Zwinglian and Lutheran who did not adhere to the liturgically imposed dietary restrictions. The denunciation occurred because Blondel refused to lend money to this unscrupulous accuser. Armed servants, accompanied by a large number of people, broke into the public inn at night, arrested Blondel, who was dining with the St. Gallen merchants, threw him into the bishop's prison, and then claimed to have acted on the orders of King Henry II. The excellent man rots in prison just because he is a Christian! The returning St. Gallen merchants urged the Bern council to intercede for the good man. They immediately wrote to the king and sent the letter to Louis [Daugerant, Seigneur de] Boisrigaut (but without informing the latter of the letter's content, as he is hostile to Protestants) with a request for its rapid forwarding. The St. Gallen merchants also immediately asked their council [in writing] to persuade the Zurich council to write a similar letter. And so it came to the aforementioned letter to Zurich. Bullinger is now to urge the Zurich council to advocate for Blondel. Vadian himself has drafted the letter for the king on behalf of and in the name of his council. He has no doubt that the Zurich council will deliver this letter along with theirs to Boisrigaut as quickly as possible. However, care must be taken that Boisrigaut learns nothing about the reason.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Henry II is said to have ordered the lieutenant of Lyon [Jean Du Peyrat] to honorably receive the Swiss envoys who will come for the baptism of his daughter [Claude]. Therefore, they inquired with the St. Gallen merchants what would please the Swiss the most. The merchants replied that the Swiss are not oriented towards pomp, but would never forget a friendly interaction with them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In France, there is said to be an unprecedented armament. They plan to muster 3,000 lancers. 15,000 cavalrymen are already present. The king has also ordered 200 larger and smaller cannons to be cast in Tours, Lyon, and Turin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In Geneva, a Savoyard nobleman told the businessmen that Emperor Charles V would not go to war against Pope Paul III if the latter relocates the Council of Bologna back to Trent. However, it is said to be true that the emperor and the pope are angry with each other for further reasons, and that a terrible war could ensue if this is not remedied. God have mercy on the people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The people of Constance are waiting patiently and behaving calmly. In St. Gallen, prayers are offered for them daily from the pulpit. As far as Vadian knows, they have not yet sent an envoy to King Henry II, but have only negotiated with him through intermediaries so far. Time will tell what will come of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Spaniards and Italians [of the imperial troops] are causing trouble everywhere, especially with young people. In Nuremberg, it is certain that a war is imminent for the Swiss.</p>

      <p>S. I have received no letters from you since Alexius left with mine, and I do not know whether he has returned or not. Meanwhile, a pressing matter has arisen, prompting both me and our council to write to you and your council. Our merchants, who returned from Lyon yesterday, reported first to the Bern council and shortly thereafter to our council about a certain learned and virtuous gentleman, Octavien Blondel from Tours, a merchant, who was accused a few days after the beginning of December by a certain bankrupt French nobleman. This nobleman, who stayed at the same inn as Mr. Blondel and pretended to be a supporter of the Christian doctrine, falsely accused him to the bishop's vicar of being a follower of Zwinglian and Lutheran doctrines and of not observing any dietary restrictions on any day, but rather eating indiscriminately at all times. The reason for the accusation was that Blondel refused to lend him a certain sum of money. Consequently, officers, accompanied by a large number of people, dragged him from the public inn, where our people were also present, to the prison of the chief priest, falsely claiming that Blondel was being taken away by the king's order. Thus, this excellent man languishes in chains for no other reason than being a Christian. Our people, moved by his plight, informed the Bernese on their journey, urging them not to abandon this good man. Without delay, they sent letters to the king, which Louis Boisrigaut, unaware of the cause (as he is hostile to our people), ensured were delivered to the court by public courier. Our people were also advised to implore the Zurich council to write, which they have undertaken to do with the authority of our council, who, moved by their pleas, are writing to yours with the good hope that they will not fail in such a holy duty. You will diligently ensure this with your exceptional faith and piety. By the mandate of our council and in their name, I have written a letter to the king with my own hand, which will undoubtedly be delivered along with yours by Mr. Louis, provided care is taken that he learns nothing of the cause.</p>

      <p>The lieutenant in Lyon has received a serious command from His Majesty to show the highest honor to the Swiss envoys who will come for his daughter's baptism. Therefore, our people were asked what would be appropriate for them and what they would most desire. The response was that they do not care for pomp. However, they will never forget those who treat them kindly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is a great military preparation underway throughout France. Three thousand lancers are to be assembled and deployed. They are gathering around 15,000 cavalry. The king is also having strong field artillery cast in three places, namely in Tours, Lyon, and Turin, with 200 pieces at each location, both large and small. They are being prepared longer and more powerfully than ever before!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A Savoyard nobleman spoke in Geneva, saying he knew that Emperor Charles V would not make any war against the pope if the latter agrees to hold his council not in Bologna but in Trent. However, it is said that mistrust already exists, and there are other reasons that could lead to a great uprising (war) without remedy. May God grant mercy!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The people of Constance are waiting patiently and keeping quiet. We pray daily from the pulpit to God for them. As I understand, they have not yet sent any envoys to the king, but are using other intermediaries. What these will accomplish, time will reveal.</p>

      <p>The Spaniards and Italians are causing trouble everywhere, especially with the youth. In Nuremberg, it is certain that Switzerland will have war.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, December 21, 1547.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
