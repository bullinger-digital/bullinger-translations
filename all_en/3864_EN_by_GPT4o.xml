      <p>Greetings. I received your letter on the 15th of this month, most illustrious and incomparable friend, in which you faithfully respond to my request at the beginning. For this, I thank you, and I am very pleased with the pious prince's zeal for the true religion. May the Lord God guide his steps further according to His word.</p>
      <p>Regarding Ferdinand, the servant of monks and papists, I had expected nothing else; may the Lord bring him back to the right path or restrain him with His power so that he does not harm the holy course of the Gospel. As for the funeral preparations for Charles V, I fear it may be too late; otherwise, I do not see it as a bad decision to deal with these trifles rather than the papal kitchen, according to the German proverb: "When the priests have the requiem in the choir, they are ready for the gaudeamus in the kitchen." Thus, the Maccabees are the priests' relics; then there is a black boar sewn into a white lilac, such a costly game for the priests. What then can they expect from the imperial, most invincible (if it pleases the gods, experience follows otherwise) body, entangled in velvet and silk? Such mockeries, like frivolous trifles, are produced by that god Mars, in whom truly dwells the fullness of embodied Satan; may the Lord daily free the church, afflicted by so many diseases, from such errors. The war preparations against the Turk are old complaints, by which the purses of the Germans are drained, and their strength weakened. Merchants always complain about the sunken ship, so that in the meantime they can sell their goods at a higher price and indulge more freely. To the same disease, Ferdinand always sings the song of subjugating the Turk, so that, having gathered money from everywhere, he can support Sardanapalian customs and gratify the papists. May the Lord, with His eternal wisdom, restore the death of the King of Denmark with a good and pious prince. What you write about the progress of the Gospel in the Kingdom of Poland and England fills me with the greatest joy; I will not fail to support such a holy endeavor with my prayers. The booklet, which you say is being printed, containing responses to 61 questions of the papists, I eagerly request to be shared with me, your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if you have any remaining notes on Jeremiah, I beseech you to send them to me with the present messenger, a citizen of Lenzburg. In the meantime, may the Lord God keep you safe in body and soul for a long time for His church. Greet your wife, who is dear to me in the Lord, along with the whole family.</p>
      <p>Delsperger and our Hamman, afflicted in many ways, send you many greetings. Farewell. February 16, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Schuler.</p>
      <p>To his old friend, the most esteemed Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Church of Zurich, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
