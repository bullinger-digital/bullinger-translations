      <p>Nikolaus Artopoeus to Heinrich Bullinger, a most candid man, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Recently, Mr. Haller showed me a lexicon written by you, about which, as you love me, I have the highest opinion, as it surpasses other works of this kind in both elegance and abundance. Therefore, I immediately asked whether you intended to publish it. "If I remember correctly," said Haller, "it will be published soon, but revised and more extensively from the press of Mr. Froschauer." "How unfair," I said, "it is arranged that something is always added to the wealthier; I wish Mr. Bullinger would give this task to our poor Apiarius, from whom he would gain great favor, and I know Mr. Froschauer would not take this badly. Help us, my lord; you alone can obtain this from Mr. Bullinger without any controversy. If I can do anything, and I can do not entirely nothing, I will also do it most willingly." When I said this, most loving man, he immediately referred this matter to me as well, saying: "Try what you can; I dare not affirm with certainty what Mr. Bullinger has decided."</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask and beseech you, my Mr. Bullinger, to grant this favor to us and our school; if you do this, you will do us a most pleasing service, and I wish you to be persuaded that at this time, no one among all our friends is dearer to us than you alone. Farewell most excellently. August 14, 1548. Greet on behalf of all of us your fellow ministers, including Pellican, Amian, Collin, and other worthy men.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Andreas Zebedee, a professor at the Lausanne school, handed me a bundle of letters, which contains several letters given to him by Calvin and others, which I will copy and send one or two to you, from which you will be able to understand what those disturbers think about the more sincere evangelical doctrine, which they themselves call Zwinglian.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. Make sure that we soon understand what you have decided. As for the letter concerning Apiarius, there is no need for you to be anxious; he expresses elegantly enough what he undertakes to express, and I, if it pleases you, will correct it with not at all negligent diligence.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a man conspicuous for his learning, morals, and integrity.</p>
