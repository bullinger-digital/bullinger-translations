      <p>Greetings. You rightly and fatherly advise us to be vigilant; for what evil is to be expected in the church from domestic dissensions is testified by history, and may God graciously avert it from us ever experiencing it! Recently, it was not possible to write what I felt, because I knew to whom I was giving the letters. This man is very suspicious, and not without reason; for among other things, he does not obscurely admit that the error concerning the sleep of souls is not so great that it can be counted among heretical opinions, since it is one of those for which the concord of the church should by no means be disrupted.</p>
      <p>If you share with us what response you received from them, you would do us a great favor; but whatever it may be, it will not prejudice the decree of our synod, and it would have been most advisable, as far as I can see, to have left this entire dispute intact to our churches; for such troublemakers, who wander outside the bounds, are neither to be helped in deed nor counsel, but either to be brought back to concord, if possible, or to be expelled with their own opinions. You know what struggles there were in the church long ago because some appealed to the Roman bishop. But we know into whose hands it has fallen, and we indeed congratulate ourselves on that account; yet the matter does not seem to be of such a good example. As for the other Clavenna matter, I discussed certain things with Mr. Balingget and understood that he easily acquiesced to my reasons. He asks you through me, and indeed earnestly, to deign to commend this cause to the most honorable Mr. Consul Tscharner by letter; for he himself also seems to favor the cause.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, however, a certain leading man of the opposing party from Clavenna was with me, the very one who is advocating the cause in the name of his people. He said that the people of Clavenna do not abhor an amicable settlement, but also wish to leave the entire matter intact to the ministers as arbitrators, if it seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>He added certain things to others, which did not seem unfair, namely, that they would go by the commissioners' ordinance and leave Franciscus Portus and all others, who are delaying their money in Clavenna, unburdened, likewise not imposing anything on the craftsmen, but asking for a reasonable acknowledgment from the tradesmen of the arbitrators' decision. Therefore, one might write directly to Mr. Tscharner on this opinion, that if it is not agreed upon here, then this means should be taken here in Chur.</p>
      <p>It seems to me it would be good if you proposed the middle way and asked the consul to help, so that something is also conceded to the tradesmen and the sum is moderated. And the essence of your writing would be that you ask the consul to help settle the matter amicably. This seems to me the most advisable; for I hear that if the strangers were to assert the matter by force, they would no longer be safe in Clavenna, etc., because of the agreement.</p>
      <p>I indeed, forgetting what is appropriate for me, prescribe these things; but since you commanded me to do so, you will forgive me for your humanity. I know your innumerable occupations and therefore reluctantly impose other burdens on you; but if there were so much leisure left from other business, I would wish that you would devote it to writing letters, in which you would commend our Eglinus to the brothers of the synod in at least six verses. You would write the letters when you have time; for if I have them by June 2nd, it is sufficient.</p>
      <p>You would ask the brothers to receive him and acknowledge him as their own as a man of proven life and doctrine, so that it does not go with him as it did with me; for the common recognition of the Three Leagues requires that no one be admitted to the synod or, as it is called here, the chapter, unless he has been previously heard and examined. Therefore, when I came, I was set aside; some wanted to hear me, some did not. Yet it was more so that a middle way was taken and the order was not broken, while others were to be examined, I was to be examined before all the chapter brothers.</p>
      <p>I understood this well; they heard and examined me with it, and although they did not quite agree with me, I did it with good will. Thus, I have remained an examiner since then, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this for Eglinus, etc. At first, I was not very welcome to many (now it is better); something similar might happen to Mr. Eglinus; yet he will not find the old man in the next, as happened to me, etc. As for new things, you should know plainly that there are none among us.</p>
      <p>What the pope is planning, because everything is now silent, is uncertain, except that we know this: the impious do not know how to rest like the Euripus. If anything is brought forth, I will write to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I am now very occupied with writing letters, by which I call the brothers to the synod. This burden falls on me alone because Mr. Philippus, being old, excuses himself from it, as he has long borne this burden himself. We must write to many communities that either have no pastors or appoint entirely godless, runaway people.</p>
      <p>I have recently come away from my studies; for when I want to take a book in hand, I must do otherwise. I often think of fleeing with Jonah; but since it cannot be otherwise, I know not what to do. These things suddenly.</p>
      <p>Some brothers also write to you, who commend to you the son of a good and honest man, Bernardinus, a minister of the church among us; he is so poor that he lives on water and black bread. If you were to contribute anything to his son, you would truly be doing an act of charity, and you would be contributing to the son of an honest man. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, most happily and for a long time with all yours. Chur, May 18, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
