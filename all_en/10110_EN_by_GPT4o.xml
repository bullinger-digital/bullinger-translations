      <p>Greetings. As the messenger was already prepared for the journey and I could no longer delay, I could not hide from you, dearest brother, what is being openly spread through all the surrounding villages, namely that the Five Places have approached the community of Glarus and have proposed to them, gathered from all the places or churches, how they demand from them to both keep the alliances and persist in the old religion with them, which they have not done so far, even though they have often promised. Nor is there any danger in this matter. For the people of Zurich have also promised that they will soon restore the former religion. In Bern, they hope for something similar. The people of Glarus, however, without giving any response, have amicably sent the envoys back, intending to respond soon after considering everything with mature counsel. These rumors are so certainly spread among us that nothing is more certain, but what your people have promised, many believe to be deception and lies, with which they want and can deceive and persuade the pious people of Glarus. I therefore beseech you to investigate among your people whether they are aware of this mission of the people of Uri. For as far as I am concerned and what they report about you, I have no faith at all. But so that I can more certainly silence the mouths of many, I beseech you, complete the response in three words. For your more prudent and best friends urge that they be made more certain by you.</p>
      <p>To your people of Bremgarten, 100 pounds of our currency have been given as a gift in counted money, and they certainly owe you a great deal. For I showed your letters to the consul and Hagius, the treasurer, and the others, who, having commiserated with the good men, also moved the rest. Sultzer has not yet returned. I will send back everything after Easter.</p>
      <p>Oh my Heinrich, how great is the danger to our republic! Wingarter was removed for fornication, then 5 others, and two are completely infirm and old. Therefore, it is necessary to add eight to the senate. There are many prudent old men and of some authority, but to whom the business of Christ is not easily entrusted. Then there are young men, indeed pious, but imprudent, greedy, and of no authority. Unless the Lord pours out His goodness upon us in the election of the magistrate, it will easily be over for us. Pray to God, and let your church pray for us. On the first of April, the election of those who choose the deacons and the senate takes place, the second election of the deacons, the sixth of the consul, the fourth of the pandareters, the seventh of the minor senate.</p>
      <p>Farewell now. Only this remains: Is it permissible to defend the brothers even with arms and to vindicate their cause, who are of another magistrate or place, with Christian charity unscathed.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>March 30, hastily.</p>
      <p>Do not leave me without an answer, by life. May you all be well.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bert. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
