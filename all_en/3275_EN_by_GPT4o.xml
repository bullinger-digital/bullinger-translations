      <p>Greetings. D. Rosetus has just explained to me the injuries inflicted on your city and the impending dangers. I can hardly express how much these things torment my mind.</p>
      <p>We must seek heavenly assistance and diligently implore Him who does not abandon those who call upon His name. I have no doubt about our own people.</p>
      <p>For I have just spoken with the consul, from whom I learned that your envoys will be heard in the senate tomorrow: I understood his willingness towards you and your cause. I cannot sufficiently marvel at the hardness of your neighbors.</p>
      <p>May the Lord soften their hearts.</p>
      <p>You could not have sent a more welcome book at this time than the one you sent.</p>
      <p>I thank you, lord and brother, for the labors undertaken for the common cause of all of us. Not everyone will be ungrateful to you, although some may seem not to fully appreciate the benefits also bestowed upon them. I greatly desire to read that book.</p>
      <p>For today I had business that I could not postpone to another time, and I sent your letters and the book to D. Martyr, begging him to return it for reading either tomorrow or the day after, while he himself enjoys it in the meantime.</p>
      <p>From the first few pages lightly inspected, I easily gather that you have acted with the utmost faith in the cause of Christ and ours concerning the Lord's Supper. But when I have read the book, I will write to you.</p>
      <p>Please send, I beseech you, the remaining pages. However much the adversaries may rage, the invincible truth will stand, for which I entirely believe that the utmost should be endured. In recent days I wrote to you about Beza's confession, which I beg you not to take in such a way as to add pain to pain. Indeed, I cannot speak otherwise, and the more I love Beza, the more I wish nothing of the sort had been published by him.</p>
      <p>If there were no danger, I would indeed remain silent. But I fear the adversaries will triumph from this: I fear the weaker will be greatly offended and the enemies will misuse that confession against us and the good cause. But we will commend this to the present time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, what to hope from those men, even if a conference is reached, I do not know, indeed I doubt more and more each day. For they write and say such things that you can expect nothing good from them.</p>
      <p>Now they are said to be in talks with the papists in Worms, and to be testing whether they can enter into concord with them. Which seems to me as possible as connecting light and darkness and mixing the law with the gospel. And I hear there are not a few who hope for some kind of concord.</p>
      <p>I prefer to be in harmony with Christ and pure truth and discordant with all these, than to agree with them and yield even a hair's breadth on matters of Christ. I fear some powerful people are seeking a mixture not to be entered into for the spirit but for the flesh. I pray the Lord to scatter the counsels of Ahithophel.</p>
      <p>There are those who think that King Zedekiah, I meant to say Ferdinand, did not seriously permit the conference, but to collect the greatest tribute from Germany under this pretext. Therefore, they think he will soon disrupt the conference, or if he does not disrupt it, he will ensure it does not have a successful outcome. This is certain, most excellent Calvin, that both the king and Augustus have most diligently guarded and requested from the imperial estates in all imperial diets that they neither agree with us nor tolerate the sacramentarians.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the kings have indeed dissimulated towards Lutheranism, which seemed more tolerable to them than our doctrine. And most evangelical princes have shunned us and our doctrine to remain in whatever favor of the kings. They still fear for themselves: nor will they tolerate us in any way, even if we confer a hundred times, unless we simply accept the Augsburg Confession and subscribe to it, and promise to teach according to it. Which I, for many serious reasons, can never promise, having learned most certainly, even from recesses and other arguments, how it was once composed, presented to the emperor, and received. Recently, while the most illustrious man John a Lasco had long and much conversation with Brentius, the prince finally revealed the mystery and explicitly said that he saw no remedy for this evil and dissension than if he himself accepted the Augsburg Confession, and that the church of foreigners should approve the same and conform all its matters to it. Behold, the prince spoke openly here and did not utter a proverb.</p>
      <p>The rest are of the same opinion as this. Of which I will not say more now.</p>
      <p>Would that we do not experience this very thing after laborious, costly, and dangerous conferences at some point.</p>
      <p>For these men are so constituted that unless you subscribe to them in all things, you are held suspect. From Italy, we hear that ten Swiss banners, which under the most wicked author the Bishop of Terracina, committed themselves to the pope's army on July 23, were cut down and nearly destroyed by M. Antonio de Colonna not far from Paliano.</p>
      <p>It is also said that a plague is corrupting many in the Guise army and that army is in great danger. Now several Swiss banners are again setting out to support the Guise army.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the cities and cantons are gravely at odds with each other. The Swiss not only do not want to give any soldiers to the king now, but they also renounce the alliance and recall soldiers from the French camps.</p>
      <p>The people of Claron, Basel, Schaffhausen, etc., also refuse soldiers.</p>
      <p>There are serious altercations among many.</p>
      <p>This is certain, we in Zurich would now have the gravest tumult if we had ever been connected by a treaty with the French. Now even the common people give thanks to the Lord.</p>
      <p>For we all fear graver things.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant peace and tranquility.</p>
      <p>The Swiss would have acted more wisely if they had renounced the treaty with the king while everything was still intact and safe, outside the king's danger.</p>
      <p>Now that the king is in grave danger, I do not know how prudently they act in what they do. (It is also said that the Turkish fleet is approaching Apulia to aid the French against Philip). D. Martyr, D. Gwalther, all the fellow ministers, my sons-in-law, and especially I, and your fellow ministers, our dearest brothers, send you greetings and invoke the Lord's blessing. Love us, dear brother, and let us diligently pray to the Lord to keep us in grave dangers. The one who offers you these letters, D. Antonius Schnebergerus, a very learned and pious man of Zurich and a student of medicine, born of good parents, has asked me to commend him to you, so that he may see you and converse with you. He is traveling to France for the sake of his studies.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you can help him anywhere and recommend him to learned and pious men, I ask you to conduct yourself towards him in such a way that he feels my recommendation was dear to you and useful to him. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man D. Johannes Calvin, faithful and vigilant pastor of the church of Geneva, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
