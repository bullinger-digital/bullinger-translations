      <p>S. D. Your scribe's son would have been a welcome guest to me; for I still remember the kindness and hospitality once shown to me by his father. But he has never come to me, not even at this hour; I have never seen him, nor has he delivered your letters to me. Today I hear that yesterday, after supper, he was playing among the Lyciscans; I hear that he is staying with Wellenberg; he has, therefore, those who treat him with dignity, so he does not need my help. Otherwise, I am ready to serve his father and all his family.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bernardinus wrote to me from England the same things that our dearest brother Mr. Johannes a Lasco announced to you, namely that the reformation of religion is proceeding beautifully, thanks to God. You undoubtedly know that on the 16th of January, around midnight, the king was almost intercepted by parricide; for the admiral, the brother of the protector, had plotted against the king's life. But the king was saved by divine kindness and protection.</p>
      <p>The traitor was thrown into chains and has undoubtedly already paid the penalty worthy of his crime. Thus, good men write to me.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is very foolish if he thinks that only four men remain in Germany who oppose his Interim. He judges Calvin correctly; he deserves eternal praise for opposing nefarious errors and impiety. I cannot say or judge anything about others, as I have seen nothing published against the Interim. But the Emperor does not know what the Lord says in the Gospel: "If these remain silent, the stones will cry out," and that today the statement is also true and will remain until the end: "I have left for myself 7000 men who have not bowed their knees to the Interim, I meant to say Baal, or Jeroboam." I am little concerned about the judgment of mathematicians; they are always mistaken.</p>
      <p>However, I know that He lives in heaven who will defeat this hydra. What I wrote about the people of Constance, I sent to Basel for you through Gaspar Mesikomer. I am surprised if he has betrayed our trust, as he is otherwise faithful.</p>
      <p>In summary: The people of Constance are troubled about the guilds, the goods of the guilds, about faith, and about everything together; they must be hereditary Austrians and accept the papacy again. No one should yield until all complaints are resolved. Farewell. Here you have the Decades of Sermons II; they have been the reason why I have not written to you more frequently until now. March 7, 1549. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>A good fellow gave me the Lord's Prayer, which I am writing down for you; it is said to have been made in Constance, joyfully by the imperialists.</p>
      <p>Trust God, they will gain little with the blasphemy: Our Father, MÃ¼lhausen is ours; who art, Basel is also ours; in heaven, before Schaffhausen, we shall succeed. Hallowed be thy name, Zurich must also be included.</p>
      <p>Thy kingdom come, Bern and all its like. Thy will be done, we are not yet greedy; on earth, Schwyz shall also be ours, as in heaven, it is planned that we shall overthrow Chur and other Confederates, the small and the great, without sword stroke with rent and gifts. See, what a merry, lame bunch they are. One should conclude the miserable rhymes thus: This should be stamped as a jest on an old hag's backside.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful minister of the church of Basel, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
