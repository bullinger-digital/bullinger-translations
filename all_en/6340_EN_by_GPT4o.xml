      <p> This entire week I am completely exhausted by the frequency of sermons. Added to this are countless troubles and concerns. Now the business of the kings is being conducted with all our might. I would never have believed that the Spaniard had taken such deep roots; certainly, he can hardly be removed despite all the efforts and expenses, and yet I hope we will prevail after many and long-lasting difficulties. Here in Chur, last Sunday, December 24th, it was announced; there was a unanimous decision to renew the alliance with the French, and they want nothing of Philipp here. It would have been very easy to raise, all the lords being idle. Thereupon, the Philippians practiced vigorously, after they sensed the displeasure. But their practice was noticed; for even those who brought them into the country, who lead all their affairs, are shouting: [All the lords are idle.] You understand the essence. What is being discussed elsewhere, I cannot know. In Davos, I hope it will go well; for there Tobias does his best. In the Engadin, people are very restless; there and in Bergell, the Philippian practice is strong. </p>
