    <p xml:id="regest1">As [Regula Meier?], the wife of the former pastor of Stammheim, Lorenz Agricola [Meyer], returns to her husband via Konstanz, Bullinger takes this opportunity to lend Blarer a letter from Vadian with news about the concluded peace [of Crépy] between [Francis I] and [Charles V]. The synod held the previous day went well and in a unanimous spirit. In the name of Hans Rudolf Lavater, the treasurer of Zürich, Bullinger asks Blarer to write to one of his friends in Augsburg to inquire about Lavater's son Felix; the latter is said to have been seriously injured in the thigh; he should be financially assisted if necessary to ensure the best care; the father intends to reimburse the incurred costs.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Since this woman, the wife of the late pastor of Stammheim, Lorenz Agricola, was returning to her husband via Konstanz, I could not refrain from sharing with you the news of the peace concluded between the Emperor and the French, which I received from Vadian; for our people have neither heard nor received anything else in the meantime. Return the letter after reading; when I have more certain information, I will provide it. Regarding the Swiss soldiers who have set out against the English, even the people of Lucerne have no news yet; if you have received anything credible, please let me know, I pray.</p>
      <p>We held a synod yesterday, and all matters are well, thanks to Christ; there is the highest consensus among us in all things. May Christ be with us always by His grace; pray for us to the Lord as well!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is my very friendly request to you, that you would do this service for me and especially for my dear lord and godfather Hans Rudolf Lavater, the treasurer. He has a son in Augsburg; he is a saddler, a journeyman; his name is Felix Lavater from Zürich; he has heard from some people that he has suffered a serious or bad injury to his thigh and is lying sick; the priest also says it is dangerous, etc. Since you have many good lords and friends in Augsburg, it is our very friendly request that you write to one of them whom you trust well, and ask him to inquire about the boy and take care of him, especially to help ensure that the injury, as much as possible and pleasing to God, does not become greater. He will honestly pay what it costs, and willingly acknowledge the friendship and service.</p>
      <p>God be with you. October 22, 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Ambrosius Blarer, incomparable brother.</p>
