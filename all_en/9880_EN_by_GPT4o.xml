      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, the courier from Geneva passed through here, who also brought me letters from Mr. Beza, from which I understood that he is sending you a copy of his writing against that Saxon synod, which he calls "robber-like." He gives us hope that on the return of the messenger, we too will be able to inspect it, which will be pleasing to us. In the meantime, we also wish to see what you have written against Schmidelin.</p>
      <p>This fate of the church is indeed lamentable; but since it cannot be otherwise due to the injuries and intemperance of these people, it is better to choose to defend the truth bravely than to abandon it disgracefully. The ecclesiastical senators of Heidelberg have written to us, but they refer only briefly to what they have written to you and discussed with you. They seem to be in labor with some grand matters; if Beza's letters are to be believed, this plan originates from the Landgrave. We have not yet responded to them, as it seems you have already sufficiently answered them, nor have we reported anything about these matters to our senate, as we usually do and should; for it seems to us that this matter is still too unformed to be shown or displayed in such places and assemblies. Your response is approved by us; in the meantime, we believe it is absolutely necessary to be cautious, lest we be led away under the guise of these synods, whether universal or national, from the simplicity of doctrine and rites and other matters, the change of which many have long sought with various efforts. The work we are engaged in is the Lord's, and it has not lacked its successes so far, as long as we have given ourselves to be governed and guided by Him, relying on no human help or agreement. Therefore, I fear that if we reject that trust and simplicity and rely too much on human plans and schemes, the Lord will confound us. Regarding French matters, since I do not doubt that Mr. Beza writes extensively, as he also writes some things to me, there is nothing for me to report. What happens privately among us, I usually write to my brother, who will communicate it to you. As for my health, I seem to be well, at least I can use and write with my right hand again; for several weeks I was forced to do without it, except with pain; now my left hand hurts, and I fear that the illness may settle in my feet again. In the meantime, may the Lord's will be done, to whom belong both hands and feet and all things; may He grant patience and constancy; blessed be His name! Hagenberg is suffering universally, that is, in all his limbs. The lords consuls, treasurers, Zerkintae, brothers, and all friends greet you and wish you good health and all good things.</p>
      <p>In Bern, at the close of January 1575. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, chief pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot and relative.</p>
