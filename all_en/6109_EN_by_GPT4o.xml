      <p>Greetings. Your diligence accuses me of sin; for a long time ago I received the description of the Muscovite or Polish battle from Augsburg and did not share it. I am sending back your description and I thank you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is written to me that the churches will soon send a delegate from Krakow to us and to the Genevans regarding various questions (I am pleased, but it is a lot of work for me, which otherwise prepares me for many other tasks) and that the Muscovites have received support from the Tatars with 30,000 horsemen and are preparing for a new battle, etc.</p>
      <p>Many and astonishing prodigies from the sky appear everywhere in Poland, etc. May the Lord have mercy on us and on them.</p>
      <p>The assembly has begun in Baden; but I have nothing certain yet about the Clarens cause; many predict bad omens; I wish the matter would turn out better than it has so far. If we are to atone and be ruined, there are good means for it.</p>
      <p>The pride and arrogance [of those people] ascend to heaven; there is no end to their threats. Perhaps Vergerius has reached you; he diligently inquired what the envoy of Philip had done among the Rhaetians; I explained the matter to him as faithfully as I could. You will hear more from him; he seems to be already losing his mind and almost acting like a child.</p>
      <p>The book of Brentius has been returned to me, vast and bitter, perplexed and most maliciously written, etc. My affairs grow by the hour, and my strength decreases.</p>
      <p>But it has seemed good to God my Father, who, if He is with me by His grace, I ask for nothing more in the world. Otherwise, I have not been very strong for 8 days, being able to do nothing at all, and my weakness greatly hinders me in all my matters.</p>
      <p>But it pleases the Lord, and so it pleases me, etc. From Frankfurt, I have never had more leisure; few letters, scarcely 10 or 12, have been brought; for because of the plague, few have come. But it has subsided there; the school has also returned to Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>The German princes have issued a document stating the reasons why they do not want to accept the Council of Trent, in German, etc. In your last letters, you write true riddles; I have never seen the Count of Helfenstein, and he has set out for Rome with a large retinue, etc., nor did he come to Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 14, 1564.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
