    <p xml:id="regest1">On March 12, the princes and electors presented to the imperial cities that they would declare themselves as enemies of [Francis I] and support the Emperor [Charles V] in the fight against him with offensive aid, as well as being ready to provide defensive aid in Hungary. Blarer is still unaware of the reaction of the [imperial] cities, but they will surely agree with the princes; the devastating consequences for Germany are foreseeable; writes confidentially, as [Zurich] must also weigh its behavior. Greetings.</p>

      <p>On the 12th day of March, the electors and princes sent the envoys of all the cities to Speyer at the Imperial Diet and presented to them how they have decided that, if it pleases His Imperial Majesty, they will openly declare themselves against the French, and also offer His Majesty offensive aid against him and in Hungary defensive aid for the fortification of castles, cities, and fortresses.</p>
      <p>However, what the cities have agreed to or not is still unknown to us; for our envoy departed from Speyer during the same deliberation.</p>
      <p>Yet it is to be presumed, given the state and situation of all things, that they will also join in such a decision and not oppose the electors and princes. What will now follow from such a decision and what everyone should consider in this matter, every reasonably intelligent person can easily assess. In summary: Our Germany must also endure, be ruined and devastated, unless we turn to God with all our hearts. I wanted to inform you of this in confidence; for yours also have to consider well how they conduct themselves in everything, so that they do not err anywhere and fall into difficulties, about which it is not appropriate for me to write; you will surely know how to act rightly.</p>
      <p>Give my kind regards and many greetings to my dear lord Mayor RÃ¶sten, his son and daughter, and always keep us in your prayers before God and in temporal matters.</p>
      <p>Given on the 21st of March in the year 1544.</p>
