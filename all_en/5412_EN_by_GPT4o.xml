      <p>Grace and peace be multiplied, most honorable man and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>For a long time, my mind has been eager to visit you with my writings; but the lack of a messenger was the reason I could not do so. Therefore, having finally found a messenger who would make the journey there (but now already wearing his traveling shoes and contemplating departure), I hastily took up my pen and wrote this note, in which, due to the shortness of time, I cannot fully inform you of the state of my affairs. However, I especially want you to know that I have been a preacher of the divine word for some time in Holland, which is my homeland.</p>
      <p>But since I abstained from the abominations of the masses and openly criticized certain abuses, I offended many, who eventually reported me to the Bishop of Utrecht. He thought he could deter me with threatening letters.</p>
      <p>But since I, beyond my age (for I am only twenty-eight years old), continued vigorously to declaim against idolatry and the profanation of the Lord's Supper, I exasperated their minds, and they became so inflamed with hatred against me that they would have apprehended me without the order of the Holland court, had not friends, who were a good part of the people, informed me of their plan and advised me to save myself by flight, which I obeyed. Now, truly, being in exile and misery and lacking counsel, I implore your help and advice and also trust that you will not fail me, still a recruit in the Christian militia, because you must remember not only the law of brotherly love but also the common nature, by which we are born not only for ourselves but also for others. I have some knowledge of your language, as I once lived in Basel.</p>
      <p>Again and again, I would like to ask you not to disdain to write back to me through your merchants who go to the Frankfurt fairs, advising me on what I should do; for I abhor the crudeness of the Lutherans and can hardly live among them without offending my conscience. But the messenger is calling for the letters; otherwise, we would discuss more extensively either by letters or in person. Hastily, on the 4th of August, in the house of Cornelius Rhetius, licentiate in Cologne.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Cornelius Both of Alkmaar. To the most learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant superintendent of the Church of Zurich and my esteemed teacher. To Zurich.</p>
