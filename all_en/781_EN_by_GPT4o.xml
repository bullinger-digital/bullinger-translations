      <p>Greetings from God through Christ, etc. Until now, I have believed in the words of Christ: first seek the kingdom of God, and all things will be added to you. Meanwhile, nothing can harm a man like pastors seeking the Lord from the flock. Otherwise, on the 5th day of the week, it happened to me during the sermon; for I was once struck by the cold and suffering... sipeliaca, that I am concerned it might not be possible for me to preach the 39th passion. May the Lord's will be done. It has attacked me severely, but I hope the fever has subsided; for my mouth is broken out both inside and outside, also the nose. The redness is remarkable, it has broken out into swelling, it runs a lot; I don't know what will come of it. If Master H. has advice, I will let it be for another 14 days. If it doesn't stop, I will (if I can) go to him, etc. I suffer unbearable pains.</p>
      <p>You have done a pleasing work with the granted book, which I will faithfully and immaculately return to its master after I have read it. I will be diligent in my work, as much as my weakness allows.</p>
      <p>There are 3 prisoners lying here because of your sake this winter; if you do not come soon, they will be too difficult for me. One is so stubborn, that he must be forced in with violence; if you cannot come shortly, I will send him to you; you can do with him as you see fit. Farewell and greet the family.</p>
      <p>All sympathize; no one helps.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
