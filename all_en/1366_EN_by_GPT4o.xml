      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
      <p>Most esteemed brother, in these days the venerable man Lord Celsus de Martinengis, of the most noble Venetian counts, has come to us, made an exile for Christ, but a citizen of the saints, a man, I say, as fervent in the spirit of God as he is noble in his refined manners, seeking to visit the assemblies of our homeland soon to be celebrated. But when he felt it was being delayed, he was weary of wasting time uselessly; he conceived in his mind to visit Zürich in the meantime for the sake of the distinguished brothers, known far and wide by their praiseworthy reputation (though not by face).</p>
      <p>Indeed, led by Christian affection, he desired to speak to them and undertook this journey; but since the name of Bullinger was especially dear to his heart, he asked me to write to your charity, so that he would not rashly and without cause distract such a man from his study and other affairs. Therefore, you should not disdain to humbly receive the recommendation of such a man from a humble brother and to consider it kindly, and, as you always do laudably, to treat him in a Christian manner. Once the assemblies are concluded, I will write to you whatever news I can have. The bearer of this letter knows how to report precisely the current news from Italy. Farewell. From the Court of Rhaetia, the fifth of August, 51. Philipp Gallitz, my colleague, wishes you and all your fellow ministers very well.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zürich, a lord and brother to be greatly respected.</p>
