      <p>On April 18th, Bucer came to Schaffhausen and visited me. At first sight, I could not recognize him, as his face was unknown to me. However, while we were discussing Luther's furious letters and he was trying to excuse Luther somewhat, I began to suspect that he was Bucer. I asked where they were coming from or going to, as he had an Italian companion, a very learned and eloquent man. They replied that they had come to see me and to understand the progress of our church, and for that reason, they would travel to Konstanz, St. Gallen, Zurich, and Bern, so that they could inform the other brothers in Strasbourg, who had sent them, and if there were brothers to whom faith could be safely entrusted, to call them. They had things to explain to us. On April 20th, I called some from the Schaffhausen area. For on that day, because it was Sunday and a holiday, he held two sermons to the people. After the second, we met together except for Benedict, whom he did not want to attend, lest he perhaps interpret the matter unfavorably and seize the opportunity of his former error. At the beginning, he excused himself from the infamy with which he might perhaps be noted, as if he conceded more to Luther after the death of Zwingli and Oecolampadius than was conceded by them while they were alive. In this matter, he declared his innocence, and it would not happen that he would yield even a nail's breadth in which Zwingli and Oecolampadius had not yielded. Secondly, although Luther maintained his firmness to the extent that he handed over the brothers more than was due to Satan, he nevertheless urged that we should not denounce him from the pulpit. Thirdly, he reviewed his opinion on the Lord's Supper, which we could not perceive to be different from ours. Therefore, I wrote this to you so that you may observe it more cautiously. If there was anything foreign that my simplicity could not grasp, I beg you to inform me. On the 21st, he left again, and he will be with you in Zurich on the first of May.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beg you to inform me about the affairs of the people of Zurich with the Five Cantons and what is to be hoped for.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, April 26, 1533.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned gentleman, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear ---</p>
