      <p>What you requested from me through letters and from Mr. Wroth some time ago, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, that this young man might have some honorable position in the court of our queen, has been diligently attended to by us, if not entirely to his satisfaction, at least as circumstances and our times have allowed. Now, as his longing for his homeland calls him back, I have decided to write these few things to you, so that you may understand and be assured that neither the length of time nor the distance of places can diminish my zeal, duty, and respect towards you, let alone erase or obliterate them.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Bernardino, and Mr. Gwalter, whom I name out of respect, I ask you to greet most warmly on my behalf. May our Lord Jesus Christ wish you to be safe and remain for a very long time to your flock. London, June 14, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Antony Cooke. To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed pastor of the church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
