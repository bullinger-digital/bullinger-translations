    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends his response to [Johannes] Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“] and requests an open opinion; he wrote the work in 14 weeks and defends the common cause. Blarer should send a copy to [Martin] Frecht in Ulm and ask him to deliver another copy along with an accompanying letter [No. 1870] to Cochläus; he does not want his work to be accessible to the public before the concerned party has received a copy (as happened to him with Cochläus’ writing). He is not afraid, but desires an open confrontation, also for the praise of God and the welfare of the Church. Blarer should pray for him; greetings.</p>

      <p>G[reetings]. Receive here, Ambrosius, dearest brother, what I have replied to Cochläus, and judge freely and advise your brother most freely. I wrote these within almost 14 weeks in spare hours. I defended the common cause, and would that it be with great benefit! What I have enclosed with this, please ensure it is carefully delivered to Ulm to Frecht. I gift him a copy; but I also send the letters I wrote to Cochläus along with the copy, asking that he ensures with good faith that they are delivered to Cochläus. I do not want the response to wander through everyone's hands before it reaches the one to whom it most pertains. I do not wish to imitate the example of him who writes to me and publishes a booklet, but does not send it. Nor do I fear the best cause in the slightest. I wish to act and engage openly and in the light of day, and I do act and engage. If he continues to respond, I will not throw away my shield, provided I think it will lead to the glory of God and the salvation of the churches. I can say no more now.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me. Dangers and temptations are everywhere; but the Lord will deliver from these. Farewell with your most illustrious brother, Zwick, and the others. March 14, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, incomparable friend, honorable and always dearest brother.</p>
