      <p>Greetings in Christ, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger and dearest brother in Christ. I thank you for writing to me privately in addition to those common letters; but there is no need for you to thank me so diligently for making honorable mention of you as often as I do, and not unwillingly. I do this because of your merit, as I am not unaware of how much you have benefited the church with your ministry and writings, and you continue to do so. I also owe you this privately, that more or less twenty years ago, I was first stirred by reading your book "On the Origin of Error" to embrace the true opinion on the Lord's Supper, when previously I had been devoted to Luther; it is therefore right that I honor him through whom I have made progress.</p>
      <p>I wanted to respond briefly to your letters, which were most welcome to me. In Scotland, the churches are in a somewhat better condition than when I last wrote to you; but the Queen of Scotland herself does not change her opinion. Last December, her firstborn son was baptized in the papist manner by a certain mitred pseudo-bishop. But out of the entire nobility of that kingdom, only two were found who deemed it worthy to attend the baptism; the others only accompanied the infant to the chapel doors as he went and returned. What is happening in Brabant and Flanders, I know you are not unaware of; I hope heavenly aid will not be lacking to them, after they seem to be largely deprived of human support, especially if the King of Spain comes with an army, (which we fear,) to oppress them.</p>
      <p>I pray that you greet Mr. Gwalter and your other colleagues in my name. May the Lord preserve you!</p>
      <p>London, 8th February 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother in the Lord. In Zurich.</p>
