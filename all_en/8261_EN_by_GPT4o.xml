      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand. Dear sir and brother, since the printer is a decent man, as you wrote to me, my lords of Chur are right to reprimand him. The necessity requires it. And even if he gives good words, he is not to be trusted at all, as he has shown himself so far. I have informed Froschauer of the matter; he sends you greetings and kindly asks you to report to us next Friday on how things have gone with him. I understand well that the printer is indeed indebted to him. [There] you might speak with Mr. Pontesella, [if he has Fro]schauer's account, if an incident [from the] printer occurs, that he advises and helps [him], so that he does not lose his due; since he gave him books. He will also send a messenger up as soon as he learns how his affairs are arranged; he asks you to do the best with him, etc.</p>
      <p>The merchants from St. Gallen passed through here on Tuesday, indicating that the admiral had moved up with both princes into the Dauphin√©, but Montpellier had not been taken by him. Not far from there, Mr. de Lova, an admiral's man, was attacked by royalists at night, killed, along with 3 companies of infantry and several cavalry. They confirm what I wrote in the last letter about Mr. de Gordes. The admiral is much stronger than ever, has great support. He is besieging the city of Saint-Esprit. It is also said that he has already taken it, etc. From Bern, my lord bailiff writes to me on May 9th, that on May 4th, those from Bern made a pact for 20 years with the Duke of Savoy; he also accepted an agreement with the city of Geneva for 23 years, that all matters and grievances are settled and resolved. Praise and thanks be to God! May He preserve you and your house in His grace!</p>
      <p>Greet for me my lord mayors, Carolus, Pontesella, Ganthner, Boneth, and other good gentlemen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, May 12, 1570.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur, my gracious lord and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
