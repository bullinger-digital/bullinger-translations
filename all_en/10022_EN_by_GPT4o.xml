      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>That you so kindly encourage me, indeed urge me, dearest brother in Christ, to read certain booklets of Tertullian translated by you, I will not be reluctant to comply with your request, provided that you allow it to be done in due time, for it is not possible immediately. However, who am I, my brother, whom you choose as a judge in such a matter? You seem to know what you are doing, for I do not shirk the duty of a Christian man. Therefore, be assured that I will deny you nothing that I perceive to be beneficial either to your own or to the public benefit of all Christians.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From ZÃ¼rich, 15th of November, 1524.</p>
      <p>Yours, Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To the young man of great promise, Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in Christ.</p>
