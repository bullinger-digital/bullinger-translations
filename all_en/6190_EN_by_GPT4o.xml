      <p>Your letters, reverend father in Christ, were delivered to me not quite promptly, but in good faith. I had nothing to write, as I had nothing to say; I write this at least so that you understand that yours have been delivered, and also, if you wanted to write to Solothurn, you would have a reliable person here who is traveling there and comes directly from Venice, where Mr. de Bellieure had sent him.</p>
      <p>Some of ours are coming from the Adige, among them the banner master from Ilanz, indicating that Hannibal von Ems is marching towards Genoa; there, one knows nothing else than that Spaniards are coming to him, and they are supposed to board ships at Nice and march together against Geneva. It seems to sound the same everywhere.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Germany to the Adige and to us indicate that new troops are being raised in Styria and Swabia. Whether this is so, I do not affirm, but I write so that, if it is also reported from elsewhere, you can compare. For the rest of the news, I give eternal thanks.</p>
      <p>But what is reported from France terrifies me.</p>
      <p>But our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. It is certain that not only our own wounds will bleed, but also the enemy's blood will flow, and it is to be hoped that the calamity of war will eventually fall back on those who initiate the slaughter against us. But our sins terrify me and the disorder of all things.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Lord must be asked not to rebuke us in His anger. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and for as long as possible. Chur, July 10, 1564. In great haste.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
