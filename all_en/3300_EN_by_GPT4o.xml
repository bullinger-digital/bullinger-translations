      <p>Greetings. I write to you rarely, indeed not at all for a long time now, because I know that you are often informed about our affairs by the letters of both our Beza and Mr. Calvin, to which I have nothing to add.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the state of our churches is such that hardly anything occurs whose mere mention does not bring sorrow to pious minds. I truly do not know what kind of churches we will eventually have if things continue this way, as we can hardly retain any semblance of them now, so that nothing is seen everywhere except the face of an angry God against us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be gracious to us and to His church. I suppose you have heard about the death of the excellent pastor of the Italian church gathered in Geneva, in whose place Mr. Peter Martyr has been elected by the same church, for which reason this messenger and envoy is coming to you.</p>
      <p>He asked me, in the name of the brothers by whom he is sent, to add my letters to those of Mr. Calvin, which he wrote to you for this reason, to which I willingly complied, although I thought my intercession was not much needed. Nevertheless, I wrote to ask you, along with others, not only not to dissuade Mr. Martyr from accepting the position, but also to encourage him to acquiesce to such a holy calling and to assist his afflicted and troubled church of his nation, to which he owes more than to others, for many reasons. All the brothers and fellow ministers send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>I wish you all to be safe and sound: especially Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Gwalther, and other friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellently and for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, September 4.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected.</p>
