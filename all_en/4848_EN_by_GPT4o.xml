      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on June 12 and I have no doubt that what I recently wrote has reached you. Regarding France, I can write nothing except that some are too anxious because the Pope wants to incite all the princes into the kingdom, as he is preparing for a national council and persists in it, nor to buy lead so dearly. The King will not enter Paris before the month of January.</p>
      <p>The Queen of England is marrying Lord Robert and did not want to admit the Pope's envoys into her territories, who wished to invite her to the council. In Metz and some other cities, temples have been permitted for preaching the gospel and the free administration of the sacraments. Within nine or ten days, I will be in Baden.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Val d'Annone, I hear they are steadfast and cause more trouble than they receive.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, June 10.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
