      <p>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Since I now have a convenient messenger, I could not refrain from informing you about my affairs, or rather the church's, or rather Christ's, I say, and your own, and to repeat everything from the beginning, know that after we departed from you, we came directly to Chur, and because here around the assembly neither public nor private matters were conducted at all due to the discord of the Upper League, which could not agree with others, we immediately returned home. But what happened: four or five days later, we were informed by very reliable messengers that a general diet, as they say, had been proclaimed. It seemed good to the brothers that I should again come to the assembly for the brothers and the church. I, not sparing the labor nor weary of the journey, which is very harsh, came again. Again I encountered the same discord; and, what is more: we lack everything, people abandon the gospel and, alas! while they promise safe and free habitation to murderers and exiles for their crimes, they want us, who are exiled for Christ, to be completely cast out and expelled. And if the lords wanted this (though we are still uncertain of their counsel and will), we would bear it with an even mind; but the subjects (as they say) do this against us, indeed all the devils and Satan are working for the destruction of the gospel. But we will say with Tertullian: "Christ is stronger to protect us than the lawyer to attack, let alone to conquer." As for me, I await with a joyful mind the sentence of the lord to be pronounced by this legitimate magistrate. I say with David: "If I find favor in your eyes, you will bring me back and grant me free habitation; but if you say: you do not please me, I am ready." "Let him do what is good in his eyes; he is the lord," another said. As soon as my affairs have reached that end which the lord has appointed for them from eternity, but which has not yet been revealed to us; therefore we must always and without ceasing pray that the lord's will be done, I will immediately inform you of everything, as my dearest brother. As for you, pray earnestly with your church to God through Christ, that he may help us in our tribulations; for he has promised us through David, saying: "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me," and: "Where two or three are gathered" etc. - Regarding my books, please tell Frisius to inform the bookseller not to send them to me until I make you aware of these matters, because perhaps I will not be able to remain in the Three Leagues; so much does Satan rage against me. I also ask you to be willing to ask the host, whose sign is the stork, to take care of my money as soon as the river has subsided. Gwalther and Frisius will inform you of everything. I will give him for his labor whatever you please, even if you decide that I should give him half or a third part; I leave that business to you. In other matters, I am entirely yours, because you are also Christ's. In my name, greet Bibliander, Pellican, Frisius, Gessner, and all good men. May the Lord through Christ keep you safe for a long time for his church. Amen. All good men send you greetings and best wishes. From Chur, the day before the calends of September, in the year of our salvation 1551. I would like to share this with the good men greeted by me in letters; for I could not write more both because of business and especially because of the messenger. Again: May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Celso Martinengo.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and faithful minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered lord.</p>
