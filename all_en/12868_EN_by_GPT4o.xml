    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger should not be surprised that Claudius does not write, even though he has messengers at his disposal. He has nothing worth reading to communicate and does not want to waste Bullinger's time with his confused letters, as he already has so much to do.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hieronymus Sailer, Claudius' employer, conveys that he has not received Bullinger's letter from February 4th and has received the silver coin with the image of Christ. Francisco de Enzinas will have already conveyed Sailer's thanks. However, the latter would like to emphasize that the goodwill shown to him touches him even more than the valuable gift itself!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is hardly anything to report, except that today news came from Antwerp that Emperor Charles V has dismissed the pious, elderly Archbishop Hermann of Wied of Cologne, stripped him of his electoral dignity, and appointed a canon named Adolf of Schaumburg in his place, who was enthusiastically received by the Cologne clergy. The Archbishop is said not to have resisted and merely stated that he was probably not suited for the administration of this church province and therefore willingly handed over his position to another.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Dukes Christoph and Ulrich of Württemberg are said to have sold their lands to King Francis I of France. Sailer would like to know if Bullinger has any confirmed information about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enclosed, Sailer transmits a letter from Augsburg. In it, the relationship between the Emperor and Pope Paul III is clearly visible. May the news be true! Since the Emperor can now exercise his power in Germany and is already dealing with religious matters, it is feared [from the Pope's perspective] that he will not keep the promise given to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [Enclosure:] On February 2nd, the Emperor received the papal envoy [Girolamo Verallo]. He presented him with the following three reproaches from the Pope:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Firstly, the Pope is surprised that Verallo is so rarely admitted to a conversation with the Emperor and is only received by Nicolas Perrenot, the Lord of Granvelle. The Emperor gave various reasons for this, including his countless difficulties with enemies and his poor health. Therefore, he thought it would suffice if Verallo communicated the Pope's matters to his council [Granvelle]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Secondly, the Pope is surprised that he is not mentioned at all by the Emperor in the pardon of the German cities, even though he has been so helpful to him (as if the Pope wanted to possess these cities together with the Emperor!). The Emperor then asked, laughing, whether the Pope had included him in the alliance with the Swiss Confederates? Moreover, he said that the Pope had no reason to complain because he had not forgotten the religious matter at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Thirdly, the Pope cannot understand why the Emperor has not sent home the glorious Italian army and instead keeps them in this cold. The Emperor replied: If Verallo had intended to speak with him about the furlough of the Italians a few days ago, he regrets not having received him immediately. He would have dismissed the Italians right away! Verallo knows what havoc they caused during the war! The next day, the Emperor summoned the Italian captains to him and dismissed them all. It was astonishing to see how much the Emperor rejoiced over this dismissal. He must be very upset with the Pope. From Augsburg, February 15th.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your kindness will not be surprised that I write nothing to you privately, especially with such an opportunity of messengers. But your kindness will forgive me, because I have nothing worthy to offer to you, such a great man. I am also deterred by the fact that you are overwhelmed with such a great burden of affairs in these times, that I think little time remains for you to read my disordered writings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What I am now writing, I have been ordered to draft in the name of my lord. He received your letters sent on February 4th along with the enclosed silver coin representing the image of Jesus. And because through Mr. Francisco de Enzinas he ordered to give you great thanks, however, so that you may know that it was accepted by him not so much for its magnitude and excellence as for the grateful spirit of the giver, he orders me to thank you again with a reminder of his utmost goodwill towards you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And wishing to write something new to you, nothing truly worthy of mention came to mind, except that today it was reported from Antwerp that the Emperor has dismissed the venerable and most pious man, Archbishop Hermann of Wied of Cologne, from his bishopric and electoral function, and has substituted in his place a certain coadjutor canon named Adolf of Schaumburg, who a few days ago entered Cologne and was received with great applause by the people of Cologne. This venerable old man spoke nothing against it except that he was entirely unfit and insufficient for the administration of this church and republic, and thus willingly gave place to another.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, there is a rumor here that the younger and elder Duke of Württemberg have sold all their regions and cities to the King of France for a certain price. If you have any more certain information about these matters or others, my lord asks to be informed in turn at the next opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My lord sends you a copy of letters from Augsburg, sent by I know not whom, in which you will read how it is agreed between the Emperor and the Pope, if indeed these letters are to be believed. But since he has already exercised tyranny and begun to encroach upon religion, it is to be feared that, once matters in Germany are settled for a while, he will not keep the faith he gave to the same Pope. To the most illustrious and distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his most esteemed lord. From Zurich.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor received the papal envoy on the second of February, when he said he would propose three things to the Emperor:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>First, the Pope is very surprised, because his envoy is so rarely given access to the Emperor or the opportunity to converse, especially when he recounts many places where the Emperor referred him to Granvelle. Here the Emperor responded, how he was hindered in this or that place, how much business was imposed on him by enemies, how he was not always in good health, and many such things, so that in conclusion he thought it would be enough if the papal envoy communicated his matters to his council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Secondly, the Pope is very surprised, because, although the Emperor received such great assistance from him, he made no mention of him in the acceptance of the German cities, as if he wanted to have them in common with the Emperor. The Emperor laughed and asked how diligently he had included him in the Swiss Confederation, and thought that the Pope had no reason to murmur about such a thing, since he should be occupied with those matters that pertain to religion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Thirdly, the Pope wondered why he kept such strong soldiers and the glory of this world, the Italian army, in this cold for so long and did not rather send them back to Italy. The Emperor said: "If, my envoy, you had wished to approach me a few days ago to request leave for your soldiers, I truly regret that it was not granted to you, so that I might have sent back those who hindered my victory more than they helped! For you know, he said, what great evils they were the authors of!" And so the next day, the Emperor summoned the captains of the soldiers and ordered them to leave. And it is astonishing how much the Emperor rejoiced to be free from them, so much so that I gather from many arguments that the Emperor's mind is very much embittered against the Pope. From Augsburg, February 15th. Yours, Claudius.</p>
