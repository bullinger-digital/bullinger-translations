      <p>Greetings in Christ, brother. I received your letter, which was most welcome to me for many reasons, written on March 12th, at the end of May; from which I understand that you have not yet received the booklets printed here, which you wrote most learnedly and piously against the papal bull.</p>
      <p>I indeed sent to the autumn Frankfurt fair both letters and four books, and a small amount of money for your use and that of our Julius.</p>
      <p>I understand that the money was delivered, but it has been indicated that the letters and books are still stuck on the way.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am sending a few copies again, which you may use if you have not received the others.</p>
      <p>As for the news you write, may the best and greatest God turn everything to our advantage and to the glory of His name! It is pleasing to us that your churches are at peace, not without the addition of other churches to the sincere profession of the Christian religion. When I have the opportunity to meet with Her Majesty, I will not forget to declare to her how much you pursue her with zeal and goodwill.</p>
      <p>She was greatly pleased with your booklet against the papal nonsense, which she read very eagerly, as I indicated in previous letters, not yet delivered to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Turkish war, I only say this: "Your own affairs are at stake when your neighbor's wall is on fire."</p>
      <p>So far, the Antichrist has been the Pope: if the Lord wishes to raise another, namely the Turk, our sins deserve it. Our affairs are as follows. The Duke of Norfolk, who had most wickedly plotted against our Queen, was justly punished. Mary, the former Queen of Scots, is publicly declared an enemy of our kingdom and Queen, and is carefully kept in prison: she indeed was plotting in every way the destruction of our kingdom, the extermination of our Queen, and the subversion of our religion.</p>
      <p>Regarding your nephew Zwingli, I prefer to say little rather than much with sorrow. The affairs of mortals are governed not by our will, but by divine providence.</p>
      <p>The condition of Rudolf is far happier, although the affection of the flesh foolishly opposes it. In the end, what cannot be avoided must be endured, not blamed. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe with us for a long time, most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>From my house in Holborn, London, June 6, 1572. Yours most devotedly, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>I intended to send the booklets to you; but our messenger here willingly carries letters, not parcels. The books must be sent to the next Frankfurt fair, if possible.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed brother in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
