    <p xml:id="regest1">The embassy to France [in May] brought about with the help of Bullinger and all the pious [in favor of the Waldensians] will bear no fruit if one does not advocate again for the [Waldensians]. The pensioners of King [Francis I] have achieved with their lies that there is no compassion for the victims. Already in Aarau [on May 22, 1545], Calvin sensed that some [Protestants] did not want to commit much [to the cause] due to dark rumors. [In the Confederation] the poor brothers are accused of having refused to pay the tithe, which not even their enemies [in France] reproach them for. However, the [Waldensians] have promised the [Roman] priests the same salary they received when they still held [masses]. Even [Louis Adhémar de Monteil, sieur de] Grignan, now legate to Worms and the perfidious instigator of this whole blaze, did not dare to use this pretext! When he was called from Provence, of which he is governor, to [Francis I], he promised the [Waldensian] brothers to advocate for them at court; but because he wanted to please [François II], Cardinal of Tournon, with whose favor he was vying for the legate position, he inflamed the heart of [Francis I] with unheard-of fury [against the Waldensians]. - [Francis I] has recently written to [Germany] to satisfy the Germans, stating he has sent a commissioner [...] to investigate the massacre. But since no one dares to stand up for the poor brothers, nothing is to be expected. More than 400 are held captive, even on [galleys]. Daily, the remaining ones are attacked from the County of Avignon. [Francis I] remains silent; it is certain that it happens with his permission. Help must be provided at the latest now! Most [Waldensians] have been scattered in flight, and the promises given by [Francis I] only serve to better annihilate the Waldensians. Should one quietly watch as the wicked proceed unpunished against the brothers and as Christ is mocked? This will happen if Bullinger and the [pastors] do not strive with all their might. Calvin hears that in Bern and Basel the hearts are already growing cold. The [Zurichers] should seriously take up the matter. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Kaspar] Megander, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Rudolf] Collin, and the other [brothers].</p>

      <p>As far as I understand from the letters of friends, the embassy to France, which I had obtained with your great effort and the zeal of all the good people, will come to nothing unless the matter is pressed again. The pensioners of King Francis I have achieved with their lies that we do not even consider those worthy of compassion whom we see being cruelly killed for the cause they share with us. Already in Aarau, when I was there, I noticed from not unclear conjectures that some were not so favorable to us, or at least not so ardent, because they were occupied with sinister rumors. However, the most baseless accusation was fabricated to burden the poor brothers: that they were persecuted because they refused to pay tithes. But not even their enemies have ever accused them of this. On the contrary, it is well known that they have always voluntarily promised the priests that they would give them as much as they used to demand when they performed their rites. For they have always had prudent and modest men whose sound advice they were willing to follow. You can therefore assert on my faith that this was by no means the cause of the persecution that was stirred up. And not even Grignan, who is now the King's legate in Worms, dared to use this pretext to alleviate the envy.</p>
      <p>But who could have known this better than he, since his treachery kindled this whole fire? For when he was summoned by the King from the province of which he is governor, he promised the brothers that he would faithfully advocate their cause at court. But while he wanted to flatter Cardinal François II of Tournon, under whose auspices he was seeking the legation, he inflamed the King's mind with unheard-of fury. Now it is worthwhile to know in what state the affairs of the pious brothers are. The King, to satisfy the Germans, recently wrote there that he had sent a commissioner to investigate the massacre that had been perpetrated. But what can be hoped for from this? There is no one now who dares to speak out for the relief of the poor brothers. Therefore, their cause will lie oppressed. More than four hundred are still held in chains. For even the bilges of the ships are full of captives. Daily, raids are made from the County of Avignon on those who still survive.</p>
      <p>Although this happens with the King remaining silent, it is certain that it happens with his permission. For he would not turn a blind eye unless he approved. Nor would the legate arrogate so much to himself unless he had insight into his mind. Therefore, now is the time to help, if ever there was before. For many have been scattered here and there in flight. Others are hiding with good men who did not hesitate to risk their own lives to save them from death. Others are held captive. What the King promises is not a remedy, nor a mitigation of the evil, but a cover under which their destruction is buried. Shall we watch quietly and remain inactive while innocent blood is shed? Shall the impious rage against our brothers with impunity? Shall Christ be mocked? Moreover, we foresee that this will happen unless you, together with others who care for the kingdom of Christ, take up the matter anew. For I hear that the spirits in Bern and Basel have grown cold unless they are warmed up. We will not cease to strive. You, with the brothers, ensure that your people seriously take up the matter. Farewell, most distinguished man, fellow minister, and most honorable friend. Greet reverently in my name Konrad Pellikan, Kaspar Megander, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Rudolf Collin, and the others.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you all safe for a long time and govern you with His spirit forever. Amen. Geneva, July 24, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich, fellow minister, and dearest friend.</p>
