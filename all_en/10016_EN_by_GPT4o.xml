      <p>To his Werner, he wishes grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I send to you, my Werner, my recent declamations, written as carefully as possible. I dedicate them to your name, leaving it to you to decide whether you wish to consider this work, which you almost forced from me, favorably. As far as I am concerned, I could not deny anything to a friend so sincere and well-wishing; indeed, my spirit would have given more, had it been possible due to lack of resources. However, what we have, we give. Farewell in Christ. All the brothers wish you well, and you will greet all in return, as many as have taken on the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>From our academy in Kappel, 8 days before the calends of July in the year of the incarnate Christ 1524.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours in every respect.</p>
