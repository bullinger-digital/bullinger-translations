      <p>On the 21st of this month of March, well-guarded under seven most fortified signs, the Lord of Graubünden arrived. It cannot be said how firm and well-equipped that Grey army is, whose number and strength do not yield to any of the other signs.</p>
      <p>In the middle of the army, between two horsemen, humble and plainly without arms (from which he was stripped down to the removal of his belt, having earnestly begged the soldiers by God not to allow him to fall into the hands of the French, nor to be tortured by the questions they would institute, otherwise he would prefer to bring death upon himself beforehand), he reached the gates with a few of his guards, was admitted, and immediately upon entering, dismounted from the rustic horse he had to use, lest he escape on another, more furious horse he initially used. He is guarded opposite the council house in a certain new building.</p>
      <p>He openly declares that if he is to face the danger of death, many others are held with the same or perhaps more serious guilt; if the same punishment befalls them, he will not shrink from death thereafter. He openly names President Dietegen and several others. Unless effective intercessions intervene, I fear that the danger of death may threaten some. May God protect us with His grace. All cry out for justice; but it is to attribute to each his own, not to Graubünden alone. About the rest, another time. Pray for us; for now, 21 signs consume us entirely and rage around us.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, in the year 1572, March 22.</p>
      <p>Your notary is delayed.</p>
