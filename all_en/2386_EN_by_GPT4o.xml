      <p>My friendly greetings with the offering of all honor, love, and goodness beforehand, venerable, well-learned sir and especially gracious, dear, and good friend. I have received your letter once again along with the latest news, as they are available, understood; thank you most highly and sincerely for the effort and work you have taken upon yourself, and especially for your good spirit and will, which you show towards me; for I can well perceive and consider that this happens out of special goodwill, since I know you are burdened with so many and various tasks. Alongside this, I also have a very friendly request to you, not to be offended that I have not responded to you; the reason is the many tasks with which I am now burdened upon my departure; I have been home very little in almost 3 weeks, having to settle accounts everywhere with the under-bailiffs. Additionally, I have also made a trip to Basel. Therefore, as your will and desire were that my wife and I come to you in Zurich, you should know that it is not our goodwill that prevents us, but we would very much like to do so; however, we cannot at this time; the great unrest of moving and the autumn, which is approaching us here very soon, prevent it. We thank you most highly for your goodwill, which we feel in this, and take it from the bottom of our good hearts for the work. We intend to return home on the 19th of autumn with the help of the Lord. Therefore, my wife and I take a friendly leave from you with this letter, with a special friendly request, that you always let us be commended to your good will as your sincerely good friend and supporter, and as you write, even though the bodies are not together, not to part from us; for on our part you should be of undoubted mind: whatever my wife and I can show you and your wife, also all your friends, service and love, we will not spare at any time, but will always be found willing to do so. New news has been written to me by Fuchsberger from the camp at Saint Paul on the 19th of August, that they are lying before Wolffenbuttel, skirmishing fiercely with the enemies day and night. It is to be feared, they have already clashed, or it will happen very soon. From Picardy, my lord mayor of Wattenwil has written to me in recent days, which I hereby send to you along with a French letter, which you may have translated and then send back to me in due time. It seems as if our Lord God wants to bring about great changes in governments. Margrave Albrecht is at Metz, has a great influx of horsemen and foot soldiers; the landsknechts, who were defeated in Italy and passed through our land, are all directed to Metz. May the Lord send it all for the best, sincerely praying to Him that He grants you everything that is welcome to soul, honor, body, and goods. My wife sends you and your honorable wife very friendly greetings and many good wishes, with always good hope that she will still see you on the journey to Bern, with a friendly request, should such a thing happen, that you will accept and consider us as a simple, but nevertheless a well-meaning lodging for God.</p>
      <p>Greet for us Herr Walther, Master Fryssen, Osiander, your son-in-law, and all good gentlemen and companions. Herewith be commended to the Lord in grace. Dated at Lenzburg, 6th of autumn, anno 1554.</p>
      <p>Your trusted good friend and always willing Nikolaus von Diesbach.</p>
