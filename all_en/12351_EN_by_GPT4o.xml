    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks Myconius for the account of the outcome of the [Brunswick] war. Hopefully, the victory will be used in the right way! - Regarding the armistice with the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I], Vadian reports that Leonhart von Vels, the captain appointed by King Ferdinand [I] against the Turks, died in Vienna, and that [Sultan Suleiman I] besieged the fortress Simonthurn near Stuhlweißenburg in November and may have already captured it. Worst of all, however, is that the Hungarians are said to be divided. It is feared that the imperial embassy to Constantinople may have achieved nothing. Possibly, Pope [Paul III] will now incite the Turks against the [Protestants]. - Bullinger knew nothing about the Neapolitan cavalry. - The letter [from Alfonso d'Avalos], entrusted to the returning envoy from Milan, is a defense to continue the restriction of the Milanese market to the region. This is evident from the copy of the letter that [d'Avalos] handed over to the [Swiss] envoys. Without this copy, the envoys would not have accepted the sealed letter [intended for the Swiss Confederation]. - Bullinger would also wish for more religious zeal from the [Zurichers]. Therefore, the sluggish must continue to be encouraged. - Further details will be reported by the bearers [Johannes] Oporin, [Johannes] Herwagen, and Konrad [Wolfhart]. Greetings to Gast, to whom Bullinger cannot write. Myconius should convey the news to Gast.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have diligently described the outcome of the war, most esteemed lord and brother in Christ, for which diligence I give you my greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, the goodness of the Lord is to be praised, through which a most fortunate victory has been granted to us. I wish that they would use it rightly and conduct themselves towards the sworn enemies of Christ in such a way that the whole world understands that they seek the glory of God from the heart!</p>
      <p>You ask what I have regarding the armistice with the Turkish monarch: Here I will subscribe to Vadian's words: There is nothing new from our people except this one thing, that Leonhart von Vels, the captain of the king against the Turks, has died in Vienna, and that the Turk besieged a strong place not far from Stuhlweißenburg, called Simonthurn, last November, and, as is feared, has already conquered it. Then the worst: The Hungarians are seen to be in disarray, and it is feared that the emperor's embassy, which was sent to Constantinople to negotiate a truce, has achieved nothing. I fear that since the Pope no longer trusts any Christian prince, he will incite the Turks against us, etc.; the Turk accepts it, places his faith where now (only) gold and money are, etc.</p>
      <p>I hear about the Neapolitan cavalry from you for the first time; therefore, I cannot add more to your information.</p>
      <p>You wonder what the letters entrusted to the envoys returning from Milan contain. Nothing but an excuse and defense of the market restricted to certain limits; that he did not enclose the market with the strictest boundaries out of hatred or envy, but driven by necessity. This is the essence. For he gave a copy to the envoys, who otherwise would not have accepted the sealed response.</p>
      <p>You lament the cold minds of your people towards religion. I too wish that those entrusted to our faith were more fervent in love and zeal for religion. But we have fallen into these times, dearest brother; therefore, we must labor continuously, cry out, and incessantly urge those who proceed sluggishly and reluctantly in the way of the Lord.</p>
      <p>More will be explained by those to whom I have given this, Oporin, Herwagen, Conrad. Greet Gast, to whom I could not write due to business. I will write another time. Share this news with him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, December 6, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Oswald Myconius, always esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
