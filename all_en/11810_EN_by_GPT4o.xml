    <p xml:id="regest1">The news he receives is troubling him; he explains Bullinger's silence on this matter by his work on the commentary on John. Bullinger will be able to learn more about the situation [in the Archdiocese of Cologne] from Bucer's response [No. 1763]. He considers the arrival of the Emperor [in Germany] to be ominous, although he doubts, based on an eyewitness report, whether it is actually Charles [V.]; it is said that he wants to pacify Germany by burning the books of the new believers. [King Francis I] is raging against his subjects; this was told by a young man from Paris, who was thrown out of his house by his father because he possessed a book by Clément Marot - the latter is now staying as a refugee in Geneva, which Gwalther should also know. He is surprised that he writes nothing about the [Zurich students] recommended by Bullinger, [Johann Jakob] Ammann, and Otto [Werdmüller]; for Zurich's sake, he has taken in two of them [Leodegar Hirsgarter and Wolfgang Haller], and placed the others [Rudolf Kopp and Johann Felix Renner] with others. In Schmalkalden, another [federal] diet is taking place, and in Frankfurt, a city diet. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is nothing that affects the emotions of the flesh more at this time than constantly hearing what is happening everywhere. You are overflowing, but you write nothing, which I excuse because of your work on the Commentaries on John, and therefore I take it in good part. Bucer has replied; you will undoubtedly hear from his letters how things stand. I interpret the arrival of the Emperor as fateful. Although I still doubt whether it is indeed the Emperor; I do not assert this, but I doubt. Two Swiss captured by the Spaniards while traveling in Piedmont say, after being released, that he sits on a small horse, is a handsome man, with a beautiful foot, altogether distinguished.</p>
      <p>Nothing here fits Charles. I suspect a disguise, which I dare not say because of the Frenchman, who has eyes and ears in the courts of all kings and princes. Therefore, while he is silent, I am forced to be silent as well. But if it is the Emperor, I expect nothing good for Germany. It is certainly said that he will pacify Germany; for he intends to destroy all the books of the new faith by fire.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is not so much increasing persecutions against the evangelicals as he is increasing exactions on his own people. The day before yesterday, a Frenchman from Paris, thrown out of his paternal home, was with me, who told amazing things about the calamities of the French. He was thrown out because of a writing by Clément Marot found in his box by his father; Marot is also in exile in Geneva, which I would like Gwalther to know. I am surprised that he did not say a word about the young men whom you, Ammann, and Otho recommended to me in letters. I do not know what is going on. Two are with me, I have placed the others elsewhere, and indeed faithfully. May they conduct themselves in such a way that they may someday be both useful and honorable to your church! What I do, I do for Zurich's sake, otherwise, I am full of boarders. These young men seem good; for they are very modest.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve them.</p>
      <p>There are new diets in Schmalkalden, of the cities of Germany in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be present with His word. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with yours and Theodor and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, July 27, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
