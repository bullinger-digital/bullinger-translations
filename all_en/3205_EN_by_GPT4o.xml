      <p>By all that is sacred, I implore you, my dear Bullinger, to faithfully keep what you have written in your last letter, that you will not share what I have written with anyone. For I, who am too bold in other matters, must also fear our people, although what I have written is true and, if necessary, I would not hesitate to confess and openly declare it. But to what end would it serve? While I write to you what I thought was in your interest, even against their prohibition, I may seem to be neglecting my duty towards them. I finally come to the matter. Yesterday evening, I received your letter in Bruges, in which you abundantly console me and affirm that you have also written to Sulzer himself. Therefore, to remove all doubt from you, know that after about eight days, Sulzer finally sent me everything, both printed by our press and handwritten by you through one of his associates, but he ordered nothing to be said through the same, from which I infer that he does not wish to prevent me from proceeding; for he who is silent seems to consent. And indeed, in the meantime, I am proceeding diligently and have already completed a quire, which I would now send to you, if I had not unexpectedly left Basel sooner than I thought I would.</p>
      <p>For the evening before, I had not yet decided to leave when my wife, about to go to the baths, somehow learned about the departure of our Frisius and... that he would not stay longer than until the Pentecost holiday. Therefore, I thought I would whitewash two walls with one brush, suddenly looked around for horses to buy, so that I could accompany my wife to the baths and visit Frisius before he left, whom I still feared, even though he was about to leave... that he might stay at least half a day longer for my sake. Therefore, if Frisius committed any fault during that delay, you will attribute it all to me. I carefully keep your original copy and hope to place the colophon on the entire book within six weeks, and I am no longer concerned about the spirit or machinations of the Antichrist, and I certainly wish that nothing about these matters had been written by me to you. But what can you do? I could not conceal what I was bearing with difficulty, especially from him whom I thought had the greatest interest in it, and although I wished to hide the conversation of your Habi with Sulzer from all men, I could not restrain myself from also confiding it to our Frisius, whom I nevertheless forbade, as if he were a stone, to communicate it to anyone except you, so that every word may be established in the mouth of at most three witnesses, etc. Allow me to jest a little in a serious matter. As for the blotting paper, which you enclosed with your letter and sent back to me, know that it is from the centuries of British writers by John Bale, an Englishman, a most excellent and learned man, which I now have under the press with the good old man himself constantly assisting in the printing of each one and urging that the work may be published while he is alive. I hope, however, that this too will be completed by next September, along with Choniates and Borraeus on Samuel, Judges, Ruth, and the books of Kings with commentaries, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell and lay aside all care about the Apocalypse; for I hope that the sieve with which Satan was trying to sift us is now stopped again. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Baden, Switzerland, on the eve of Pentecost 1557. Again, I beg you to ensure that Frisius's delay is borne with equanimity by those (whose concern it is).</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and especially esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
