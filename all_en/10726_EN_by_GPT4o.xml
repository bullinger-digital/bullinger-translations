      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Dear godfather, Kappen Hans told me that you intend to come this week, which makes me very happy. However, I am quite sure that you will not come before Tuesday. Therefore, I inform you that I will ride to Zurich on Wednesday, if it is God's will. So, if you also intend to come then, postpone it to the following week or come on Monday.</p>
      <p>Dated at Kappel, Saturday before St. Andrew's Day 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear godfather.</p>
