      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] sends greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>How much praise in the assembly of the saints those deserve, dear brother, who, having spurned the treasures of the Egyptians and other things which are considered the greatest goods among them, take up the cross of Christ, is not something I need to teach you alone among all. This is what these two noble men, Franz Bettus from Rome and Jakob Contius from Trient, have done, both having served in the highest offices with their princes, Bettus with the Duke of Pescara, Contius with Cardinal Madruzzo, the Viceroy of Insubria. They are men not to be despised for their piety, talent, and learning, worthy of your friendship and that of the other good men who are with you. What they have now done, they promised me a year ago they would do here. They are coming to ZÃ¼rich to listen to our men and yours, if they can, and to make more progress. There is no reason to doubt that they will ever bring you disgrace or inconvenience; for they are prepared and equipped with both piety and modesty and other qualities. If my trust and the old relationship between us have any value, I wish to commend them to you, so that they may understand that they have come to brothers, to fathers, and to their own city, while they seek their future. Regarding my request from previous letters, I will say nothing except that I expect the same goodwill from you that I have experienced so far. Farewell with your whole household. My people send greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first day of July, 1557.</p>
