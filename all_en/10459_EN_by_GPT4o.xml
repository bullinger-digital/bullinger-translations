    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares with Bullinger alone particulars from Ambrosius Blarer's letter to Duke Ulrich and a letter from Blarer to Zwick with 1. Blarer's astonishment at Erhard Schnepf's harshness, who, because Konstanz had signed the Augsburg Confession and had been admitted to the Schmalkaldic League by Elector Johann of Saxony, should not impose on him a carnal, unscriptural understanding of the Lord's Supper. 2. Blarer's simple confession of the Lord's Supper. 3. His admonition to have the same teachings in W端rttemberg as in the surrounding cities to avoid disruption and to find enough pastors. 4. His request for a private audience, in which he then proposed the Marburg Formula of 1529 as a basis for an agreement. Schnepf accepted it to Ulrich's delight. W端rttemberg or Stuttgart Concord. 5. Blarer's complaint about the courtiers and the delay of his appointment by Chancellor Johannes Knoder. 6. Duke Ulrich is not inclined towards Melanchthon because of his disparagement in the collection of proverbs by Johann Agricola of Eisleben. From other news, Zwick mentions Leonhard Eck's stay in Stuttgart, the imperial legal independence of Duke Ulrich, rumors of appointments of Andreas Osiander and Philipp Melanchthon to T端bingen, because the Basel people do not want to let Simon Grynaeus go. Asks for advice on how to deal with an Arian Claude d'Aliod, and for the loan of Pellican's Repertorium, if Gregor Mangolt does not copy it.</p>

      <p>Dear Master Heinrich. I must write to you something special and personal alongside the epistle, which you may also show to others; however, let it remain with you; for as many things are written to Zurich, so many things are written from Zurich. Thus, the saying is certainly true: Silentium tutum praemium (Silence is a safe reward). Yet I cannot keep it from you. When you have read it, tear up the letter, and if you wish to tell a good friend, do not mention my name. And with this condition, know that our M. Ambrosius sent a letter to the prince when he had already arrived in Stuttgart, and dealt very earnestly with him regarding the sacrament.</p>
      <p>1. Firstly, he was quite astonished that Schnepf had sought him out so harshly, since our people had agreed to and signed the Saxon Confession at the Diet of Augsburg, and the Elector, along with his people, was not only satisfied with the signing but also with the explanation in the article of the sacrament and had entered into a Christian understanding with our people. He had thus assumed that Schnepf would have let him remain with the same, which confession does not sound otherwise than that the body of Christ is truly presented in the supper, etc. Since he did not want to let him remain with it, but sought him out in a much coarser and more carnal way and against the nature of the scripture (these are the words of our man), also against the similarity of [faith], as well as against [the] presentation of the oldest, foremost teachers of the church, and that also further than we have ever been sought, he thought his princely grace would well consider with what right and Christian moderation such a thing should happen.</p>
      <p>2. Further, he indicated to the prince in his writing what his confession of the sacrament was, namely that the words of Christ are true as they sound, that Christ, when he says: "Take, eat, this is my body," etc., truly gives his body to his believers to eat as food for eternal life, that he should remain in them and they in him eternally; that it should rightly remain with this and that outside of simplicity, no further presumptuous disputation nor carnal thinking should be allowed. This was the summary of his confession in the letter to the prince.</p>
      <p>3. Thirdly, he earnestly admonished the prince to be cautious in the matter and to consider what might follow from it, what offense and disruption it might lead to if his principality were taught and held differently than the surrounding estates and cities. Also, he indicated to him that if one were to teach and speak of the sacrament in such a carnal and coarse way, one would not find as many faithful servants of the word of God as he would need in his land, but would have to appoint all sorts of people, etc.</p>
      <p>[4.] Beyond this written admonition, he further requested from the prince that he admit him to a private colloquium. This happened, etc. There he undoubtedly pressed the preceding points more earnestly. In the colloquium, he also instructed him freely how he might come to terms with Schnepf. Also, if he came to terms with him in this way, and he accepted that which Luther had accepted from Oecolampadius, then he, the prince, would demand the handwriting from both of them; for Ambrosius knows well inconstantiam illorum (their inconstancy), etc. From this, you will best understand the epistle. Also, when Schnepf accepted the confession with Ambrosius, the prince said: "God wills it; it shall be a good hour, and it shall remain so. It shall, God willing, be useful for many things. I know plans and practices that shall certainly be thwarted if my land can reconcile with the cities," etc.</p>
      <p>[5.] Also, among other things, he writes: "In the prince, I desire nothing, in the courtiers, much." There are also suspicions that some were against it, which is why Ambrosius was called a month later than ordered by the prince. "Omnes etc. Some think the chancellor suppressed the letters, which the prince later indignantly learned from a good man." - All these things, my brother, I wrote as if dead.</p>
      <p>[6.] Also, the prince has courteously let it be known that he is not as gracious to Melanchthon "propter Islebii proverbia, in quibus Philippo autore nonnichil sibi maculae aspersit" (because of the proverbs of Eisleben, in which Philip, the author, has somewhat stained himself).</p>
      <p>Also, Dr. Eck was in Stuttgart for three days, a good fellow writes to me; he was entertained at court, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, know that the duke holds the land mero imperio et potentia (with full imperial power and authority), that he bears no fief from anyone but the empire. The king must sing the passion, a good friend writes to me. Yet grace has been granted to him that the princes have agreed that the conditions of peace remain in silence, unless they are not kept; sed sigillis et fideiussoribus omnia sunt roborata (but everything is confirmed by seals and guarantors). - All these things I wrote as if dead.</p>
      <p>Also, I hear that there are many practices present, with which Lutheran preaching comes into the land. Some say and think that Osiander and Philippus are coming to T端bingen; for those from Basel did not want to let Grynaeus go. Pray to God very earnestly; for I believe M. Ambrosius will have to suffer.</p>
      <p>Also, you might let me know how you think one should deal with an Arian, since nothing helps with him. Should one judge, it is offensive, as it concerns faith; should one expel, he does further harm; should one keep him imprisoned, it takes a long time and will, although it seems to me almost the best.</p>
      <p>Dear, faithful lord and brother, let this writing of mine remain with you, and pray to God.</p>
      <p>Also, send me by Mangold or otherwise the repertorium that Pellican made, if Mangold cannot copy it. I will send it back to you within a month's delay.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God be with you.</p>
      <p>These are your letters, Bullinger, which you alone will read after reading the previous epistle.</p>
