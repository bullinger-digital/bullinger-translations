    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's epistle [commentary] [HBBibl I 81] and acknowledges the shortcomings of his own commentary on the Epistle to Titus, which were not corrected by the printer Thomas [Platter] despite reminders; intends to warn the pastors of Bern and Zurich at the upcoming synods before purchasing. In Lausanne, Pierre Viret is preaching. A decision regarding the [captured Solothurn "bandits"] Roggenbach will be made only after the troops [return from the Vaud]; they do not have to fear the death penalty. Chillon Castle is in Bernese hands. Megander asks for advice for an upcoming discussion about the use of church property. [The Bernese pastors] do not consider the proposed additions [No. 768] to the [First Helvetic] Confession, which they received too late, to be necessary, but have no objections. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your most welcome letter and gift, dearest Bullinger, for which I not only thank you but also promise to repay you someday. However, what you added at the end of your letter regarding the uncorrected edition of our Titus cannot be displeasing; yet, I cannot help but be saddened that Thomas, the printer, did not listen to my friendly and brotherly request and plea, what should I say? He did not heed my promise to cover the expenses in some way, to have it reviewed and published in a more corrected form. Therefore, it is necessary for me to warn at the upcoming synods that none of the brothers, either in our region or in Zurich, should purchase this uncorrected edition; I hope to see your synod soon.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, Christ is freely proclaimed by Pierre Viret, a man as learned as he is pious, in a very well-attended sermon.</p>
      <p>The matter of the Roggenbachs has been postponed until the return of our soldiers. We hear some threats, but no matter how they threaten, I tell you for certain, we would rather break the Swiss confederation than have the Roggenbachs executed.</p>
      <p>Chillon Castle has been captured. A messenger has been sent to Zurich to announce this.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, since I hope we, I mean we in Bern, will meet and consult on a more suitable use of church property, I ask you to advise on what should be decided in this matter, and I convey this message to you.</p>
      <p>Finally, what you sent to be added to our confession, we received after our envoy had left for Basel, so we have decided nothing here. As far as the matter itself is concerned, we do not see anything lacking in our confession, but we do not object to your additions being included, though more for synonymy than necessity.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to inform you of at present. Farewell, greet Bibliander, Custodius, Pellicanus, and the brothers. Rhellicanus sends his regards to you all.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the last day of March, in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your Megander.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
