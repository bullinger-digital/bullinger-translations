      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letter on August 10th, in which you ask me to send you Glareanus' work on weights; however, you should know that Glareanus still wants to make some changes; but he is still hesitating and the printer is also delaying. If he does not add anything, I will send the booklet shortly. Furthermore, I thank you for the articles proposed to the princes for examination; you will see a flood of evils follow. Duke Moritz is preparing a new army against the Magdeburgers and Brunswickers. I would gladly see what Philipp has written to you about the Saxon churches, whether they will persevere in the recognized truth, which some have denied and returned to their former vomit. Listen to this strange thing: Soto, the monk from the confession of King Philipp, has been expelled from the court by the advice of Emperor Charles; what he intended, I do not know, certainly deserving of greater punishment for the malice he exercised against the afflicted churches. They also say that Dr. Johannes Bihard, a Sorbonne theologian, is coming to Geneva; what this portends, we will hear shortly; for until now he has been a most bitter enemy of the gospel, and all who have been killed so far have been examined by him and judged worthy of death. But hey, read the following writing and examine it carefully and you will find in it the thoughts of the Emperor:</p>
      <p>Copy of the Pope's response.</p>
      <p>The Pope finally revealed his opinion to the legates of the Emperor and the King of France, namely that he wishes nothing but to please the Emperor, as his virtue deserves; however, he will never do anything without the consent and advice of the King of France, which the innate and hereditary piety of the most Christian kings, who have been and are the pillars of the freedom of the Christian republic, demands by its own right. Therefore, nothing could be more troublesome for him than if one were to ask something of him that was alien to the dignity, utility, or even the not unjust will of the other; nothing is more in his prayers and daily requests to God than that, if the two principal sons of the apostolic see, on whom the whole of Europe depends, would have that peace among themselves which the world cannot give.</p>
      <p>But as long as God, due to the sins of the Christian people, denies this, he will at least strive that they cease from arms. The Emperor indeed has no cause for arms, as he possesses almost everything in dispute between him and the king.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he cannot bear that the Emperor should attack the king or his confederates. As for the king's piety, he is convinced that he will not wage war against the Emperor, lest he involve Europe in a fatal war; that he himself should ask more from the king in favor of the Emperor, this cannot be done without shame honorably, just as the Emperor himself cannot, until he is induced by the illustrious liberality of the Emperor's mind to assist in some tolerable condition of satisfying the king for those things which have undoubtedly come to him by hereditary right, etc.</p>
      <p>From these things, it is easy to see that the Emperor not only under the pretext of religion solicits the princes to accept the Interim, but also to wage war against us and the French.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us true peace of mind. I will write soon about the Pelagians. If you have any news, please share it. Dr. Schertlin sends you many greetings, with whom I will dine. Farewell. August 14th, Basel 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>I also thank you immensely for the gift of the serum; I will repay this kindness when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his dearest lord in Zurich.</p>
