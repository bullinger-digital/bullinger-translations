      <p>I received your last letter, most illustrious and esteemed man, two days ago, and I have decided to respond briefly now, given the convenient opportunity. First, regarding the letters written by you in June, they have been found intact, and since they were well sealed, it seems that they intended to keep them for a while, until no one inquires further, but everyone believes them to be lost. Many things give rise to this suspicion, among which is the fact that, although Olevianus's wife had gone to Metz, she nevertheless retained them for more than three whole months, and then they seemed to have taken their retrieval with such difficulty. But this does not concern us much.</p>
      <p>For the letters sent to Mr. Beza and Dathenus, I thank you as much as I cannot express in writing. They were indeed most welcome to me, both yours and Mr. Gwalther's. If they had any candor and judgment, they could have considered the matter more carefully and acted less disgracefully. You write everything quite openly and clearly; but you write in vain. For those who have undertaken to defend the thesis do anything rather than acknowledge or admit their error. It was not necessary, my Bullinger, for you to ask with such solicitude that I not be disturbed by Dathenus's intemperance; it was as if I had seen a dream to understand those insults, because I have often heard the same things repeated by them to the point of nausea to the Elector Prince and all others publicly and privately.</p>
      <p>All my senses have become callous to those words. Another reason is that God has adorned me with this great gift, that I can receive any injuries with a very calm mind, bear them more calmly, and soon after lay them aside with the utmost calmness and forgive them from the bottom of my heart. For this divine benefit, I continually give thanks to God as much as I can, not as much as I understand I ought to give. Therefore, I will not cease to be a friend to all, to gratify all, and to give them what I would wish to be given to me by those whom I had unjustly offended, indeed, I will not even make any mention, unless perhaps among my highest and most faithful friends.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt that the Wittenbergers think rightly or at least come very close to us in the matter of the Eucharist; their writings sufficiently indicate this, but it is confirmed to me by many good and trustworthy people, so that I cannot doubt it.</p>
      <p>I think you have already received the contradictions of the catechism, ordination, and theologians; for a small vessel was recently sent to my relative, in which, along with some other things and some furniture, there was a copy of this writing. I hope he has already received it, unless it was detained in Strasbourg, which I would not want.</p>
      <p>I earnestly pray you and together with you our Mr. Ludwig Lavater, a truly good, pious, and learned man, to seriously, yet amicably, exhort Mr. Willing to not oppose the prince's disciplinary formula too much, but to tolerate something for the sake of peace.</p>
      <p>It is better to endure a small evil for a great one, which is necessary if he is forced to abandon his station and place. He is said to be very pleasing to the Bretons, but there is no firmness among the common people. However, I wish you to write in such a way that he does not perceive it to have come from me, since the exhortation would have less authority; otherwise, there is no need to conceal anything. In many places now they elect elders, and they seem almost everywhere to deliberately choose the worst, as if to mock, I think; from this very thing, as I fear, we will be able to expect nothing good.</p>
      <p>About Sylvanus and his associates, I have nothing certain, except that he is said to be writing a full and solid refutation in prison. If the Lord, as I hope, has changed his mind, he could accomplish much, because he is learned and, having suffered from this disease, he has deeply understood the feelings of these impostors and has experienced which arguments are more effective with them. The first author, Adam, was brought to Amberg yesterday evening. I think we will soon see some end to this matter. I rejoice that at least the most pestilent stench can no longer spread now that all the accomplices of this horrible error have been apprehended.</p>
      <p>Your people are so commended to me that I wish you to be free from all care in those things which can be provided by me.</p>
      <p>I am now entirely engaged in the thought of refuting the most monstrous and absurd doctrine of Paracelsus, and in the first part (I think I will have to write four large books) I have decided to treat those things which pertain to piety, that is, about the superstitious and magical healing through words, characters, invocations of I know not which angels, and whatever of this kind the cacodemons have devised. Serious questions will arise here, which I will attempt to resolve plainly and solidly, partly from philosophy, partly from theology, to the best of my ability. Mr. Ludwig very conveniently sent me his booklet on specters, which I would now be compelled to read if it had not already been planned before. I also pray you again and again to express the highest thanks to him on my behalf, if I cannot write. As a token of my grateful mind, I send my booklet against astrologers, because I do not know if you have it and nothing else is at hand now.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I send you a question pertaining to almost the same argument, whether our witches sin mortally by divine law, to be examined. I wrote it at the request of a very good and learned man, also very pious, who thinks against me with Wierus the physician in the book On the Deceptions of Demons.</p>
      <p>The reason I wrote those things is this: That Paracelsus calls himself the Hermit of Hohenheim and also Bombast. Therefore, I would like to know if there is any noble family around Einsiedeln von Hohenheim or Bombast, and if anything else can be known about this matter. I earnestly ask you to inquire by any means you can, whenever the opportunity arises. He was once familiar with a certain Mr. Clauser, a physician of Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's daughter was betrothed to Archduke Ferdinand of Galli on October 22. A legate sent by Galli was present, an Italian man from the lowest place and completely plebeian, made Count d'Ares because of his practiced lust with the queen, as they say. See where things fall. To such a famous assembly of princes, Galli sends such a man, who, if he were not a boy, would seem to me to mock the Emperor and the empire.</p>
      <p>Our people now vigorously commend their excommunication for sermons, saying it is a spiritual matter not pertaining to the magistrate, who is profane, and that in Matthew 18, Christ speaks of spiritual governance. The assembly, I think, will end within a few weeks; for after he has conveniently married off both daughters and sent them away (the French one is said to be leaving tomorrow) and obtained what he wanted, the Emperor seems to care little about the rest. He has obtained more than 300,000 thalers, if they are all counted together, which have been confirmed to him again from a promise already made and which are now granted to him for the first time. I can indicate nothing else but that the ruin of the empire is at the door; for such a great amount of silver is spent on luxury and yet it is not enough.</p>
      <p>The one bringing this to you, Simon Reutinger, has a papist parent not far from Schaffhausen, who is unwilling to assist him in anything unless he becomes a priest. Since he cannot sustain himself here any longer, he is setting out to seek help and assistance from you; he was with you last year and brought you letters from us and experienced your kindness and that of the other colleagues, so that he now hopes excellently. He is indeed a truly good and pious young man and modesty itself. I have never seen or heard anything about him that was not worthy of commendation in his entire life. He is not very sharp or quick-witted, but he is of a very good character.</p>
      <p>He was created a Bachelor, as they call it, almost two years ago and would have progressed further if poverty had not held him back. Therefore, I pray you with as much respect as I owe and as much effort as I can, that you may be willing to assist him in any way possible, lest he be forced to do something wrong, which I do not think he would do even if he had to die. If there is no place for him with you, you can at least help him with advice and recommendation. I am entirely persuaded, unless all faith is completely absent, that you will render service to a good, pious, grateful, and useful young man for the church, which you will not regret; indeed, I will consider it given to me, whatever is given to him through you. May God Almighty bless your labors and studies and keep you safe. Amen.</p>
      <p>On the 29th of October.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Thomas Erastus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in virtue, learning, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his master, to be highly honored as a father.</p>
