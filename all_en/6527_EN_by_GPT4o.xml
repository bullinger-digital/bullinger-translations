      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, Minister of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed father, greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>When I recall the many and great benefits you have bestowed upon us (esteemed father), I am compelled to express my eternal gratitude to you, lest I appear ungrateful for such great kindness, and I am urged to recognize you as a second parent.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, we arrived in Heidelberg on the 4th of July and delivered your letters to Dr. Erastus, who, after reading them, accepted us as boarders in your name, which he would not have done otherwise; for he had previously refused many. But since he had no room for us in his own house, he arranged for us to find one not far from his residence.</p>
      <p>We were almost continuously drenched by rain during our journey, and if the merchants from Zurich had not been present, who assisted us greatly in your name, we would have fared poorly. Here, by the grace of God, the arts flourish, and we have a great number of learned men, from whom we hope, with God's help, to gain much benefit. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I send my greetings to Veritas and Dorothea.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, 8th of September, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient son, Antoine de Cougn√©e. To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich and my most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
