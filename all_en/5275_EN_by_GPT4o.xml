      <p>From Württemberg.</p>
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär writes to me, saying it is rumored that the Prince of Orange, who is a Count of Nassau, has stabbed his wife, who was a daughter left behind by Duke Maurice of Saxony, along with another noble young lady, simply because they both attended an evangelical sermon. Also, in Weimar, there is said to be a preacher who refuses to give the Lord's Supper to women, because Christ had it with men, that is, with his disciples, and not at all with women. Furthermore, in Carinthia, a monk is said to have arisen, teaching that it is a Lutheran fable what has been preached about Christ so far; he claims there is a very different account. He does not write further about how or what else he claims.</p>
      <p>What will come of this?</p>
      <p>I sent him your latest booklet against the Brents; he writes to me that he also sent it to his brother-in-law, the one from Grafeneck, to read; he writes to me to convey to you his many services, also all love, good, and greetings. My son writes from Strasbourg that the affairs of the school and the church are extremely disturbed and there is a danger that, with the Marbachians prevailing so much, Mr. Conrad Hubert and the minister of the French church may be removed from their ministry; Specker, the priest of the Thomas church, shamelessly and most confidently throws those old church doctors off the bridge, especially Augustine, because of what he wrote against the Pelagians, claiming he was a man and could have erred, etc., as if indeed, etc. What, I ask, will be the end of this unbearable arrogance of these young men! I am sending you a fuller account of that most cruel act of the Guise, recently committed by him, translated from French into Latin, which my son has already sent to Strasbourg. You will return this with the next sure messenger, etc.</p>
      <p>I could not add anything further; I am now entirely caught up in a certain very unfortunate business, about which, if I have any opportunity, I will also inform you, seeking your advice, unless it is resolved in another way, which is very complicated. April 16, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother and most esteemed friend of all by far.</p>
