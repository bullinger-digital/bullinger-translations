      <p> S. I am residing in a garden with honorable people, with young lord Hartmann von Hallwyl, our bailiff, Hämmen Haberer, and others; they have spoken to your people of Zurich in such a way: there are prominent people who let themselves be heard, they would also like to act until the Bernese receive a blow, then they would also run, etc. I, who would like to see peace between the two cities especially, have responded, denied, and defended this to the best of my ability, which surprised von Hallwyl; but they would not let me come to that. Now I know well how the matter is fundamentally on your Zurich side. I often think to myself, for the sake of peace, to keep in mind what irreparable things we might bring about, what misery and distress might bring to us and our holy religion, also to the common Confederation. It is known that they in Lucerne have decided in the council to wage a war against us, but such a thing has not taken place; it has been prevented and hindered by one man. Solothurn and Lucerne are constantly opposed to my gracious lords of Bern, so that one has to deal with them at every council meeting, seeking all means to give us a reason to retaliate. What then some of your Zurich people would undertake and what revengeful spirit would be kindled in the conflict, you, dear lord and brother, have to consider well. Virtus unita fortior est se ipsa dispersa, as the proverb says. Therefore, it is my friendly request to you, that you, as much as it is your duty, be among your people to ensure that such opinions do not increase; for truly I hear from many brave honorable people, they do not want to do more than before, but rather put an end to it, even if their lords and... do not want to, where the five places should break out, and I must give them faith; for many good-hearted people daily report the truth more clearly, and besides, the unworthy and unfriendly of the opposite, which I do not say, the dishonorable defiance and wantonness are becoming apparent. </p>
      <p> Therefore, on our part, everyone should speak the best to ensure that it does not lead to war. But if God does not arrange it otherwise, let us consider the old negotiated matters and the future danger with a united heart. </p>
      <p> Although I always thought that much could be achieved with patience and that the matter of the holy religion should not be fought with the sword. I write this to you as my old, well-trusted friend, knowing to always adhere to it. Whatever else may happen, I will not keep it hidden from you. Scis, quam sedulus sit in suis conatibus veritatis hostis; praeterea te non fugit, quę et quanta ingratitudo nostra meretur. Greet your wife and your entire family most dutifully from me and consider my words kindly, I beseech you. Given in Lenzburg, October 29, 1554. </p>
      <p> Yours, Gervasius. </p>
      <p> You have here a messenger to whom you can safely entrust letters to me. </p>
      <p> To the pious, learned master Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my old lord and especially good friend, to be delivered. </p>
