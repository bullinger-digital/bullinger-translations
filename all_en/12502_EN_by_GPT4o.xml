    <p xml:id="regest1">[In Zurich] it is said that Luther was publicly reviled and also the rumor was spread that he had died of grief because he did not know how to respond to the [“True Confession”]. However, some report that well-meaning people withheld the writing of the Zurichers from him to prevent a new conflict. Philipp further learned that those who supported the [First Helvetic] Confession, drafted in Basel [1536], are not tolerated [in the Confederation]. Bullinger should know, however, that the Landgrave has often been able to prevent the opponents [of Zurich] from drafting harsh writings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- God demands faithfulness, love, and humility from people. The [Eucharist] dispute, on the other hand, harms [the spread] of the Gospel. During his meeting with Emperor [Charles V.] in Speyer, Philipp had to listen to how the Imperialists harshly criticized the disunity of the [Protestants] in the [Eucharist] doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Since the Council [of Trent] and Pope [Paul III.] are plotting against [the Protestants], the latter should neither give cause for criticism nor allow themselves to be weakened by new [internal] disputes. Bullinger should therefore ensure that his followers do not continue to mock Luther. Since God has accomplished so much good through Luther, one must not seek revenge, even though to the great regret of Philipp and many others, Luther has acted too harshly against the [Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The [Wittenberg] Concord accepted by Zurich's neighbors (including Bern, Basel, St. Gallen) is based on the Holy Scripture and states that [in the Eucharist] not only bread and wine but also the body and blood of Christ are received, albeit not in an earthly manner. If one were to strive for the unity of the Church and pay more attention to the wording in the interpretation of this sacrament, the [Protestant] churches would come closer together and, as a result of their unity, attract more people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Philipp has no doubt that Bullinger will advocate for this.</p>

      <p>Philipp, by God's grace Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc. Highly learned, dear special one, it has come to our attention that Doctor Luther, of blessed memory, is said to have been publicly reviled among you as an idolater and that it was spread that he died of grief because he could not respond to your booklet. However, some have reported to us that he never saw such a book, but rather it was withheld from him by well-meaning people to prevent a new conflict from arising. It is also said that those who wish to adhere to the confession you sent to Basel and then to Doctor Luther are not tolerated among you. On the other hand, some from the other side might have resorted to some sharp writings, which we have often prevented by divine grace; for without our efforts, the sacrament dispute would undoubtedly have been reignited anew.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, with faithful warning, we graciously intend that you consider how God requires faithfulness, love, and humility from us above all, and that nothing should hinder the Gospel or give the enemies such contempt and support against us as this sacrament dispute. As we cannot conceal from you, when we were recently with the Imperial Majesty in Speyer, the Imperialists themselves raised and brought forth that we are not united in our religion, especially regarding the sacrament; for one preaches this, another that, one aligns with the Anabaptists, and one belongs to this sect and another to that, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, to prevent this and to avoid the matters being stirred up into new disputes, especially since the Council and the Pope are so swiftly plotting against us, you should, as much as possible, abolish such talk and ensure that Luther, of blessed memory (through whom God has done so much good for us), is not thus dishonored and falsely reviled by your followers. For even if he wrote too sharply against you (which has been and still is a heartfelt regret not only for us but for all pious scholars of his part), it does not befit you to measure him with the same measure and to repay him for the wrongs you have suffered from him, nor to seek your own victory.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Moreover, you know that the Christian concord of the churches (in which your neighbors Bern, Basel, St. Gallen, and other places gladly remain) is based on the right understanding of the Holy Scripture, that we receive not only bread and wine but also the body and blood of the Lord, though not in any worldly manner. And if both sides would look to God alone and the unity and edification of the churches (setting aside all private affections) and would yield, concede, tolerate, and come closer to each other in words (without giving up the right understanding), we would be of good hope that the schism would cease with God's help and the churches would come closer together and unite, so that we, united in our head Christ Jesus, might better resist our enemies (who are so many, great, and powerful) with God's assistance and also bring many more to us through such unity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We fully expect that you will not let anything prevent you from promoting all this, according to the virtues often praised by us. And we are graciously inclined towards you.</p>
      <p>Given at Friedewald, the 5th of June, in the year, etc., 46. Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, has signed.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scripture in Zurich.</p>
