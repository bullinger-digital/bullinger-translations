      <p>S. D. For a long time, I have not received any letters from your kindness, most illustrious man, and therefore I await them with great longing. The one who delivers this letter to you, Maternus, etc., is a learned and pious man; he spent some time in Wittenberg, then went to Geneva, returned to us, and was for some time a companion of Mr. Peter Martyr; now he is going to Italy to see it as well.</p>
      <p>He asked me for recommendations; I could not refuse him, as I consider him worthy, whom all the pious should love and whom all good people should help. You can assist him with recommendations and advice.</p>
      <p>You will do here, as I know, more than I ask and so that I understand that our recommendation has had some weight with you. During these winter months, I wrote 6 books against the Anabaptists in German; they contain pages... therefore I could not conveniently attach them to the letters nor fit them into... the pocket. We are in good health by the singular grace of God.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you; greet [the father with our sons]. On March 18, the Abbey of St. Gall was completely consumed by fire, which started in the house of a certain pastor. Yesterday, our most honorable council sent an envoy there to console the afflicted and to give a gift of 200 crowns. May the Lord be with them and strengthen them in good.</p>
      <p>Throughout Germany, we hear that soldiers have been conscripted for some time, but today we hear they have been dismissed and are to be dismissed. I cannot write more as I am tired; I have spent 5 whole days writing letters, for today Froschauer left for Frankfurt. Live and farewell with your whole household, with our John, and especially with Father Travers.</p>
      <p>Hector is struggling with poor health.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Friedrich von Salis, most worthy commissioner of the County of Chiavenna, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chiavenna in Valtellina.</p>
