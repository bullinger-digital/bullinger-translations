      <p>Greetings. Regarding the care of your health, which I recently urged you to consider, my dear Bullinger, I add this: noticing from the accounts of friends that you always use the common diet, especially the one used by the whole family, I judge that you cannot be truly healthy unless you establish a better dietary regimen. The greatest and most excellent force of heat is dissipated by the continuation and perpetuity of thoughts; thus, when the heat and natural strength are weakened, the body does not dissolve thick food; it does not easily embrace it, but labors greatly in digesting and overcoming it. Therefore, the diet, which should be a support for a weak nature, when it is thick, also becomes an impediment. Thus, it is necessary that even the best constitution is undermined and weakened in this way. See, my dear Bullinger, these things are very evident.</p>
      <p>Therefore, apart from chickens and small birds, in this weakness, eat nothing of meats that is greasy and fatty, thick and sinewy, tough and sticky. Thick and tough cheese is a plague and a certain cause of dizziness. Unless I hoped you had discovered this yourself through experience, I would show you that when strength is laboring, tough cheese always generates dizziness. I therefore beseech you, what reason is there for you to fear, as you differ and are distinct in your way of life, so should you differ in diet and food from others. But the life of a scholar, especially a man, and a body afflicted by lack of labor and exercise, should therefore have an appropriate dietary regimen. Believe me, it is not piety to disregard this.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ. Amen. Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
