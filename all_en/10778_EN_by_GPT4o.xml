      <p>To Lord Werner Steiner, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and a blameless life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>At last, dear and most beloved brother, I offer what I promised ten years ago, the commentaries on Paul's Epistles to Timothy. In the meantime, I was ashamed and regretted the rash promise, to tell the truth, not once, because day by day, with experience as my teacher, I learned how much material is necessary for a commentator, and again, how lacking I am in it. However, after the tireless letters and prayers of more learned and holy men had obtained from me, even unwillingly, an explanation of almost all the other Epistles of Paul, it seemed to be the act of a treacherous and ungrateful man to defraud an old friend and host, who had deserved the best from me, of his hope. For in your zeal for all the ministers of God and His word, you also most kindly supported me, an exile and one who had escaped from the fire of persecution. Indeed, for the same love, you so greatly requested these commentaries from us, so that you might benefit as many as possible. You saw that these epistles contain the instruction of a bishop and therefore are useful to both the exceptionally and moderately learned, but that they cannot progress further without a guide and index, and thus these commentaries would be beneficial. Certainly, with this intention, that is, with the desire to help, I undertook this labor not reluctantly. To you, therefore, they owe whatever benefit I have conferred through my labor and work.</p>
      <p>Continue to embrace the good with favor and to help the worthy with beneficence, and in every way to benefit as many as possible. The Lord has called you with a holy calling, endowed you with gifts both of mind and fortune not to be despised. Therefore, adorn the Sparta you have obtained. The Lord will not fail the willing and diligent. But He who granted that, having left behind the most ample condition and your native home, you followed Him and the pure preaching of truth, with no ordinary loss of your resources, as the faithful Abraham did, He will also grant that, having despised all the allurements of the world, you may steadfastly continue in the way of the Lord, trample on earthly things, strive for eternal ones, and finally, happy, be received into the eternal homeland to enjoy eternal joy with God, which all will enjoy who, having denied desires, flesh, blood, country, resources, family, and present things, adhere to their eternal and invisible, but true, good God. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich, in the month of February, in the year of our Lord 1536.</p>
