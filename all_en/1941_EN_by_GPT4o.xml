      <p>Your office and the extensive indication of your goodwill towards me delight me greatly, and I wish for some opportunity to be given, in which I can in turn prove both my gratitude and my opinion of you. Although that news of such a significant defeat inflicted by the most wicked robber should cheer all good men, I do not think we should greatly rejoice until we understand what the outcome of the victory and these matters will be. How accursed was the advice of the Bishop of Arras, who, as it has been reported to me, advised the Emperor to allow everything to be done and carried out in Germany; such a fierce nation would not cease to bite the bit until it had fallen by mutual wounds! Hence all those plans and evasions in all actions were devised, so that nothing certain could be established, but everything rushed headlong and recklessly. The succession of the empire is the new Helen. Behold, on the other side of the world, the death of the King of England, the election of the daughter of the Duke of Suffolk, who married the Duke of Northumberland, with the daughter of the Emperor's aunt being cast out, who is said to have fled to him. My king is advancing to his camp with great spirit. From there too we will soon hear something tragic. In the Sienese countryside, where everything was hoped to be peaceful, a grave war has recently flared up, because the Duke of Florence has occupied those fortresses which were held by the Spanish garrison. The Turkish fleet is skirting the coast of the Strait of Sicily and is bringing devastation and fires to the Emperor's territories throughout the Lower Sea; it is attempting the same in Liguria. On land, too, the war is being waged very fiercely there; our forces have so far been victorious, having taken several towns partly by force, partly by surrender. O happy you and all yours, who, with your affairs happily settled, watch so many shipwrecks from the harbor! May God grant that I may at least sometime in leisure be able to remember these things and devote myself entirely to the many things written wisely and piously by you and other most excellent men, which I have preferred to all kingdoms. I feel in this my exile and life, truly nomadic, or if there is something worse, how pleasant it is to philosophize away from business. I have received and read your booklets diligently. I understand German clearly, but I cannot speak it fluently, as a man who is not a student.</p>
      <p>At the very moment I received your letters, Mr. Bassefontanus sent me new writings written by the same hand. See in what matter I can be of service to you. Farewell, most learned man. Chur, 8 days before the Kalends of August.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Bellay is in good health and always remembers you and yours. I hear the Roman king is lying down with a fever. Today, early in the morning, I received letters written from Siena: the Duke of Florence has restored everything; nevertheless, he is very much afraid for himself.</p>
      <p>Your John Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
