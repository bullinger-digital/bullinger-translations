    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. His letters always contain comfort from the Holy Spirit. May God strengthen Bullinger and also grant the people of Konstanz the strength to bear and overcome any burden!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A completely credible letter has just arrived, according to which Eriprando Madruzzo died in Ulm on February 20th [correct: 17th]. Shortly thereafter, Johann Naves is also said to have died, whose name derives from the word "ship," and who was the right hand of Emperor Charles V in Upper Germany. If only the "great sails" [i.e., Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle] would die, especially since ships carry sails with them! He too will probably not escape God's judgment. Nevertheless, Blarer prays for these enemies, so that they too may experience God's mercy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is said that there are many deaths daily among the [imperial] soldiers. They are ruining the [occupied] cities. The Emperor is moving with all his artillery to Frankfurt am Main and Saxony. King Ferdinand is coming to meet him. Both want to destroy Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. If only he does not enter into a rotten peace! Then everything would still turn out well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Hopefully, the people of Konstanz will receive another reprieve! If Naves were still alive, he would have long since written to the people of Konstanz again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Thank you for the song. It is typical of its authors! Some troublemakers from the [Protestant] camp have published a "Sudatorium," which people in Konstanz like to laugh about, although Blarer finds this amusement inappropriate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enclosed are the ten guilders and the letter [No. 2823] from Konrad Hofherr. Bullinger knows for whom this money is intended. If the amount is not correct, Bullinger should report it, so that the good widow [Regula Mayer] does not suffer any harm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Konrad Zwick will tell everything else. Blarer, who has little time, would now rather present a special concern.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [Enclosure:] Blarer's friend, Captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, who captured the Ehrenberg pass in the [Danube] campaign, must reckon that he has fallen out of favor with the Emperor and the King. Serving Ulm, he receives 650 florins annually. But when Ulm submitted to the Emperor, he left the city and left his household goods as well as servants and horses there. Together with his wife [Anna Zehntmeier] and his stepson [Philipp Klee], whom she has from her former husband [Georg Klee], he has been in Konstanz for several weeks, where they are accommodated in a canon's house.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Schankwitz now wants to acquire a modest property for the son. He was pointed to [the castle] Dübelstein, which belongs to a Freimut [correct: Gotthard Richmut] from Zurich. He then asked Blarer to discreetly find out whether the Zurich authorities would approve such a purchase, and whether he and his wife would be allowed to stay there as often as necessary. He asks this because he will continue to serve as a soldier for several lords (perhaps only the people of Ulm). Of course, he does not intend to recruit Zurich mercenaries!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] He is a decent, brave, and honest man. His wife is devout. Both love the Gospel. As a soldier, he could still make a lot of money, but now he wants to be content with being a servant of a sovereign by nature. He and his wife come from the County of Tyrol. From there, his wife still receives income. However, it is questionable whether the King will still allow its payment, especially since Schankwitz is in great disgrace with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Bullinger should inquire with the councilors whether they would allow Schankwitz to purchase Dübelstein, or whether this would violate Zurich law, which Blarer certainly does not want. However, he would like to contribute to Schankwitz gradually giving up the business of war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The enclosed letter is intended for forwarding to Bernardino Ochino, if Bullinger knows where he went after his stay in St. Gallen.</p>

      <p>S. For your letters, I give thanks as much as I can, especially since they always contain something that excellently breathes the consolation of the divine spirit. May the Lord grant you, my Bullinger, these worthy and perpetual spirits, and may He also constantly add such to us, so that, no matter how great the burden we see placed on our shoulders, we may hope to be equal to it and even superior. The Lord governs all things with marvelous counsel!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now letters are brought (but such that we can safely believe them) that on February 20th in Ulm, Eriprando Madruzzo was seized with a very severe pain and died; and shortly thereafter, the chancellor, whose name is derived from ships, followed him, whom the emperor used as his right hand in Upper Germany - if only the great sails had also perished with him, since it is fitting that ships carry sails with them. However, he too will not escape the judgment of the Lord, although I pray for them, that they may soon repent and experience with us the mercy of the Lord in Christ Jesus, who freely forgives us all things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is said that many good people die daily in heaps. (Soldiers) They are also making a mess in the cities everywhere. The emperor is breaking out with all his munitions. He is moving towards Frankfurt and Saxony. The king is also moving with force towards the emperor. They want to destroy the pious elector. Oh, that he would not now (only) surrender and accept a rotten peace! Everything would still be good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We hope in God, we will have a little reprieve here again, as long as it pleases the Lord. If the lord of Naves had not died, my lords would have already had further writings from him by now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We give thanks for the song. Now the lips have lettuces that are quite similar. Some troublemakers in our camp have published some kind of "Sudatorium," which is now being laughed at here. I was greatly displeased by the untimely applause of our people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I send here 10 gold coins with the letters of Curio. You know to whom they are owed. If there is any error in the currency or number, you will indicate it in the next letters, so that the good widow is not defrauded.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Commend us diligently to the Lord with all yours. The rest Zwick will tell, etc. So hold it for good. I have no more time. I must also write to you about a matter. May the dear, faithful God be with you forever. February 25, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Dear lord and brother, my dear friend and brother-in-law Marcell Dietrich, captain, who then conquered the pass in the past war, has to reckon with great disgrace by the emperor and king. He is a servant of Ulm (they give him 650 florins annually) and has left Ulm when they accepted reconciliation with the emperor. He did not want to wait for the emperor, although he still has his household there with several servants and horses. However, together with his dear wife and stepson, a boy whom his wife had by her previous husband, he has been here for several weeks. They have their own house in a canon's court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>He now intends to buy a small property for his aforementioned son. And he has been pointed to one at Greifensee named Diepoltstein. It belongs to a Freymut by you. He now asks me very kindly to discreetly inquire with you whether your lords of Zurich would allow such a purchase, so that he could buy this property for his son, and whether he and the mother could also be with the son as often as their situation requires. He asks this because he has service money from several lords (he might now have service money from those of Ulm), which he cannot well use for his honorable maintenance. However, he does not want to incite any servants by you, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>He is certainly a decent, brave, upright man and has a godly, Christian wife. They love God's word. He could acquire great wealth if he desired to be a soldier forever; but he is not inclined to that, but only to serve a lord from home. They are both from the County of Tyrol. There the wife still has her incomes. But he does not know whether the king will continue to allow it or not. For he has now become very ungracious to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>So you are now asked and I inquire whether it would be possible to obtain it from your lords or not. What would be against your statutes and good order, I would very reluctantly have it broken because of mine or my own. But what would be customary or permissible, I want to have asked you most kindly. I want to have shown you a good, faithful friend and brother in such a way as you have done so far. I am entirely obliged to repay you in a friendly manner. I would like to secretly promote such, now that he has been withdrawn from the miserable wars.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>If you know where the pious Bernardino Ochino is, you will deliver the enclosed letter to him. I cannot at all know where he has gone from St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To the very excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and very dear brother. Zurich.</p>
