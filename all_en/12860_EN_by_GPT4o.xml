    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Recently, Kröttlin sent a letter to Bullinger [not received] and to his friend Johannes Willing, because he would like to have his son [Hans Baptist?] educated in Zurich, especially since he knows that the best Christian discipline prevails there. Subsequently, Willing wrote to him that Bullinger had received the request favorably and was making efforts to find accommodation for the son. Kröttlin is very grateful for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He continues to plan to send his son to Zurich as soon as possible. However, due to the dire course of the war as well as the snowfall, there is a delay. Nevertheless, the boy remains recommended to Bullinger, so that he may be raised in a Christian manner by a good teacher and well-educated in languages. Kröttlin will provide for the maintenance annually and will also show his gratitude to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Venerable, highly learned, your reverence, my entire friendly, willing service. A few days ago, I wrote to your reverence and also to my particularly favorable friend, Johannes Willing, about how I have a young son whom I would like to send to Zurich for his studies. However, since I am not particularly well-known in that place, I wrote to your reverence and also to the aforementioned Willing, my particularly good friend, and requested to promote my son, as I am now writing to your reverence and desire, to have him received in that place (where I know that all good discipline and Christian conduct are taught more than in other places). Subsequently, I recently received a letter from the aforementioned Willing, in which he informs me how your reverence has shown yourself entirely willing in this my request and has made efforts to accommodate my son with particular diligence; for which I am most sincerely grateful to your reverence.</p>

      <p>I am also still willing to send my son there. The reason for the delay is not that I have changed my mind, but solely because the situation, unfortunately (God have mercy), due to the war, has become so worrying here and subsequently the weather with snow has also occurred in such a way that I have not been able to send him off so quickly. But with the help of Almighty good God, I am still willing to send him to your reverence as soon as possible, with entirely Christian and friendly request and desire, that your reverence may accept him and, as I undoubtedly desire out of Christian zeal, have him instructed to the glory and honor of God, and to promote the learning of all Christian arts, discipline, and good language, to place him under a good teacher. What I am then annually obliged to do for this, I am entirely willing, and also offer to earn (repay) this to your reverence before God and in time. Dated the 12th of February in the 47th year. Your reverence's willing Gabriel Kröttlin, city scribe of Ravensburg.</p>
