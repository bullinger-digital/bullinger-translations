      <p>Greetings and best wishes. When I went to Chur yesterday to hear the sermon, as I usually do, my most esteemed lord and father, I received your most eagerly awaited letters, which filled me with both sorrow and joy. Sorrow, indeed, because I learned from them that the excellent Lord Simler, my esteemed lord and host, has been afflicted with gout and confined to bed, and therefore could not reply. Joy, however, because you, such a great man, occupied with many and significant matters, nevertheless (as is your kindness) deigned to write to me the most gracious letters, which I will preserve as a treasure as long as I live. Nor was there any reason for you to thank me for always making honorable mention of you in my letters to Lord Simler; I would indeed be most ungrateful if I were to forget you, whose kindness and singular love towards me I have experienced so many times, and indeed I clearly perceived the same in your letter to me, in which you advise me so fatherly (as all who wish me well and all the best do) to leave the court and embrace the offered position.</p>
      <p>The name of secretary to the royal majesty among the Rhaetians is certainly plausible and pleasing to the ears, which before me has been granted to no Rhaetian, nor will ample promises be able to divert me from leaving the clamor of the court and the utmost license of living to return to the camp of Pallas. What Lucian writes about courtiers, I have never read; but they are engraved in my heart as if inscribed in bronze and in no way erased, which I often heard from my grandfather of pious memory, who dissuaded me from the courtly way of life, asserting it to be the most miserable of all. What Erasmus and Budeus write about courts at the end of the book "De Asse," I have read, who depict courtiers in their true colors.</p>
      <p>It would be long to enumerate each reason why I wish to depart from here, although I do not consider it against religion to be at court, where I am not compelled to do anything against my conscience; but I prefer to recount these things to you in person rather than commit them to writing. - I thank you, my lord, greatly for the book you sent me, and for the news (which I shared with Lord Tobias), for which I currently have nothing to repay, except this: we learned in recent days that the Duke of Savoy is enlisting soldiers; for what purpose is unknown. Two days ago, his envoy passed through here, returning from the emperor's court. All of Duke Hannibal's war preparations have vanished; concerning the outcome of the battle, besides what I have written before and you recently to me, I have nothing. In Milan, the Spaniards are greatly rejoicing and have kindled many fires as if the matter were safe and victory won.</p>
      <p>I would very much like to know where Lord Languetus is heading, who, as I could gather from your news, passed through there in recent days. The same person who had my last letters to Lord Simler also had letters from me to the same Lord Languetus, which he would undoubtedly have delivered to him if he had known him. These few things, my lord and father, I write hastily and among many other matters (for today we wrote to the king and his counselors), I earnestly ask you to consider favorably.</p>
      <p>I wish you to convey my greetings to all yours, especially to my dearest compatriot Lord Heinrich and his wife, also to the daughters Veritas and Dorothea and the granddaughter Verena, as well as to Lord Gwalther and Lavater. Farewell, most distinguished man; may the best and greatest God preserve you long unharmed for His church. My cousin Pontisella sends you many greetings. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Haldenstein, August 25, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johann Baptist Müller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, an exceptional servant of Christ, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, to be honored as a father with perpetual fidelity.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
