      <p>Greetings. From your letters, I have been informed about your somewhat weak health, which I hope is improving. However, it cannot but be good for you, who accepts everything as if from the hand of the most benevolent Father, who makes sweet for His own what appears bitter and hard to others, and who has long since instructed and armed you against all assaults and temptations. If I had anything that could refresh and heal you, I would not withhold it.</p>
      <p>I pray you to take care of your health and that of those who depend on you, and expect all my efforts and services.</p>
      <p>I sent to Mr. Walter what has been written to me from Germany and Piedmont, which I believe he will share. It seems the Germans and the Swiss have left the camps and are returning to their homes. I am still anxious about what the outcome of the peace talks will be.</p>
      <p>When I learn something certain, I will write to the most honorable council of Zürich, whom you will greet in my words. It will be most pleasing to me if you have taken care of my son.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, November 12.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor and colleague of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
