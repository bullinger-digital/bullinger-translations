      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, reverend father in Christ, at the very moment we had to go to the court to dispute with the Anabaptist. A stubborn kind of people, and one that admits no instruction.</p>
      <p>Your labor, therefore, will be extremely useful both to us and to other pious ministers. As for my writing that it seemed strange to me that you wrote nothing, the reason is that yours have not yet been delivered to me; perhaps they were lost; however, you write that they contain nothing of value, which, by Hercules, I am glad. Otherwise, I know what your occupations are, so it is not necessary for you to excuse yourself to me.</p>
      <p>You order us to sell the horse as soon as we can; indeed, we will try. Now it can walk for the first time, but it cannot yet bear a rider; Master Philipp had it with him, and Pontisella will take it back later. Those good men are surprised that you write about expenses, they say they owe much more to you and yours. But because it is very lean and emaciated, I fear whether we will find a buyer... it might be better and more convenient to sell it in Zürich. But, what should be done, we wish to learn from Christoph.</p>
      <p>As soon as it could walk and bear a rider, there might be merchants among us who would ride to Zürich without your expenses. I received two crowns; but it would not have been necessary for you to pay so hastily.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, it pains me that you even think about asking about expenses, as if I do not owe you all my fortunes. I treated it very frugally and indeed, so that I made no expenses with it.</p>
      <p>I had a sick boy; while mine gave him attention, they neglected my son.</p>
      <p>Now, if our efforts are pleasing and acceptable to him, unless it has been abundantly satisfied. There is nothing new now.</p>
      <p>Those who come from Milan affirm that the new pope has passed away. But I affirm nothing yet.</p>
      <p>I ask you to inform Master Collin, my father-in-law, through your people that the barrel with grain has been returned to me, but now due to the pressure of time, I could not write. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church of Zürich, his lord and most revered patron.</p>
