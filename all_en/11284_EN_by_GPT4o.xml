      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Behold, once again I trouble you with my letters, but I ask you to grant pardon, for I continually interrupt your studies with my trifles; indeed, there are reasons for this. I previously sent the sphere through Myconius's maid, which I hope you have received; however, I forgot to send the center of the sphere and the leaden fittings, which connect the colures and support the axis of the world. I am sending these to you now and ask that you receive them with a fair mind.</p>
      <p>I do not write more now, lest I be a nuisance to you. I only ask this, that you ensure Martin Peyer receives the paper he desires through Froschauer and that the same is sent to Myconius.</p>
      <p>Please greet your mother and wife along with the entire family in my name. Farewell, most kind father, and keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, March 11, 1539. Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
