      <p>News. From Gomorrha, located 10 miles away from Ofen, a fortress against the Turks, a soldier from Ulm writes that he daily sees many Christians being led away by the Turks, which causes him distress. They are not allowed to attack the Turks; because the king does not want it, he wants to maintain peace. As a result, 6 companies of soldiers were mustered at Kopstein, which are being sent to Transylvania, while the Spaniards are withdrawing. The monk believes he will be able to hold Transylvania against the Turks. Shortly thereafter, an envoy arrived in Vienna, who declared the peace to the king. Consequently, Maximilian was elected as the supreme commander against the Turks along with many others. Houses in Vienna are being demolished, preparations are being made for the bastion, and there is great fear among the people. I have this from reliable and trustworthy sources.</p>
      <p>The emperor is ordering many horses and wagons; it is believed he intends to personally go to those from Magdeburg. The man had to describe the city to him with all its surroundings. The emperor has decided he will not abandon the pope. Thus, the war in Italy will begin; the emperor will cover two-thirds of the costs, the pope the other third. The pope is already before Parma. The alarm will be raised. It is believed that all of Saxony will rise against each other to relieve those from Magdeburg. May God grant luck and salvation to the poor. It is hoped that Lord von Heideck will accomplish something good in Saxony; many princes have gathered together and held a meeting. Those from Magdeburg have also come there. It is still quiet. It is certain that the Count Palatine was in Nancy, and the King of France sent Count von Pfalz to him; what they have discussed will soon come to light. War is imminent, and for a long time, it has been predicted that the electors would not come to Constance in vain. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
