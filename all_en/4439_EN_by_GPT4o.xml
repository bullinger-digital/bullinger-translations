      <p>Greetings. If I had been informed in time about the departure of this messenger, I would have written a longer letter; but since I am writing after dinner, fatigued from the day's work, you will forgive the brevity, especially since I must attend to tomorrow's sermon. I do not doubt that many and various rumors about the disturbances in France are being spread there, as almost everywhere. What the majority is planning, I do not know; what many hope for, it is not worth writing, lest I involve myself in their foolishness. At my request, Beza has undertaken a troublesome and dangerous expedition filled with many inconveniences, which I do not regret. Had I not intervened, many regions would be ablaze with a horrible fire.</p>
      <p>If God blesses our plans, we will have abundant reason to rejoice. Whatever happens, all good people, having thoroughly understood the matter, will judge that we have attempted nothing rashly.</p>
      <p>Our efforts are focused here to prevent our people from rioting. So far, we have made much progress; the outcomes of future times are in God's hands.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, our people are carried away by excessive confidence; for what we have always forbidden, they occupy temples or preach in public places. The brothers sent by us excuse themselves, saying they are unwillingly drawn or compelled by necessity, since no private house can accommodate four thousand. But since time would not suffice, more later.</p>
      <p>The senate has instructed me to ask you and our other brothers for a most just and not unpleasant matter. It has decided to support four boys in your city at public expense, so that they may advance in liberal studies and learn your language. Those chosen are considered by the schoolmasters to be of the best promise.</p>
      <p>Now, in the name of the senate, I implore your faithfulness to arrange lodgings for them, where they may be kept under pious and chaste discipline. I would not indeed wish to be importunate to you; however, because I am certain that you all will be inclined to this duty, I did not hesitate to request from you, as far as your convenience allows, what you were going to do willingly. I would like to discuss at length with you and other brothers; however, since I am drawn elsewhere, I defer to the next opportunity. Farewell, distinguished man and brother, revered from the heart, along with the best fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect, guide, preserve, and sustain you all to the end. I write no greetings from anyone, because no one knew I was going to write.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 6, the day before the messenger departs. Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>I am overwhelmed with great sorrow due to the recent death of our excellent brother Macarius. The church is deprived of a most faithful pastor, we of a most friendly colleague; I am personally bereft of a brother both most integral and almost half of my soul. The whole city mourns; but the more thoughtful are seized by deep grief.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and esteemed fellow minister.</p>
