      <p>S. Your letter dated the 12th of this month was sent here by Mr. Coignet through his own messenger. We are very surprised by the judgment of the Landgrave; but these are the arts of the Guises, who thus blind the eyes of the princes of Germany; I hope, however, that the Lord will open them again. We hear absolutely nothing about Condé, except that every day the largest cities and republics join him; for I hear that the people of Reims and Troyes in Champagne have made a pact with him. In what form the alliance is made, you have surely seen, or if you have not seen it, you will find it with my brother, to whom I am sending the form of that alliance described. Coignet has not received a single letter from the court or the king since the previous assembly, which is so strange to him that he hesitates and doubts what to do with the Swiss now gathered again in Solothurn; he thinks the letters are intercepted by Condé's people, and he does not mind, even if he is surprised. Yesterday, the old envoys, Consul Negelin and Diesbach, went there.</p>
      <p>We are now waiting to see what will happen.</p>
      <p>The money sent earlier is intended for other purposes and not for these uses, which is why it is believed that the Swiss, although unwilling, will stay at home. We hear nothing about Lyon; however, in Grenoble and Valence in the Dauphiné, all the churches are said to be reformed, and the Lord's work is proceeding successfully. The dealings with Savoy have been properly and smoothly rejected by my lords, the citizens; because since he does not want to accept the capitulation made in Basel, one can well think that there is nothing to negotiate with him, and it is intended to give him nothing at all.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen them and grant success! Consul Steiger is in Savoy, but he will return soon, then I will communicate to him what you have written. In the meantime, I will also advise others to be mindful.</p>
      <p>I am concerned that there will be a Lugano affair; the game is entangled there, although if one used the law, the peace of the land would not allow it, where they are stretching it. The spears should be equally long; but they do not want to.</p>
      <p>May God make it better one day.</p>
      <p>In Glarus, I am concerned, it will soon rise; I would like to see how they intend to behave towards them.</p>
      <p>I wonder if they sent envoys to Solothurn, since they have behaved so flatteringly before. I hear nothing from Valais; those favorable to the gospel live in such a way that they destroy more than they gain; that gives me even less hope. From the Dauphiné, in these days, some churches have requested ministers from us, who have also been granted to them. May the Lord make the churches grow and increase in this way.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else now; as soon as I learn something, I will inform you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your friends and brothers greet you, especially Haller, Hagius, Musculus, and Zehender. Give my regards to your wife, children, and your entire household, and finally to all friends and brothers in my name. Bern, May 18, 62.</p>
      <p>I do not yet know what yours has brought here; for the senate has not yet risen. He himself has been ordered to wait; in the meantime, I have written this.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and dearest compatriot. Zurich.</p>
