    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato is pleased with his good relationship with Bullinger. May it remain so. The reason for this letter is his and Bullinger's concern to promote the Gospel. He and his colleague Bartolomeo [Maturo], preacher in Oberbergell, warmly recommend Brother Gabriele, who has preached the Gospel in Morcote (in the Lugano region), to Bullinger, Johannes Rivius [probably Frisius], [Konrad] Pellikan, and the other colleagues in Zurich. The success Gabriele had in preaching the Gospel led to his expulsion. Now Gabriele wishes to explain to the people of Zurich the situation in this region and the positive consequences of a possible accession of Lugano and Locarno to the Gospel. He hopes for advice and help in order to be able to return honorably to his brothers [in Morcote] soon, thanks to the influence and diplomatic support of the people of Zurich. - Greetings. Bullinger wishes to answer Renato's last letter [No. 2279]. May they both agree in the interest of the Gospel.</p>

      <p>Camillus Renatus and Bartholomaeus Maturus of Cremona to Heinrich Bullinger and other excellent men, peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>From all your letters, I seem to have understood, and I am not mistaken, most kind Heinrich, how much you value me and how much I can promise myself about you, whether for my own sake or for others. I have plainly held this as certain until now and always, God willing, I hope to continue to do so. But even if fortune had fallen, by which I knew you would deny me everything, God forbid the omen, the nature of this letter is such that I am sure to obtain from you, by your judgment, whatever it is, deservedly, namely, whose every effort, diligence, and work is in promoting the discipline of Christ and the Gospel. The matter is this: Gabriel, our brother here, also a minister of the Gospel, about whom good things are heard, has publicly professed the Gospel for some time in the Lugano region, which is under the dominion of the Swiss, in a place called Morcote, with such effort and fruit that not a little glory has been added to Christ and the impious have received a great wound from the Gospel. Hence the disturbances, hence the dangers, hence he was expelled by the slanders of some. Now he himself runs to you, the most zealous ministers of propagating the Gospel, to explain the whole matter, in what state the affairs of the Gospel are in those places, what hope, what fruit is prepared from the added towns of Lugano and Locarno, and with the intention that, having used your advice and work for this matter, he may finally be restored by the consolation of the pious to complete the ministry from where he was expelled by the envy of the impious. For this reason, I and Bartholomaeus, the evangelical minister of Oberbergell, earnestly ask you, Johannes Rivius, Pellikan, and the other ministers of the Church of Zurich, most gracious brothers, and beseech you by our Lord Jesus Christ, to assist the already expelled brother Gabriel in whatever matters will be necessary, with your authority and favor, your zeal and work, so that he may be restored to the most eager brothers more quickly and honorably, and that without injury to the good, by obtaining a diploma from the rulers of your empire. We hope you will most zealously take care of this matter, as we greatly desire, so we certainly hope. Farewell in the Lord. All the brothers here greet you. You indeed, my Bullinger, respond to my previous letters, I ask from the heart, so that we may agree at some time with the fruit of the Gospel. Farewell again. From Vicosoprano of Oberbergell, December 19, 1545. To Heinrich Bullinger and the best brothers, most dear to us in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
