    <p xml:id="regest1">Happel understands that Bullinger refuses to recommend him to [Landgrave Philip of Hesse], because if the latter is indeed not well-disposed towards Bullinger, such a letter would do more harm than good. - Happel will soon find out how [the Landgrave] is disposed towards the [Zurichers], as he will visit him with the [letters of recommendation] from Bucer and Paul Fagius. Bucer's letter states that [the Landgrave] can learn details about the [Marburg] church and university from Happel; if a conversation takes place, Happel will talk about [the Zurichers] and the hostility of [Hessian] theologians towards them. - Happel will report at the next Strasbourg fair [June 24] what he was able to achieve.</p>

      <p>I do not disapprove, most courteous man, that you refused to recommend me to him, about whose goodwill towards you you were doubtful; for if his mind is alienated, your letters would not be as beneficial to me as they might be harmful. However, in a short time, I will understand how he is disposed towards you; for, equipped with letters from Bucer and Paul Fagius, I will meet him myself, and Bucer's letter among other things contains that he wishes to inquire from me about the affairs of our church and school and the accounts of individuals. If he does so, I will seize the light opportunity to mention you and your cause, and I will point out the envy and importunity conceived by some of our theologians against you, if perhaps he wishes to prevent it from his own, as he has always taken it badly until now.</p>
      <p>What I achieve, I will write at the next Strasbourg fair. Meanwhile, fare well with your whole household.</p>
      <p>Given from Frankfurt in the year 1545, hastily. Yours sincerely, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
