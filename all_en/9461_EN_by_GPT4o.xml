      <p>Greetings. Meanwhile, I remain uncertain and doubtful, not knowing whether my letter, written to you and Campello together 14 days ago, has been delivered to you in good faith, since in my last letter I wished to know this from you, and now both of you have written to me, yet neither has mentioned a word about it. For the news diligently recorded and shared with me by Mr. Scipione Lentulo, I give you my greatest thanks; for I am delighted by them and wish you to kindly greet that man on my behalf as diligently as possible and thank him in my name for his efforts and ask him to continue in his diligence. I will keep the condition proposed by Mr. Froschauer until he returns from Frankfurt; then I will explain everything to him and promptly report his response to you. Your poem does not seem to me to be biting or satirical. I will also try with Froschauer to see if I can achieve anything; if he proves difficult as usual, I will send it to Basel. The Gotz family is not entirely unknown to me. But since your parent and your family, who live today, are called Egli and not Gotz, I would retain the name Egli and not change anything or give adversaries an opportunity to mock or pour out their scurrility on the name Götz. In Frohndorf, there is an ancient and honorable family of the Joners, which, however, began to be called by the name Rüpli in living memory, which, although it seems more obsolete, they have nevertheless retained and are called today and wish to be called the Rüpli, even though the older name is the Joner. I think you should imitate this. I do not wish to increase your trouble and labor; however, if you collect a summary of those acts for me, I will be grateful. I send the heads of the peace, as they have been translated from the printed French copy. I wish that peace may firmly remain with you! If the peasants violate it to recover money, they will not only obtain money for themselves but will also incur greater expenses, which they will later be forced to pay in full or lose all their goods or at least expose them to danger. But since peasants, and also townspeople, rarely act wisely, we must pray to the Lord to govern things and keep us safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all of ours, Mr. Campello, Victor, both Pontisellas, the consuls, Charles, Bonet, and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 25th September 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The news I have received from my friends these days, I have enclosed here to repay the favor.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my kind and dear sir. Chur.</p>
