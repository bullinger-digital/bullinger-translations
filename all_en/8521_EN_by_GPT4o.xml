      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated March 20th. I am expecting you; for your arrival would be pleasing to me, allowing us to discuss common matters more intimately. I will inform our Gwalther of what you wished to be conveyed to him. I have also heard previously that the Spaniard has broken faith with the Venetians; however, I do not fully understand whether this occurred during the Turkish war or if he is newly threatening war against the Venetians. Ganthner is performing deeds worthy of himself. He lives, who will avenge. I am sending you, Campell, and the consul the booklets you see, intending to discuss these matters further with you when you come here.</p>
      <p>Now, please consider this brief writing kindly; for being very busy with other matters, I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Greet Campell, Bonet, Pontisella, and other good men from me most familiarly and kindly. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 23, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor in Chur at St. Martin, my gracious lord and dear brother. Chur.</p>
