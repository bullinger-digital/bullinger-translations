      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware, most learned Myconius, of what is to be hoped for regarding that concord between the Lutherans and the fanatics. You see the excerpt copied from the commentaries published at the Easter fair earlier this year, 1535. He wrote more and more vehemently on pages 127 and 128. In this work, he rages against the fanatics, but also defiles us with the most shameless lies. And there are those who not only fall at his knees as supplicants. May the gods destroy that womanly softness and perverse zeal for concord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed brother, and consider these things written to you.</p>
      <p>I have sent a similar excerpt to Bucer, so that he may see with whom he is dealing. I see no moderation here that will prevail with him, unless we completely deny the holy truth and say that only this most holy man of God has correctly understood the sacraments. But may the devil do that!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the day of John the Baptist, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the Basel church, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
