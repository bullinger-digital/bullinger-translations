    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on the internal difficulties in Bern: Treasurer Bernhard Tillmann was excluded from the council because he discouraged and persuaded Reformed refugees from Solothurn to give up their resistance without instructions from Bern, using threats. Venner Niklaus von Graffenried accepted a bribe of 10 crowns and subsequently lost his council position and his honor. Mayor Hans von Erlach firmly rejected a similar offer; there is talk of further corruption cases. Haller regrets that even staunch supporters of the Reformation could not resist the temptation of foreign money, as this weakened the position of the Evangelicals in Bern. The reason for the bribery attempts: Philibert de Compois, Lord of Thorens, who had lost four castles to an opponent, tried to obtain Bernese citizenship and Bern's support, which his rival sought to prevent through monetary gifts. On February 22, a meeting of the Reformed places is to take place in Bern, probably concerning the Solothurn matter. Haller has been ill. He requests the sending of transcripts of Theodor Bibliander's lectures on the prophets, Pellican's commentary on the prophets, Vadian's "Epitome," and Bullinger's commentary on the Corinthians. He asks Bullinger to answer his previous letters.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that various rumors about the disturbances in our republic are being spread among you, dearest brother. Therefore, I did not want to keep you in suspense any longer, even though everything is still unresolved, as I truly fear. This is the situation: Our treasurer, Bernhard Tillmann, who has held the office for six years, has been removed from his position. The people of Solothurn, despite having promised the delegates of all the cantons, did not want to hear or deal with anything from our side and sent away the ministers of the word. The treasurer himself had discouraged our party with certain threats to dissolve the assembly, and this without the commission of our magistrate, which is interpreted as the cause of all the trouble. On January 25th, he was removed by both councils and returned to his former state, although he hardly has the prudence and eloquence to suffice for it. These were the threats he uttered against the evangelicals gathered in our territory from Solothurn: "You will be punished for the rebellion or you will make friends into enemies." Secondly: "You will accept peace or a truce, without harm to the faith and without any negotiation, or if you do not, my lords will expel you from their territory." He added: "I speak for myself, my lords have not commanded me." Since he could not clear himself of these charges and satisfy both councils, he was ordered to remain silent by the councilors and citizens.</p>
      <p>On the 30th of this month, a certain bandit from Gruyères, Niklaus von Graffenried, a man venerable in age and exceedingly wealthy, fled to an asylum, which he had received from the same Gruyères' wife for a fee of 10 crowns. When he was given the opportunity to excuse himself before the dioceses present - perhaps fearing for himself, he refused - he was not only removed by the council and citizens but also considered infamous, to whom no trust should ever be given. The same Gruyères had offered the same number of crowns to Mayor Hans von Erlach, but he, in his integrity and faith, rejected the scoundrel so that he would not attempt this corruption again. It is said that another person, not insignificant in the senatorial order, had open hands for these gifts, which you will learn about when it becomes clear. Our republic is in such a miserable and difficult state, and when we see those, even the richest, being corrupted by such a small gift, those who once presented themselves as pillars of the word of God and promoted everything related to religion, being excluded from offices and the senatorial order, what should we think of those who are poor, who are either imprudent or papists? Two pious men were elected from the senate to the prefectures this year. The treasurer and the bandit were removed, and it is not yet the end. The selection among the citizens is not abundant. Either young and inexperienced or papists will have to suffice for them. Thus, public peace and religion will always be in danger. From this, you can easily conjecture that in such domestic tragedies, even the closest minds are separated, so that no one dares or wants to trust another. The common people certainly adhere firmly to the word and want the evil punished. They urge the senate. But no one is ignorant of the nature and customs of the common people. As for you to understand why money was distributed: There is a certain noble, a pious man, named Philibert de Compois, Lord of Thorens, who sits behind the Duke of Savoy; four castles were taken from him by another nobleman; he had requested to become a citizen of Bern so that he might be helped as a subject alone according to the rights of the alliances of the city of Bern and the Duke. To prevent this, money was distributed by his opponent, not coming from the French. It is a pity of God. I am very shocked by this.</p>
      <p>All Christian cities are called to a meeting in our city on February 22nd, I do not know for what reason, but I suspect it is because the people of Solothurn have falsely denied everything they promised. Make sure that your people do not deny. If they come, they will be well received, so that the old friendship may be renewed.</p>
      <p>As for me, I have been bedridden three times this month, but I have recovered in the meantime, desiring nothing more than for you to send something from Theodor, so that we are not entirely deprived of your studies. You can conveniently do this with the delegates, if they are at least coming to the meeting. You should also advise Christoph Froschauer. The prophets have been sent. I am expecting the last volume on Job, the Psalter, etc., and the rest of Vadian's works. I have not yet received anything from you on the Corinthians. Forgive me. I have written so hastily that I have not read over the letter.</p>
      <p>Last day of January 1534.</p>
      <p>I know I have asked much of you in previous letters. If they are still at hand and you can, please respond.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of Christ in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
