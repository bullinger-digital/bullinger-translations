    <p xml:id="regest1">He has only briefly read the letter from the people of Constance to Luther, but it seems to be in accordance with the Holy Scripture and the response [of the Swiss]; Pellikan expresses his opinion in a separate letter, while Theodor [Bibliander] is reserved in his judgment and Leo [Jud] has not yet read the letter. The Zurich council has approved the response [of the Swiss]. Greetings. Pellikan sends the requested items; Bullinger sends two writings of Luther and Zwick's letter [No. 915?].</p>

      <p>Bullinger's response.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have received, dearest brother, your response prepared for Doctor Luther. I have skimmed it, not yet read it thoroughly, and it did not displease me. Your writings seem to be in accordance with the Scriptures. You have responded with nothing other than what we have responded. I first gave it to Pellikan to read, and he wrote a letter in which, I believe, he expressed his opinion. He said to me: I see nothing being responded by them other than what has been responded by us. Theodor is reluctant to express his judgment in such important matters. He constantly fears that Luther will not accept our response. Leo, when I was writing this, had not yet read it. For on Sundays, we are entirely occupied with ecclesiastical matters. If anything else occurs to us, you will be informed shortly, either by a personal messenger. Indeed, I find nothing in your writings that does not please me. Continue to love our church. For we love you and yours. We must pray to the Lord to soften the heart of the stubborn man and unite us in true harmony of spirit.</p>
      <p>Our council received the response prepared in Basel yesterday.</p>
      <p>Greet Conrad and Thomas, the most excellent, very much, along with the other group of friends.</p>
      <p>What you requested from Pellikan, he himself [will send] to you. I am sending two booklets of Luther and your letter, but on the condition that you return them. For I have not yet replied.</p>
      <p>November 26, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Doctor Johannes Zwick, dearest brother by far.</p>
