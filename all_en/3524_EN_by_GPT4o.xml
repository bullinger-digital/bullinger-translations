      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have nothing to report except that Mr. Calvin from Geneva announces that persecution against the faithful is being instituted in France; the king has allowed three cardinals to conduct an inquisition and has granted them the power of life and death over the saints without any appeal. Therefore, we must pray for our brothers and members of the same body.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, great preparations are being made in France; very large exactions are also being made. May the Lord comfort the wretched and, with His glorious coming, put an end to this bloody battle. Mr. Laelius brought these letters to me, which I earnestly ask you to take care of diligently.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>What you recently wrote, I continually find to be true.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 4, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his godfather and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
