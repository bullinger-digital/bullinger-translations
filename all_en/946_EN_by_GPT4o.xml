      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you. Our Leonhard Hospinianus, who is to be our future steward, delivered your letter to me on June 17th, which undoubtedly declared the sweetly breathing friendship that has been preserved between us for almost twelve years now, most learned Bullinger. If only I could be a living letter with you once and see and hear you in person, so that I could perceive your love towards me and your most favorable goodwill from your very face and eyes, etc. Last year, returning from the Valais with our royal companion, we wanted to visit the brothers in Zurich; but our church was in great danger at that time; therefore, it was necessary to hurry to the brothers who, deprived of their offices at home, were eagerly expecting us.</p>
      <p>And now that the opportunity has been offered by the prince (who called me to your baths in Baden as a good companion) to greet you, the health of my body and my feet, which refuse to do their duty, a most troublesome swelling, is a hindrance. I therefore pray to the gracious deity and his son Jesus Christ, that what is now denied to us mortals may be granted after the glory of immortality has been attained (certainly reserved with Jesus Christ) to enjoy in a wonderful way with mutual embraces. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>Now I will say a few words about the church. It is safe as before from the superstitions of the antichrist; but a great contempt for the word of God has crept in, and the discipline of Christ has almost entirely perished within a few months. I wrote to our monarch, our brothers having been called to a recent synod because of this; but what the delaying prince will answer, long days will reveal. In summary: The Swabian land in the upper towns is loose and cannot bear Christ. However, I do not doubt the faith of our prince; among the good, he is better. If only he would proceed as he can, while the mercy of the kind God grants better times.</p>
      <p>The church of Strasbourg is in great danger and peril. There is fighting on both sides;</p>
      <p>Christ has his own, as they boast, who nevertheless threaten with seditions and fights; the antichrist also defends his own with his factions having regained strength.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the mercy of God must be implored, lest the catastrophe be evil.</p>
      <p>Hedio, on the 17th of this month, when I also received yours, writes to me as follows: "Doctor Copius, the envoy of our city to the Imperial Majesty, will bring here certain news of the Emperor's arrival in Upper Germany; now he is in Cologne, settling the sedition that is between the citizens and the clerics. However, Philipp Melanchthon writes that in Saxony the doctrine of the Son of God is as it was before the war, and nothing at all has changed, and there is some sort of confederation and society between the King of Denmark and the cities of the Baltic Sea, etc. The gracious God should be prayed for, that we may be one in Christ everywhere among the nations, whether they are monarchs or kings and princes or from the common people; but not all have faith, and many are called and few are chosen.</p>
      <p>There are others who certainly affirm that the Count Palatine of the Rhine is preparing lodgings for the Emperor, if indeed, after settling the affairs in Cologne, he will proceed to Mainz to greet that devout archbishop, the patron and promoter of the interim doctrine, and then the Elector Palatine. From there, he will set out for Nuremberg to hold a colloquium with his brother Ferdinand and some bishops, before the diet begins in Augsburg. This from a trustworthy man; although others think it is a diet, it is certain that the Emperor's councilors and captains have also been summoned to the Emperor. Grandville, on the 10th of this month, passing through Montb√©liard, was heroically received by Duke Christopher in a nearby village with five tents erected in a certain meadow and all kinds of delicacies and courtly dishes abundantly provided. It would be long to write about this.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this young man named Hermann, a Saxon by birth, who was in charge of the school at Nicolaus Regius; he is returning to his homeland and wanted to see Zurich first, etc.</p>
      <p>I am forced to be brief on this very large sheet. Farewell in Christ. All of ours greet you. You also, in turn, will greet your sons-in-law Zwingli and Lavater, to whom I wish the blessing of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that Juno, the pronuba, may favor the work they have begun. Encourage them to imitate their ancestors, who died for the glory of Christ, and to imitate you, their father-in-law, in the constancy of the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>Also greet Pellican and Gwalter by name in our name with all the confessors of Christ. Farewell well a second time.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, June 24, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the very pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent minister of the word of God of the people of Zurich, to be observed as a brother.</p>
