    <p xml:id="regest1">Arrival of Bucer in Bern. Bullinger is to take care of the education of one of Lucia May's sons, who is staying in Zurich with Enoch Metzger. The disagreement between Haller and Megander could, in Bucer's opinion, be settled by Leo Jud. Haller wishes for a visit from Bullinger. Greetings to Pelikan.</p>

      <p>S. I received the letters and Bucer with the greatest pleasure. From them, I understood that Bucer is with us and I will understand more when he has spoken before our congregation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Mays are sending this boy to us, who has been trained in the basics of both grammars, and whose mother, a widow with 12 children, wanted him to be especially recommended to you through me, so that you may act as his tireless patron. He will have his sustenance with a certain Enoch, as he has so far taken care of the boys of that family, but regarding attending schools and lectures, he will follow your advice after you have tested his education. With us, he had two teachers, one a common schoolmaster, the other Rellicanus, who benefits the boys greatly with his exceptional diligence. If he could also have such teachers with you, the mother will be ready to repay. You will more willingly invest such effort and care in him because Nikolaus von Wattenwil has his sister as a wife and has other excellent men in his family. Therefore, whatever good you do for him, it will benefit not only me but the entire May family. Do as we all hope from you.</p>
      <p>I will strive to put an end to our disagreement. For, as you know, nothing is more adverse to me than to disagree with my brother in faith. Bucer indicated that this could be achieved through Leo. However, I will do nothing without your advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love and hold me in esteem as you have until now, and use me up to the altar. If only I could speak with you even once! I cannot leave the nest, so you cannot escape.</p>
      <p>May 11, 1533.</p>
      <p>Whatever has been done with us, I will write to you as soon as I have a messenger. Greet Pelikan. Both of you continue to help the brothers everywhere. If I did not seem to flatter you, I would write how your work pleases ours.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
