      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter is a Doctor of Theology. I consider him to be learned and pious. He has come to Strasbourg, sent by the Archbishop of Cologne. It was agreed that he should also visit the churches in our city, Zurich, and Constance before proceeding to his calling. He inquires and discusses willingly, but only for the sake of learning; therefore, I believe there is nothing to fear from him. Please receive him kindly, as is your custom.</p>
      <p>He can speak on many various matters, which you will be able to inquire about from him. He knows certain things about the English, and he has brought some news about the Emperor, some of which he learned here, including that Count Wilhelm was taken captive to Paris and that the king addressed him with these words: "Go to Paris and learn to be a good count, as you once were, but have unlearned." Remarkable, if it is true. The rest you will hear from the doctor.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 16, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, my brother in the Lord, to be respected. Zurich.</p>
