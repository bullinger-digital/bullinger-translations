      <p>S. I pray to the Lord again and again that your waters may be most healthy for you, most reverend father. I am sending here the report of the Tuscan judgment to our communities regarding the demands of the Swiss envoys. What was decided everywhere about it yesterday is not yet known. For only tomorrow, when they have met again, will the popular votes be collected. It is surprising if our exiles and refugees have committed such things, that any human protection exists for them.</p>
      <p>The most distinguished man, Mr. Treasurer Thomanus, dealt with me in very few words and indeed more amicably than expected, and if he had not always been occupied with various cares and businesses, he intended to meet with me and discuss each matter more extensively; but he also reminded me in a letter written on the way to me, when he was returning to you: there are several honorable men who say that the preachers of Rhaetia bear no small blame for these disturbances. Immortal God! Are we to blame because we teach that justice must be upheld; but those who are at fault accuse us, whose practices the earth could no longer bear? I replied extensively to Mr. Treasurer: 'If we are such, why does the magistrate not punish us?' But because we accuse the magistrate, perhaps the blame will be transferred to others. But what is the need to argue about who is to blame? Let this accusation, which I send, be read; let the causes of those who boast of being so innocent be examined more diligently, and it will not be difficult for even a blind man to see what the true cause and origin of these disturbances is. Certainly, the wolf both accuses and condemns the sheep. We will appear shortly at the next assembly and ask the lords: if we are such, let them remove us from the midst as we deserve; if not, let them defend us and bear witness to our innocence.</p>
      <p>We will hear where those honorable men are who try to cover their filth with our innocence. Today the judges meet again in Tuscany: but in a few days they will disperse. They are determined to reform the impious abuse of certain goods in the Valtellina, so that ministers of both professions may enjoy equal stipends.</p>
      <p>This very quickly, May 25, 1573, at night.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Bonett, Mr. Karl, Mr. Victor, and our entire synod, which ended successfully, send their greetings to your eminence and sincerely wish you all the best.</p>
      <p>Chur, Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>Your eminence's most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man of the highest and all kinds of virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor and bishop of the church in Zürich, his singular lord, to be honored with the greatest respect. Zürich.</p>
