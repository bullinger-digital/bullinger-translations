      <p>S. D. I sincerely wish you good health; I am, according to my age, in good health, thanks to God. I am compelled to write to you, most kind Bullinger, with a heavy heart, to inform you about the events that took place this past winter in our region of Graubünden, although I do not believe they are unknown to you, as they have likely been extensively reported by the ministers of Chur, our brothers, who have sharpened their pens against me. If I thought they had communicated the entire series of events to you without excessive bias, I would not burden you with my displeasure in your public and private affairs; however, to ease my own mind, I pray you will not be annoyed by reading my present letter. It happened in the month of November last year that a certain rumor arose against our bishop, that he had been in a meeting in Baden with a papal legate and there conspired against the state of the Lords of the Three Leagues, and thus was guilty of the crime of lèse-majesté. With this new development, the people of Chur summoned the three jurisdictions from the League of God's House to them and, having elected three delegates, sent them through all the communities of the League of God's House with certain articles; however, the main one was against the bishop regarding his actions with the papal legate, with the aim and effect of stirring up trouble and having the bishop condemned as a capital offender. It is believed that the ministers of Chur were aware of this conspiracy.</p>
      <p>At that time, the Chur fairs were being held, to which, as is customary, the council of all Three Leagues convened. When gathered, the bishop appeared and cleared himself of the false accusations against him, offering to submit to justice and suffer the due penalty if he were legally convicted; indeed, he recounted the reason for his visit to the legate. The entire council approved and confirmed the bishop's exoneration.</p>
      <p>The delegates, however, running through the communities, were recalled by the council, and a particular assembly of the League of God's House was held over all the matters for which those three jurisdictions had sent their envoys, protesting against the bishop. It was decreed by that assembly, as a certain document requested on the matter shows, notwithstanding those objections. Once again, those three communities were gathered, along with others summoned without the usual order observed in our Graubünden, and they fabricated new articles, which were eventually approved by the majority of the League of God's House at the assembly held on St. Paul's Day, despite the bishop's protest and insistence that he should not be deprived of his rights and prescriptions by force, but rather that a legal judgment should be made on the differences, and thus the whole matter was postponed to the next dedication fair. Meanwhile, the ministers of Chur sent letters to all the preachers of our valley, requesting and urging them to praise the proposals made by the delegates against the bishop to the communities and to encourage the people to embrace them, so much so that some ministers, at their suggestion, called the bishop a traitor to the country. They eventually suffered the penalties of the law.</p>
      <p>You now hear, most prudent brother, what snares those unrestrained conspirators have laid to capture the defenseless bishop.</p>
      <p>When the bishop sensed such machinations against him, he called and requested friends bound by blood or affinity to come to his defense, lest his enemies do him harm. I also presented myself with others and supported the usual means to ensure the order of justice was maintained and peace remained firm on both sides, as explained above. The ministers of Chur do not cease to denounce me to good men as a deserter of the divine word; with all diligence, I have strived to suppress the kindled fire so that it does not spread further, and therefore not to oppose the holy religion in any way, nor was a single word about religious contention brought up in all the circulated actions. Indeed, the people of Chur, to promote their purpose, called to themselves, and even made a legate, a most impious man who never approaches sermons but is entirely and thoroughly imbued with papal leaven. However, lest you believe I am applauding or defending the bishop in his failings, I indeed confess him to be a man of impure life and burdened with other crimes, and through Travers, I have admonished him orally and in writing to adopt a more exemplary life, fitting to his rank; otherwise, he should certainly expect the Lord to visit him with His rod one day. This is as true as Jesus Christ is the true God, although my exhortation has been little heeded by him. May God grant him a healthier spirit.</p>
      <p>As for the ministers of Chur, I do not wish to descend into hateful disputes; I have never been of such a mind towards anyone. No one is free from fault; everyone will have to give an account to the Lord for the talent entrusted to them.</p>
      <p>You now have, most pious Bullinger and most beloved brother in Christ, what has transpired in our disputes up to this point, and unless I had communicated it to you in full, written by my own hand, my mind would not have found rest. Please consider these very rudimentary words, uncultivated by any phrase of erudition, as they are, with goodwill.</p>
      <p>If I have erred or sinned in any way, I await your correction, to which I offer to comply. Live and farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>From Zuoz, 6th day before the Kalends of May 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Travers.</p>
