      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I give you immense thanks for the matters I found in your letters; I will not be negligent in repaying the favor. The city of Metz has been handed over and the Baron of Mansfeld captured, who wanted to escape by making an attack.</p>
      <p>Now the Imperial forces, attacked by the French at Avenches, are struck with fear, they flee or surrender, as they expect no help from the Emperor. Martin von Rossen has fled; they say he is in the fortress of Ghent. The Queen is in Brussels, very ready to flee. Frankfurt is besieged by Margrave Albrecht and Maurice; for they have joined their armies to prevent any unexpected event. The Landgrave of Hesse complains that he has suffered great damage from those who were never harmed by him. Regarding the Turks, we have this from Mr. Lazius: The Turk is sending a large army against Transylvania and us; but the King has fortified Transylvania with three German legions and one Spanish, as well as 18,000 Hungarians, so that he can be safe against all Turkish attempts. In Hungary, there are scattered Germans, Italians, and Hungarians numbering 30,000, and more are gathering. King Ferdinand is called by the Hungarians, who will soon, with an equipped army he has gathered in Bohemia, go to meet the Turk and overthrow all his forces. This is what he says. Thus we see Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Transylvania, and the Kingdom of Naples, indeed almost all of Europe, to be in great turmoil. But few are found, both among kings and princes, who amend their lives, establish true religion, and invoke and worship God with heartfelt devotion. This in brief.</p>
      <p>I will send the books you request shortly, if I can obtain them in any way. I wrote to Strasbourg, but received no response.</p>
      <p>The chief scribe will respond for himself. Some of the soldiers... return from the French camp... sick, tattered, and without money, and they cannot bear the heat and the hardships of war. The tumult was almost stirred up by our peasants, who did not want to touch the Emperor's lands; but they subscribed to the councils of the cities. Farewell. July 20, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Gast from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor at the church in Zürich, his dearest teacher. Zürich.</p>
