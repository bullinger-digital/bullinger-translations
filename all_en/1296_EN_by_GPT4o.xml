      <p>I give you immortal thanks, and I shall give them as long as I live, most learned man; for I cannot affirm that I will repay you: for I do not seem to be able to respond to your great services, unless perhaps you will think that I am repaying the favor when I will remember. And not without reason: for I have received from you letters written most gravely and eloquently, which indeed were most pleasing to me, both because, having set aside more serious matters, you deigned to write to me, who am unworthy of the letters of such a learned man, from such a distant region in your advancing age, and also because your writings are of such a kind that they seem to contain not some common things for delighting, but pious and divine things for teaching, advising, and consulting, especially those which are particularly suitable to my age, sex, and the dignity of our family; in which, as in all other things that you have published for the greatest benefit of the Christian republic, you have shown not only that you are exquisitely learned and endowed with singular erudition, but also a clever, prudent, and pious counselor, who knows nothing but good, feels nothing but divine, commands nothing but useful, and produces nothing but honest, pious, and worthy of such a revered father. O how fortunate I am! To whom such a friend and wise counselor has fallen, (for Solomon has it), and who am now joined by the right of kinship and friendship with a man so learned, a theologian so pious and a true champion of religion. I think I owe many things to God Almighty, and especially that, after he deprived me of the pious Bucer, a most learned man and most holy father - who did not cease day and night to supply me with what was necessary for establishing and forming life, and who advanced my course and progress in all probity, piety, and knowledge of letters, and incited me with his best advice - he granted you, most esteemed man, to me in his place, who, as I hope, will be willing to add spurs to me, who am slow and dragging, as you have begun. For nothing more desirable can happen or occur to me than to be led by the letters and most salutary advice of such illustrious men, whose virtues no one can sufficiently proclaim; and that the same may happen to me as to Blesilla, Paula, and Eustochium, whom that divine (as it is said) Jerome instructed and led to the knowledge of divine things by his held sermons; or as to that aged woman to whom the divine John wrote a certain hortatory and truly theological letter; or as to the mother of Severus, who used the advice of Origen and acquiesced to his admonitions: all of whom did not acquire as much praise and benefit from the form of the body, nobility of birth, and abundance of wealth, as they drew glory and happiness from the advice of the most prudent men, because those men, conspicuous for such singular erudition and admirable piety, did not disdain to lead them by the hand to all the best things, and to suggest what would have the greatest weight for eternal salvation and the happiness of future life. That you may deign to do this for me, since you should be considered neither the least in genius nor erudition nor piety among all of them, I ask you again and again. You must think me audacious, who so boldly demand this; but if you are willing to consider the reason of my counsel, namely that I wish to draw from the treasury of your piety those things which may conduce both to forming morals and to preserving faith in Christ my savior, you will neither be able to turn this, which I do, to my fault, nor will you wish to do so for your humanity and prudence.</p>
      <p>From the booklet full of true and unfaked religion, which you recently sent to my father and me, I gather the sweetest flowers as from a most pleasant garden; and my father also, as far as his most serious business allows, is diligently engaged in its reading: and whatever fruit we both will derive from it, for that we must give you and God immortal thanks on your behalf. For we do not think it right that through you and your likes, of whom not a few are born in this most fortunate part of Germany, we should receive so many and such truly divine gifts from God Almighty with ungrateful minds.</p>
      <p>For we are accustomed, as is fitting, to repay benefits with benefits to men, and to show ourselves mindful of the gifts bestowed. How much more, then, should we strive to serve divine goodness, if not to respond in every part, at least to embrace with joyful minds what it bestows, and to give thanks from the heart for them!</p>
      <p>Now I come to the praises which your letters attribute to me, which I ought neither to claim nor in any way to acknowledge: but whatever divine goodness has bestowed upon me, I refer it all to Him as the highest and sole author of all my affairs, which have any appearance of virtue; whom I would like you, most honorable man, to ask in my name with your constant prayers, that He may so moderate me in this part and all my affairs, that I may not be found unworthy of such great kindness. My most illustrious father had intended to write to your humanity and likewise to give thanks for your excellent labors undertaken and that singular humanity, by which induced you inscribed the fifth decade to his name and published it under his auspices, unless he had been called away to the farthest ends of Britain by the most serious affairs of royal majesty; but when he is free from public occupations, he affirms that he will write to you most diligently. Finally, if you show me some way and method, as I am now beginning to study Hebrew, which I should follow in this course of studies with the greatest benefit, you will render me most indebted to you. Farewell, the highest honor and ornament of the whole Christian church, and may God Almighty preserve you for a long time for us and His church!</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Johanna Gray.</p>
