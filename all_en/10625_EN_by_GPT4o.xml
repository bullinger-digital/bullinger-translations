      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since those brothers from our midst have decided to visit their native homes and pass by you, I did not want them to come to you without a testimony that they are worthy and have been proven in ministry for many years, so that they may be recommended to you. One, namely Konrad, is already known to you, while the other, formerly of the Teutonic Order near our city in Köniz, was among the first to confess the gospel of Christ with me. If you do anything in their favor, do not doubt that it is done for me.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what I wrote to you most recently, consider it seriously; for I cannot help but fear that a great calamity threatens our church, because those who were the first both in the council and from the gospel, like our Sepianus, are now the foremost persecutors of all ministers, with the greatest regard for persons, so that one who is Swabian, even if he is upright in ministry and conduct, is scarcely counted among the herdsmen. Meanwhile, Franz remains silent, I am close to silence due to poor health, and the others are generally held in contempt by everyone in the field. What else can I say here but that God will send famine to those who now see themselves as satisfied. Therefore, I beseech you, dearest Heinrich, do not fail me, your friend, with your advice, as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>Megander, Rellicanus, and Simon are in good health.</p>
      <p>If there is any news with you, add it to your letter: about Württemberg, the Münsterites, Bucer, concord with Luther, and others, also whether your works on Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians are under the press.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, let our secrets remain with us.</p>
      <p>June 5, year 35.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>I will return the well-preserved copy to its messenger and in due time.</p>
      <p>Megander has prepared for the press commentaries on both letters to Timothy.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of the Zürich church, his dearest brother.</p>
