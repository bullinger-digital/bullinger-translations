      <p>Greetings. If you are well, most esteemed father, it is good; I am indeed well with my family.</p>
      <p>I sincerely grieve that you have lost your consul, who was greatly deserving in matters of the Christian religion and the Swiss republic. However, I congratulate all the pious that Lavater has succeeded him. May the Lord grant him the heart of David and other pious leaders and a long life!</p>
      <p>Our Theodoric, that surgeon and string player from Freiburg, has been unhappily absorbed by the military, into which he was sent by his father. I hear that the people of Bern are somewhat coming to their senses after reading Luther's insane pamphlet, which I also hope to read, if possible, so that I may better understand the response, which they say you are preparing, when I can obtain it.</p>
      <p>I sent you perhaps a month and a half ago an ancient bronze coin bearing the image of a certain emperor, if I am not mistaken, equaling the size of half a teston. I am uncertain whether you have received it, nor do I know if you have returned it. I would like you to inform me about this matter.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write about. The royal pensioners are very hostile; they no longer expect any of his sermons. That veteran from Freiburg, joyful in the evening, recently passed away during the night. Our soldiers, all punished to a man, were forced to swear that they would no longer go into military service without the knowledge and against the will of the magistrates.</p>
      <p>I send here, as is my custom, these small tokens of my esteem to your children. Our people greet you. Greet your wife in my name, who is like a mother to me, and your children. Farewell and love me as you always do. January 3, 1545.</p>
      <p>You will give a shilling to Brigitta.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours from the heart,</p>
      <p>Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>Also greet in my name Mr. Johannes Keller and his wife.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Antistes of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, always to be greatly respected by his father.</p>
