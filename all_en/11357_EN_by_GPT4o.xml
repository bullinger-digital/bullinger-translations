    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's report on the English King [Henry VIII] confirms his distrust, which he has harbored since the king's willful divorce [from Catherine of Aragon]; however, he is pleased about the progress of the Reformation elsewhere. He hears from Italy that the Turks have wrested Castelnuovo from the Emperor [Charles V] and have cruelly raged among the garrison; now they plan to move over the opposite Loreto towards Rome. Mayor [Diethelm] Röist could not write because of the grape harvest, which has been bountiful. He asked Heinrich Tuggener to procure the [1535 printed] German-Latin New Testament, with which he wishes to acquire basic knowledge of Latin; he asks Bullinger for help if Michael [Schwyzer?] no longer has any for sale. Pastor [Johannes Keller] is pleased with Bullinger's greeting; greetings.</p>

      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear lord and brother, may God's grace be with you, along with my friendly greetings and willing service, etc. I received your letter on Sunday, the 5th of October, and understood therein the disposition of the King of England, as I have always assessed it. The dangerous (willful, arbitrary) divorce from his first wife displeased me so much that I never believed he had a heartfelt love for the word of God. However, it must be so that apostasy and persecutions occur, so that the believers are tested and learn to trust no man, but to look only to God, whether people fall behind, ahead, or beside them. But I am glad to hear that the gospel is advancing elsewhere, and I desire that those are well grounded in faith; God will not let them sink again soon, etc. New news: There is one who transports merchant goods from Italy to Germany, who was with me in Rheineck, who informed me that he was in Milan within 8 days. There, credible letters came to his master, whom he serves, that the Turk had forcibly taken a very strong and good castle from the Emperor, called Castelnuovo, which is a pass (passage, strait) and blockade at that place of the sea, though with great loss of his people, as the Spaniards and landsknechts, stationed there as reinforcements, performed excellent, great deeds; but the multitude of artillery and people that the Turk had there caused them the damage. And after the conquest of the castle, whatever he found remaining, that was not struck dead, he had their noses and ears cut off and took them away in the galleys. He, the Turk, also has the mentioned castle built entirely strong and fortified and finally intends to move directly next spring on the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, from there to Rome, to receive a plenary indulgence from the Pope. For if he holds the castle and pass, one can no longer defend against him. There is also a court against Loreto, to be reckoned over the sea, and such a conquest is to occur within two months. And although the Pope and his followers have well deserved such punishment, there are many pious innocent people who must suffer therein, which is to be pitied. May God grant them and us all grace for true repentance and right improvement, so that he will take away these and other punishments from us, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet my lords and brother-in-law, Mayor Röist, on my behalf very much. Also tell him not to be angry that I have not written to him; the harvest (the grape harvest) is the reason, as much more wine than anyone expected, by the grace of God, will be, and at Buchberg good, but elsewhere it is very much like the Zurich wine, etc.</p>
      <p>I have written to my steward Heiny Tuggener to send me a New Testament, where the Latin and German are printed side by side, as they were printed in Zurich years ago, as I think it is the best way to acquire a beginning of Latin from it; I am very eager to learn it. It is my request to you, if perhaps Michael no longer has any, to help elsewhere for the money; as I am very much in need of it, etc. Your greeting, which you gave to my preacher, pleased him very much. He also sends you many greetings and friendly thanks. My wife and I greet you and your household very much, etc. Greet for me Master Löwen, the provost, and other my lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Given in Rheineck, Monday, the 6th of October in the year 1539. Your ever faithful friend and brother Hans Haab, citizen of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in the minster at Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and brother.</p>
