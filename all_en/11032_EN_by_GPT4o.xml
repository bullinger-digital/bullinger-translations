    <p xml:id="regest1">At the request of Gryn채us, albeit reluctantly, he takes a position on the letter [of Capito and] Bucer to Luther. He finds no reason to doubt Bucer's sincerity, as Bucer truthfully reports and tries everything to reconcile with Luther, both with his apology for the long delay in negotiations and with his assertion that Oecolampadius and Zwingli had acknowledged the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper; his reference to the example of other churches is also not to be blamed. That Bucer expresses reservations about Zwingli's doctrine and interprets the attitude of the Swiss theologians as a cautious consideration for the common people serves to please Luther and also hits on something correct. Although Bucer's "retractions" also displease Myconius, Christians should repay evil with good. The Swiss fear of a relapse into Papacy has its merits; nevertheless, everything must be examined impartially. If Bucer suggests that the Swiss have revised their understanding of the Lord's Supper, this is no reason to be angry with him. Luther will not deviate from his understanding of the words of institution; however, emotions should not be an obstacle to approaching him. Viewed soberly, only good can be hoped for from Bucer's letter as a whole. Myconius writes confidentially; he asks Bullinger to act moderately and warns of the dire consequences of a failure of the concord, especially since the princes and cities [of the Schmalkaldic League] are now acting so obviously with God's assistance.</p>

      <p>Greetings. At the request of Mr. Gryn채us, I reluctantly take on the task of writing to you about Bucer's letter to Luther; I do so reluctantly because I know you did not send your own letter to him for me to respond, but rather to hear his own opinion and judgment about Bucer and his letter. Moreover, I am not the one who can weigh such significant matters with the dignity they deserve, and even less so when it is necessary to respond, especially with minds so disturbed. Nevertheless, while I comply with his request, I do what I can; for I briefly indicate how I would receive Bucer's letter if it were my matter. Therefore, I do not want you to think that I intend to change your mind here, but simply to do what I proposed, and this at the behest of Gryn채us.</p>
      <p>I have read and reread Bucer's letter with Gryn채us and alone. And while I seek his mind, I find it to be what I could wish for in a reconciling friend. This very fact has deterred me more from writing, as I see that we view his writing with different eyes, and I fear that perhaps you would receive what I write differently than I intend. Nevertheless, I thought it necessary to fulfill what I had undertaken. Therefore, I say freely that Bucer seems to me to have completely fulfilled the duty of a friend in his actions, indeed in writing to Luther. For he has everywhere rightly testified to the truth of the action and has tried in every way to reconcile Luther with us. For when he recounts the reasons why the response was so late, he seems to recount them both truthfully and amicably to me. Were not the meetings and deliberations the reasons for the delay? In these matters, however, which have been done and in what manner, while he recounts them, he cannot be judged to have erred at all, even less so when you asked him to adapt everything to the understanding of your people in the letters. He acts for concord when he says that Oecolampadius and Zwingli acknowledged the presence of Christ in the supper. Would that God had willed these heroes to live longer with us! For there is no doubt that the churches would have beautifully agreed long ago. Through the catalog, he wanted to invite us to be moved to think more religiously about what was being done. He certainly did what is customary when we try to lead by examples. Did he sin here?</p>
      <p>But you say: "We ourselves see all this well enough, and there is no need for your judgment, especially of one who is blind; there are other things that move us. For what was the point of saying that Zwingli acknowledged the presence of the Lord in the supper imperfectly, when how he felt here is known to everyone? What also, to thus expose our weakness and fear, our lack of judgment, our misguided affection, as if we were still children in the knowledge of the truth? What finally, to propose so hatefully the stupidity of the people, their rudeness, their stubborn judgment, and I don't know what else? Could these not have been omitted or said differently?"</p>
      <p>I say frankly, if anything was sinned here, I do not see it, or if I see anything, it is nevertheless very slight to me. For Zwingli, although he rightly and truly felt about the presence of the Lord in the supper, never nevertheless sustained to express it in words as Luther expressed it, lest he seem to attribute anything to the papacy, indeed lest that handle be taken from his words. But as it is to feel with Luther about the presence imperfectly, so Bucer could not speak otherwise with him - unless he wanted to speak more obscurely. The weakness, to which Bucer conceded not a little, I indeed acknowledge so willingly in many as in myself first, as I see it hinder that we still understand the security of the Lutherans, by which they confess and assert that Christ is truly and substantially eaten in the supper besides the eating of faith, as what can be done even outside the supper. For what they say, I indeed will never henceforth pronounce to be a dream, but rather the strength of the grace of faith, especially when I see them here to be so fearless; we ourselves testify to be full of fear when we say that we must beware lest by new formulas of speaking we give a handle to the wicked or the weak to cry out that we have deviated and even that the papacy will soon be restored in full. But what need is there to pronounce this to Luther? So that he might certainly be made more easily ours and teach, if we were willing, what would conduce to shaking off fear, and extend a hand to the fearful. For I hardly think anyone to be so strong that he does not sometimes need the help of a stronger one. This is what I see enough around the business of the matter, about which alone I want you to understand what is said. For let it be, we feel as Luther does, yet we do not dare to speak so unless with added glosses, while he speaks only the words of Christ, the apostles, and the fathers. What is it then, that I should be angry with Bucer, because he wrote thus, when I see his mind here as devoted to Luther, so friendly to us.</p>
      <p>But you say: "While everything seems golden to you that Bucer says, what, I ask, does it seem, what he says about our lack of judgment concerning the Retraction, does that also please you?" Would that meanwhile, while he wrote that, he had slept a deep sleep! Not indeed because of the argument of the Eucharist, as in which, although something can displease, yet the similarity of his (which is also of Doctor Vadianus) reconciles the rest more than enough. But what he inserts about Zwingli, about the Epistolary, about the preface of Theodorus, and I don't know about what others, I wish had been omitted. But what is done cannot be undone. What shall we do then? Let us return good for evil, if we wish to be Christians, if we wish to be true ministers of Christ. For if we do otherwise, it is to be feared lest we have God less propitious to us sometime.</p>
      <p>As for what he introduces about the nature of the people, I indeed cannot deny; for how often have we complained about this among ourselves before now? And you, if I am not mistaken, did not simply state this among the people of Strasbourg. Although when I look more closely at what he says, he does not entirely attribute everything to vice, while he uses these words: "But it can bear nothing less than to deviate from those things which seem to have been undertaken against the papists." For this stubbornness seems to be in part holy, provided it is not stiff-necked, but as a goad to the knowledge and acceptance of the truth. For to stubbornly refuse the papacy, can it not be said in some way to be the beginning of receiving the gospel of Christ? For the stupidity objected to, we are compelled to confess, by which one wants to cling to those things which he has learned, either because of the author or because of custom, but not because of themselves. The truth was to be sought by us, as we profess it, and therefore no one is not to be heard calmly; but what is true is to be received and afterwards diligently weighed to be such. You know the fierce ones, who say: "What is it, why are we so often vexed and for so long because of this concord? If what we have given does not please, let them go. We have lost not a few things because of what we have held until now; what remains, we will equally lay down." These seem to be of the stupid, not of the prudent. For it is much otherwise with the latter. They follow Paul, who commands to prove all things, to hold fast that which is good. He also commands that all things be done with gentleness. For if we acted thus, I believe our republics would be much happier and more peaceful than they are, not to mention consciences.</p>
      <p>There is one thing besides, about which I have never, as far as I know, heard: where he defends why we say that we also taught thus before, explaining to what we refer what we said "before". Nevertheless, there is no reason to think ill against Bucer. For after he knew that Luther could not bear this speech and yet wanted us to be defended before him, he had to say either this or something else fabricated. Therefore, whether he defended truly or not, it seems to be weighed rather than to be indignant. For as far as I am concerned, I know that many things have come to me in this matter, namely about the Eucharist, meanwhile, while the matter has been tossed back and forth for so long through the pursuit of concord. Nor can there be any doubt that the same has happened to many others on both sides.</p>
      <p>I do not blame Luther for not being able to bear our speech; for it is not to be borne by him. For although the common confession has that Christ offers his body and blood in the mystical supper to his own and delivers it to be eaten and drunk, and Luther says exactly the same, yet we do not confess the same when we look to the mind of the parties. For we explain the body as the efficacy of the body. He nothing less. For he simply wants it to be said, believed, taught that the body of Christ is distributed and received, yet not in a gross manner, such as human sense or reason conceives, but heavenly. For he cannot persuade himself that the Lord said without cause: "This is my body, which is given for you" [1 Corinthians 11:24]. And Paul's: "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" [1 Corinthians 10:16]. But about this matter, you will see and hear more in his response.</p>
      <p>"You seem," you say, "to be entirely Lutheran and Bucerian." Listen to what is true: Indeed, before God, I regard neither, but consider the matter according to my capacity. I see what affections can do in us; they make us blind to the words and deeds of others. Hence, if there is any truth in these, they take it away so that it is not held as truth. And this is the reason why dissensions increase more and more and we are precipitated into great dangers. Therefore, unless we learn to command our disturbed minds, we will finally feel how we have not rightly handled the word of God. "But the truth is taken from us." This is not the attempt of either Luther or Bucer, but rather the effort is to give. "They will never give what we have." Here it must be seen carefully, lest anyone deceive himself. It must be prayed diligently, lest the Lord allow us to be deceived, and affections must be cast away, lest they take away all right and true judgment.</p>
      <p>Moreover, to finish: I wanted to demonstrate with so many (although they are very few with respect to the argument) how nothing seems to us in Bucer's letter for which anyone should be rightly moved; but why it seems so, the disturbance of minds is the cause. Therefore, I pray the Lord Jesus, that with eyes purified, it may be allowed to behold the truth, from whomever it may be, most correctly. Then it will happen that we may soon see what we may rejoice in.</p>
      <p>I write to you alone, not to others, lest I stumble. Therefore, I also pray that you do not show it to anyone. I do not want to adjure you by your most holy faith. Some of you have irritable minds. I feel you to be more placid everywhere; I ask that you do not let your mind be led astray at any time. I fear how your people will receive Luther's response. Therefore, unless you mitigate everything, it is to be feared that it will be over with concord. From which if we are excluded, see you what evils are to follow. We will give a handle to the confederates to rage more. We will give hope to the Antichrist of one day triumphing against the gospel. We will be judged by the holy churches as adversaries. We will stand alone, whatever happens. "He is not alone," you say, "who has God." It is true. But they also glory equally, and in their judgment more truly, and they prove this their glorying today with such a strong and eager response against the pope and his associates. I wonder if anyone can either read or hear it without great admiration for the fortitude and constancy of the princes and republics, and also for the grace and help of God, which so clearly stood by their counsels. But we will also delay foreign nations, so that they approach the gospel more slowly. And who knows whether this dissension might sometime give our own cause to think ill of the gospel and so to despise and reject it. Let us pray to the Lord that concord does not cause discord.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be diligent in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 11, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the venerable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zurich, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
