      <p>I completed the translation of your Decades almost a whole year ago. In the meantime, I have re-read it several times, although I have not transcribed it due to the work's volume. If it seems to you to be in the interest of the church that either the entire work or some sermons separately, such as sermon 23 on the cross or 45 on prayer or those 4 in which the sacramental matter is most fully treated, be published, you can let me know. I will send it to you for review, and if there is anything further to correct, my brother's efforts will accomplish this. For I have been so involved with these to the point of saturation that I do not notice everything that could be corrected. I did not want you to be unaware of this. Let it be done as you see fit; I do not urge any other addition.</p>
      <p>In recent days, some Roman monks from Como came to Freiburg with indulgence wares, equipped with much authority from the Roman pontiff. But the people of Freiburg did not want to admit them to sell their wares. Therefore, they left with great indignation. I hear they were also in Lucerne and among the Sub-Sylvanians, but they were not admitted there either.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter, to which there is nothing more for me to respond. Therefore, fare well with all yours, whom I ask you to greet diligently in my name and that of mine; Musculus and all of ours greet you. Bern, April 15, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
