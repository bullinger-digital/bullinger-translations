    <p xml:id="regest1">In accordance with Vadian's order, which was conveyed by the bailiff Johannes Haab, [a letter] has been written, and he is ready for further services. He is pleased to hear that Vadian has not abandoned the work on the “Farrago de collegiis et monasteriis Germaniae veteribus,” and encourages him to continue advocating for the true doctrine; he thanks for the useful foreign policy information, which he reviewed with [Diethelm] Röist, who sends his regards to Vadian, and requests further news. There is great conflict to be feared in the Empire, due to their sins; he hopes for God's mercy. He asks for Vadian's opinion on his preface to the Münster Bible, which [Christoph] Froschauer is sending to Vadian, and on his book “De origine erroris”; some fear that his writings might provoke criticism, but he always has only God and the seekers of truth in mind.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have written what you commanded, most esteemed man, through the distinguished Johannes Haab, the bailiff of Rüti. If there is anything more that you wish to be done through me, I will be most ready. Your letters have delighted me for two reasons: Firstly, because I hear that those books on the colleges have not been abandoned. Continue to support and illuminate the true religion, indeed to defend it from errors; the Lord will crown your learned diligence. Secondly, you have done a most pleasing thing by noting foreign matters with such diligence. They benefit me greatly; I reviewed them with Röist, who sends you his warmest regards. Please continue to write if you have any certain news. I fear great disturbances will arise in Germany, and this because of our sins. May the Lord have mercy on us. Froschauer is sending Münster's version. You will see what I have prefaced in the sacred Bible. Concerning these and what I have written about the origin of error, I wish to hear your judgment. There are those who think that both will be received with hostile minds by some; but I preferred to please God and the seekers of truth rather than certain morose individuals, who approve of nothing unless they themselves have done it. Farewell and love me. Zurich, March 11, 1539. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
