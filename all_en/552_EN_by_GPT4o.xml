      <p>Greetings. I have finally obtained from Bäler the receipt long desired by you. He expresses his greatest thanks for your services. As for what else I might write, I have nothing at the moment, both because I have written more frequently and extensively in recent days, and because I do not have much leisure time left. Therefore, I commend you to the grace of the Lord, along with your wife and children. I congratulate Zwingli on his calling and condition. May the Lord inspire in him a paternal spirit, so that he may be as much an ornament and benefit to this church as his father was! My wife and Musculus send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 7, 1549. Johannes Haller, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>You can recommend Gervasius to the people of Aargau, among whom the election of ministers rests. I will do the same.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and renowned man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Zürich church, his lord and venerable compatriot. Zürich.</p>
