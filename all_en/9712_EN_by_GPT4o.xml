      <p>Greetings. That unfortunate soul has finally vomited out his bloody spirit; indeed, the miserable people are rushing more and more into fatal servitude, and the princes are held in stricter custody than ever before. It is rumored, not without reason, that both Marshals were killed in prison by the order of the tyrant, who was cruel even in death. If Condé can obtain money, he will take action; if not, I would prefer him to be elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Lanonius defeated Mompenserium among the Pictones, and Mombrunus conducted himself well in Dauphiné; but Mongomery was captured in Normandy, and without a doubt, Athalia will exercise all her cruelty on him, unless God prevents it. But you will learn all these things in full from our envoy, who is traveling there in the name and with the mandate of Condé, to deliberate with you on what can be accomplished during this interregnum among your people and to try everything. What Condé requests is so fair and moderate that I think no one can justly refuse their assistance in this matter, and it is probable that the Pole will embrace these plans when he enters a kingdom that is very needy and disturbed. But what if he were rather detained in Poland? If only that could truly happen and Alençon could be elevated to the throne from his chains! But besides the fact that the Poles have pledged to release their king immediately if such a thing should happen, and to elect another, if we have rightly advised them not to invite that plague upon themselves, how can we now, in good conscience, advise them to retain it? Therefore, I think these two things should be requested from them: one, to delay the matter as much as possible, and the other, before they release him, to obtain some peace for the churches according to the written formula of Condé.</p>
      <p>I am writing in this sense to our Thretius, whose letters I am sending to you open, so that if they please you, you may add your own letters in the same sense to any friends (which I also urgently request in the name of all the other colleagues of the Gallic churches and indeed of Christ himself) and ensure that they are all sent together to Krakow as safely and quickly as possible. But if you think otherwise, I would like you to return them to me. I would also like you to remember to insert in your letters sent to any of the brothers you choose, that if by chance Thretius is taken from us (which God forbid), or if he is far away, he should open my letters as if they were addressed to him, and after reading and sharing them with those who need to know, he should consign them to the fire, so they cannot cause harm to anyone. You will receive the declaration of Condé written in French from our envoy included in this packet. The plague has re-emerged among us and is disrupting our school; it has invaded Mr. Roset's family, from whom it has snatched two daughters in a moment, and a third is also afflicted with the same disease. He himself is well with the remaining children. One of our colleagues is also affected, whose life I almost despair of. Pray for us and for all the pious.</p>
      <p>May that heavenly Father protect you from all evil. I hoped to visit you this summer; but I do not want to abandon the flock in this sadness.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, along with the entire assembly of most beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, June 19, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>I have just received news that Athalia is dangerously ill, and that Mombrunus, having routed seven cohorts, has captured a town of great importance in Dauphiné, called Diam.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the faithful pastor of the Zurich church, whom I hold in the highest regard.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
