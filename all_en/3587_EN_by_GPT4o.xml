      <p>S. D. I know, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, that you have sometimes been displeased with Laelius' behavior and his disputations with curious questions. I know that he was suspected by many, as if he favored Servetus and Grybaldo.</p>
      <p>However, I am quite certain that he does not favor them or their perverse doctrine at all. Moreover, he lived here with us for many years without reproach.</p>
      <p>He endeavored to benefit and serve everyone as much as he could, and he proved himself to be upright and sincere in religion. Therefore, I commend him to you as a brother, and I beg you to receive him kindly and to assist him wherever he may need your help.</p>
      <p>If you bestow any benefit upon him, I will consider it as bestowed upon myself by you. For I love him uniquely because of his piety, integrity, and humanity, and I wish him to be loved by all good people. He himself will report to you how his affairs, as well as those of his brothers, are in danger.</p>
      <p>And indeed, we ought to show him greater kindness because he endures more severe persecution from enemies, and for no other reason than for Christ's sake. I wrote to you last year that an Englishman came to me, who brought letters from Philipp and Utenhove, which I also sent to you. I also indicated that I entrusted him with letters to you and to Mr. Haller.</p>
      <p>But you replied that you neither saw that Englishman nor received any of my letters.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I understand that that rascal was a traitor. For friends from Hesse write that a certain Englishman hurried to Jena and boasted that he had collected letters from the Schw√§rmer (fanatics) which he wanted to deliver to Jena. By God's will, I retained a copy of my letter to you, which now seems appropriate to submit, in case those quarrelers publish what they received through treachery, and perhaps corrupt it, so that you are not unaware of what I wrote to you. (Follows a copy of the letter stolen by the Englishman, which we presented in its place above N. 2791.) What needs to be added will be added by Laelius, who has a clear view of our affairs.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with all the fellow ministers and brothers.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Jonville, Budaeus, Badius, Normandius, etc., also be well. Likewise Crispin and Robert, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 8, 1558. Our brothers greet you. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
