      <p>[...] that we must necessarily bring up the troublesome and poisonous matter of Gantner again with you; for his followers everywhere claim that the people of Zurich are on his side; although we knew well that this is not the case, we would very much like to have your other response, which will soon be useful to us in its place and time, to expose the man's vain delusion, etc. - λογιαν or collection for foreign brothers made, the same will be brought by Koblerus. This time must be made good, as the common man must otherwise also give old and new taxes to the authorities and everything is very expensive. This sum, 120 guilders, has been collected with some addition from my gracious lords from the poor and rich in our temples at the doors. Desiring and requesting my gracious lords, as they then, but very briefly, writing to you themselves, that you would be so kind as to trouble yourselves with them, and to send it to Bern according to your last letter. Meanwhile, we also want to urge other churches and high courts, so that something may fall in and at least the will may be felt; for Chur is only one court; if each court contributed as much, it would far exceed the sum of the Bernese. God regards the spirit, and he who gives quickly, gives twice; therefore we wanted to be the first; but it is also fitting that those who enjoy these things are grateful. - I have solicited a benefice for Othmar Casparli at St. Peter in Schanvik, which was previously held by Gantnerus. But the peasants have not yet given me an answer; I am waiting for it every day; as soon as it comes, I will not delay at all with the prohibition. Otherwise, I would know little good at the moment; for the peasants notice it like a butcher about a calf. - Among us, the people cry out, the 13 places (according to the letters, a copy of which I would gladly send you) are pursuing three points, that they persist in the union and do not understand Mr. Peter of Grantry; but there is much grumbling, and many wonder how it comes that the Evangelical Cantons point elsewhere, where they are not. But I know well how it goes, where the sea gains the upper hand, to which one writes in the name of the 13 places afterwards, even if pious people do not consent to it. Afterwards, it brings a lot, since this letter is written in the name of all 13 places to our communities, that not the least occasion is taken from this to say: 'Are you, those from Zurich and Bern, also wanting us to hold to the king, which they would not do, if the king were guilty and it had gone so badly, as they make it.' Much is also said here about how great honor is done to the lord envoy Bellievre among you. - Amman Lussi, a creature of the equestrian pontiff, is on his way to Rome via Milan and (as d. d. Ruinell writes to us) claims that he wants to go there because 5 Pagici also want to join the Holy League against the Turk, but etc. - The community of Sonders has chosen two men and sent them to the bishop in Chur to ask him to take his interest or tithes from them according to the investiture, as before from Beccariis; they do not want to do him any harm in what belongs to him. He replied that he would not break what was decided in the council of Trent, etc., and it would be done after a short time. - At our court is a priest; he is the brother of the former bishop Thomas. He spoke up there against one of our lords: [How would it be] if you had to accept our faith? Now just let the Easter come.' When the 3 commissioners wanted to inquire about the treachery in Valtellina, they had already been warned beforehand, and they have laid this murder on women and children, as if it were a street rumor, where nothing further was pursued. However, a monk has been cited for the upcoming assembly day, which falls on January 11 and will be a very large, unruly assembly day, where we, I fear, will hear little joyful news; for the 3 leaders, among whom was one of their will, have returned from Innsbruck from the prince of the land, with the answer that he wants to have the son of the Rhaetian lord at Razüns for 20 years after the father's death, as the letter states. So the peasants do not want to tolerate that; they think that if they pay the pledge debt, all the other goods should fall at the cost, which has run away from them, and they do not want to have any Plantagenet as lord. I fear that the bell will still be paid with greater sorrow.</p>
      <p>For it is certain and without any doubt that 10,000 or perhaps soon 12,000 Spaniards are lying around Chur and Milan and wintering there, under the pretext, as if they want to move to the Netherlands in the spring. The bull is not yet dampened. There is concern here that the [flags] must break out again. God send peace and calm all unruly hearts.</p>
      <p>In the year 1572, on the penultimate day, in Chur.</p>
