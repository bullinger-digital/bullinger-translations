    <p xml:id="regest1">A letter from Milan dated April 8 states that Emperor [Charles V], who is receiving strong military reinforcements in Italy, has initially traveled to Rome but will later move to Milan. It is said that French cavalry and infantry with artillery have penetrated deep into the Duchy of Savoy. He asks Bullinger to inform [Mayor] Röist that the preacher [Wendelin Oswald?] has denounced the participants of the Basel meeting [for the drafting of the First Helvetic Confession] as heretics from the pulpit. Many people from the abbot's domain attended the Reformed sermon and communion at Easter, after which Abbot [Diethelm] imposed fines. If Bullinger has not yet sent a report about Vogler's residence in Zurich, he can send a letter with Hans Widenhuber. Greetings. It is said that Konrad Zwick and Joachim [Maler] have traveled to Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>May the Lord God break all counsels that rise against us.</p>
      <p>Beloved, in response to your request, I inform you of the news we have, especially concerning the Emperor, as follows: Last Thursday, a letter was sent to me from Milan, dated April 8, 1536, stating: Regarding new news, nothing special, except the certain report that the Emperor has moved to Rome and has twelve thousand foot soldiers, Italians and Spaniards, three thousand horsemen. The Venetians are said to send him three thousand soldiers and three hundred cuirassiers (armored horsemen). The Duke of Florence also sends him three thousand soldiers, six hundred horsemen. The Emperor will also personally move to Milan into the camp; for they are making him a tent in Milan. Also, the ten thousand landsknechts are already in Milan, of the Emperor, and four hundred horses here, which will carry the artillery, are supposed to be stationed at Vercelli to set up the camp.</p>
      <p>Regarding the French, it is said that their cavalry is already in Asti in the land of Savoy; also, some foot soldiers have crossed the mountains along with some artillery.</p>
      <p>Would you kindly inform my dear Lord Röist on my behalf, as I am obliged, and I have also written to you before, I write this again, done for my oath's sake, to inform my Lord Röist, as long as it does not seem harmful to you, that I inquired from my Lord Vadiano himself whether it is so, he said yes, that the monk, the preacher, here on the open pulpit preached with more or less words (as I hope, by St. Gallen in known company): "The learned are again gathered in Basel, the heretics," approximately these words, yet the preacher speaks, Doctor. I asked my Lord Doctor: "Did you not reveal this to those in Basel on that day, the injured?" He said they refrained from it, for reasons. He thinks perhaps, it is not good to hear every day, etc. Acting here, as I know (in the best way). Informing my Lord Röist, for my oath's sake, I show him this in secret, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, on Easter day, I hear truly, many hundreds of the abbey's people went to the sermon and the Lord's Supper in many parishes everywhere, also two ships from Rorschach went to Lindau. Hear, these days the abbot has sent some and with his own mouth imposed the oath on them, to ask, and those who went to the sermon, each 10 shillings, and those who went to the Lord's Supper 1 pound of St. Gallen currency.</p>
      <p>I hope, once you receive the letter, you have written to me about the lodging and other matters; but if not, then write to me through the good Hans Widenhuber. With greetings from both of us to all of you, the house, Lord Röist, Master Kaspar, Rordorffer, and others.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, yes, on the Saturday after Easter in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>It is said, Konrad Zwick and Joachim have traveled to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>To my beloved Lord and good friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
