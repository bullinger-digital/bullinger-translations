      <p>Greetings. As I am sending a courier to my most esteemed parent, I could not refrain from addressing you, even though I have nothing that greatly deserves writing, at least with a few words. I also informed Count Wittgenstein, in case he wanted to send you any letters, who sent me these attached.</p>
      <p>Now, most illustrious man, whom I know to be entirely concerned with my prosperous affairs, I wanted to inform you that on the 19th of July, I was admitted into the inner council by the most illustrious Prince Elector. In this way of life, if I can be of any benefit to you or yours, I would prefer to show in action rather than words how much I value you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man. On the 17th of August, in Heidelberg, in the year 1575.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to Mr. Gwalther and Simler. Yours sincerely, Johann Philipp Freiherr von Hohensax, etc.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
