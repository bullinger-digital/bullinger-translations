    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger was very pleased with Pistorius' candid letter [not preserved] from September 12 [1545], as Pistorius expressed his friendly attitude towards the people of Zurich, even though many of them distance themselves. Bullinger will also express himself freely in his response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Pistorius writes that he abhors the Eucharistic controversy, especially since the Old Church nearly perished due to internal disputes, and therefore the modern Church might face a similar end. However, there is no reason to be ashamed of every dispute! Indeed, there are disputes that are approved by the Lord and have more favorable effects on the Church than excessive confidence or peacefulness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- There was a dispute between Christ and his disciples; likewise among the disciples themselves. Furthermore, Paul had to oppose Peter on an important matter of faith. We owe the majority of Paul's letters to his confrontation with the Min√¶ans or Nazarenes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- How does the dispute between Luther and the people of Zurich stand? [Johannes] Oekolampad, [Huldrych] Zwingli, and many others hold the correct view on the dual nature of Christ, who remains both human and God without the two natures mixing. However, what Luther claims in his doctrine about the Eucharist contradicts many points of faith and aligns more with the doctrine of the Antichrist. It is known that the glorified, resurrected body of Christ is now in heaven at a specific place; therefore, it cannot be present everywhere, including in the bread and wine of the Eucharist, as Luther claims. Furthermore, it is known that a carnal enjoyment of the body of Christ is of no benefit and that Christ must be received spiritually by the believer. Luther, however, invented a third type of feeding: he speaks not only, like the [Holy] Scripture, of a grossly carnal and a spiritual feeding, but also of an inexplicable feeding (ineffabilis manducatio), which is neither carnal nor spiritual and yet truly and physically, and with which he connects the forgiveness [of sins] and eternal life. This, however, completely contradicts the doctrine of the Gospel and aligns with the doctrine of the Antichrist, except for its transubstantiation and sacrificial doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- There is therefore more reason to be outraged by [Luther's] doctrine than by the fact that some people oppose this doctrine! Indeed, it is even the duty of the people of Zurich to refute Luther's doctrine, especially since he not only publicly attacked the people of Zurich and branded them as heretics, godless, and wicked people, but also attacked Christ. Posterity would be horrified to find that in God's Church no one opposed Luther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Much more than the [dogmatic] disputes, the inappropriate silence of the Old Church has caused harm! In it, there were learned and holy people who taught erroneous things. And because no one dared to oppose them, more and more heresies were spread. Therefore, Pistorius should not be so horrified by the Eucharistic controversy, especially since no private interest, but the integrity of the doctrine is at stake. And in such a case, one must not remain neutral!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Pistorius writes that the [Hessian pastors], who were not involved in this dispute, believe almost the same as the people of Zurich, only they express themselves differently. Bullinger, however, believes that one should only use formulas that are appropriate and unambiguous, and that do not require repeated explanations themselves. Speaking is meant to express oneself clearly. Therefore, the servants of the Church should not explain the complex statements of Scripture in an obscure way. Even less should they resort to ambiguous explanations that could be appropriated by both parties in the event of a dispute.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Pistorius is also of the opinion that the [Hessian pastors attribute] more [effects] to the Eucharist than the people of Zurich seem to do, because the [Hessians] consider the signs (symbola) [in the Eucharist] not only as declarative (significativa) but also as offering (exhibitativa), and thus believe that something is actually offered through the word and through the signs. Pistorius, who uses the language of others here, should consider the matter more closely. Are words and signs really capable of offering something (exhibere)? Or is it not rather the case that one can only declare (significare) something with words? Whoever diligently studies the [Holy] Scripture and the most pious and genuine [Church] fathers will conclude that words can only declare, remind, instruct, and admonish. In themselves, words are not carriers of what is declared. And what they do not have in themselves, they cannot offer (offere) or present! The words only express the will of the Lord to have his body crucified, to feed us for eternal life with this sacrificed body, as with bread and drink, and not (especially since he never promised this) to offer us his body to eat (tradere) or present (exhibere) with the bread, which amounts to the same thing. Whoever takes the gift of Christ's body as food, that is, whoever believes in Christ, has eternal life. And the believers who participate in the Eucharist, and who are urged by Paul to examine themselves, already have a share in Christ's redemption and do not receive Christ only during a Eucharistic celebration. Moreover, the glorified body of the resurrected Christ is not distributed (distribui) with the Eucharist, especially since the officiant would not be able to offer the glorified body of Christ or the Holy Spirit. He can only hand over signs (dare), like John [the Baptist] at that time, who could only baptize people with water and not with the [Holy] Spirit. In summary: The words admonish and instruct; the sacraments declare, testify, and confirm [God's] commitment [to people] (obsignant). Word and sacrament serve justification [by faith]; but they do not justify themselves and do not confer (conferre aut exhibere) grace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- What Pistorius then presents, Bullinger does not dispute at all, for he also believes that the Eucharist is not limited to a memorial celebration in which the believers only celebrate their redemption and express their gratitude to Christ. The Eucharist also serves the establishment of Christ's covenant. It testifies that Christ died for our sins and declares that Christ wants to save those who believe in him. It is also permissible to say that Christ is present in the Eucharist; but he is present through his Spirit, as he promised, not physically. Therefore, he does not distribute himself (distribuere) in the Eucharist, nor does he offer himself (exhibere) in it. Finally, one must already be a member of Christ to be allowed to participate in the Eucharist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger therefore abhors the word "exhibere," unless it is understood to mean our restoration and the effects of Christ's gifts in us; which, however, does not come about through the Eucharist, but through the Holy Spirit in faith. The effect of God's grace-giving mercy in us is, however, improved (reparari), brought to remembrance, and confirmed (obsignari) thanks to the holy signs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Bullinger does not want to discuss the sacraments in detail here, but to give Pistorius something to consider about what the [Hessians] could attribute more to the Eucharist than the [people of Zurich] do. The [Protestants] previously fought together against the pestilential, money-generating doctrine of the sophists. According to this, the sacraments would be able to confer grace (conferre) to all those who do not oppose it. But now, to the delight of the opponents, the [Protestants] express themselves differently about the sacraments than before and newly claim that something is offered in them! Such a claim, however, hardly differs from that of the opponents and leads to the conclusion that participation in the Eucharist effects justification.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- But the Apostles did not teach us such things! For what Paul writes about the Passover and circumcision can be transferred to the Eucharist and baptism. Paul writes that Abraham was justified by his faith in the Messiah even before his circumcision. Circumcision therefore contributed nothing to justification and merely confirmed it (obsignare). The same applies to the Eucharist, where faith is already present in the participant; unless the Eucharistic celebration is held in such a way that, in accordance with 1 Corinthians 14, it also effects the conversion of unbelievers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- In Germany, one should not strive for a compromise with the Antichrist. Nothing is to be expected from this! Like Jannes and Jambres [in the time of Moses], the [Catholic] opponents resist the truth. Paul has ordered to oppose such people, not to negotiate with them, for this only leads to expenses and dangers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Should Pistorius be forced to participate in such negotiations, he should prove himself as a faithful servant of God, who interprets the Scripture thoroughly and does not give up God's will. Moses and Aaron did the same. They did not yield to Pharaoh when he sought a compromise. One must not negotiate with enemies, especially since they are commissioned by the Pope [Paul III.]. The Lord has indeed saved his churches from the lion's mouth through [Philip of Hesse], but one must remain vigilant.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Greetings, also to [Philip of Hesse].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Your letter, most humane and dearest brother Pistorius, written in Frankfurt on September 12, I received around the beginning of October, and I give you my utmost thanks for your kindness, as you continue to be a friend to us, even when many others neglect and turn away from us, and you write to us most amicably. We will never forget your kindness. It also pleases us greatly that you write openly, candidly, and freely, from which we can hope that you will take it well if we also respond in a friendly and open manner, that is, sincerely and simply. Certainly, our Lord, whose ministers we are, approves and loves simplicity and candor above all else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You are entirely horrified in spirit whenever the thought of the contention over the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord comes to mind. You add the cause of your horror, that you see the primitive church almost perished due to contentions; from which one must now also gather that our churches, if we continue to bite each other, will eventually be consumed. To which I add these words of consolation: Not every contention is blameworthy and fatal; indeed, the Lord approves of some contentions and dissensions; hence, it will not be necessary to collapse at the first sign of dissension. For some dissensions have a clear fruit and are better than excessive security and tranquility.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>First, therefore, it seems necessary to examine in what matter there is dissension. Not infrequently was there dissension between the Lord himself and his disciples. For there is no head of a household so tractable and peaceful that he does not sometimes dissent with his family. A very serious contention occurred between Paul and his colleague Peter, not about a trivial and superfluous matter, but about the head of our salvation, namely, whether the Gentiles also belong to the communion of Christ, whether the pagans are pure and holy through faith in Christ without the aid of legal observances. In this matter, the teacher of the Gentiles resisted Peter to his face, and sharply and openly rebuked him, saying most openly that he was not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel. With the Nazarenes or Min√¶ans, who preached the same Christ with Paul, a much graver contention intervened with those who denied the legal observances with Christ, but preached this alone and pure Christ and faith in Christ. Nor do you ignore that the majority of the apostolic letters fall under contention: The matter itself speaks this; the writings testify. If now the apostles, especially Paul, had been horrified by contention from the heart, what, I ask, would have happened to the church of Christ? The impurer part would have prevailed, and the sincerity of the preaching of the gospel would have been obscured. Now, therefore, when we read the contentious writings of Paul against the Min√¶ans and insincere preachers of the gospel of Christ, we are not horrified, but we praise the faith and sincerity of the apostle Paul with thanksgiving, rejoicing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Let us now apply these things to our affairs and see what kind of contention has arisen or been restored between Luther and us. Many good men, not only Oecolampadius and Zwingli, have taught the gospel of Christ purely: Christ, true God and man, with natures undivided and not confused, is the supreme king and high priest of the universal church, that is, redeemer, intercessor, and sacrifice, as well as the life and all the desire of a pious heart; he ascended to heaven into the true tabernacle, and no longer clings to the earth; he sent his spirit, through whom and in whom he works all things in his own, who are absolved by faith in him alone, and by faith perform good works, which he himself commanded, they added that this faith and religion are taught by the word of Christ and renewed and testified by the sacraments of Christ. But Luther opposes these and presents such a doctrine of the sacraments, which obscures and subverts some articles of true religion, and makes more with the antichrist than with Christ. I would do the greatest injury and insult to Luther of holy memory, who now lives with Christ, unless I prove what I have said! The articles of true faith and religion are: that the Lord Christ consists of two natures, undivided and not mixed; that Christ ascended with a glorious body into heaven and is contained there in a certain place; that he is not everywhere according to the body; that the flesh of Christ eaten corporally does not profit, but eaten spiritually plainly feeds, so that a faithful man does not hunger or thirst. But Luther teaches about the natures in Christ in the sacramental contention in such a way that, if what he himself teaches is true, the natures must be confused. For he says that the humanity of Christ and his true body are everywhere just like the divinity. He teaches and says it is a lie to assert that the body of Christ is in one place in heaven because of the mode of a true body; for the body of the Lord can be in several places at once. He indeed concedes that the scripture makes mention of two kinds of eating, carnal and spiritual of faith; but he adds and invents a third, neither gross nor spiritual, but yet true and corporal, meanwhile ineffable, to which he attributes remission and eternal life. He thinks this happens in the supper. Do these things savor of evangelical sincerity? Do not all these things diametrically oppose the sincere doctrine of piety? Are not all these things manifest and copiously and frequently repeated in Luther's books? Now, as for the doctrine of the antichrist, with which he does more than with the doctrine of Christ, do not the pope and Luther teach the same in the matter of the supper, except for transubstantiation and the daily victim, when both teach that the bread is the body of Christ essentially and in reality, so that both the worthy and the unworthy eat the true body of the Lord, so that those who eat the bread eat nothing else than the true body of the Lord, which hung on the cross? Luther teaches with the pope that the ascension of the body of Christ is such that nevertheless here on earth under the appearance of bread and with the bread (with the adorable and venerable - for thus he speaks - sacrament) is the true body of the Lord, and that in some ineffable way, so that anyone who takes the bread may say: Here I have apprehended and hold you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Who, hearing these things, would not be more astonished and horrified than when he hears that there are some men who oppose such perverse doctrines? How others bear such doctrines, what they judge of them, how they reconcile them with the truth, we do not know. We thought it was our duty, as those called to the ministry of the gospel, to attack and oppose those things which diametrically contradict the gospel and confirm antichristianism, especially since Luther dragged us and the teachers of pure truth and openly said that we are heretics, that we are impious and sacrilegious, that we do not believe in God nor hold any article of the Christian faith rightly. How could we have passed over these things with a deaf ear? How could we have ignored that atrocious insult not only to the living and the dead, well-deserving men, but to Christ himself and his truth, most impudently designated? Posterity would have been horrified, I am sure, if it had read such atrocious insults against the truth and the ministers of truth, and had seen that there were none who opposed themselves for the house of God, for the truth, and for the well-deserving, if not a wall, at least a hedge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Believe me, my most esteemed Pistorius, the great harm to the primitive church was not caused by contentions, but rather by the untimely silence of some. There were learned and holy men, whose great benefits to the church were evident; but they had their own errors, which they nevertheless sought to propagate due to the innate vice of corrupt nature. Others did not want to oppose them because of the authority of these men. The simpler ones did not understand the beginning (the beginning of error) and received their doctrine without selection. Therefore, the error prevailed universally over time. I am sure some examples occur to you, as you are very knowledgeable in histories. I therefore urge your piety not to be so horrified by those contentions in which not private causes of a few are at stake, but in which the integrity of doctrines is at stake, in which controversy no one is allowed to be neutral. You, for your outstanding piety, weigh what I have said.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Then you say that your people, who are not involved in the heat of contention, feel almost the same about the Lord's Supper as we do, except that they use different formulas of speaking, and that they seem to say more in some places. It is well known that those who use those formulas of speaking, which encompass and achieve the very thing they ought to explain, and finally most significantly expose it to the minds of the people, having nothing of ambiguity, obscurity, and doubt, think and act most prudently. For speech was invented to truly, simply, and clearly express the concept of the mind. And the interpreters of the scriptures and ministers of the churches should uniquely strive for this, that what they say is clear, indeed that they explain those things which seem more involved in the scriptures, so that no difficulty remains. But they should not use such expressions that require other and other interpreters and expositions. So far am I from approving those expressions which are not only obscure and ambiguous, but also provide a defense for old errors or which, while the contention is still ongoing, are so composed that either party can seize and apply them to their own sense. For, as it is necessary to confess the truth simply, so the Lord approves sincerity and simplicity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Furthermore, you explain what it is that your people seem to say more, as follows: when they want the signs to be not only significant but also exhibitive, by which those things that are offered by the word and symbols are truly exhibited. And here, my dearest Pistorius, consider carefully what you have said with these words. I know, I know that you speak more here from the opinion and tradition of others than from the opinion with which you were once imbued. At the beginning, you say that the bread of the supper is not only a significant sign but also an exhibitive one. You then explain the word "exhibiting" by adding, by which (to the faithful) those things that are offered by the word and symbols are truly exhibited. Therefore, a question arises from these: what is that true thing that is offered by the word and symbols, that is, what do the words and symbols mean? Do the words have a certain power to convey the very things of which they are words and names, or only to signify? Now if you diligently examine the scriptures and the more religious and purer fathers, you will find that words are not to be attributed more than the office of signifying, reminding, and exhorting, etc. They do not have in themselves what they signify. Therefore, they neither offer nor exhibit; for what I do not have, I do not exhibit. The word is that word of the Lord spoken to the leper: "I will, be clean." By these words, he wanted to signify that he willed to cure and cleanse the leprosy by his divine power. But there was not in those words the cleansing that the words exhibited. So the word is that word of the Lord: "This is my body, which is given for you," certainly signifying the true body to be crucified; but meanwhile, in the word, there was not the body that was offered and exhibited by the word. Why then do some say that words and symbols not only signify but more exhibit? They seem to want to say and think something other than those who say that in the supper the true and natural body of the Lord is given and taken, and indeed they say and speak the same with these, since Christ has only one true body. But the bread signifies nothing other than the true natural body of the Lord given for us. If what is signified is at the same time exhibited, I do not see what these say other than those. If in the supper with the bread the true body of the Lord is exhibited to us, now this happens either by the power and gift of God promising or by the benefit of the bread or the minister. But nowhere has he promised to give his body to be eaten with the bread; for the words "this is my body" are figurative. Rather, he promised that he would give his body into bread, that is, food, so that whoever eats this, that is, fixes all trust in the incarnate Christ, will live eternally and will no longer suffer any hunger or thirst. He denied that his flesh eaten naturally profits. Therefore, he did not give, he did not promise what does not profit, who says or does nothing that does not profit. But what he promises, he performs and exhibits, namely eternal life and fellowship to believers. Now as for the symbol of bread, the Lord does not distribute himself in the bread or with the bread, but on the cross through the spirit in faith. Finally, the supper is the food of the faithful; the supper repels the unfaithful. Therefore, before the faithful approach the supper, they have been made partakers of Christ; they do not first receive in the supper what is distributed. For Paul says, "Let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of the bread." But the nature of the body in Christ, even glorified, is different from what is either visibly or invisibly with the bread or in the bread or distributed through it. Moreover, the ministers do not give the body of Christ, just as no man gives the Holy Spirit; the minister gives the symbols of the true body and blood. John said: "I baptize with water; he who is coming after me will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire." Therefore, in this cause, as in all others, I think we must adhere to this safe and fixed anchor of our religion. Believers are justified and made alive by faith alone in Christ. God alone justifies, feeds, invigorates, preserves, satisfies, and gives life by his spirit, not through any externals. We participate in his grace, life, and gifts by faith alone. We will never allow these to be distributed into sacraments and certain externals. For thus the integrity and sincerity of the evangelical doctrine, which the apostle wanted to remain inviolate through so many contentions, is violated. Meanwhile, as we attribute power to the word of admonishing and teaching, so we confess that the sacraments signify, testify, seal, and as it were present the things signified to the eyes, so that the word and sacraments serve justification, not justify, not confer or exhibit grace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Therefore, we do not at all oppose what you immediately bring forward. We do not think that the supper is only a memorial by which the faithful celebrate the accomplished redemption, but by which Christ instituted a testament, a certain and firm testimony of his last will. For we believe that the last and firmest will of the Lord was to save believers. But he saved when he transferred my sins to himself and atoned for them on the cross. But that he gave himself for us to death and shed his blood for the remission of our sins, he attests with the visible sign of bread and wine, so that the supper is rightly held as a visible testimony of the body given for us and the blood shed, and at the same time a memory and grateful commemoration of all that he suffered for us. Thus, as you recall, the supper is not an empty spectacle. For it is the institution of the Lord; it is a faithful commemoration of the death of Christ; it is a testimony and sealing of the truth, a testament also of our redemption. And we gladly concede that Christ is present. For how could he be absent from his own banquet? How could he be absent from his own institution, which he makes effective? But he is present, as he predicted he would be present to the church until the end, in spirit, power, truth, and help. He is not present bodily, as he most copiously attested in the gospel according to John. Thus he does not distribute and exhibit himself through this ministry. For we must first be partakers of Christ and members of Christ, unless we wish to take judgment upon ourselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Therefore, I greatly abhor the new and contentious word "exhibiting," unless by exhibition we mean a certain restoration and continuation of the grace and all the goods communicated and already long ago conveyed with Christ. This was indeed the mercy of God the dispenser, not through any other instrument than through the spirit of God, and it is received by us through faith; but it is repaired, refreshed, and sealed by the sacred symbols.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>However, I have not now decided to fully discuss the sacraments, but only to provide your piety with an occasion to think about what it is that your people seem to say more than ours. Certainly, it seems to me that we must be very careful not to rebuild what we once destroyed. Once with all our common forces, we attacked, captured, and demolished that chief and pestilential doctrine of the sophists and the anchor of their market, that grace is conferred by the sacraments to those who do not place an obstacle. But now, using different words and a different form of speaking, to the laughter of the adversaries, we introduce something equivalent, that the things signified are exhibited by the sacraments to the faithful. What, I ask, is the difference between conferring and exhibiting, except that this is more vivid and somehow more effective? What, I pray, is the difference between grace and those things that are said to be exhibited by signs? Does not the very body of the Lord given for us, the blood shed, make us grateful and acceptable to God the Father? If therefore these are distributed and exhibited in the supper, grace is certainly conferred, we are certainly justified by the taking of the supper. For that justifies which absolves from sins and makes us grateful to God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>See, my most esteemed Pistorius, where we are led by those new expressions and words of ours devised daily! The apostle did not teach us about justification and sacraments in this way. The reason for the sacraments is the same. Therefore, what he produces about the Passover or circumcision can be applied to our baptism and the Lord's supper. But he teaches in Romans 4 that Abraham was justified before he was circumcised; he was justified by faith in the Messiah. The sacrament contributed nothing to righteousness; again, however, it was neither empty nor void; for the sign was added to seal the righteousness of faith, which was in Abraham's foreskin. So certainly the Lord's supper was instituted by the Lord to be a sealing of the righteousness of faith, namely of that faith which justifies, and it is believed that the Son of God gave himself for us and shed his blood - which faith was once given to the justified faithful; justified, I say, when they believed, not now first conferred in the supper, unless exercised by some special example in 1 Corinthians 14. But now it is exercised, renewed, and continued by the solemn and celebrated action of the supper.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I wish and would desire that some in Germany would be less inclined to conciliate with the antichrist. For what can we expect from those men, the evangelical and apostolic scripture has taught, and add also manifold experience. The Lord says in the gospel: "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another?" and Paul: "They are men," he says, "who resist the truth like Jannes and Jambres, corrupt in mind, reprobate concerning the faith," and avoid them. He does not say, make a compromise with them, or allow the truth to be obscured by a cloud because of them, or apply yourself to them and concede something so that they may also permit something, but avoid them! But because we do not obey the doctrine of the gospel and the apostles, we are immersed in many useless expenses, illusions, dangers, difficulties, and scandals. Some seem to think too much of themselves; may the Lord give them understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>But you, most esteemed brother in Christ, I say to you through our ministry and through Christ, whose ministers we are, I exhort you, if you are ever compelled to be involved in such compositions, to show yourself a faithful worker to God, rightly dividing the word of truth. Consider, I beseech you, what Moses and Aaron did when Pharaoh wanted to make a pact with them. He saw that the matter had come to such a point that something had to be done. Therefore, he wanted to let the people go, but under certain conditions. But Moses, a faithful servant in the house of the Lord, did not want the pact and rejected those prescribed conditions, urging the will and word of God. Experience abundantly teaches us what kind of people they are with whom you are dealing. You have been surrounded for a long time by bands of soldiers. It was not known whether they were friends or enemies. Finally, it appeared that they were enemies. By whose auspices and arts, I ask, did they move against you? Especially by the pontiff, with whose members and indeed intimates they mix conversations. Therefore, I see that all things are full of dangers. The Lord indeed delivered his church from the hand and mouth of the lion through the work of your prince; but the same requires gratitude, understanding, and prudence from us, lest we always foolishly offer ourselves to be mocked and beaten by robbers. My greatest hope here is in the mercy of the Lord and the cause itself. In ourselves, there is little hope. And I know the Lord will not fail us, provided we pray and watch seriously.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>In this, farewell with all yours. Commend me to the most illustrious prince and the brothers. Zurich, the last of March 1546.</p>
