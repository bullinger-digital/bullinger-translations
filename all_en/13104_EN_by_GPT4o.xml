    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich came to Konstanz three days ago on behalf of the Augsburg council to discuss an important matter with the heroic Sebastian Schertlin. Schertlin remembers Bullinger well and sends his regards. Frölich feels an even greater need than usual to see Bullinger again, but due to his many tasks and lack of time, it is not possible for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He has almost no hope left regarding the freedom of Germany and the continuation of the public preaching of the Gospel, as all supporters of the Pope are speaking in favor of the already made and upcoming decisions of the Council of Trent and are striving for [the cessation of the proclamation of the Gospel].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The imperial cities are also so drained and powerless by this perjured Spaniard, Emperor Charles V, that they can hardly remain free and will soon likely have city bailiffs and tax collectors imposed on them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] King Ferdinand, this son of the devil, has terribly devastated Bohemia and killed many people. He arrived in Augsburg after Frölich left the city and will destroy the remaining fortune. There is already such misery there due to the foreign soldiers, the plague, and the enormous inflation, as could not be greater. God will have mercy on the repentant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The people of Zurich should not take offense if they learn that the people of Konstanz are in peace negotiations with the Emperor. They are being cautious in this. They expect nothing great, neither security nor the favor of the Emperor, but wish to meet the Christian requirements. The Papists have imposed harsh sanctions on the people of Konstanz, which have already been publicly announced and implemented. This is what drives these good men to fulfill their duties [towards the Emperor]. May the Lord protect them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger thus sees that Frölich is in danger. Bullinger should pray for him so that he remains steadfast in case of emergency. God has already saved him from a pestilential illness (with fever, colic, and chest tightness).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] A Spaniard [...] in Augsburg has hired a scholar [...] to translate a topographical description and a map of Switzerland into Latin for him, because he could only find such documents in German. He is having all the cities, villages, roads, and mountains depicted very precisely. One can imagine on whose behalf and why he is doing this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger can reply through the present messenger [...] as Frölich will be in Konstanz for another four days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings also to the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, to the city clerk Hans Escher vom Luchs, to Rudolf Gwalther, to the dear Johannes Haller, to Konrad Gessner, Johannes Fries, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Johannes Wolf, and to all the scholars.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, my most distinguished brother, I arrived here on the business of our council and spent this time in serious discussions with the excellent hero Schertlin, who also spoke very highly of you and instructed me to send you his warmest regards. Although I have always greatly desired to be with you, at this time I have an even stronger desire to see and speak with you. However, my duties and the lack of time have prevented me from traveling to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What I most wish for you, friends and brothers, to know is this: I have little hope left for the freedom of Germany and the continuation of the public preaching of the Gospel of Christ. For all the supporters of the Pope are subscribing to the past and future Council of Trent and are striving for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Moreover, the cities of the empire, having broken faith and torn agreements, are so exhausted by the Spaniard that it seems impossible for them to remain free, and soon they will unwillingly have to accept governors and tax collectors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>King Ferdinand, this son of perdition, has miserably devastated Bohemia and slaughtered many good people. After my departure, he went to Augsburg to destroy the remaining happiness. The calamity in Augsburg is now so great, not only because of the impious soldiers but also due to the rampant plague, that it could hardly be greater. Add to this the extreme cost of all things! But the Lord will have mercy on us when we repent!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The people of Konstanz have a prudent plan to reconcile with the Emperor, not to find great faith or favor, but to satisfy Christian piety. Therefore, do not be offended if you hear that they are negotiating peace with the Emperor. The Papists have obtained very harsh mandates against the people of Konstanz, which have already been published and put into effect. This is what invites and encourages good men to their duties. May the Lord protect them mercifully!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You understand from the above what dangers I am involved in. Therefore, pray to the Lord for the strength and constancy of Laetus, should he ever be afflicted! I have endured a semi-plague: fever, colic, and chest tightness all at once; but the Lord has graciously restored me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There is a Spaniard in Augsburg who, unable to obtain a cosmography or map of Switzerland in any language other than German, hired a scholar to translate everything into Latin for him. From this, the Spaniard is striving to depict all the cities, villages, roads, and mountains of Switzerland as accurately as possible. One can conjecture on whose orders and for what purpose he is doing this. Many believe it is being done insidiously.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>If you wish to reply, the messenger can deliver the letters to me, as I am compelled to stay here for four days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Greet the lords consuls, the city clerk, Gwalther, my dearest Haller, Gesner, Fries, Pellican, Bibliander, Wolf, and the entire circle of scholars. Farewell, my honor! October 25, 1547, from Konstanz. Yours, Georg Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, to be delivered by hand.</p>
