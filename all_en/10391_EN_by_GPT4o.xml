    <p xml:id="regest1">Gladly sought information on Bullinger's two questions and laments the difficult times. The impending war: Philip of Hesse will be in Württemberg before Pentecost. The French king and the Duke of Lorraine are tying up the Habsburgs in Alsace and Breisach with their armies. Bavaria is arming itself against an invasion from Austria or Bohemia. King Ferdinand has battle-tested commanders, but no money for troops. The Voivode Zápolya has occupied all of Hungary. Philip of Hesse has been driven to war preparations by Ferdinand's threat, which have remained hidden for so long from the Habsburg opposition, in favor of Duke Ulrich's principality of Württemberg and the evangelical cause. Myconius judges Erasmus and Luther as negatively as Bullinger does. He quotes the insult of Hieronymus Emser and Oecolampadius from a passage in a work of Luther communicated to him by Markus Bertschi. He asks for Bullinger's help in finding a man suitable for church service. Wolfgang Kuchimeister can send him his son. He asks for news from the Diet.</p>

      <p>S. I was glad to learn about the two matters you wrote about. But good God, what misery! There is nothing more to say.</p>
      <p>Regarding the impending war, the situation is as follows: The Prince of Hesse will be in the Duchy of Württemberg with his army before Pentecost. The commander of this army is the Duke of Brunswick, and besides him, there are dukes, counts, and nobles, truly great men. The cause itself has the favor of all. There is a large amount of money, many soldiers, many war machines, and the entire apparatus is as it should be. The King and, as some say, the Duke of Lorraine have an army jointly hidden and thus fortified, in case the first of the House of Austria, that is, the people of Sundgau, Alsace, and Breisach, prepare to rush to defend Württemberg. The Duke of Bavaria will guard against any harm from Austria or Bohemia with a triple army. He is said to have drawn five commanders away from the Spanish Emperor with a huge sum of money. The enemy now finally knows the preparation, but still hesitates about where it is heading. He has commanders, as some say, more experienced, but lacks soldiers, because Ferdinand struggles with extreme poverty. There is also a rumor that the Voivode Zápolya has completely occupied the kingdom of Hungary, closing it off to Ferdinand. Hesse is moved because he is harassed by more than horrendous threats from Ferdinand, and unless he approached the matter in this way, it would be over for his principality, for the justice of the gospel, and for all who have depended on the prince so far, and such great turmoil would occur throughout Germany - Ferdinand is driven both by himself and by the priests - as has hardly ever been seen. Therefore, God must be prayed to, that He may favor His own and be mercifully present. The miracle I see here is that the matter, instituted for so long - for almost five years, although it has been in action for two full years - still remains hidden from the enemy and others, except for those who have dealt with it, even after the army is ready to march. Without God, such long silence does not seem possible. For what we write, hardly anyone knows except a very few, so I would like it to be kept with you as well, as long as it is useful. So much for the war.</p>
      <p>Regarding Erasmus and Luther, I feel the same as you do about the latter. They were beneficial at the beginning, now no one harms more perniciously. One is proud and insolent, the other bitter and ambitious. God, I hope, may favor, or rather correct, both. The interpreter of Oecolampadius has something milder than what you write about Luther. For he says: "And I am fully convinced that Emser and Oecolampadius and those like them were suddenly extinguished by these horrible blows and shakings." I read this only as indicated by our Markus Bertschi. I wonder if it is different in the Lutheran copy. Indeed, I would dare to swear that Luther is convinced the Holy Spirit is only with him and his followers. Time will reveal everything. May God grant us His truth.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we need your work: We need a learned, wise, and prudent man. If you know anyone who can be given to support our church, either from your own or elsewhere, please inform us as soon as possible. Apply diligence, for it is necessary.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Kuchimeister, the table maker, wants to send me his son; urging him, if it is convenient, the sooner the better, so I will test him (examine), as he wrote to me. It was not possible to write to him during leisure.</p>
      <p>Write to me about what has been done at this Diet, when you know, so that I may see how the envoys agree or disagree.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, April 20, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, learned and pious brother in his Lord. Zürich.</p>
