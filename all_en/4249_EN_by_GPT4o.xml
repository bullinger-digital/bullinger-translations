      <p>The Lord truly tests me.</p>
      <p>Now for the first time, I begin to understand what men are. Previously, my adversaries attacked me; now my own friends hinder me.</p>
      <p>Pray to God to guard my senses.</p>
      <p>I have sinned in some things, broken by impatience.</p>
      <p>I see these things as being most harmful to me.</p>
      <p>I will be steadfast, and I wish you to be firmly convinced of this, and with God's help, I will emerge from this labyrinth. That action rises daily; unless I am divinely assisted, it is impossible for me not to be ruined. I was recently before the senate of the academy and I asked about these: 1. Whether my disputed theses were approved by them for so long or not. 2. Whether they still approve or disapprove or whether they have changed their opinion. 3. Whether in other assertions, which I have presented to the adversary for the sake of clarification, there is anything that conflicts either with the disputed theses or with the public declaration of the disputed theses. 4. Whether they can allow the press for my confession and those assertions.</p>
      <p>Some counselors were offended by these questions; they interpreted it as if I wanted to drag them into that cause; for they are not brave enough. Minquitius is the stronghold of the adversaries, and as long as he is here, nothing solid can be hoped for; for he incites other princes or at least their counselors to criticize our prince for dismissing Tilemann and to dissuade him from continuing to act in this matter. The Lord reigns in this cause.</p>
      <p>Pray to God to grant a happy outcome and to avert turbulent movements. My father, the spirits are so exasperated that I see it does not benefit the propagation of the truth for me to be here at this time. I would gladly come to you; but I am so poor that I do not know how I can undertake such a long journey to you with my wife, child, and family. I cannot find a place in the vicinity because of the rumor.</p>
      <p>The slanders grow so much that both counts themselves are afraid to give me lodging. Hipperius advises that it would be beneficial for me to be absent from Heidelberg for a longer time.</p>
      <p>What has happened in the meantime is much more pleasant than what I previously told you.</p>
