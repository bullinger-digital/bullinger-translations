    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the current war turmoil, Vadian will receive news from the Zurich council. Augsburg trembles and seems (probably because of its great wealth) to be particularly exposed to the danger of an attack. Allegedly, troops are preventing Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse from coming to the aid of the cities of [southern] Germany. However, Bullinger is of the opinion that the Landgrave will soon appear with an army appropriate for the situation. Bullinger is still waiting for news from Lower Germany. The Basel council also reports only rarely. It is known that Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is showing courage and will assist the [southern German] cities. Regarding the Confederates, Bullinger does not give up hope. Vadian should send delegates familiar to him to the upcoming [Tagsatzung] in Baden. Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria is said not to have been willing to take up arms because of religion. Consequently, Emperor [Charles V] is said to have presented him with another pretext for war. The Rhineland nobility refuses to assist the Emperor. If Vadian has reliable news, he should share it. May God give courage and strength to His own and instill fear in the opponents!</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is nothing for me to write about the war turmoil; for you will learn about it from our council. I see Augsburg trembling greatly and perhaps because of its great wealth, it is being targeted more than other cities. They say that Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is being detained by some soldiers and horsemen, preventing him from aiding the German cities. However, I believe none of these rumors. I hope he will soon appear with a properly equipped army. The brothers in Lower Germany remain silent. I am waiting daily to see what they will write about their movements. Indeed, the Basel council has given only a few reports to our council. It is certain that Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is of a strong and fearless spirit and will bring faithful aid to the cities. I do not even despair about the Swiss Confederates. Be sure that your people in Baden are also faithful. Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria is said to have replied to the Emperor Charles V that he does not wish to fight with arms because of religion; therefore, the Emperor presents other pretexts. The Rhineland nobility have refused to assist the Emperor.</p>
      <p>If you have any more certain information, share it. Live and farewell! Let us pray to the Lord to inspire courage and strength in our people, and fear and confusion in our adversaries.</p>
      <p>June 28, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
