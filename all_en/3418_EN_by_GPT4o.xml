      <p>S. D. I am grateful for your goodwill towards me, most learned and dearest teacher in the Lord, which you have shown through this magnificent gift, sent to me by an author both most precious and delightful to me. Therefore, I am now bound to you with the utmost loyalty.</p>
      <p>For these 26 sermons of yours have affected me so much, have drawn me entirely into admiration of you, and have held me steadfast in the same, that I can neither express it in words nor could you, if I were to express it, believe it. Therefore, continue to write, debate, strive, delight, and above all, to conquer those rabid and judgmentless men, who with their shouts and furious pamphlets are once again stirring up the sacred fire. For there are some ill-fated minds born in Saxony, in hatred of good men and to the detriment of public tranquility, who offer themselves to the world to be mocked with their virulent and more than scurrilous writings, as can be seen in the contention that occurred in Worms during the colloquy among our people, which I believe has been spread everywhere in pamphlets, not without great harm to the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>The colloquy was established, as you know, in Worms by the estates of the empire for the sake of religion, so that matters might be settled quietly and peacefully by both parties. But alas, when our people ought to meet with the adversaries in a spirit of gentleness and leniency, those who stand on our side tear each other apart, just as if dogs, who ought to pursue a wild beast in the forest, were to bite each other and let the beast escape. Thus, our people, who ought to pursue the most wicked beast, namely the Pope, with the word of God, are fighting over unnecessary matters and allow that most wicked beast, namely the Pope, to go free. If this is not madness, then no one has ever been mad.</p>
      <p>I pity the good Philipp Melanchthon, and likewise Johannes Brenz, who are both sincere and pious theologians, and I will never allow myself to be torn away from their pious and sound doctrine, whom I also know are not opposed to you; but I trust that the supreme ruler of things will, with his secret and inscrutable counsels, turn everything to a happy outcome; for he alone can bring the unwise counsels of men to joyful and good results. Concerning your son, you need not be anxious; he has been advised by me not to engage in any frivolous company. Then I asked his master, the baker, about his conduct; he also found nothing lacking in him. But I will listen more diligently.</p>
      <p>Then I received 3 florins in coins.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish you to trust that everything is most ready for you and yours from me, for both the antiquity of our love and my custom towards my own and your many services to me demand it.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, the only Savior, together with your whole family, whom you will greet in my name earnestly. There is no news here except about Polweiler, who, with great disgrace and loss, even leaving the cannons unpaid, has left for France, which you may perhaps know better than I. Hastily, very quickly, Augsburg, November 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Bibliander, Gwalther, and all the pious and learned men. Yours devotedly, Johannes Ehinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and teacher, to be honored with eternal veneration.</p>
