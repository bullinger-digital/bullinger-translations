      <p>S. D. P. Once again, venerable father, I interrupt you with my foolish letters and disturb your holy studies (for which I beg you to forgive me in all things), not because I wish to extract any response from you to my previous letters. For as those letters are not worthy of your response, so there is nothing of such weight contained in them that should compel you to respond, and besides, I most willingly spare your advanced age (may it still be extended to us for as long as possible), I say, I spare that most venerable old age. However, what has moved me to write to you now is that, since a certain almost tragic and inauspicious controversy has arisen between Mr. Tobias Imhof and Mr. Johannes Gantner, formerly pastors of this church or city and colleagues among themselves, which undoubtedly must be discussed and resolved in the next synod by the brothers, indeed by those in Rhaetia who purely preach Christ, there are some preachers among us of not the least authority and condition who have also encouraged me, already inclined to do so, to write to you and to ask you, in the name of our entire synod, to act with the authority you possess, so that a man of rare and distinguished piety, learning, and authority from among you may be sent with the authority to act to our next synod, to be celebrated, namely either Mr. Heinrich Bullinger or, if it is less convenient for him due to his grave age, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther or Mr. Johannes Wolf or finally Mr. Ludwig Lavater, who by their work, skill, and authority may not only help to settle the controversial matter but also defend and advocate the cause of truth and finally lead it to a happier and more desirable conclusion, by which the offenses of the mind may be removed as conveniently as possible and dangers avoided, and so that other matters, perhaps of no less importance and which may require no less mature consultation and deliberation than the former, may be more rightly and justly resolved in...</p>
