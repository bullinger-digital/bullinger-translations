      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Osiander requested dismissal from the council of Nuremberg and was dismissed; for he did not want to witness the change of religion and left after three days without informing any of the brothers, nor did he tell his wife where he was going or to whom. Some think he was called by the King of England. I would never have believed he was so poor, as many have said various and many things about his wealth. The Duke of Brunswick harasses the people of Goslar, Brunswick, and Magdeburg daily, which cities still strongly resist the impious commands of the Interimists. The impious prince, or if you prefer, the insane one, has obtained five thousand from the emperor; he is so impoverished; thus he wishes to satisfy his creditors. These papists can do everything, they achieve everything they want. The people of Magdeburg have foreign soldiers, with whom they defend themselves against their enemies; however, they have only 600 foot soldiers.</p>
      <p>The people of Brunswick have promised assistance and cavalry if needed. Erasmus Albert acts as a vigorous supporter in Magdeburg with other excellent men.</p>
      <p>Many have perished from the plague; but now the plague has ceased, and they wish to offer themselves to Christ before they accept any impious doctrine. Aepinus, the preacher of Hamburg, has written extensively against the Interim, as have some others. I gathered this from letters and a courier from Magdeburg, who brought letters to Brentius these days, in which he is called with great promises to be the pastor of the church of Magdeburg. Schnepf, the preacher, was forced to leave his preaching office and left TÃ¼bingen; perhaps he is hiding in some castle until the Lord grants more favorable times.</p>
      <p>Nit wit von Heilbronn was a pastor in a village, where there was also a half-stipend; the priests have settled back in, accused the preacher to the Spaniards, who captured him, took him from Schoterdorf, bound like a thief, burned his books for 60 florins, also plundered his house, and drove out his wife and child. There one can see the virtue that the Interim established by the Emperor or by some theologians has.</p>
      <p>About other matters, our Myconius will write to you.</p>
      <p>Brentius sends his regards to you and gladly read your letters mentioning him with admiration. I have discussed the matter of the supper with him more than once, and indeed I cannot disapprove of his opinion, even if he writes more intricately about this matter. He feels, as you write: the dispute is in words, while in reality, we agree. You can write to him freely; for he is worthy to be consoled by the brothers who profess Christ. He is in exile, left his wife with six children in Halle bedridden and crippled; he is a burden or trouble to no one among us. If only he could find a place to stay with us or in Switzerland. He is already writing a commentary on the prophet Isaiah.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is gathering cavalry and enlisting, what he intends to do, it is easy to sense. He is dangerously ill; for I heard from someone from Freiburg, whom a nobleman from Brussels sent to Dr. Gravella to accomplish something. But he had to leave and did not accomplish anything; for he says, they told him at the court, the Emperor is so sick that they have to bleed him.</p>
      <p>When he got out of bed, they had to put him back in it after eight days. The people of Freiburg sent this messenger and forbade him to say that the Emperor is so sick; instead, he should say that the Emperor is healthy, rides out hunting, etc.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
