      <p>Strasbourg, April 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Savior and life! In the frequent crowd of the Frankfurt fairs, dearest Bullinger, your Froschauer brought letters and books to me. He asked that I faithfully send them through someone trustworthy to England, which your letters, certainly very pleasing to me, also requested. I gladly performed this service. By chance, the servant of our most faithful friend, Richard Hilles, was present, whom he sent to me for certain business: to him, I entrusted the book and letters dedicated to the king, along with all your other letters. I did not entrust the remaining books to him without reason. For first, it is fitting that the king be preferred to others and receive his before others, lest what could be rare and pleasing becomes less pleasing because it is common to many. Therefore, I enclosed the other two, which pertain to Hooper and another, with goods, which I ensured would be sent correctly from Antwerp. I instructed the servant to give the book and letters to Master Richard; I also wrote to Master Richard to commend the same to Master Hooper. Hooper's name is famous among all the English. Made a royal preacher, an enemy of the Lutherans and Bucerans, an outstanding defender and promoter of true faith. His praise flourishes clearly among all, both for his innocence of life and for his discipline. May the Lord perfect what He has begun through him.</p>
      <p>Bucer has dangerously relapsed into his old illness. Richard wrote that there is no, or very little, hope of life. If he dies, England will be happy and more blessed than all lands, as it will be freed from two most pernicious minds, Paulinus and Buceranus, in one year. New sects arise among us daily, there is always a new face of religion. I truly believe our learned men are delighted by novelty and the variety of things.</p>
      <p>We have a brotherhood here, authored by Paul Fagius. They have their little meetings on appointed days, in which questions are inquired by a foolish commoner, much more foolish (as I hear) than those of the Thomists or Scotists. Also, a new kind of confession, or (as they call it) preparation before the holy supper, has been instituted by the preachers without the consent of the magistrate or the people: nor is anyone allowed to approach the holy communion who has not first shown himself to the priest. And they defend this solely with the holy gospel's sentence, "I know my own, and my own know me." Therefore, it is not permitted to approach the synaxis unless known by the preacher.</p>
      <p>Marbach publicly preached this, to which I almost responded with: "And I call my sheep by name;" therefore, it is necessary to call those who approach by their proper name.</p>
      <p>These things are ridiculous but truly pitiable, and written for no other reason than to let you understand into what errors the new and tender church still falls. What do you think will happen after a hundred years if we are already stumbling in open light? May God preserve you and your church incorrupt; and grant His grace that our English church may be purely instituted and preserved. I have enclosed some beginnings here, which could be explained to you by Master John Butler.</p>
      <p>We have here now at Saint Thomas a Swiss preacher, who is rumored to have been expelled or fled from you long ago for adultery: then having become your enemy, he fled to Bern; where he attempted some sedition and disturbance, and for that, as it is said, was expelled by the magistrate. Indeed, the rumor is quite bad, and it has given me no small offense so far: yet I think it false. If I understood it to be certain, I would consider the man no other than a heathen and publican, unless he is reconciled to you and the Bernese church; nor is he worthy to take the divine testament upon his lips, since he himself hates discipline. I wish to be informed by you about this matter. Furthermore, the state of the Strasbourg church is still as it was after the papists were overthrown. The magistrate sent an envoy to the Emperor, Master Copius, who is considered a good man. We have certain news of a composed peace between the English, French, and Scots. I have not yet received the conditions of peace, but I will receive them shortly; which I will share with you.</p>
      <p>I wish to be informed about the state and condition of my relative John; whether he is pronounced suitable for your church or not. If he seems less suitable, which I have always feared and still fear, a condition is offered to him by which he could support himself comfortably. I wish, therefore, that a judgment be made about him, so that we may be certain of what to hope for him. For if he neglects the present time, and is then rejected by you, it will not be easy to provide for him afterward. He will be expected until the feast of John. If he does not seem suitable to you, I would like to be warned before that day, so that he can be provided for: for there is a sufficiently bright and suitable condition for his talent at hand, which if he neglects now and is later inconvenient to you, it will certainly not be easy to provide for him in the future. I wish, therefore, for your express opinion on this matter. If you do not want him, send him to me. Farewell with your dear wife and children.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>The letters that Master Christopher Hales received from your church, he lost along with the pouch. If, therefore, anything of great importance was written by you in the same, you can repeat it in the next ones. May God preserve you! I received these enclosed letters the day before.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
