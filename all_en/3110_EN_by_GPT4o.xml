      <p>Greetings. Yesterday after 4 PM, dearest Bullinger, your letters were delivered to me. Due to the stormy weather at dinner time, it was not possible for the esteemed men to come; today I wanted to visit them all and greet them around the eighth hour and invite them to lunch or dinner, whichever they preferred. But behold, sad news is announced, namely that they already wish to set out on their journey, booted and hatted, so I was only able to send my Raphael to them, to offer a noble fish and wines from my cellar, which otherwise would have been offered more abundantly and generously in my house. I am very sorry that it was not possible, which I greatly desired, so the brevity of time forced me to offer salted flour, whereas otherwise they would have been received with fragrant incense. I ask you to consider this occasion favorably. Do not worry about your son; I will exert every effort so that I do not appear to have neglected him.</p>
      <p>There would be more to write, but I did not want to delay those who are about to leave. I expect nothing from the diet (assembly). The king is asking for twelve hundred thousand (1,200,000), namely auxiliary troops against the Turkish rage. I fear that a large part will be used to appease the creditors' attacks, which have left the poor king completely drained.</p>
      <p>Religion is composed... Sidonius, Canisius, Wicelius.</p>
