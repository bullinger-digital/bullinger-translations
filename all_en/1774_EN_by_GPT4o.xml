      <p>S. D. P. Dearest brother, my most recent letter I sent to you via the Gotthard; remember well, it was delivered to you. There is a region near us called Davos, a prominent and notable place of the Three Leagues, but a wild and large parish. Their pastor passed away three weeks ago from this time, with great sorrow from his church and all of us; for he was a very honorable man, who had worked diligently in the gospel for more than thirty years; he was over 70 years old. The Landammann (chief magistrate) of the region came to us and requested our help and advice, that they might be provided with another shepherd, to which we are entirely inclined; yet there is no one among us to whom we can entrust this honorable place. They have earnestly asked us to write to you and inquire if there is anyone who would take on the position. They gave the previous pastor a hundred Rhenish guilders annually; they now offer to improve the salary, so that they might obtain a good preacher. He need not be young, but a mature, capable man, without any lustfulness, but of serious demeanor, who can hold and let go; for great assemblies are held there at times. We would also prefer that he be a native Swiss and not a foreigner, and if you find someone suitable for us, write to us; then the region will formally write and call for him, etc. - Regarding the war, we hear nothing good; also, among other things, there is talk that Sch√§rtli has been captured. If there is anything of the sort, we ask that you inform us. Farewell. December 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>The pious men, Consul Haimius and Tscharnerus, greet you. Yours most devotedly, Philippus Gallicius, Johannes Comander. To the truly great man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Dear advice on this; if you know an honorable man, indicate him. Send me this letter back.</p>
