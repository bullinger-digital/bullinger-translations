      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you a few days ago, dearest compater, and there is nothing to add at present, except that Schertlin wrote to me three days ago that Duke Georg of Mecklenburg, with 12 cohorts of soldiers and some cavalry, is besieging Magdeburg, yet the city can easily let anyone in or out. It is well supplied with soldiers and provisions, and an army is being prepared by certain princes to liberate it.</p>
      <p>Then he indicated the threefold plan of the Emperor towards the double dealing of the princes and estates, especially regarding the continuation of the Council of Trent, with the Roman Pontiff agreeing, or rather colluding, to this until the middle of Lent. May the Lord scatter the plans of the princes.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to send these, as soon as you have the opportunity, to St. Gallen to Mr. Vadianus, and obtain from him that he does not hesitate to send them to Augsburg when the occasion arises.</p>
      <p>My wife Esther and Nicolaus seem to be recovering by the grace of the Lord. The plague has not yet abated among us. If only the plague of corrupt morals would at least abate here and throughout all of our Germany. Farewell excellently, most esteemed man and dearest compater. Bern, December 6, 1550. Greetings to all of yours.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most outstanding theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
