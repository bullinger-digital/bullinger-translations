    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letters [No. 1669f] and will return [the enclosure?] after copying; the two copies [of his commentary on Matthew] cost 28 Batzen. As requested by von Rümlang, he has written to [Peter] Kunz in his own name and in the name of Erasmus [Schmid]. It was unwise to send the son of the treasurer to [Johannes] Fries, as he already hosts 20 students; Bullinger could have accommodated him with [Peter] Kolin and also provided a bed himself, but he withdraws in light of the recommendation to Fries. He asks for news about the [Swiss] troops in Italy and France; [Christoph] Froschauer will probably come to Bern soon. It is not possible for him to write more now.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>With great joy and expectation, I received your letters, dearest Eberhard, and I give you immortal thanks. After I have copied the example, I will send it back.</p>
      <p>The two copies cost 28 Batzen. I wrote to Kunz as you requested, in the name of Erasmus and myself. Regarding the treasurer's son, I wish it had been handled more prudently. Fries is a diligent and good man, but he hosts 20 young men in one lodging. You can imagine how studies are hindered by such a crowd. I had arranged accommodation for him with Peter Kolin, a most learned and upright man, and I was going to provide a bed myself; however, since he was recommended to Fries, I easily yielded.</p>
      <p>I pray you write if you have any news from Italy or France about our troops. I think Froschauer will soon come to Bern.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I could not write more now, otherwise I would have written more. Farewell again with all good things.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 4th of October, 1542.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Eberhard von Rümlang, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
