      <p>In great haste. I have received your letter from the pious pastor at Rheinau regarding the book, along with the letter to the gentlemen in Ulm; I will send him his letter with the book by the first messenger these days, also writing to him myself, explaining the reasons why it cannot be printed here. We no longer have a printer; our printer has gone to school and sold the printing press. The book would indeed be worth printing, and it would be timely. I thought that Fries in your area would gladly have it printed; in my opinion, it is a very valuable truth.</p>
      <p>I have also received your other letter; I will send you the entire work as soon as I get to read it. It is not yet published; they are first exploring the spirits of men; I hope the dear God will send everything in a different direction than some have in mind.</p>
      <p>As for your opinion that it was wrong to get involved, you know well that it could not have been handled with any cleverness or propriety; for how could or should we have acted? You know how things have stood with us everywhere and still do. We have no misfortune in getting involved. May the Lord prevent us from offending God in any way! Help us sincerely with all faithfulness to cry out to God.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless the dealings with Bern, so that peace and unity of the Church of Christ may be preserved! If the matter with the war is true, then the affair is wonderfully practiced and directed so that each one may continue in his undertaking and maintain his affairs.</p>
      <p>I have not seen Claudius anymore, do not know how his affairs stand or where he is; his wife is in Winterthur in childbirth. May the Lord have mercy on both of them! I recently gave him 5 guilders upon his departure so that he might settle his affairs in Winterthur, etc. I do not know if he has done so.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on May 15, 1548.</p>
      <p>A[mbrosius] B[larer].</p>
      <p>We have no news at all, not a word; it is very quiet. But what do your assemblies bring?</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his own. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
