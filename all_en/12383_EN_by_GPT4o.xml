    <p xml:id="regest1">When Hooper lived as a courtier at the court of King [Henry VIII] a few years ago, he began to diligently study the works of Zwingli and Bullinger's commentaries on Paul. Since he was able to live independently as an adult thanks to his father's kindness [...], he turned to the study of religion, even though he was initially devoted to a false worship. Now, however, he wishes to serve God with a pure heart. He is ashamed that he did not do this earlier.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- As he reveres the people of Zurich, he wanted to visit them long ago, but has so far been prevented by illness and financial difficulties, especially since his father, whose sole heir he is, strongly opposes his [new] religious stance. Hooper intends to return to [England] in a month to bid farewell to worldly honors, pleasures, and friends. At the same time, he will try to obtain at least part of the inheritance due to him, in order to live modestly in Zurich. However, if God has planned otherwise, he will renounce the treasures of Egypt (to use a word from Paul [Hebrews 11:26]) and embrace poverty and exile in the hope of eternal life. Therefore, he asks Bullinger and the Zurich community to pray for his journey, for he fears the treacherous bishops, whose greatest concern is to shed the blood of pious people; a danger he himself has often faced. Through the power of prayer, [King] Hezekiah was able to defeat the Assyrian king [Sennacherib] [2 Kings 18:7, 19:15-19], Elijah called down fire from heaven [2 Kings 1:12], and [King] Jehoshaphat defeated [the Moabites and Ammonites] [2 Chronicles 20].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- News from England: Hardly any other nation is so devoted to idolatry [as the English]. [Henry VIII] has indeed destroyed [the power of] the Pope, but not the [doctrine] of the papacy. He has destroyed the monasteries, incorporated their possessions into the state treasury, expelled the monks and nuns, and yet they, including the nuns (of whom there are at least 10,000 in England), must commit to celibacy. Mass, celibacy, invocation of saints, auricular confession, fasting, and purgatory hold a higher status than ever before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The treaty [of Whitehall], concluded by Emperor [Charles V] and [Henry VIII] on [February 11, 1543], is to be extended. There is no hope for peace between the French and the English; instead, a cruel war is expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The main pillars of the Gospel in England are dying by the hour. In recent years, [Thomas] Audley, Lord Chancellor; [Charles Brandon], Duke of Suffolk; [Edward] Baynton, [Vice]-Chamberlain of the Queen [Catherine Parr]; [Thomas] Poinings, Governor [of Henry VIII in Boulogne]; the [poet and diplomat] Thomas Wyatt; and [William] Butts, the personal physician [of Henry VIII], have all passed away. All were members of the Privy Council and true followers of the Gospel; they succumbed to the plague or the [English] fever, leaving the country entirely in the hands of the bishops and [opponents of the Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] and the Bishop of Westminster [Thomas Thirlby] are negotiating for [Henry VIII] with [Charles V] in Brabant. The Bishop of Durham [Cuthbert Tunstall] recently returned unsuccessfully from Picardy, where he had been sent to negotiate peace between the French and the English with the envoys of King [Francis I].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [outcome] of the [tense] situation between the Scots and the English remains uncertain. The English have captured important Scottish towns and villages, not to mention the dreadful devastation of the land by the Earl of Hertford [Sir Edward Seymour] in the summer [of 1545]. The Queen of Scotland [Mary Stuart] is hiding with Cardinal [David Beaton, a supporter of the "Auld Alliance"] in heavily fortified castles [Stirling and Dunkeld].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- As Hooper gathers from a letter from Bucer, the Regensburg religious discussion has been suspended. Melanchthon had not yet arrived. Bucer is therefore expected to return [to Strasbourg] earlier. Hooper will report further to Bullinger as soon as he learns more. Elector [Frederick II] of the Palatinate recently allowed the free preaching of the Gospel in his dominion, although in the matter of the Lord's Supper he has, as the saying goes, gone from the horse to the donkey, as he moved from the doctrine of the papacy to that of Luther, which in this respect is worse than that of the papists; for those who replace the substance of the bread in the sacrament with the body of Christ are closer to the truth than those who claim that the natural body of Christ is with, in, and under the bread and yet is nowhere. Hooper hopes that God will grant [the Elector Palatine] a better understanding.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Richard [Hilles] and his wife [Anna, née Lacey] send their regards. In Hilles' house, a noblewoman [...] and her younger sister Anne [t'Serclaes] are staying. The latter is very devout, always prays for Bullinger, and commends herself to the prayers of the Zurich community. Hopefully, Bullinger will soon get to know her as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to [Theodor] Bibliander and [Konrad] Pellikan, among others. Bullinger may count Hooper among the friends of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- [Enclosure:] Hooper asks for Bullinger's opinion. He believes that it is not permissible for a believer to participate in the mass and other blasphemous services of the papists. However, some objections sometimes make him uncertain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Calvin has written some things on the subject, but does not address all the arguments of the adversaries, so Hooper now seeks Bullinger's opinion on some questions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Regarding Naaman, the [commander of the army of the king of] Syria [2 Kings 5:1-19]: Hooper knows that one should not make a general rule from a single case, but it cannot be ignored here that the prophet [Elisha] says to [Naaman]: "Go in peace!" Those who are not familiar with Hebrew interpret these words as follows: "If you want to return, then this is at your own risk; but I do not endorse this." However, the Hebrew "Go in peace" expresses a command and also an approval. This allows [Naaman] to worship the true God in the house of [the Assyrian deity] Rimmon, in the hope of converting the Syrian king and others. If Hooper's interpretation is correct, then this must also be allowed [today], especially since the prophet [Elisha] granted it to a pious man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- When Elijah complained to God that he was the only believer left, he learned from God that there were still 7,000 [1 Kings 19:14-18]. If all these people had not participated in idolatrous services, it would be expected that [Elijah] knew at least some of them. Moreover, Hooper cannot imagine how anyone could deny that these people remained faithful to God in their hearts, even if they were publicly with the impious in the idol temples. No objection moves him more than this one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Just as God forbids idolatry, he also prohibits adultery, fornication, and other misdeeds, and he does not condemn [idolatry] more than the other [offenses]. However, no one has to leave their homeland because of one or the other [misdeed]...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Hooper writes this not only to seek Bullinger's opinion but also to live accordingly. He himself has no doubt in the matter; he wishes, however, to satisfy pious people who are not yet sufficiently instructed in the faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] as well as to the Englishman [John] Burcher living in Zurich.</p>

      <p>To his dearest lord, Heinrich Bullinger, a man most esteemed for both piety and learning, John Hooper wishes perpetual happiness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest1">
      <p>A few years ago, when I lived more than enough as a courtier at the court of our king, most honorable lord and dearest brother in Christ, certain works of Mr. Huldrych Zwingli, a man of blessed memory, and commentaries on the Pauline epistles, which your kindness has most successfully made known to the entire world as a lasting monument to your name, presented themselves to me with a favorable and happy omen. I did not want to neglect these excellent gifts of God presented to the whole world through you, especially since I saw that they seriously dealt with the salvation and eternal happiness of my soul: therefore, with all diligence, and as if with a certain superstitious diligence, I deemed it worthwhile to devote nights and days to your writings; nor was this labor ever burdensome to me in this matter. For after I left my youth behind, and by my father's kindness had the freedom to live more liberally, I began to blaspheme God with impious worship and every kind of idolatry (emulating the impiety of my ancestors) before I rightly knew what God was; yet, having been delivered from this by God's kindness, which I attribute solely to God and to you, nothing now remains concerning the rest of my life and my final fate, except that I worship God with a pure mind (and know what is lacking for me while living in this body, since the state of life is deceptive, and all men are nothing) and serve pious brothers in Christ, but the impious for Christ's sake: for I do not think that a Christian is born for himself, nor should he live for himself; but whatever he has or is, he should attribute it all not to himself, but to God the author, and consider all his goods to be common to all, as the necessity and poverty of the brothers demand. I am indeed exceedingly ashamed that I did not do this before; but like a brute beast, as the greatest part of men are wont, I served my passions; but it is better to be wise late than never to be wise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Because of my love and reverence for you, I had often intended to come to you, although I have always been hindered, partly because of my adverse health, partly because I am suspicious of the kindness of fortune; for my father, of whom I am the only son and heir, is so opposed to me because of the religion of Christ, that if I do not want to obey his counsel, I know that I will have him not as a father, but rather as a cruel tyrant. However, shortly, after a month, I will return to my homeland to bid farewell to honors, pleasures, and friends of this world; and there I will try, if possible, to have at least some part of my right through friends, so that I may live modestly with you in Zurich; and if God has seen otherwise, and it pleases Him to oppress me with poverty and want or in any other way, I will bear it with an even mind, and I would rather choose to be afflicted with the people of God in exile than to enjoy the temporary comforts of sin; I consider (to use Paul's words) the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; I have regard for the reward; I hope for eternal life, not earned by my merits but obtained by the blood of Christ. Therefore, I beseech you, O man of God, by our Lord Jesus Christ, to help me in this journey with prayers to God for me; for I fear those treacherous bishops, and not without reason, whose greatest concern is the shedding of the blood of pious men; whose minds and dispositions I have often experienced, and not without great danger to life. Therefore, I wish to arm myself with the remedies given to us by God against their snares and tyranny; I seek the assistance of your church, so that aided by its prayers, I may feel some solace from it according to God's promise, who is always present to all who call upon Him in truth, from whom alone help is to be sought in every danger. For nothing can be a firmer defense than faithful prayer; through it, Hezekiah overcame the king of Assyria, Elijah called down fire from heaven, Jehoshaphat obtained a marvelous victory. But the prayer will not flow further, lest I offend your pious and most learned ears with these letters cultivated by such a crude Minerva.</p>

      <p>Receive in a few words what news England brings, dearest lord. As far as true religion is concerned, nowhere among the nations does idolatry flourish more: our king has slain the Pope, but not the papacy; he has expelled all monks and nuns, destroyed their monasteries, and ordered all their goods to be carried into his treasury; yet they themselves are bound to perpetual chastity by the king's command, even that fragile sex of women; England has at least ten thousand nuns, yet none are given the power to contract marriage. The impious masses, the most disgraceful celibacy of priests, the invocation of saints, auricular confession, superstitious abstinence from foods, purgatory, were never held in greater esteem by the people than at this time.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The treaty that was concluded two years ago between the emperor and our king, I have just received by letters, is being renewed; may God turn everything to the glory of His name. There is no hope of peace between the French and the English, but we expect a bloody war daily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Those who most favor the gospel in England are dying by the hour: for two years now, many most illustrious men have met their day; Lord Audley, Chancellor of the Kingdom; the Duke of Suffolk; Lord Baynton, first of the queen's chambers; Lord Poynings, who acted as the king's deputy in the town of Boulogne; Sir Thomas Wyatt, known to the whole world (for his illustrious virtues) as a defender of your and Christ's religion; Doctor Butts, the physician who always had the care of the king's body; all were of the king's council, and truly favored the gospel, and as much as they could, promoted the glory of God. They have now ended their course by plague and fever, so that the land is now entirely left to the bishops and those who despise God and all true worship.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Bishop of Winchester and the Bishop of Westminster, our king's envoys, are now dealing with the emperor in Brabant. Another bishop of Durham, who was sent to Picardy to negotiate peace between the French and the English with the king of France's envoys, has now returned to England with peace unachieved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The situation between the Scots and the English remains uncertain and doubtful; however, the English have captured the principal cities and districts of the Scots; but the devastation of the country recently made last summer by the Earl of Hertford, I shudder to report. The Queen of Scotland, along with the cardinal, are hiding in the mountains, and have such fortresses that cannot be conquered.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The colloquy at Regensburg, as far as I understand from Mr. Bucer's letters, is suspended; I believe this to be the case sooner, and Philipp Melanchthon has not yet come to them nor is he coming. And Bucer, as I hear, is coming to us sooner than we thought; we still have nothing certain; if there is anything certain, I will immediately inform your kindness, and expect fuller letters if our news demands them. The Count Palatine recently had the gospel preached throughout his province; but as far as the Eucharist is concerned, he has descended (as the proverb goes) from horses to donkeys; for he has fallen from papism into the most Lutheranism, which in this matter is worse than all papists; and those who destroy the substance of the bread in the sacrament and place the body of Christ in its place are closer to the truth than those who say that the natural body of Christ is with, in, and under the bread, yet occupies no place. God, I hope, will finally give him a better mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Lord Richard Hilles with his pious wife sends you many greetings in Christ; he now has in his house two sisters born of a noble family; the younger, whose name is Anna, a true lover of religion, prays for your perpetual happiness, and commends herself to the prayers of your church, which I hope you will soon see.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest10">
      <p>You will greet the distinguished men, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, with the other pious brothers in my name. Farewell, most learned and pious lord, and I pray that you will allow me to be counted among those who truly and sincerely favor the majesty of your religion.</p>

    <div xml:id="div12">
      <p>In Strasbourg, on the 27th day of January.</p>

      <p>If it were permissible because of your affairs, I would like to know your opinion and judgment. I certainly believe that it is not permissible for a pious man to be present at masses and such impious worships in papism. However, there are some arguments that somewhat urge the mind and hold it in suspense for a time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Mr. Calvin has written more on this matter, but he hardly satisfies, as it seems to me, the arguments that can be opposed; I will propose one or two to your learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Regarding Naaman the Syrian. Although it is not right to draw a private person into a general example, it is very relevant to this purpose; for the prophet said: "Go in peace." Those who are ignorant of the Hebrew language interpret it as if the prophet had said: "If you want to return, let it be at your own risk; however, I do not approve of the deed." That interpretation, in my judgment, the Hebrew language does not allow; for [לךְ לשלום] "go in peace," is a particle of command and confirmation, and therefore he allowed him to worship the true God in the house of Rimmon, in the hope of gaining the king of Syria and others to the true God; and if I interpret this place correctly, since the prophet allowed it to a pious man, we must also allow the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest14">
      <p>In the time of Elijah, when he complained to God that he alone was left as a worshiper of true religion, he was informed by divine admonition that 7,000 were left. Certainly, if such a number of people had not been present at the impious rites, one or another would have been known to the prophet of God; nor do I see who can deny that these pious men, about whom God comforts His sad servant, were often openly and publicly with the greater multitude of the impious in the temples of idols, yet they kept sincere and pure religion of the one God in their hearts. No argument moves me more than this one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest15">
      <p>By the same reasoning by which God forbids idolatry, He forbids adultery, fornication, and other vices; nor does He condemn one more than the other; but because of one, no one is bound to leave their homeland, as they say, nor because of the other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest16">
      <p>I do not write these things, most honorable man, to know your opinion, but once known, without any pretense and simulation, God willing, I will follow it most diligently; nor do I doubt this matter; however, I wish to satisfy pious men who are not yet sufficiently instructed in the faith. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Greet, I pray, your wife in my name, and another English brother of mine in Christ and friend, who lives with you in Zurich, Mr. Burcher.</p>
      <p>Yours, ready for all things, John Hooper, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, endowed with all religion and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving antistes of the holy church of Zurich, may these be given.</p>
