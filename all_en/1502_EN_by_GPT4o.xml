      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I first announce that I have been ill for a full 10 days now, not dangerously indeed, but with such an illness that can keep me continuously in a vaporarium (a steam room). I am the Lord's; let Him do with me as He wills. Would that He might soon free me from this prison!</p>
      <p>On St. Catherine's day, another session was held, which I expect hourly; another will be concluded on St. Paul's day. The Emperor is eagerly watching and, when he sees the end, will send in the army against those who refuse to obey. The Bishop of Chur sits among those masked and diligently offers his services to the adversaries. Two of the principal ones who attack Christ there have been made cardinals: the Bishop of Fano, a Dominican monk, and Pighinus.</p>
      <p>Thus the Pope will incite others to be more diligent in condemning the truth. There were twelve new cardinals, all favoring the Emperor's party, namely in hatred of the king. Parma and Mirandola still endure the siege, indeed soldiers breaking out from Parma slaughtered the Prince of Macedonia with a few horsemen. That monk George was said to want to refuse the cardinal's hat. But he did otherwise; for he not only accepted it reverently, but with such a clamor of cannons as Hungary has scarcely ever heard. Thus the Romans have a Turkish cardinal monk; for I hear plainly that his manners are Turkish.</p>
      <p>But I return to myself. I hear that among the leaders of Raetia there is talk of expelling me; for they say they fear the Emperor. Those who favor our doctrine are plainly lukewarm; the papacy hates me worse than a dog and a snake; thus it will leave nothing untried to at least remove me from these borders, if it cannot utterly destroy me.</p>
      <p>Hear something more serious: one of our brothers, a fugitive for the name of Jesus Christ, 10 days ago, while sitting at home by the hearth with his wife and little daughter, was shot by a certain Italian scoundrel. We all suspect this to be the work of the Pope himself, who would wish to remove us all from these borders as far as possible, and there are those who think that murderer sought me, not the one he stabbed. In short: we are in great danger of life, about to be in greater, yet I do not fear much and plainly recognize this to be a gift from God.</p>
      <p>From England, instead of the support we hoped for, came sad news of new disturbances in the kingdom. Meanwhile, your Vergerius is in need; yet he trusts in the Lord and contemplates things which you will understand someday. Affairs, undertaken journeys, and now illness prevent me from putting the final hand on the translation of your booklet to the king; but I will soon do so. Take it in good part. I commend my nephews to you; urge them to be good; I earnestly entreat this from you: If I recover, I plan to come to you soon.</p>
      <p>I cannot keep silent about this: the people of Parma expelled from the city, to relieve it (for they feared famine), a large number of women, who came to the enemy's camp, and at first almost all were violated, then sent back to Parma. But the people of Parma sent them again to the enemies and again they to the besieged.</p>
      <p>What do you ask? Many, when they saw themselves treated so cruelly, drowned their little children in the river and, driven by despair, ended their lives with a noose. These are the fruits that arise from popes and devils, oh God, but how long will you allow this? But these are the beginnings of sorrows. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church. I would not have thought my strength sufficient to write such a long letter; but I can do all things in Him who strengthens me. Pray for me, Brother Bullinger. Martinengo could not bear the harshness of our valleys; thus he will winter in Chiavenna. Vicosoprano, on the Ides of December 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
