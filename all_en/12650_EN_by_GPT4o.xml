<letter xml:id="file12650"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">In the current [war] turmoil, it would be reckless for Happel to entrust his thoughts to a letter. One must leave these to the Lord and pray earnestly. The [imperial] opponents are trying to prolong the war to wear down the [Protestants] and deprive them of their freedom. May the Lord chastise and improve us like a father, and not according to our sins!</p><p xml:id="regest2">- The young [Zurich students] want to leave Marburg because studies there have come to a halt due to the dangerous [war] events. However, the people of Zurich must decide what is best for their students. If they wish to recall them (provided the journey home is safe), that is right. Happel would also agree to a relocation to Leipzig or Wittenberg, provided these places remain safe from any Bohemian incursions until the [Leipzig] Spring Fair, the people of Zurich are willing to bear additional costs, and the two universities are not closed (as is rumored), which is not the case in Marburg. If the people of Zurich want their students to spend the winter in Marburg, this would be a very safe solution. Since the approximately 7,000 horsemen and 14,000 foot soldiers from the Netherlands have left the region around Marburg and reached the camp of Emperor [Charles V.] (which is regrettable and astonishing), there is no longer any enemy to fear, unless the Emperor defeats the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], which the Lord forbid!</p><p xml:id="regest3">- The people of Zurich will know what is best for their students. Happel and Johannes [Pincier] are ready to assist their former preceptors in this matter.</p><p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to the family as well as to Theodor Bibliander, [Conrad] Gessner, Rudolf Gwalther, [Johannes] Wolf, [Johann Jakob] Wick, to his brave, limping neighbor [...] and to Conrad Pellikan, to whom Happel unfortunately could not write due to lack of time.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Greetings. What should I write now in this storm and confusion of all things, I am uncertain, especially since it is not safe to commit one's opinion about the current state of affairs to writing. I understand that it must be commended to the Lord and that we must pray without ceasing with all our heart and mind, that He may defend and protect His cause, preserve and promote it, since there is no salvation in princes.</p><p>What is being done by the opposing side, what their efforts are, even the blind can see, namely to exhaust our people by the prolongation of the war and, those whom they could not overcome by valor, to finally oppress them when exhausted with those resources and that power (which they acquired by our favor, our money, our blood, and, I say, by our death for them), and not only to prohibit public, but also Christian and common freedom of all, and to condemn and enslave the oppressed to perpetual servitude. Oh the morals, oh the times! These are indeed what our sins have deserved. May the Lord indeed chastise us, I pray, but may He lead us, once chastised, as a father to better fruit and a healthier mind, both us and them, again and again I pray, beseech, and implore. May God, the best and greatest, grant this through His Son Jesus Christ, our redeemer! Amen.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>Your young men wish to leave here, because they see that the studies of literature are growing colder and colder here due to the present dangers and tumults.</p><p>However, I leave it to your prudence to decide on this matter of their will, what seems best. I do not dissuade you from recalling them, if you think they can return to you without danger. However, I do not disapprove, indeed I advise, that they be allowed to go to Leipzig or Wittenberg (as they greatly desire), if they can arrive there safe and sound, if those places will be safe from Bohemian incursions until the Spring Fair, and if you think and trust that they are able to bear the greater expenses (unless both those schools have collapsed in some way, and are fortified and overshadowed by mercenary soldiers in place of students, who are said to have left - as ours is not). But if neither pleases you and you wish them to endure this winter with us and stay longer, this seems to me, as far as the circumstances and reasons of many things are known and understood by me, the safest of all. For, since those who were almost upon our necks have passed, about 7,000 horsemen and more or less 14,000 foot soldiers of Lower Germany, and have penetrated to the camp of the Emperor (which is regrettable and astonishing), I do not see that we have to fear any other enemy than the Emperor himself, if he overcomes our most excellent prince - which God forbid! Amen.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>But, as I said, you will see how prudently you provide for your most excellent and honorable and learned young men. In whatever matter or work your Johannes and I can gratify you, our preceptors who have deserved so well of us, and your young men, we will not be reluctant to provide it in good faith and with a ready mind.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>Farewell with your whole family, most humane of all men. From me, I pray, convey many greetings to the most illustrious men, Theodor Bibliander, our common preceptor and friend, [Conrad] Gessner, Rudolf Gwalther, [Johannes] Wolf, [Johann Jakob] Wick, and his neighbor, who is lame in one foot, a most excellent man. But also greet most familiarly in my words Mr. Conrad Pellikan, our reverend father in Christ, to whom indeed I had decided to write separately, but later was prevented by the pressure of time and unexpected occupations.</p><p>Yours with all my heart, Wigand Happel.</p><p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely revered preceptor.</p></div></body> Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
