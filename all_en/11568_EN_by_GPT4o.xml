    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for their letter of admonition [No. 1490] and is pleased with their advocacy for the Geneva church. The call from the [Geneva] council initially frightened him, as he never thought of leaving during his time there, but often wished for death and, unlike Farel, did not want to take on any public office after his departure; however, certain reasons have now forced him to do so. The poor treatment by the Genevans would not prevent him from returning, as only a few individuals are to blame for what happened, and the fact that the people of Strasbourg would like to keep him is not an obstacle, as they also care about the well-being of other churches. He initially excused himself to the Geneva council with his dispatch to the Worms convention, but Geneva had already sent envoys who followed him to Worms; after consulting [with the Strasbourg council], he suggested that they come to Geneva together with Bucer and representatives of other churches, inspect the church, and jointly seek a solution, but the journey [to Regensburg] prevented him from doing so; he wants to counter the impression that he would have welcomed a pretext. Wishes that, regardless of his fears, others decide about his return to Geneva; the people of Strasbourg consider it sensible for Bucer to accompany him there after the end of the Diet, and a representative from Zurich should also be sent to this consultation. Strasbourg will not hold him back; the interruption of his theological lectures would be manageable for the school. Capito, Bucer, and he himself, however, consider the support of the Bernese indispensable, and they are not averse, provided that the Geneva church can truly be helped by his service. Does not want to shy away from the unwelcome task and is ready to travel to Geneva to make a decision; is glad that the people of Zurich are also urging him to do so, as he holds their judgment in particularly high regard. Cannot report anything certain about the state [of the religious discussion], but the people of Constance will certainly do so; Philipp [Melanchthon], Bucer, and all others send their regards to the people of Zurich. The princes and cities [of the Schmalkaldic League] appeal to the French king [Francis I] on behalf of the [persecuted] brothers; since the letter [MO IV 325-327, No. 2243; CO XI 220f, No. 311; Corr. des r√©formateurs VII 126-128, No. 983] was handed over to the envoy [Antoine Morelet or Claude Dodieu?], he did not dare to include a report to Farel, but asks to urge the Zurich council to write quickly, as there is hope for a mitigation of the persecution.</p>

      <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Most distinguished men and brothers, to be especially esteemed. Your letters were most welcome to me for two reasons: first, because you faithfully and prudently remind me of my duty, due to the connection the Lord has willed to exist between us, and second, because I see you are seriously concerned about the church of Geneva, whose well-being should be entrusted to me. Therefore, I give and express singular thanks not only in my own name but also in the name of the church itself: for you have deemed it worthy to assist both it with your patronage and me with your counsel. Although I did not particularly need that anxious exhortation you used, as I was already sufficiently inclined to do what you suggest, it was nevertheless pleasing to me to be confirmed by your judgment in a difficult and perplexing deliberation. But because I perceive that you have some doubts about my disposition, I will first briefly explain to you what has prevented me from coming sooner, and then what I have finally decided to do based on the opinion of my brothers. When the first letters came in which the Senate tested my willingness, I confess I was not lightly struck, seeing myself drawn back into those straits from which I always judged I had been freed by the singular grace of God. As long as I bore the governance of that church with my most excellent and faithful colleague Farel, I tried in good faith all the ways by which it could be preserved. And although the province was most burdensome to me, I never thought of leaving the place. For I considered myself placed by God as if in a station, from which it would be impious to move a foot. And yet I know it will be incredible to you if I relate even the smallest part of the troubles, or rather miseries, that we had to endure throughout the year. I can truly testify that not a day passed in which I did not wish for death ten times, but the thought of leaving the church and moving elsewhere never once entered my mind. Therefore, when we came to the extreme, because we saw that its safety depended on not being removed from the helm, we labored no less to retain our ministry than if it had been a contest for our lives. And if I, a man not very sharp, had been obeyed, it would have been much easier then to either assist the tottering church or to support it in part collapsed, than it is now to restore it completely lost.</p>
      <p>The best remedy to avert the danger would have been if we had been called to your synod. It could not be obtained. The other, if the church had seriously taken up our cause in common. I seemed to all to be insane when I predicted what later followed. Moreover, when I seemed to myself to have finally finished, I withdrew with a quiet conscience into seclusion with Farel. He was immediately called elsewhere. I had decided to abstain from any public function in the future. And I would have done so, had not certain causes compelled me to take up the calling in which I am now.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to tell the truth, that message was not at all pleasant to me when I heard I was being called back there. Yet I do not dwell on all those things which you believe to be an impediment to me: the disgrace inflicted on me, the inhumane treatment, and the like. Whether I am accustomed to avenge my injuries, I leave to God and to men who have experienced it to judge. But even if I were otherwise most eager for revenge, there is no reason why I should seek any revenge on the Genevans. Whatever happened, it was done in the name of the city, so that the blame rested on a few authors. And they themselves carried out the whole affair with hired workers through sedition. And not even the people of Strasbourg, although they wish to keep me with them out of the paternal benevolence with which they embrace me, prevent me from taking up this calling, if it is found to be useful and salutary for the Genevans.</p>
      <p>I am the best witness of how faithfully they have always cared for the well-being of that church. And I experience more and more every day how they are touched by the singular concern for all churches. What then is the hindrance? you will say. When those letters came, it had already been decreed by our senate that I should set out for the Worms convention. I had this excuse for not deciding anything certain with them. However, I wrote them the most friendly letters in which, although I did not promise to come, I nevertheless promised all the services they could demand from a man most devoted to them. But they, not waiting for a response, sent envoys who pressed for my arrival. We were already in Worms. They followed us there. After deliberating with those to whom I had given myself to be governed, I dismissed them with this promise, that as soon as we returned home, we would do from the heart what was for their benefit. I also explained our plan: it seemed to us that their church could not be better advised than if some from the neighboring churches came to inspect its state, who would take and give counsel from the present situation. Bucer was therefore to come with me, unless some greater necessity intervened, and we had good hope that it would be obtained from the other churches to send their representatives. But before we left Worms, fear of this other journey was already instilled. A few days after our return, I was informed to prepare myself for the journey. Thus, with the hope of coming there cut off, I again excused the delay. But perhaps I will seem either to have sought or at least gladly seized these pretexts by which I extricated myself from that calling, from which my mind otherwise recoiled. To free myself from this suspicion, I will briefly open to you the whole sense of my mind. Because I feel myself far unequal to those contentions by which I was almost consumed in the past, I confess I greatly dread this burden.</p>
      <p>Indeed, whenever I recall those struggles in memory, with which those who least ought to have exercised us, I am almost entirely disheartened. Therefore, if I were to acquiesce to my mind, I would rather cross the sea than go there. But since I am suspicious of that cause, I do not consult myself: I order those who are of sound judgment and sincere mind to be consulted. And lest I seem to do this cunningly, I implore in the name of Christ that they have no regard for me. But if I am not hindered by any difficulty here, you know that nothing should be moved by me in such a great matter without the authority of that church to which I am bound. Moreover, the unanimous opinion is that, as soon as we are freed from these assemblies, we should go there. They think it expedient that Bucer should lead me there, so that we may consult together on what is best to do. And I wish it could also be obtained from you, that you would send one from your college to be with us. Whatever happens, there is no fear that the church of Strasbourg, in looking out for itself, will neglect another. Nor indeed does it have a reason even if it wishes. As long as I was there, lest I do nothing, they employed me in theological lectures. However, my work is not so valuable that the school would suffer much inconvenience from my departure. One thing alone has Capito, Bucer, and the others anxious: that they expect little edification from my ministry unless the Bernese join me in good faith and extend a helping hand. Nor do I conceal that I have my chief hope in this if they are willing to assist us with their agreement.</p>
      <p>To bring them to this, I wanted to communicate with them beforehand before we undertook anything. They show themselves not to be of an alien mind, provided it is established that the church can be both restored and preserved by my ministry. You see, therefore, in what state the matter is. I have never refused this task, however unwelcome it may be to me, nor have I even avoided it. Long ago, even overcome or rather broken by the entreaty of many pious brothers, I decided at least to go there, to deliberate from the present view what I should do. Nevertheless, as I began to say at the beginning, it is a great pleasure to me that your vote has also been added here: for since I have always rightly esteemed you very highly, nothing more desirable can happen to me than to act in whatever I do from your and similar authority. Therefore, that part of your last letter was most pleasing to me, when you say you have no doubt that your exhortation will have weight with me. For since I have always pursued that church with singular reverence, and have always esteemed you very highly, I am glad you have formed this persuasion about me, that you dare to promise yourselves anything from my regard for you. You can certainly do so safely. For I will not disappoint your expectation. I do not dare to write about the state of affairs here. For everything is still partly suspended, partly involved, so that divination is needed if anyone wishes to have something certain.</p>
      <p>Moreover, whatever it is, I do not doubt that the people of Constance will faithfully write to you. Therefore, I will make an end.</p>
      <p>Farewell, brothers most beloved and esteemed by me in the Lord. All who are here greet you, Philipp [Melanchthon], Bucer, and the others. May the Lord Jesus confirm you with His Spirit for the edification of His church.</p>
      <p>Regensburg, the day before the Calends of June.</p>
      <p>Johannes Calvin, your most loving and devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and excellently learned men, the pastors and doctors of the church of Zurich, brothers and lords most esteemed by me.</p>
