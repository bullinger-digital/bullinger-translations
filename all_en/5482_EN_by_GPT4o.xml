      <p>Greetings. Now, as I return from the mountains late at night, reverend father, your letters are lying on the table and are delivered for the first time on the 5th of October. Therefore, I am very grateful to you; for you have done more than I dared to hope. I have nothing, and if I had anything, I would not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haller wrote ambiguously about the English and German army and their progress; we desire more certain information at some point. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, 5th of October, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, F[abricius].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ. Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
