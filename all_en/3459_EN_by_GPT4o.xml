      <p>Greetings. There was no need, most illustrious Bullinger, for you to respond so extensively to my letters, as I could have been content with a few words, being aware of your affairs, with which you are occupied, and ignorant of the common opinion about the heavens. Therefore, so as not to trouble you with long letters, considering the leisure of both of us, which neither of us has in abundance, I have decided to respond to you briefly. Regarding the sacrament, I believe my opinion is well known to you.</p>
      <p>As for the heaven illuminated by the light of divinity, in which the Father dwells with the Son, and concerning the throne and the right hand of the Father pertaining to this universe, it did not seem appropriate to respond to you at present, partly because you do not seem to have understood what I mean by the terms heaven, divinity, and throne, and partly because at this time there are many things that are more important for the public welfare of Switzerland to explain than to unravel this question more precisely. Meanwhile, let us maintain the concord in the Lord and the friendship with which the divine spirit has united us. For the time will come when we will speak more clearly about the spiritual heaven and the throne of the Messiah.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the Zürich church and its ministers. I bid all yours in the Lord much health.</p>
      <p>On the first of January, 1558.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>[yours] To the reverend man, outstanding in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the holy gospel among the Zürichers, his most beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
