      <p>Greetings. This noble man, as I hear from the interpreter, a count of the English kingdom, my dearest godfather in the Lord, has been commended to me by Lord Viret of Lausanne for his singular zeal for true religion, for which he has also endured imprisonment and was brought into danger of execution, from which, however, he was freed by the grace of his father, whose authority is great in England. I was very sorry that I could not speak to him except through an interpreter; for he does not know Latin.</p>
      <p>The interpreter, who has set out from here to Basel with the knight and the Englishman himself, informed me that there is no one in his company who knows Latin, and yet he is so held by the love of learned men that he delights at least in their sight.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it seemed right to send this to you in his name, which also pleased Lord Viret; I do not doubt that there are Englishmen with you with whom he can speak, and whose company will not be unpleasant for you.</p>
      <p>Moreover, concerning the Genevans, I beg you to consider what I have written to you through Mr. Haller; the matter is of great importance. I greatly fear for that church, and unless I am mistaken, Calvin is not sufficiently prudent in this disturbance. There is a need for wise men to intervene; this would be the duty of you or the people of Basel. It is regrettable that Nikolaus von den Jungen did not set out to you with Mr. Haller, as he had planned, where you could have been fully informed about this matter. Farewell very well, my dearest godfather. Greetings to your whole household and to the lords there, brothers, and friends; all of mine greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Our little Heinrich and yours, this evening, was seized with an unusual fever of the whole body, which greatly saddened and worried his mother; but I have good hope that tomorrow everything will be better than expected. Bern, 13th of September, 1555.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], yours in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
