      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter to your kindness, most illustrious man, is the son of an old and faithful minister in our churches, who has ensured that his son was educated from youth to learn the liberal arts and letters. But because he married sooner than he should have, he made less progress in his studies. Although he still has a wife and children, the old man, moved by good zeal, considering his son's age and wishing that his son Johannes might someday be of service to the republic, either in the church or in the school, and that the investments made in him so far might not be in vain, has decided to make another attempt. Although not many advised him, he has decided to send him to you in Zürich, so that he may diligently listen to the sermons of Mr. Martyr, Mr. Simler, and other professors for the span of a year. The good old man hopes that his son will turn into a man who will be of some use. He earnestly asked me to commend him to the learned men of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>But because your kindness is well known to all and your authority is very great among everyone, and your singular benevolence towards the people of Schaffhausen is not obscure, I, most learned Mr. Bullinger, ask you again and again to assist him with your advice and help, so that he may be a companion to one of your family or to Mr. Gwalther, or if he cannot be joined to any of these, to some other learned person, so that he may have a greater opportunity to study and especially to make progress in theology; his age still requires some discipline. But I do not doubt that you will act as is fitting, according to your prudence.</p>
      <p>No one here should be at all concerned about the cost, as whatever you or someone else agrees upon with him, it will certainly be paid. Thus, I not only trouble you with my letters, but also refer others to you, who may cause business for your kindness. As for our Simpertus, we hope well for him, and he himself hopes well for himself; the Guaiacum drink has helped a lot; he does not doubt that he will soon be preaching again; praise be to God. Concerning the colloquy at Erfurt, letters have certainly been sent to you, as our student returning from Marburg testifies, that the theologians of the princes have met or are still meeting to discuss concord among themselves and to settle other matters, about which we will hear in due time. Nor do I doubt that you have been informed from Strasbourg about the dispute between Zanchi and Marbach concerning the article of providence. Zanchi introduced Bucer's arguments and proved his own opinion with them, and he extolled them greatly. One of Marbach's companions, when the same article was being disputed in his house, brought forth Zanchi's argument, which Marbach immediately noticed and asked where he got the argument from; he replied: from Zanchi. Marbach, remaining silent, refuted Zanchi's arguments the following week; then in the third week, Zanchi expanded his arguments irrefutably. Marbach, noticing that he was not equal to Zanchi in intellectual strength, brought the matter to the senate, accusing Zanchi severely, adding among other things that from his doctrine it follows that there is neither a resurrection of the dead nor even a final judgment. The senate calls and hears Zanchi.</p>
      <p>He requests a public disputation.</p>
      <p>Marbach does not want to engage with his followers. The senate decrees that the matter should be handled with writings submitted to the senate, and that both should cease teaching theology in the meantime. We will hear what will happen.</p>
      <p>The senate favors Zanchi, as do most of the more learned, Herlinus, Sturmius, who said to Marbach: "You are trying to expel Zanchi; if you expel him, I will ensure that you are also expelled, or I will await your expulsion." But these matters have precedence among the senators. Sturmius is writing a booklet on the Eucharist, which he is compiling from various writings; we will see what it will be like when it comes to light; it will certainly be remarkable. We hope well, as the Cares have not approved the articles composed by the mediators between them and the Claronenses; they want the matter to be handled justly. I would like to hear your judgment on this matter; our envoys assert that no war is to be feared. But now I cease.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all the learned, whom you may deign to greet in my name, if you have the time. Our Simpertus greets you.</p>
      <p>All the other ministers of our church wish you safe and sound. Schaffhausen, the day before the calends of May 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Jakob Rüeger. To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, and his brother in Christ, to be greatly respected. Zürich.</p>
