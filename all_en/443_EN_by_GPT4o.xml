      <p>The letters you sent me on February 15th, I received on the evening of February 25th. This delay was caused by some unknown hindrances at the wedding in Winterthur, which prevented our relative Gregor from Ulm from sending your letters and Musculus' letters to us promptly, along with the package, for which I thank you both greatly. I am not writing anything else now, except to let you know that I have received yours. You defend your delayed writing to me in such a way that I would prefer you write nothing at all rather than delay the sweating presses in such an excellent and beneficial work for everyone, so far am I from wanting to harm public benefits for my private use or pleasure. I will return what you sent with the next courier, if he is of certain trustworthiness.</p>
      <p>Pray for us and be vigilant, so that we are not caught off guard. When there is a messenger, please send these letters to Theodor Marcellus, which I wrote a few days ago; then, when there was an opportunity to send them, some kind of forgetfulness crept over me, and yet it is important that he does not receive them too late. I will pray as much as I can for the Lord to be favorable and supportive of our Musculus' calling. I cannot write more. February 25th.</p>
      <p>Nothing new. The commander has returned to Konstanz; his father has died.</p>
      <p>It is written from Augsburg that on February 10th, the young prince arrived in Munich in Bavaria, and it is not known where he will go next.</p>
      <p>According to all indications, this Valentinus Fabri is not the one you wrote about; for I am told that this one is a small, red-haired, upright man; but I will find out more precisely.</p>
      <p>Greet your household with all the brothers, especially Musculus, although I think he has now gone to Bern.</p>
      <p>It is very regrettable that your letters were returned so late concerning Metzler's son, as he could not be there on Matthias' feast day; for I fear it will now be too late for him when he arrives in a few days.</p>
