    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast sends the book praised by the Catholics [„Verbum dei carnem factum“] by the Colmar monk [Johannes Hoffmeister], in which he polemicizes against Zwingli, Oekolampad, and Bullinger. The book would be worth a response, [especially since Hoffmeister] has hopes for a bishopric promised by King Ferdinand [I]. Bullinger should share his opinion on the book. - It is said that in [Zurich] a father [...] killed his son [...]. Gast does not know the reasons, and some may be exaggerating [perhaps]. Bullinger should report what happened. - Oporin is printing at Froben's expense a "Promptuarium" compiled from the "Thesaurus Linguae Latinae" by Robert Estienne, which is being shortened for this edition with the help of [Teodosio Trebellio]. If Bullinger wishes, Gast could send a copy through [Christoph] Froschauer. Oporin is also printing Sebastian Castellio's poem "Jonah" with a biography of John the Baptist in Greek; furthermore, an [edition] of the poet Alcimus with a commentary by Menrad Molther. - [Johannes] Herwagen publishes the commentary by [Wolfgang] Musculus on the first seven chapters of the Gospel of John. - [Nikolaus] Brylinger publishes the works of Xenophon in Greek and Latin. - There is nothing new at Froben. - Heinrich Petri is printing the "Cosmographia" [by Sebastian Münster] in an expanded edition. - Should Bullinger wish for any of these writings, Gast will send them to him with the next messenger. - [P.S.:] Greetings to Gwalther and [Johannes] Fries.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am sending you, dearest Bullinger, the booklet by the monk from Colmar, which a certain papist shared with me (and I could barely obtain it through requests), in which he attacks you and your doctrine. Furthermore, it also contains quite envious mentions of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. He particularly mocks Zwingli, in whose place you succeeded. If it seems appropriate to you and some benefit to the church might arise from it, I would like you to respond. He is worthy of some response, and that without insults, as he is now aspiring to the bishopric, which has been promised to him by King Ferdinand. He is held in high esteem among all papists, and whatever he says is considered sacred. Therefore, read the booklet and share your judgment on this matter with me.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new at this time; if you have anything, please share it. They say that a father among you killed his son, but I do not hear for what reasons; some are exaggerating the matter. However, I wish to know from you what has happened.</p>
      <p>Regarding recently published books, I cannot write anything certain at this time. Oporinus is printing at Froben's expense a "Promptuarium" compiled from the "Thesaurus Linguae Latinae" by Robert Estienne and collected in Paris. Someone is trying to compress everything more tightly so that the book will be more marketable in the second edition. He has 20 books of paper; however, I still do not know at what price it will be sold. If you wish, I will send the book through your Froschauer, as well as the poem "Jonah" rendered in verse with the life of John the Baptist written in Greek by Sebastian Castellio. Nothing else, except the poet Alcimus with a new commentary by Menrad Molther.</p>
      <p>Hervagius has published Musculus's commentaries on the chapters 7 of John. Brylinger has published the works of Xenophon in Greek and Latin, all translated, which have been desired until now.</p>
      <p>The Frobenians have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Petri has printed the "Cosmographia" again with an augmentation.</p>
      <p>If you request any of these books, I will send them with the next messenger. Farewell. September 25, 1545, Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet Gwalther in my name, if you encounter him, along with our Fries.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, dearest lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
