    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger is thankful to God for enlightening the Palatinate with His Gospel. May the [Evangelicals] not continue to show ingratitude towards the Lord, so that His benefaction serves as a blessing to them. If only the pious would not rely too much on the strength of their [Schmalkaldic] League! For they might fare similarly to the [Swiss Protestants in the Kappel War], who were suddenly defeated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Some say that the French [King Francis I] and the English [King Henry VIII] repeatedly try to be admitted into the [Schmalkaldic League] or at least seek friendship with the allies. But whether this is true, Bullinger cannot judge. He knows the cunning schemes of the princes and is aware that [Francis I] once planned an alliance [with the Protestant Swiss cantons]. Since then, however, [Francis I] has chosen Cain over Abel. The pious must not burden themselves with any allies, lest they perish from it, for Emperor [Charles V] does not sleep. He has informants everywhere, even among the closest allies [of the Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Myconius should report on the war plan [between Francis I and the Emperor] mentioned in his previous letter [No. 2341].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Johannes] Gast will gladly take care of the transmission of [Myconiusâ€™] letters to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In [Zurich] everyone is well. Greetings from [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Heinrich] Buchter, and the others.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who has illuminated the entire Palatinate with the light of His Gospel and continues to overwhelm Germany with His blessings. These will lead us to salvation if we use God's blessings rightly; they will lead again to destruction, and that by our own fault, if we persist in ingratitude. Would that the faithful not rely too much on the strength of their League, and that it not happen to them as it did to us, that in a single hour they are completely scattered by a few and those the worst scoundrels. I see that such leagues have not been perpetually fortunate.</p>

      <p>May the Lord breathe His grace upon them and us. Some say that the French and the English are almost courting that evangelical league or at least seeking friendship with the allies. Whether this is true or false, I cannot easily divine. I know the arts and pretenses of princes. I know that the French once sought a Christian city; for in prosperous times we count many friends. But when the Lord tested us with fire, the French meanwhile showed that they preferred the city of Cain to that of Abel. Therefore, let the pious beware not to burden themselves with any kind of allies and finally collapse under their own weight. The Emperor does not snore or sleep. He has wide ears and far-seeing eyes, for he has supporters everywhere. We also have more enemies than we think, even among the closest ones.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You would do a most pleasing thing if you would timely inform about the war, which you mentioned in your last letter. I would derive the greatest benefit if I heard it to be true and that in time, that it is said the French and the Eagle will again test the dice of Mars. Therefore, I pray, do not neglect this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Gast will gladly take care of the letters; finally, they will always be offered in time to those going to Zurich. We are all well here by the grace of the Lord. Would that you also be well with yours! Farewell. Pellikan, Bibliander, Gwalther, Buchter, and the others greet you.</p>

      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Basel, a revered and beloved lord and brother.</p>
