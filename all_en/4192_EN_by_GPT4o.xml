      <p>Greetings. I indeed wrote to you eight days ago and I hope my letters have already reached you, although they contain nothing of great value. By God's grace, my son has returned to me quite healthy and he greatly praises the kindness and benefits of you, your wife, and other good men. May the Lord repay you, your family, and other good men for whatever you have contributed to me through him. I earnestly ask you to kindly extend my immense thanks to Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontisella, the consuls, and others; if the opportunity arises to reciprocate, you will find me willing to do so for all of you.</p>
      <p>I am sending back to you here two crowns, which you lent to my son, and I also express my gratitude. Furthermore, since he lived in your house for 14 days, I ask you to inform me what I should repay you for that inconvenience and the expenses incurred, and what to repay Pontisella or the one who meanwhile fed the horse. Sell it as soon as possible and get as much as you can from it, just to avoid further unrest, trouble, and costs. Rightly, my dear friend, my son was and is anxious; for his disobedience and fault have caused me great harm. I had strictly forbidden him to enter Italy; I had previously written to friends in Venice, asking whether it would be convenient to send a baker there. They dissuaded me by all means with serious reasons, one of which was the danger of fever. I read the letters to him before he went abroad, strictly forbidding him to enter Italy or any other place not pleasing to me, etc. However, he boldly went to Venice against my command and wanted to experience in reality what he did not want to believe from his parent.</p>
      <p>Indeed, disobedient children cannot cloud their parents with any mist of greed, if they do not willingly lavish as much money as these sometimes foolishly and maliciously squander. He would have asserted my dignity more rightly if he had been a frugal boy who obeyed his parent's command. But I am no better than my ancestors, to whom the same thing happened, which I now lament to you, my singular friend. I only ask that you do not take it badly if I do not write more frequently. You say: "We greatly wonder at the cause of your silence." I have long since informed you of the matters by which I am overwhelmed, let alone burdened. I send here a rejected leaf, so you can see that I am not making things up, but speaking the truth.</p>
      <p>So far, I have barely been able to write as much with the pen as the types have devoured, and I greatly fear that I may not be able to keep up; the work is therefore hard for me and scarcely surmountable. Therefore, stop wondering if I do not write as much as you wish.</p>
      <p>However, do not stop writing very frequently and copiously.</p>
      <p>I do not urge you to constancy and endurance of labors in this course; for I believe I have a very clear view of your faith and diligence. May the Lord strengthen you in all good, protect you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 19, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, the most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his dear friend and brother. To Chur, to Mr. Hans Schmid, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
