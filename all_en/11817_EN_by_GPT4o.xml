    <p xml:id="regest1">Outstanding personalities attract other people like a lighthouse from afar - so does Bullinger, to whom he, as an unknown, expresses his admiration; this is based on Bullinger's works, which are also appreciated by his lord, the French envoy [Jean de Montluc].</p>

      <p>Bartolomeo Del Prato to his dear Bullinger, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Even from distant places, we perceive and admire the virtues of those who are absent and unknown, most distinguished Bullinger, and indeed, the greater these virtues are in any person, the more they shine brightly from a high place to those who are far away. Just as sailors on the open sea steer their course by the light of a visible lighthouse, so I believe it is fitting for other mortals to do the same, so that when the splendor of outstanding virtue shines in a person, amidst the darkness of this human life, they may converge towards him and retreat as if from obscurity, that is, they strive to insinuate themselves into his goodwill and familiarity. For this reason, I will use the benefit of letters at present, so that you may judge the bond of friendship, by which the admiration of your unique learning and rare genius has bound me to you, to be firm and have it confirmed as if by a promissory note. Nor will it seem strange or entirely rash to you that I, unknown to you, have dared to intrude upon and interrupt your studies with my letters. For this is the peculiar and singular nature of distinguished men, that they are loved by strangers, addressed by those who are absent, and familiar to those whom they have never seen.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I hope you will pardon my audacity in light of the excellence of your studies, which have placed you in great favor with my lord, the French envoy in this Republic, and have made me most devoted to you. This I could not refrain from indicating to you, as I believe it is more important for each person to know all their abilities. In Venice, on the 3rd day before the Ides of August, 1543.</p>
