      <p>Greetings. Although nothing occurs that deserves to be written, so that leisure may not be idle, you can also understand the state of our times and the affairs of France from Lyon and Geneva, I have only wished to write this, which I think you are very much convinced of, that I am yours and very much wish to be able to gratify you; you will experience this, whenever you wish.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you. You will greet the most honorable council, Mr. Gwalther, and all friends. Farewell. Paris, March 29, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
