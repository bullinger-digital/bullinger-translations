      <p>S. I also feared, my most desired Bullinger, (which I nevertheless concealed diligently), that Mr. Haller might be more distant from us, and I feared this all the more because he replied so slowly. Now I have received those letters, from which I easily understand that he is the same as he was the previous year. Although they were most welcome to me, as you know even without my saying so, they were even more welcome because they were accompanied by those that would be delivered to you; for I do not doubt that they will be most pleasant to you, which is why I worked hard to have them delivered to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I would have sent them through Albert if I had received them in time; now they must be sent to my people in Konstanz, who I do not know if they will have someone to give them to immediately. If you wish to respond to Mr. Haller, you will also send it to me, as I have already learned from him through whom it can be conveniently delivered.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, farewell and greet all the fellow ministers individually, if it is not troublesome, in my words.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, October 3, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>To the equally pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
