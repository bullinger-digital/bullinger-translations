    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast has read with sorrow the artificial, embellished letter from Bucer to the Zurichers [HBBW XIV, No. 2049] with praise for Luther and Bucer's justification of his own mediations. Traps lurk everywhere! How skillfully Bucer tried to prevent Bullinger from mentioning the [Wittenberg] Concord and from responding to [Luther] at all! Bucer, whose disposition and inconsistency are well known throughout Germany, may be driven by a good zeal; God alone will judge this. Gast now understands why the [Swiss churches] were so pressured to sign the [Wittenberg] Articles: namely so that the [Lutherans] can boast of the submission [of the Swiss churches] to Luther, which they are already doing! - Gast does not want to accept the two sent volumes [I and II] of the Zwingli edition as a gift. He wants to pay Bullinger for them or send him other books in exchange. Gast also wishes for Volume III [of the Zwingli edition] because of the [commentaries on] "Ecclesiastes" and "Job". He already possesses the [content] of Volume IV in folio format. - He has conveyed Gwalthers' poem [probably "De quinque primariis evangelicae doctrinae instauratoribus"] to Myconius. The latter wanted to write to Bullinger but perhaps did not due to his diarrhea illness. [Bullinger's] letter [not received] to Peter Martyr [Vermigli] has reached Strasbourg well. - [King] Ferdinand [I.] left the Worms [Imperial Diet] 14 days ago; before that, he complained bitterly in a separate conversation with Emperor [Charles V.] about the Turkish threat. [Charles V.] is said to have traveled from Worms to Cologne, where it looks like there is unrest. - In Breisach, after Pentecost [and after the departure of Johann Werner Wiga], none of the eight available priests wanted or could proclaim the word of God, and if some [preacher] [...] had not come, they would have all been expelled from the city. If only that had happened! - No one knows the resolutions of the [Worms] Imperial Diet. Another Imperial Diet [in Regensburg] is imminent. In the meantime, the Papists will hold counsel on how they could delay the cause of Christ. - Bullinger should forgive Gast's talkativeness. - Last week, a woman [...] hanged herself out of poverty; another [...] wanted to jump from the [Middle] Bridge but was caught. Yesterday, the apprentice [...] of a shoemaker [...] committed a murder. Two suns have been seen by many people these days. A drunkard [...] threw himself out of the window after midnight. - [P.S.:] Gast sends a part [of his commentary] on the first four chapters of the Gospel of Mark. He would like to have it printed in [Zurich]. The manuscript comprises no more than 25 sheets. Should a printer be interested, Gast would send the rest [of the commentary] after the [Frankfurt Autumn] fair. Gast does not want to have it printed in Strasbourg or [Basel]. From the printer, Gast would only want five or six author's copies. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I read with great sadness that letter, beautifully adorned with the embellishment of words, a testament to Bucer's attitude towards our churches, that is, the letter which praises Luther and extols Bucer's diligence in reconciling the churches. If only he had devoted this effort to another, more useful and necessary matter! Perhaps he would have gained greater praise and benefit. Everything is full of deceit and falsehoods. How skillfully he wanted to deter you from mentioning concord! How nicely he tries to extort with threats that you should not respond at all at this time! Germany knows Bucer's character. His inconsistency is known to everyone. Perhaps he started this endeavor with good zeal. The Lord will judge him, to whom he stands or falls. Christians act honestly in all things, especially in matters of religion. Now I understand why they were accustomed to urge us to subscribe to the articles sent to us, about which they now boast, as if we had subscribed to Luther and other Lutheran churches. May the Lord open their hearts so that they may recognize His will. Amen.</p>
      <p>I received the two volumes of Zwingli with great pleasure, but I do not want them as a gift, lest I be more of a burden to you than is fair. Please indicate the price, and I will pay as much as you wish; or if it pleases you, I will count the pages and send back the same number.</p>
      <p>Therefore, write which books you want, and I will buy them as quickly as possible; for I do not want to burden you in any matter. However, send the third volume as well because of Ecclesiastes and Job and other things that I do not have in larger format. I have the fourth volume in folio. You will see that I am not ungrateful to you, be it in any matter that you entrust to me.</p>
      <p>I gave our Gwalther's poem to Myconius, who said he wanted to write to you, but I do not know if he did because of the dysentery, which the good old man suffers from. Similarly, the letters to Mr. Peter Martyr in Strasbourg have also arrived conveniently.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand left Worms 14 days ago, having dined alone with the Emperor the night before, and walked together in the hall, where Ferdinand complained bitterly about the Turkish threat. What the Emperor replied to this, no one knows. Emperor Charles also left Worms, supposedly heading to Cologne, where unrest is said to be brewing; for the council is divided. There are many clerical servants in the council who want to keep, protect, and defend their own by the old custom. May the Lord bring help to His own, and you pray to the Lord for them, that they may be steadfast in resisting the members of Satan, who are whistling at the last hole. Nor do I think it should be concealed from you: In Breisach, there are still eight priests; but they have had no pastor since Pentecost. And for three weeks, no preaching has been done there, for no chaplain wanted to preach. They would have deserved to be beaten.</p>
      <p>Behold the miserable situation and worthy of lamentation; among so many priests, not one can be found who wants or knows how to proclaim the word of God! And if some rascal had not come, they would all have been expelled from the city; and if only it had been done!</p>
      <p>No one knows what was decided at the diet. Another diet is to be held. In the meantime, the Papists will consult on what to do, and they seek nothing else but to procrastinate the cause of Christ. For they see our and our people's laziness, yawning, and slowness in all matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and forgive my talkativeness. Last week, a woman hanged herself out of poverty; another wanted to throw herself from the bridge, but was caught. A murder was committed yesterday by a servant of a certain shoemaker. Two suns have been seen in the sky by many people these days. A certain man, exceedingly drunk, threw himself out of the window after midnight and died; I think wine was the cause. The Lord warns us enough, if we would only be wise.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and commend me to the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I send you sermons on the Gospel of Mark, not on all chapters, but on the first four, which I wish to have printed with you. If none of the printers would undertake this work for me, I wish the book to be returned. It would not exceed a booklet of 25 sheets; however, I am not sending all now, but if someone wanted to print it, I would send the rest after the fair. It does not seem to me a useless labor. I do not want to send it to the people of Strasbourg nor willingly permit it to our censors, who know nothing else but to change what displeases them. Farewell again and again and write back about this matter. I ask nothing from the printer but 5 or 6 copies, which I have been accustomed to give to friends. Greet Mr. Pellican, the excellent old man, in my name as courteously as possible. Thus, I am accustomed to make up for my silence with scarcely tolerable talkativeness.</p>
