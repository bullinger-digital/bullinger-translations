      <p>Greetings. I acknowledge, my most excellent father, that what the Lord promises to His own is true, that not even a cup of cold water given to them will be lost. For I have nothing more humble to compare with whatever it is that I have thus far rendered to the church of God, from which, however, I reap the most abundant fruit of your friendship towards me: which I indeed value so highly that I would not exchange it for all the treasures of kings.</p>
      <p>But your singular kindness appears in this, that you have embraced me, a mere little man, in such a way that you even deign to address me with your letters. But what can I offer you in return? That very thing which I have long since offered to you, both absent and unknown, that is, myself and all that is mine, even when in our miserable France I was reading your and some others' most holy books, I thought to myself: Alas, how long will I wallow in these filths of papism? When will it be that I hear so many truly pious men speaking? That I join their assemblies? That I confess to the God of heaven with them, and happily complete this calamitous course of life? These were my wishes then, of which the same one who made me think of them has granted me the greatest part. For He first granted me, (about which I wish I could always glory in Him) to prefer the cross to all the fortunes of my homeland. Then came the friendship of Calvin, Viret, Musculus, Haller, good God, what men? When I think that they are my friends, I am so far from feeling any trouble of exile, that I rather use that saying of Themistocles: I would have perished if I had not perished. But now, when I see that I am not only known to you, but also, which my poverty did not allow me to hope, dear to you, I have certainly achieved far more than I expected. Therefore, I give you as many thanks as he can who willingly confesses that he owes you everything.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, regarding what you write about Cochlaeus, in this too I recognize your singular modesty, who have not disdained those trifles of ours. Certainly mere trifles: but that man was not worthy of a better writing, so that now my plan begins to please me, to treat those ridiculous fools in this way rather than as I see you have done, who preferred to contend with him by reason.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for the letters of Vergerius to me, and at the same time I ask (for I will now speak more familiarly with you) that you take care to deliver mine to him in return.</p>
      <p>As for the conspiracy of Trent, the Roman Antichrist has not disappointed our expectation, but I know this will happen, that his hope will deceive him.</p>
      <p>For the Lord will preserve His church. Meanwhile, I am indeed ashamed when I compare the sloth of our people with the vigilance of the adversaries: and here I will freely say to you what I feel. I find many things lacking in our churches, but at this time I would especially wish that when we see the adversaries conspiring together, some brothers from each of the churches of Switzerland and the neighboring region, chosen by the common judgment of the ministers, would convene to consult the mouth of the Lord about the collapsed discipline of the church and the imminent dangers. I would also wish that we at least imitate the Ninevites: for all see, even the blind, how justly the Lord is kindled against us. But what ought to be done publicly by all, there is almost no one who anticipates the face of the Lord.</p>
      <p>All complain about the calamities of the church, very few beseech the wrath of the Lord, no one is moved by the observation of their neighbors.</p>
      <p>The magistrate thinks he has performed his duty excellently when he has promulgated some edicts.</p>
      <p>The cries of the ministers are in vain, when public scandals are either neglected or not prohibited with the severity that the wickedness of men deserved. The zeal of the Lord is cold. Here indeed the commands of the princes are openly violated with impunity. Lent is observed with no less religion than among mere papists: everything resounds with drinking, blasphemies, fornications. In the sermons, there is a marvelous solitude. To say it briefly, the face of the church is miserable. I know how much your authority prevails with both republics, with most princes. Therefore, I implore you by the Lord Jesus, whom we all serve, to take up the common cause of the churches to be aided in common dangers.</p>
      <p>These are, my most excellent father, what I thought should be written to you at this time, perhaps too confidently: but, even if you do not approve my counsel, you will certainly not disapprove my will, as I think. I wish to be commended to Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, whom I, men never seen by me, both venerate and respect, and to the other brothers of better note, especially to Gesner, to whom I do not write, lest, as he says, I sin against the public good. Farewell. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and sound for His church for a very long time. In Lausanne, 14th of the calends of March. Viret and all the brothers and fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Theodorus Beza, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and upright pastor of the church of Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger. In Zürich.</p>
