    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. He has nothing further to add to his last two letters [No. 2980 and No. 2981] except what the Konstanz patrician Hieronymus Hürus, an honorable and educated man, to whom he has already stood as godfather twice, can report. Bullinger should receive him with his characteristic friendliness. He will appreciate him when he gets to know him better. He should pray with all believers for the council and the church of Konstanz (to whom he rightly speaks well). As every reasonable person knows, nothing can end badly as long as there are people who comply with [the will of God]. However, there will always be only a few of these unless God increases their number through the effect of his spirit. Therefore, one should earnestly ask God to ensure that all people of Konstanz strive for true heavenly bliss. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff], his brother Thomas, and Konrad Zwick send their regards. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] The French envoy [Sébastien de l’Aubespine] should take better care of the letters entrusted to him. A Radolfzell resident [...], who recently stayed in Konstanz, said that they were aware of the negotiations between Konstanz and King Henry II. And when the addressed people of Konstanz (including some councilors) did not want to believe this, he recounted how he found the said letter lying open on a table in the inn in Baden where the ambassador was staying and was able to read it. How careless! Great harm could arise from this! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] On the previous evening, Blarer received letters from Georg Frölich and from a councilor of Augsburg [...]. According to these, Emperor Charles V is not showing himself and is drinking the water of his [guaiacum] wood cure. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Many people are in Augsburg, and many more are expected. And since part of the foreign mercenaries are to remain in the city, the envoys of the imperial estates will have to settle for poor accommodations. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] The young Duke [Karl Viktor] of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the young King Maximilian are said to have arrived in Augsburg, but not [Karl Viktor's] father, Duke Henry the Younger, nor Duke Maurice of Saxony, whose capture is unknown to the letter writers. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Both write that there is much to report that cannot be entrusted to the pen. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] According to Frölich, the Hanseatic cities are arming; for what purpose, he does not know. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest9"> [9] Furthermore, he reports how an imperial captain [...] arbitrarily stabbed a chamberlain [...] of Duke Johann Friedrich I of Saxony and almost strangled an employee of Mayor Jakob Herbrot named [Georg] Feuchtweck. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest10"> [10] One prays unceasingly to God and asks him not to lead us into temptation, but to glorify his name and grant us eternal life. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest11"> [11] Bullinger should report on the Bündner Bundestag, on Bern and France, as well as on the Zurich shooting festival. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest12"> [12] [P.S.:] He should strive for closer acquaintance with Count Georg of Württemberg, especially since he proves himself worthy of a prince, even if he is not without faults. </p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your most diligent letters, for which I thank you. There is nothing now that I can add to my previous letters except what Hieronymus Hürus, our patrician, an honorable and not at all uneducated young man, to whom I have already become a godfather once and again, could faithfully report to you. I ask you to receive him with your singular kindness. You will appreciate his character and intellect once you look deeper. Pray for us with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that in His mercy He may govern all things in our city and church (which you prudently and Christianly admonish). Everyone understands that nothing can end well unless there are those who comply - whom, however, I see nowhere to be found except very few, unless the Lord grants them by His spirit. Therefore, we must earnestly pray to the Lord with humble vows, that He may incline the hearts of all of us to where they can once be truly safe and blessed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet very lovingly in my words. Our people, whom you know, especially my brother Thomas, Konrad Zwick, and my wife, send their regards to you.</p>

      <p>It would be good if the French envoy were warned to take better care of the letters that are sent to him, etc. A man from Radolfzell was here. He let it be known to some that they were well aware of the negotiations between Konstanz and the French. And when the addressed citizens, including some councilors, said they truly knew nothing about it, he said he had been in Baden and found the letters from Konstanz to the French lying open on the table in the French envoy's inn and read them himself. It is truly not good to handle things so carelessly! Great harm could arise from such carelessness.</p>

      <p>Last night I received letters from Augsburg from Leto and another council friend. They write nothing special, except that the Emperor is staying in and is supposed to drink the guaiacum wood water.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Also, many people are there and more are arriving daily. A Reichstag is supposed to take place, and part of the foreign troops are not to be dismissed. The envoys of the imperial estates must be poorly accommodated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Also, the young Duke of Brunswick is there, and the young King Maximilian, but not the old Duke of Brunswick, nor Duke Maurice. They also do not know that he is captured.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Both write that there is much to write, but the pen cannot be trusted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Also, Leto writes that the maritime cities are in arms, but he does not know what their movements are aimed at.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Also, an imperial captain out of sheer wantonness stabbed a beloved chamberlain of the Duke of Saxony; also, he almost strangled a servant of Mayor Herbrot named Feuchtweck.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord unceasingly, that for His promised mercy He may not allow us to be led into temptation, but may glorify His name in us and keep our souls for eternal life!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What you further learn about the great day in Chur, etc., also about Bern and France, and what this shooting will bring for friendship among you, let me know, etc. 12th of August, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Make yourself more familiar with Count Georg of Württemberg; he has a character worthy of a prince, but he is not without his blemishes.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother and friend. Zurich.</p>
