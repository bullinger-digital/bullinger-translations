      <p>Greetings. If I provide you with anything, dear brother, by writing various and copious letters, you certainly repay me with the same effort and diligence.</p>
      <p>I truly congratulate you that it has been obtained from the more powerful part of the Confederation that they renounced the royal military service. May God confirm in you what He has begun. The king seems to be thinking about convening a council in which he will excuse himself; he sees that everyone abhors the most atrocious robbery. Now, therefore, through lies, he will twist the blame onto the admiral, who allegedly conspired against him.</p>
      <p>Even the blind can see how baseless this is. He subjected some to torture to extract something of this. Some are said to have fainted under torture, preferring to die rather than confess to falsehoods; others are said to have been overcome by torture and to have said what the royal officials prescribed for them to say. From this, he will undoubtedly compose an apology for the parricide; but it will be bald, vain, and shameless, an excuse about which we will talk when it emerges. Now we will wait to see what will be brought forth; perhaps the true history of the whole tragedy will be described. Here I send you 2 booklets, one for you, the other for Mr. Consul Willi, whom you will greet in my name. If you learn anything certain about the soldiers gathering in Milan, where they are inclined, you will inform us promptly, especially if they begin to threaten either you or us or even the people of Geneva and Bern. Just now, a letter is being read to me, written on September 18 from Paris, stating that there is still no cessation; however, the damage now occurs at night, and the sum of all these matters is to extirpate the true religion, which they will not be able to do, but will rather succumb to it, and it is seen that the king's excuse is false.</p>
      <p>From the Netherlands, I have nothing certain at this time, because the adverse writings are coming and uncertain. The latest is that both forces, the princely 9000 cavalry, 80 companies, the Albanian 12000 cavalry and 40 companies of foot soldiers without Spaniards and Walloons, are not far from each other, so that they will disperse without fighting. Others write of a truce until spring and that Bergen has surrendered and withdrawn with the goods that were inside. What is true, time will tell.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and children. Greet in order those who greeted me through you.</p>
      <p>I hurried. October 17, 1572.</p>
      <p>Mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
