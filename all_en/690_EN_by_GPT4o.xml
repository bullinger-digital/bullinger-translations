      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>We have received, along with your most pleasant letters, the judgment of your matrimonial affairs, according to which our own have also rendered their judgment, and thus this controversy has been conveniently resolved. Furthermore, it remains for us not only to give thanks for your kindness and your labors, but also to repay them someday. Therefore, since I have not yet received anything from Italy except the letters of Augustin von Kleve, which I thought it worthwhile to share with you, for they will inform you more certainly about both our ecclesiastical and military affairs, although they write uncertainly, but more certainly to our magistrate, for which reason our consul Heymius has been sent to the Swiss and they have arranged 900 for their support. - I am expecting daily a courier from Ascanius Marsus of Milan, who was sent by our lords of the Three Leagues. Meanwhile, farewell with your church and family through the Lord, who may always deign to preserve you, amen, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, September 27, 1549. Comander and all good men send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Your same Blasius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
