      <p>S. Bartholomäus Stekius, my relative, sent these letters from your son to me, to be delivered to you by the first messenger. I entrusted them to this good man, who attended the wedding of the daughter of the late Johann Widenhuber here with us, as a reliable courier, and he promises that if you have anything to send to your son, whether money, letters, or other things, he will ensure that it is delivered to him with the utmost diligence by reliable messengers and at the earliest opportunity. In this matter, both my relative and I will always be ready to serve you and yours and to do you a favor. I also ask that if any news from France, England, or other places is written to you, which you deem worthy for me to know, you also inform me, which I also promise to do willingly.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, St. Gallen, 13 days before the calends of September, in the year of salvation 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Josua Keßler, of St. Gallen [Greek].</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed Antistes of the most ample church of Zürich, his lord and friend, to be honored with all respect.</p>
