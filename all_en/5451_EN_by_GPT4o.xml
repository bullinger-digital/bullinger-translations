      <p>As soon as I sealed this, Doctor Thomas Schopff, the physician, came to me, indicating that in Stuttgart he had greeted Doctor Jakob Andreae Schmidlin, conversing with him amicably. But he is more stubbornly defending Brencissat than ever, etc.</p>
      <p>This autumn, he will visit the church with some noble delegates; all of whom will overthrow the pious rites, etc. Schopff greets you.</p>
