    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Curione has not written for a long time, and for an even longer time, he has not received a letter from Bullinger. Lastly, he sent [with No. 2893 from May 2] on behalf of Francesco Stancaro his Hebrew grammar [Ebreae grammaticae institutio] through the young student [Caspar Herwagen], a nephew of Johannes Herwagen, who was traveling to Italy. Meanwhile, he often heard from the Zurich students studying in Basel that Bullinger is doing well. However, since a long interruption in correspondence is not beneficial for friendship, Curione takes the opportunity to send a letter with Pietro Perna, who is traveling to Zurich for his business, to at least converse with Bullinger by letter and convey his greetings. There is hardly anything better in these bad times than to cheer up one's troubled mind a little with letter writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should at least write briefly on occasion, especially since Curione finds his letters encouraging and edifying! Currently, there is much to report and enough reason to comfort, advise, or warn each other, or to comment on the current situation as believers. And Bullinger is very well versed in all this. He should also know that Curione will always behave honestly and harbor no ulterior motives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] But enough of that. During the school holidays, he had no teaching obligations. To avoid being idle, he wrote a booklet [De omni artificio disserendi] designed for young people about his field, in which the [rhetorical] rules learned in school are refreshed. Since the booklet could be useful to Bullinger's sons, especially his eldest son Heinrich, he includes a copy with his letter, even though he believes that Bullinger's sons receive a completely satisfactory education in all subjects at home. However, since he owes so much to the father, and therefore also to his sons, that he could hardly ever repay it, at least this book gift should express his gratitude. If Bullinger wishes for more copies for the other sons, he should just let him know! Curione will send them immediately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Should Bullinger have read the writing [Pro vera et antiqua ecclesiae Christi autoritate oratio] by Curione against [Antonio] Fiordibello in the meantime, he should let him know if he encountered anything offensive. Peter Martyr Vermigli reported in a letter [from Strasbourg], which Perna also read, that Martin Bucer was outraged by the passage where the body of Christ is mentioned. However, Curione does not care about Bucer's opinion as long as the better thinkers agree with his writing. He also does not care about Calvin's and Pierre Viret's opinion. They have indeed sided with Bucer in Strasbourg, while they seem to teach something else at home, even opposing the Lutherans, whom they approve of in Bucer's presence. This quite openly and without ulterior motives, especially since Curione knows to whom he entrusts this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also from Curione's wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] and the children, also to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children. Theodor Bibliander and the colleagues are also greeted. Bullinger should remain well-disposed towards Curione and his family and pray for them.</p>

      <p>Caelius Secundus Curio sends greetings through Christ Jesus. For a long time, I have not written to you, my dearest Bullinger, and for an even longer time, you have not written to me. Since the time I sent the Hebrew grammar of our Stancaro to you, by the mandate of himself, through the nephew of Hervagius, a studious young man who was then traveling to Italy, I have written nothing at all (and I had received no letters from you long before that). However, I often inquired about you from the young men of Zurich who study here, and I heard that you are well. But our friendship should not endure such long and prolonged interruptions. Therefore, when our Peter Perna, a modest and good man, very respectful of you, was traveling to you for some of his business, I could not let him leave without my letters, so that, since we cannot do otherwise now, we might at least enjoy this exchange of letters and converse as if present and greet each other. For what better can we do in these calamitous times than to alleviate the bitter troubles and sorrow of the mind, if not dispel them, at least soften and ease them with letters?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, I beg and beseech your kindness, my best Bullinger, to sometimes honor me with your letters, even the briefest ones. You can hardly believe how much your letters refresh, educate, and sustain me. At this time, there can be no lack of material, whether about common miseries or even private consolations, or about consulting or warning about imminent dangers, or commenting on the places of the most holy religion; all of which are so readily available to you, and you hold the account of all so well, that nothing seems to be lacking to you. As for me, I will act with such faith, sincerity, candor, love, and diligence with you, that I can never justly be blamed in the duties of Christian friendship.</p>

      <p>But to omit these things now, about which I know you have no doubt: during these holidays, when it was allowed to be free from the public duty of teaching, so that we might not be entirely idle, we wrote a few things about our field, in which we are engaged. These are indeed scholastic and very slight. But we wanted it so, that those who are in their youth might find the recent school reflected in them. Since they seem to be able to help your sons somewhat in the studies of eloquence, I send you one booklet, which we recently published, so that you may give it in my name to him to whom it will be more suitable, although I think it fits Heinrich, as the eldest (if I am not mistaken), more than Rudolf or Christoph. But if you think it also suitable for the others, write back! I will send one immediately to each. For even if I think they can be content with the paternal and domestic teaching (in which I know all excellent arts and wisdom flourish), yet, because I owe so much to you, I also know that I owe as much to them as I can ever repay. Therefore, I ask you and your sweetest sons to consider this, whatever it is, kindly, until the opportunity and occasion offer themselves to provide greater things.</p>

      <p>Regarding my speech against Florebellus, if you have had the time to read it all, I ask you to let me know if anything in it offended you. For the passage about the body of Christ offended Bucer somewhat, as I received from the letters of Peter Martyr of Florence, which letters our Peter here, who is coming to you, saw and read. But I do not care much about what Bucer thinks of my writings, as long as they are truly approved by the more sensible. For I do not wish to join with Calvin and Viret in that question, whom I hear subscribed to Bucer in Strasbourg, even if at home they seem to think otherwise, for at home they criticize the Lutherans, whom they approve of in Bucer's presence. I write this to you freely and candidly, as is my custom. For I know I have nothing to fear, understanding to whom I disclose these things.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus, my best brother, and pray to God for us and love and honor us as you do. Greet your wife and children in my name, and in the name of my wife and children. I also ask you again and again to greet Mr. Bibliander and other most learned men and brothers in my name. Basel, 6th day before the calends of September 1547.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the holy church of Zurich, a friend and brother to be especially respected. In Zurich.</p>
