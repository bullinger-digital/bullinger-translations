      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to add to what I recently wrote through my mother, except that a consistent rumor is being spread that Calais has once again been taken from the French by the English, which I wanted to share with you immediately, although I assume you have more certain information. I also await what you will write to us about these and other matters.</p>
      <p>I am now coming from the lord of Habsburg, who acts as the governor of the Margrave of Baden in the Rotulano domain. He has betrothed his stepdaughter to a nobleman from the Erlach family here and has brought her here. He sought my conversation and discussed many things with me (as he is a wise and learned man) about ecclesiastical matters, especially about the sacramental controversy. He desires it to be removed; he proposed much about establishing a colloquy.</p>
      <p>I see that he is of the Lutheran opinion, yet he does not wish to condemn anyone; he is entirely dependent on Sulzer. He showed how he has always opposed those in several diets who wanted to condemn our churches. I encouraged him to continue doing the same and to defend us from the slanders of the wicked and at least to ensure that their side uses the same modesty against us as we do against them.</p>
      <p>He promised much.</p>
      <p>Among other things, he asked that if I ever wrote to you, I should ask you not to deny your efforts for a colloquy if you are summoned. I also told him much about the dangers of colloquies and about the zeal of the Zürich church in maintaining peace, which he did not disapprove of. He rejects ubiquity; he is hostile to Westphal because of the tragedy stirred up again and is entirely inclined here to maintain peace with each other until the Lord grants better things. He hopes that Jakob Andreae from Geppingen will come to Zürich and confer with you about these matters. I wanted to forewarn you of this, although he is not certain whether it will happen or not.</p>
      <p>I am now returning to him again to have lunch with him, and since he conveniently offered himself to me here, I wanted to pour this out rather than write to you. Therefore, take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
