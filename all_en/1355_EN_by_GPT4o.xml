      <p>Philipp Gallicius to his Heinrich, Greetings.</p>
      <p>By the will and also the advice of Johannes Comander, the venerable elder, I have come here, called as the minister of this church. May God grant that it be fortunate for all. If this had not happened, I would have come there to see you, if there had been a place where I could have been not unsuitable. For in my Engadin, my sons (of whom I have five) could not learn the German language, and elsewhere there was no means to support my family, as I wrote to you a little before I came here, through two young men, who, however, brought me no response from you; but they confessed frankly that it was due to their own negligence and fault, not at all yours. And I write this to you as if to give an account of my actions, to a man like you, at whose command all things should be directed for us. Furthermore, the brothers of the Valtellina ask for these books to be bought and bound most neatly for them: Calvin on all the epistles of the apostles; Musculus on the Psalter; the Reformation of Hermann, if I am not mistaken, of the Cologne church; the Bible printed by Robert Estienne. When these have been prepared, send them to me, and let me know the amount to be paid; the one who requests the books has entrusted this to a certain citizen here, who will pay.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he sends here through this bearer a gold crown. Buy and accomplish everything at a reasonable price. We persuade ourselves that you will not unwillingly do this; they are pious works. - The one who presents this letter to you, a brother in the Lord, was in prison for many months because of the gospel of the Lord, finally released in a miraculous way. He visited Calvin, desiring in the meantime to see you, whose many sermons he has translated from the Decades into Italian and published. But lest I forget this: what a great offense! Dr. Bartholomäus von Castelmur, the vicar here, etc., showed me his booklet on monasticism, which he also showed to you and you read, as well as the letter in which you responded to him. The man is not defeated; he has prepared an apology to the venerable lord and man Heinrich Bullinger, etc., happily written. There you will see: a man, by Hercules, charming by the grace of folly. If he could push you to publish something against him by name, he would strike the stars with his lofty head. But lest I trouble you further, sweating for the world, farewell in the Lord. Here all is quiet, no news, except that the emperor is sending soldiers to Italy; we do not know where. May God preserve you along with all the learned there for a long time. From Chur, on the 26th of July, in the year 1551. Comander sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>The same yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the world. In Zürich, etc.</p>
