    <p xml:id="regest1">[Peter] Kunz has died, and from the remaining exponents of the Lutheran party [Simon Sulzer and Beat Gering], there is not much to fear anymore; in the event of a new appointment, with support from [the people of Zurich], even [a representative of the Zwinglian direction] could come into play; in any case, the struggle will be easier after the death of Kunz. Requests to strengthen the young letter bearer, who could soon be appointed as a deacon, in the right doctrine. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>As human affairs are fleeting and mortal, it has happened that the carnal support of many has paid the debt of all flesh, namely Kunz. After this, there is not much to fear from the two remaining exponents of the Lutheran faction; for it is uncertain whether a third will be added to them, indeed we have no less hope for a pious patron of the truth, therefore it will also be your task to lend your helping hands, so that our church may be relieved of this burden. But if indeed no one is added, we will fight with greater hope and fruit; for much had to be conceded to Kunz's importunity, lest the whole edifice be destroyed at once.</p>
      <p>The young man here, who carries this letter of mine to you, was received by us last year and has lived in such a way that perhaps soon he will be called to the office of deacon. Advise him to imitate no other than the sincere and pious doctrine and clear profession, which has been prevalent in the Swiss churches until now.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, February 23, 1544.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
