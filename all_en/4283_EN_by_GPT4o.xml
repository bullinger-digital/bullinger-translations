      <p>Greetings. Here you have the writing of Schenck against the ubiquity of the body of Christ, along with some other matters concerning the same cause, which is now being discussed in Augsburg. It pleases me to add here a passage from Melanchthon's commentary on Paul's Epistle to the Colossians, which was published in Frankfurt by Burbach in the year 1559, on this subject (although perhaps you have seen this before and have considered it yourself); for he writes at the beginning of the third chapter of that epistle, among other things, as follows: "Here many notable matters are contained: the declaration of the articles of the creed 'He ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of God the Father,' etc., also what are the properties of the glorified body, also how it is said 'Christ is in us, Christ is our life.' And first about the saying 'He ascended into heaven,' how do these things agree? Elsewhere it is said: 'The Son who is in the bosom of the Father,' also John 3: 'the Son of Man, who is in heaven'? I answer: in the creed, the saying is understood as it sounds literally, both of the body and of the bodily location; 'into heaven' that is, into a heavenly place, wherever it is, because here allegories are not to be invented. The ascension was visible and bodily, and the whole antiquity always wrote that Christ is in some place by bodily location, wherever he wills, and the bodily ascension was made upwards. But in the proposition 'the Son, who is in heaven,' the saying is understood by the communication of idioms. The λόγος (Word) is always in heaven, even if by bodily location the body is in the Virgin. This narration is expressed in the explanation of the creed, which is read in the books of Cyprian, although elsewhere the inscription is: 'Explanation of Rufinus.' He ascended to the heavens, not where the Word of God had not been before, for he was always in heaven and remained with the Father; but where the Word made flesh had not sat before, that is, where the body had not had a bodily location before. Thus Augustine speaks, and the words are cited in Lombard's Book 3, Distinction 22. Christ did not leave the Father when he came in weakness, everywhere whole, everywhere perfect. Then the form of speech is added 'everywhere whole, but not wholly.' Others have spoken more elegantly. The proposition is true by the communication of idioms, Christ is everywhere.</p>
      <p>Athanasius speaks thus about the incarnation of the Word: 'The λόγος (Word) is not bound to the body, but he himself contains the body, so that he is both in it and outside all things and in the bosom of the Father, nor when he is in all things, does he become a part of others, but all things receive sustenance from him. But as it is said about the local ascension of human nature: 'He ascended to the heavens,' so about the exaltation of human nature above all creatures it is said 'He sits at the right hand of the Father,' as Paul here says: 'Where he is sitting at the right hand of God.' He says that Christ is above and indeed at the right hand of God, that is, not as the blessed angels and men are above, but exalted above the angels in that secret light of God reigning with the Father, and yet the body is locally somewhere according to the mode of a true body, as Augustine says. And these propositions: 'Christ is in us, I in them, we will come to him and make our abode with him,' etc., are understood by the communication of idioms, and about this presence of the Son in the preaching of the gospel and in the saints, it is necessary for the church to be faithfully instructed, so that we may recognize our Lord Jesus Christ to be present with the church and to be the head perfecting all things in all.' This is Melanchthon. Would that all Lutherans would write and speak thus; then the way to concord would have been made. I wanted to add these things, because if you have not seen them before, without a doubt it will be pleasing to you; if indeed you have seen them, yet my work, I know, will not be ungrateful to you.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write.</p>
      <p>Your brother will communicate to you the things that are happening with us, to whom I have written a few things about them, and also about the son of Lord Consul Müller, whom we have looked after, as you wrote and as the brother will explain. Haller, Hagius, the father-in-law, all friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 13, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
