      <p> Greetings. For your letters to me, and also for those sent to you by others and forwarded to me, I owe you great thanks, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. Gastio never lacks news to write, so his letters are mostly very pleasant, even if they do not always bring news of pleasant things. However, the variety itself can indeed be delightful, especially because they never fail to intersperse something joyful. I had not heard anything about the armored monks before; a bold deed indeed, and truly worthy of a Franciscan cowl, which in previous centuries has also destroyed many distinguished princes through poisonings and betrayals. Please, write to me a fuller account of this matter, once you have received more certain information from others, in your usual manner. </p>
      <p> I also earnestly wish that your prayers for the Emperor may be fulfilled, and that the most merciful King of Kings, Christ, may grant it, and that He may avenge him graciously for the blood so abundantly, not to say cruelly, shed. I am expecting hourly what is further written from Augsburg about his health and when the judge of all will finally demand that soul, which has been tormented for so long with such great sufferings. It is most certain, as you write, that this death will stir up horrendous and fatal disturbances for many throughout all of Europe, and even in a good part of Asia. Many will stir themselves, who now sit still and silent like a mouse. But what if everything falls back on the head of the Roman pontiff and his scales? I would indeed easily promise this to us, if I did not fear that the ingratitude of our people would be tormented by a longer tyranny of those, although the Lord can also take worthy vengeance on them for other reasons. But we must not break into the judgments of the Lord, which are deeper than the ocean itself, but rather we should repent sooner and more maturely and be authors of repentance to others as well, as much as we can, so that however the impending gravest storms fall upon the whole world, they may fall without any danger to us, but we may lift up our heads and rejoice that our redemption is near. </p>
      <p> The friend who wrote to me about the recalled Spaniards who have already progressed somewhat is not from Augsburg, but from Lindau, and is truly trustworthy. </p>
      <p> I am returning those two letters and have nothing to give you in return now from others that I have received, but I hope that something certain will be sent by friends today or tomorrow. </p>
      <p> I would have easily detected Halleri's error in Parma; for the Emperor could not restore what he never had; but he will restore Piacenza to the Roman See when the Frenchman restores Parma. </p>
      <p> I commend us to the Lord continually and that with the most fervent prayers of faith. May He build you and your house with the abundance of His perpetual blessing and preserve you eternally. Farewell, my soul. May 14, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer. </p>
      <p> I greatly congratulate our Heliander on his fate, who now admitted to the heavenly wedding, reclining at that banquet table, no longer ministers to any church, but has Christ Himself, the bridegroom of all churches, as his minister, whose face he now enjoys most pleasantly and eternally with glory and sweetness, happy and most blessed. </p>
      <p> To the incomparable man of doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his greatest friend. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
