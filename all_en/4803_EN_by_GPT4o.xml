      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter written on the 10th of this month.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received mine along with two booklets of epigrams and poems and a letter to Flaminio. I will depart for Basel tomorrow.</p>
      <p>What can be done there, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Colonel Frelich has been appointed as an arbitrator in place of the ill bailiff Choiller.</p>
      <p>I would wish for some moderation in your municipal laws and not to always act with the utmost rigor. The lords could enjoy the company of good and honest citizens, who have been sufficiently punished by many years of repentance and would not refuse to convert a light or monetary penalty into pious uses.</p>
      <p>But about these things, we will speak in person sometime.</p>
      <p>From Vienna, I understood that Mr. de Willeville, who is the governor of the city of Metz, went there to greet the emperor in the name of the king and to return the favor for another delegation provided by the emperor. He was honorably received there and departed on the 3rd of this month for Prague, to also greet Prince Ferdinand and then return to France. Perhaps it is not entirely without reason that it was written to you from Augsburg; but I have nothing certain.</p>
      <p>The king's coronation has been postponed to the eighteenth of this month. I believe the King of Navarre has consulted for the security and peace of all, he himself sent some noble and wise men through all the provinces of France, to persuade the people to mutual concord and to quell the tumults stirred up by the work of priests, and no business would be done to any pious person. There is almost no mention of the council anymore.</p>
      <p>The Lord wishes to lead his chosen ones to the knowledge of himself by another way. I am sending a bundle of letters to Mr. Galthero, whom I ask you to greet in my words and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>My wife and Matheolus greet you.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 17th of May.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
