    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger had been on business since noon, and when he reached the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater?] at three o'clock, the mayor showed him the [Hohentwiel] treaty sent by the council of Constance [between Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg [and Emperor Charles V]. He further reported that the messenger from Constance [...] would soon depart. When Bullinger returned home, he found Blarer's letters [No. 2762 and No. 2763], and he intends to address their most important matters immediately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger has long lamented that things are not as they should be in [Zürich or in the Four Cantons of the Confederation]. There is a lack of sincerity, love of God, and love of neighbor: People are not willing to risk danger and death for others, showing themselves not only as humanly [weak] but also as bad. Yes, even Bullinger is not as he should be. However, in the exercise of his office, he clearly and distinctly admonishes (just as Blarer has done to him) that one should stand in the service of truth. However, he has not yet succeeded in effecting a united resistance against the Emperor. But if the [Confederates] are attacked, something will have to be done. Whether it will then be too late remains to be seen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Precisely because everyone is in a poor state, Bullinger [in a lost letter to Blarer dated January 22] suggested that the people of Constance should place their hope in God. He nevertheless senses that the Zürich councilors are well-disposed towards the people of Constance. Therefore, the latter should clearly and openly express their disappointment [regarding the letter written in the name of the four Protestant cantons by the Zürichers]. Presumably, they will receive a more detailed explanation in this way than Bullinger did. As for him, he expects nothing from the [Four Cantons], as he knows exactly how things went in the last [Second Kappel] War and again now, during the [Schmalkaldic] War in Germany. Consequently, he has resolved to plead and admonish as best he can, whether publicly or privately. If something positive results from this, he will attribute it to God's work. If not, it will become clear to him that God intends to punish His own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Even if the Confederation were to abandon Constance, there would still be no reason to submit to the bishop [Johann von Weeze]! For even then, the people of Constance would have to suffer. This is exactly what Bullinger [if he were in Blarer's place] would make clear to his council, even if the chances of being heard are slim. If he succeeds, it would be attributed to God. If not, he would still trust in Him, for the present suffering is limited and the eternal reward is certain. And if God were still able to enforce His will, one would have to learn to trust Him even then.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger indeed feels how much and rightly Blarer is grieved. But since the world behaves no differently, God must act accordingly. He gives everyone the strength to exercise their office in trust in Him until the end.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] According to Blarer's wish, Bullinger will once again advocate for the people of Constance with the Zürich council, as he is aware that Constance is only a stone's throw closer to the battlefield than Zürich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The [unknown] rider [who rode through Thurgau] may well be right in his prediction that a bloody confrontation on the Rhine will soon occur!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Indeed, the [Hohentwiel] treaty is scandalous. Duke Christoph [of Württemberg] as well as Count Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] and others have meanwhile retreated to Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is true that the time of the Maccabees with the persecutions committed by Antiochus [IV Epiphanes] has begun. But [the redemption] will soon follow! But first, God's children must still be tested, as it is written in Dan 11. Only then will God overthrow the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger has so many tasks to complete and letters to write that he barely has time to catch his breath and misses many things. Therefore, Blarer should not hold it against him if he does not write everything. Moreover, he is not informed about everything. At the [Diet] in Baden, it was decided that the mercenaries who, after it was forbidden, still went to war [to Germany] should be punished as follows: A captain with 100 guilders, a lieutenant or ensign with 50 guilders, an ordinary soldier with five guilders. All should be disarmed. However, the Zürichers have not yet decided on the sanctions against their mercenaries. This will probably change. In Zürich, according to the law (which is always valid), a mercenary must be punished in honor, body, and property. Therefore, the mercenaries who went to France were also severely punished. If the [mercenaries who went to Germany] were now left unpunished, the mercenaries who went to France would also demand a remission of their punishment. And then the law would be nullified! Therefore, some experts advocate that the law should continue to be upheld and only the [mercenaries who went to Germany] should be punished more lightly. It is necessary to constantly ensure that the supporters of mercenary service in Zürich do not cause even greater problems for their authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] May God strengthen the hearts of the people of Constance so that they do not stray from the right path! Bullinger does not find the statement of the Zürich council, that it will do what it can responsibly, inappropriate, especially since the people of Constance did not formulate any specific requests in their letter. He therefore wonders why the people of Constance take such offense at it. Bullinger already wrote about this in the letter [not received] that he entrusted to the messenger from Constance the day before yesterday [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] In all this, he hopes that in Constance as well as in Zürich, all expectations will be placed solely on God. In addition, appropriate means can also be applied, about which Bullinger has already expressed himself in his letter the day before yesterday. It would also be good if the people of Constance freely communicated to the Zürichers (whether in writing or orally) what exactly they criticize about the attitude of the Four Cantons, and if they also let Basel, Bern, and Schaffhausen know, but kept it secret from the other cantons for the time being.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] When one is already near the end, one should do one's best until the end! There is also unrest in Zürich, as the Five Cantons demand the punishment of Bullinger and especially Rudolf Gwalther because of his "Endtchrist." Both are waiting to be summoned by the council, but are confident in the Lord.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The enclosed letter [from Vadian] as well as the previously sent letters [from Baldassare Altieri and John Burcher] should be returned by Blarer soon. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Dear lord and brother, I have not been at home since noon, but have been out on business, and when I came to the mayor at three o'clock, he showed me the Württemberg treaty, received from your lord, and said that a messenger from Constance was here; he would soon be ready to depart. When I returned home, I found your letters on the table. I immediately began to respond as much as possible, especially to the important points.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is not as it should be with us, as it should rightly be, and in my opinion, it should be that one should trust in God alone without any deceit and walk in love towards one's neighbor, offering help and advice, even at the risk and loss of our lives. I have long lamented that it is not so, and that we are not only flesh and blood but also malicious, as in other places (which I now regret enough); especially that I myself am not as I should be. Yet, in what concerns my office, I admonish (as you have admonished me) publicly and privately to firmly adhere to the truth and to help the truth. However, I have not yet been able to bring the matter to the point where people generally want to resist the emperor. Be aware, if he begins to approach us, something will be undertaken. How far that may reach, I cannot know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Dear lord and brother, we are also people like other poor people. Therefore, I have written to you to place your matters in God's hands. It is no less true, I can sense nothing but a very good will towards yours from my lords. And if your lords err and need, they should write freely to ours, through which they will receive thorough information and understanding. Be aware and rightly, they would open up more to them than to me. In our own matter, I do not rely on us. I know how it went in the previous war and how it is now in Germany with this war. Therefore, I have made and set my matter thus: What I can and may do publicly and privately, I do with pleading, asking, warning, admonishing. If something happens, I know that God has worked it; if not, I hold that God seeks us for our sins. I know then not what else to do but to persist in the truth with God's grace, setting life and limb upon it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>And even if the Confederation does not support the pious city of Constance, and you are left alone, would you therefore submit to the bishop's yoke? You would have to suffer worse afterwards. That is what I would hold before mine. If I could achieve it, God be the honor; if not, I would still set mine upon it. If I then had to retreat, God would not sleep and abandon you. Be well comforted in the Lord! If we do our part and no success follows, it will be found later. If God wills, we will be justified, and our suffering will not be eternal. And even if it goes as God wills, our heart should always be strong in Him. Even if He makes all flesh ashamed, the spirit remains upright in Him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I can well sense in your writing that you are very troubled, and not unjustly. But you see that the world does not act otherwise. So God cannot act otherwise than He does. So let us seek true comfort in Him, plead, give our advice, do our office until the end, and let Him rule.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I will from now on do my best with my lords, as you desire. For I know that it is as you say: That you are now a stone's throw closer to the battlefield. I have also committed myself to the matter through the grace of God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>To worry that the rider is not a false prophet, for I believe that they and we will find each other on the Rhine in blood and water, as a punishment for them and us or our sins. God have mercy on us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Württemberg treaty is a miserable treaty. Duke Christoph, as well as Count Georg, are in Basel and others more.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>These are indeed the times of the Maccabees, namely that Antiochus still tortures. Soon the other will come too. But first, those who are God's will be well tested (see Daniel 11), then the Lord alone will overthrow the Antichrist.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>There is so much writing that I am suffocating in it; the tasks are also so many and varied that I forget much and become negligent. Therefore, do not be angry with me if I sometimes omit to write some matters. I also cannot know everything. With the mercenaries, it is as follows: Those who ran away against the prohibition in the common lordships are now punished in Baden: The captain 100 guilders, lieutenant and ensign 50 guilders, the common soldier 5 guilders, and until grace without weapon and honor. My lords have not punished theirs. But be aware, something will happen with time; it may also dry up. Our situation is as follows: We have common statutes. Whoever runs to princes, lords, estates shall be punished in honor, body, and goods. Severe punishments have followed those who ran to the French; and some are still in punishment. The statute has never been lifted. If now these soldiers were to be let go without any punishment, the French would also demand it; that would bring us complete disruption. Therefore, the wise think to let the severe punishment remain, and with time to impose something on these, bearable and light; only that no complete destruction follows. Iniquum petendum, ut aequum feras, for we have always had great temptation and unrest from the French; it grows more and more upon us, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>May Almighty God strengthen your heart, that you do not bind yourself to the wrong directions, go right, as God wills. What my lords have written, to do what they can answer for, seems to me not inappropriate. Now, however, yours have not, as far as I know, requested anything substantial, significant from them through their writing. I wonder why you burden yourself with it; yet I wrote to you the day before yesterday through your messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Yet, in all this, I would wish that you and we would look solely to God. I am not against appropriate means. Therefore, if yours take these means, which I wrote about the day before yesterday, into their hands, it would not be bad, or if yours had freely written or spoken about what they lack from ours, also that they let it reach Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, and that they keep silent about the other places for the time being.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Dear brother, if it is already at the end, let us do our best until the end. We also have our unrest here, for the Five Cantons demand punishment from my lords, that they punish us, especially Waltherten, because of the printed "Endtchrist." We are waiting to be summoned for advice, but let us be comforted in the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>This enclosed letter, along with the others previously sent to you, should be returned to me soon. God be with you and all yours. Greet them for me. Given in Zürich, January 24, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 1547. Yours entirely and sincerely.</p>
