      <p> Greetings. You have here, my most esteemed lord and brother, a messenger who will faithfully bring to me anything you were going to write. I have nothing, except that from Italy it is reported that the war is raging fiercely before Parma. Ravenna is said to have suffered some damage; the French are faring well, etc. </p>
      <p> The Venetians are said to have discovered a betrayal that the imperial forces had prepared against them, similarly the Genoese also discovered one and are said to be in a bad situation with the emperor. It is also said that the people of Magdeburg have recently achieved a great victory in a sortie. If you have anything, let me know, especially how the matter of the council stands. Farewell. Zurich, 12th of July, 1551. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Lord Oswald Myconius, my honorable lord and dearest brother. </p>
