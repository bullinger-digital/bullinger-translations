      <p>Greetings. I received your last letter, most illustrious man, and indeed, both your actions and those of the people of Bern and Schaffhausen should be followed by us as well; but I would not assert anything about the recall of the exiles. We will give thanks to God if we can bring the matter to such a point with our cries that no one will set out anew; for it cannot be said how great the gifts and how much money is flying around here and there. Tomorrow, an envoy will arrive with money to attack everyone and will host many with the most lavish hospitality or banquet, if he can soften or even influence the more stubborn ones.</p>
      <p>This was reported to me by that good old man, about whom I recently wrote to you, whom I believe to be sincere with me. He also persists in his opinion about the traps set for the messenger of Cond√©; therefore, let him beware. He also reported that the King of France has decided to send both his envoys to Switzerland to court Maximilian's daughter and seek her as a wife for the king. Our people easily tolerate the envoy's writings in the treaties, in which he himself advises that the new expedition should not be delayed.</p>
      <p>So much for now, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 28, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord, in Zurich.</p>
