      <p>Well-educated, pious and wise, especially gracious, dear sir, my willing service and all good things are prepared for you in advance. Since I have understood that this year, by the grace of God, a lot of wine has grown with you, I have not wanted to withhold from you some growth from the vineyard in Rol, which I hereby send you a small barrel. From this, have the barrel, which I sent you last year, filled. To my other gracious, dear sirs, such as Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Ludwig Lavater, and also Mr. Wolfgang Haller, distribute equally with a request, that they may accept it as a small gift for a good, prosperous year (which I hereby wish you all from the heart) well rewarded. I hereby offer to render you all possible services. We have no news here at the moment, other than what you are undoubtedly well informed about by the mayor of Cham; whom we want to greet very friendly. I hereby commend you to the protection of God Almighty.</p>
      <p>From Bern, December 14, 1566. Your always willing servant, Johann Steiger wrote.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the divine word of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord and good friend.</p>
