    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for two letters. He is pleased that Vadian has undertaken the expansion of his [first published in 1518] commentary on [„De chorographia“ by Pomponius] Mela; Bullinger is even more curious about the other two announced books. The military success of [Cheireddin, known as] Barbarossa pains him greatly; but the treacherous princes deserve it, and worse is yet to come. The widow Rubli has handed over the enclosed ten guilders for the maintenance of [Sebastian] Uriel [Appenzeller]. Pastor Leonhard Brunner in Worms reports [No. 1319] that the plague is raging there; favored by the death of some opponents of the Reformation in the council, he has now been able to introduce the celebration of the Lord's Supper. According to [Simon] Grynaeus [No. 1326], the plague is also spreading in Basel, and Bullinger fears that the wife of Myconius, [Margret], has already died; some students fled to Zurich. Otherwise, things are going well in Zurich. The Diet will take place on St. Martin's Day [November 11] in Baden. He recommends the bearer of the letter, a Frenchman [or: Gallus; see No. 1318]; he has married a daughter of the St. Gallen citizen Othmar Schryber. He asks Vadian to write to him frequently and apologizes for his poor handwriting due to his illness.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. You have compensated with two letters, and those very copious ones, most illustrious man, for what I have so far complained was lacking. May the Lord be your reward; for you burden me with so many benefits that I can never repay. You promised more extensive commentaries made by you on Mela, which has delighted me greatly. However, the other two books, which you know, please me even more, although not yet seen; for the subject is so appealing; moreover, I know your fortunate talent and with what great erudition you will handle it. May the Lord increase His spirit in you. I was greatly grieved upon reading about Barbarossa's success in military affairs; but I see that the cowardice and impiety of our princes deserve such things; indeed, I fear I am compelled to hear even more atrocious things at some point. The widow Rubli has handed over these ten gold coins you see for the expenses of the boy Uriel. I extorted them with difficulty and more than once despaired; finally, I received them. Leonhard Brunner, the preacher, writes from Worms these days that the plague is raging severely among the citizens and that several tyrants have been removed from the council, and thus he has taken advantage of the opportunity and, with the advice of many pious people, has prepared the Lord's Supper for the church, which received it with great applause. He therefore asks in his letters that we pray to God to confirm what has begun and to have mercy on those afflicted by the severe plague. In Basel, too, it has begun to rage, as Grynaeus complained in letters sent to me. I fear that Myconius's wife has already passed away. Several students, especially Grynaeus's companions, have fled to us. How long the Lord will not also direct this weapon against us, He knows. Otherwise, our affairs are well, thanks to the Lord. The Diet will be held on St. Martin's Day in Baden; which you know, I believe. I commend to you this Frenchman, an excellent and proven man; he has married the daughter of our fellow citizen Othmar Schryber. Love me, as you are accustomed, and please write to me frequently. Farewell and excuse my poor handwriting; it is due to my illness, etc. November 5, 1539. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
