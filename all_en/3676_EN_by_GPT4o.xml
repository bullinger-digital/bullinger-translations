      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, in which you commend to us the cause of the good man Christian from Bremgarten, written by you on July 22, was finally delivered to me on August 12. After reading it, I communicated the entire matter with Mr. Philipp, and as far as I can see, no one will bother him in this regard in the future, especially since his parent is originally from these regions. Indeed, in previous years, it was decreed by law at the public assemblies through the intercession of the ministers among us that no one should be received by the synod who had not first been examined and had not brought an honest testimony of their past life.</p>
      <p>This decree has been departed from more than once by many, not without offense to the pious. We, however, insist on this decree uniquely, as we can keep those deceivers away from our churches by no more convenient way. You see, therefore, the reason for this counsel, which, if only everyone would adhere to it, the affairs of the church would be in a better state. Your most recent letters have been returned to me quite promptly.</p>
      <p>I myself have presented your letters to the legate; those that pertain to Friedrich von Salis, I will deliver as soon as I have conveniently found a courier.</p>
      <p>As far as I could observe, your letters were most welcome to the legate, who indeed followed their reading with an honorable speech about you. I asked him what he wanted me to write back; he replied that he himself would write what he wanted you to know. It was extremely pleasant for me to read your letters after such a long interval; that you address everything to me so kindly and extensively, you indeed do so paternally; I only wish that I may conduct myself in such a way that you may never regret your benevolence towards me.</p>
      <p>Since the legate had previously given me his letters to read, I did not hesitate to reveal to him the main points of mine in return, primarily with the intention that, if he had discovered anything differently, he would not conceal it from me, so that I could also inform you of the truth. He affirmed everything you wrote as true; however, he denied, and indeed consistently, what was added about the four signs intercepted and slaughtered on the way. He added that Mr. de Thermes had thought of nothing less than fortifying Dunkirk, a place otherwise fortified, with a garrison, as it was further away and could have been held with difficulty. Mr. de Thermes, the marshal (he is said to have attained this dignity not long ago after the death of Peter Strozzi), as you write, came alive into the power of the enemy, but also the younger Count of Rhine; however, the legate affirms that he has this last information not from the court, but from friends in Lyon. The battle was long undecided.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the French, outnumbered by the cavalry, began to act more slowly and to consider fleeing; but because they were fighting in a less favorable position and also had the dangerous sea channel behind them, they had to either miserably perish by the waves or bravely fall, the battle was renewed and dragged on until evening. But more were swallowed by the waves in such great panic.</p>
      <p>The one who was carrying the orders of Mr. de Thermes in the name of the king to abandon the battle plan arrived at the disaster of his men, but too late. For the king feared that Mr. de Thermes might do something rash to more fully illustrate the dignity of the name he had recently acquired. The legate said that the leader de Thermes had initially settled with his troops in a fairly favorable place; but because by chance 12 English galleys had landed at the same place, from whose artillery he was unexpectedly driven off, he was forced to throw himself into such danger. The remaining French troops are now united, not so those of Philip (if we believe the legate), to whom new cohorts are flocking daily.</p>
      <p>The king himself has been with the army until now; but a courier who passed through here yesterday announces that the Duke of Guise is thinking of leaving the borders of the kingdom and besieging Cambrai, while the king will remain content within his own limits. However, it was not difficult to perceive from his speech that even the legate did not place much faith in this last report. But he still says that the French army is very ready and numerous, and that the affairs of his king are in no danger, indeed he offers this argument: if it were otherwise, he would have long had orders from the king to recruit a new army from the Rhaetians, since the affairs of the French rest on the support of the Swiss and Rhaetians. So much for this.</p>
      <p>Everything is calm and peaceful with us. Those who come to us from Milan, men worthy of trust, report that last month a Spaniard, very ill-disposed towards the Christian religion, arrived in Milan, to whom Philip has entrusted the governance of that duchy. When he took office, he began to demonstrate with not obscure omens how much he wanted to serve the antichrist; for he burned alive two Christians, previously subjected to many insults because of their confession of the truth, one of whom was a monk (of which order, I do not know), who, when forced by the violence of the assassins to ascend the platform built for this very purpose, to recant and publicly abjure the truth, said: "Since I am pushed here to say what I think, I will speak freely and openly." Then, having begun, he burst forth intrepidly into such words as were intolerable to the satellites of the antichrist, who immediately rushed forward and, covering his mouth with their palms, threw him down from the platform. By what means and how indignantly they treated him afterwards, you will soon hear from others; I hear that no kind of cruelty was omitted against them. The Venetians today have one of our merchants, who lives in Chiavenna, in chains because of religion. Hercules von Salis was sent from our side to intercede with the Venetian senate yesterday.</p>
      <p>The imperial forces have gathered a troop here and there from the fortified places, which now lies before Valence, and because of the great danger, they have had to remove their women and children from them everywhere. The one whom the King of Navarre, about whom Mr. Sultzer writes, freed from prison, is the nephew of the constable from his sister. Since you are already familiar with his story and the excellent confession he made before the king, I refrain from writing more about him. But Mr. Sulzer writes about a certain minister, which does not seem plausible, since the King of Navarre, from the time he placed the constable's nephew in favor with the King of France, has been in the camp with the King of France. These things in passing.</p>
      <p>I have attached here the letters I wrote to you before. You need not worry about the new things I sprinkled in them, since we now have everything more certain. Most of the other things of that kind are such that it is not very necessary to transmit them to you; but to avoid the labor of rewriting, I sent them in full. I also wrote these more hastily than I should have, because several had to be written at the same time. Therefore, forgive my haste.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and continue to love me as you do. Moreover, do not hesitate to convey my many greetings to the most illustrious and honorable men, my teachers and patrons, always to be honored, your fellow students. Chur, August 15, 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron, to be greatly honored. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
