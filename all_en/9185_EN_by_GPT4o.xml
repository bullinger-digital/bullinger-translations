      <p>Requested by both parties, the governor of Wellenberg and the families of the Beldians, I, most illustrious and honorable compater, have diligently done what I could and thought the matter was well arranged. Again, the governor sends letters to Hesse and us to the Beldians, as if he distrusts their promises, and inquires from him about religion, asserting to this woman that neither he nor his children desire someone suspected of Lutheranism. Duke Hesse himself reported this to the widow, asking for her response. She was astonished, did not know how or with what modesty to respond to these things, mentioned them to her brothers and relatives, and asked them to advise her on what to say to this unexpected and unforeseen question.</p>
      <p>They thought the governor regretted it and sought this reason to refuse more honorably. The brothers themselves, whom I have so far found sincere in religion, did not want to advise their sister to join such a marriage with someone who professed himself so much an adversary of their religion, and they hoped she could be betrothed to another who was of our profession, so that she might return to her father's religion (which they earnestly desired), and for this reason, they thanked the governor and denied their sister. Now he insists again; however, both Beldians are not at home, so we could not respond so quickly; but as soon as they have returned home, we will inform you by a certain messenger of what they have decided. I have never acted in such matters and even this time I act unwillingly; however, the cause moved me, which I cannot ignore, that I have devoted my efforts here: I know how gentle and tractable the governor's nature is, and that he is more severe towards people of our profession, he does this by the abbot's instigation and becomes more ardent, as there is no one to divert him from his purpose; I thought perhaps by God's counsel this marriage was to be instituted, since this woman has so far been found almost like another Abigail and Esther; for she had two husbands from the beginning who were very serious adversaries and enemies of the gospel, but she drew them to milder parts by her clemency and kindness, which she used towards them. I also judged it would be so with Rinovus, - there is a very pious, but meanwhile very miserable people, whom the abbot persecutes with hatred worse than a snake; he instigates the governor to be more severe than is fitting -, so that she, prevailing with kindness towards her husbands, might also make his mind more humane and gentle, which she herself promised to do when asked by me. Otherwise, she has been of the papist profession for many years even after the death of her last husband, when she could have freely returned to us, unimpeded by anyone, which unless I had seen myself, I would never have allowed myself to be persuaded to consult even a little in this matter. We will therefore await the arrival of the Beldians; then we will respond in due time to both the governor and all of you.</p>
      <p>I was recently asked by many good men known to you to urge and strongly request you to let us know what the reason was that the king refused this military expedition to the Swiss; but at that time no merchants had gone to Zurich. I therefore beseech you now to deign to inform us of the news that comes to you from France and Belgium; for such ambiguous things are reported among us that we can safely believe no one. We rejoice greatly that La Rochelle has not yet surrendered and pray to the Lord to raise his hand and deign to deliver them as Daniel from the lion's mouth and like Daniel's companions from the burning furnace. I was pleased to respond to your matters hastily.</p>
      <p>Always keep me commended to you, and as for the collection, my brothers and I will devote all our efforts in our field.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My wife sends you greetings. Greet all the brothers and fellow ministers with your whole family.</p>
      <p>Glarus, January 26, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hug, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compater. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
