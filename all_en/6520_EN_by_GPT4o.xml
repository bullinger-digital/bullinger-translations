      <p>I was exceedingly grieved, and exceedingly glad, that you were ill, and that you have recovered. You write that you included letters addressed to Mr. Jewel in my letters and ask that I ensure a copy of them is made up to this point and sent to Mr. Horn.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my dear Bullinger, I have not seen Jewel's letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I could not satisfy either your or Horn's expectations; but Abel delivered them to Jewel in London with my letters open; he promised Abel that he would send a copy to me as soon as possible. "Anyone can be rich in promises." He promised, but nothing more; thus he has defrauded both you and me and Horn. But I attribute this to the infinite business with which he is occupied.</p>
      <p>You ask for forgiveness for having imposed this burden on me: I consider it not a burden, but an honor, if I can serve Bullinger on any occasion. When I read your German letter to my wife, upon mention of the death of your wife and daughter, she immediately burst into the most bitter tears, so I was forced to stop reading for a while, as she would not lend her ears to listening.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland married Henry, Lord Darnley, the firstborn of the Earl of Lennox, on the 1st of August. Some of the nobles in Scotland do not favor this new marriage; what the outcome will be, we still doubt.</p>
      <p>Certainly, the gospel has taken very firm roots there. There was a rumor not long ago that our queen would marry the Duke of Austria.</p>
      <p>What will happen, I do not know; when I find out, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>I am expecting your most learned homilies on Daniel. Farewell, best Bullinger, with all yours, whom I wish to be safe.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep all the people of Zurich from evil. Amen. Hastily from Ludham, 18th of August, 1565.</p>
      <p>Mine and yours greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished man. In Zurich.</p>
