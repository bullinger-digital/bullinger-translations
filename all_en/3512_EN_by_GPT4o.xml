      <p>Greetings. I am very concerned, my most esteemed lord Calvin, dearest brother in Christ, because I fear that my letters written to you on January 12th have been intercepted by deceit and not delivered to you. An Englishman came here from Poland and first delivered to me letters received from Philipp, of which I send a copy, indeed the original itself. He also added others written by Mr. Johannes Utenhove, which I have also attached here, so you can see what they are like. Finally, he asserted that he also has letters written to you by Mr. Johannes a Lasco, which he will deliver into your own hands and to no one else.</p>
      <p>He added that if I wish to write anything to Calvin, he would deliver it with the utmost diligence and ensure it is taken care of, and that he would return within a few days, so that he may return to Poland laden with our letters as well. Therefore, I entrust him with letters to you, in which I briefly and freely explain what transpired at the colloquy in Worms, where our Zwingli was specifically condemned, and the Augsburg Confession was confirmed in such a way that they professed they had changed nothing in it, nor would they ever change anything.</p>
      <p>And many other things of this kind.</p>
      <p>I also entrusted him with letters to Mr. Haller and some writings and a small amount of money enclosed in the letters. However, Haller writes not a word about these, nor does that Englishman appear anywhere.</p>
      <p>Although I am not suspicious nor do I think ill of foreigners, yet since he has not returned nor is there any further talk of this man, I begin to anxiously turn over many things in my mind. Therefore, if he has come to Geneva and brought my letters, I pray you relieve me of this anxiety, etc. I am sending back the letters of Mr. Jakob Andreae, which were sent to me long ago but were lost for some time in a pile of letters and have now been found. Please return my summary in Latin collected from his book, which was also sent to you long ago, through this messenger, and give him the letters of Philipp and Utenhove to be returned. If what they report is true, the hand of the lord is heavy upon the necks of the English.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain news about the French churches and the imprisoned, I pray you share it so that, if it is joyful, we may give thanks, and if it is sorrowful, we may supplicate. Farewell and love us as you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers be safe.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 20th.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the Genevans, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
