    <p xml:id="regest1">Konrad Gessner, who accompanied Christoph Froschauer, did not deliver Bullinger's letter. Frölich was unsure whether he should respond to the letter or just briefly confirm its receipt, as he is always so busy. Therefore, he could not properly attend to the two [Zürichers]. However, he invited them along with Michael Keller, [Wolfgang] Musculus, Johann Heinrich [Held von Tiefenau], Claudius [Pius] Peutinger, and Sixt Birck to dine with him. During the meal, Gessner shone, presenting a rare example of scholarship through his seriousness, modesty, and good manners. [Gessner] will report himself on his negotiations with [Anton] Fugger, who seems willing to spend money. However, Bullinger knows how dangerous it would be if a man like Gessner went to Italy! Considering his wisdom, Gessner will surely act prudently. - Frölich does not believe that Luther is preparing an attack against Bullinger. Also, Luther's plan to have the Zürichers condemned at a synod seems to be coming to nothing. Whatever Luther plans, he is sure to face mockery and ridicule, as the strongest thing is the truth. May the Lord protect the Zürichers! - Frölich would gladly acquire Gessner's "Bibliotheca universalis," especially since it was recommended to him by Bullinger and he now knows the author personally. - Bullinger wrote that Count Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] would probably be reluctant to let M[atthias] Erb go and might become angry over his appointment by the [Augsburg] council. Therefore, Erb should [upon accepting the job offer] first go to [Zürich] to be summoned from there [to Augsburg], where he would initially preach freely and then take a position upon the retirement of the sick Michael Keller or another pastor; he is also to serve as superintendent. The salary is 250 or 300 guilders and accommodation. - Frölich still intends to visit [Zürich]. - Nothing specific is known [in Augsburg] about the armistice with [Sultan Suleiman I.]; however, there are rumors that Hungary has been almost handed over to the Turks up to Pressburg. Ferdinand [I.] is said to pay Suleiman I. 24,000 guilders for each year of the armistice and to acknowledge himself as tributary to him. - The [book sent by Bullinger, which contains the writings "The Old Faith," "Report of the Sick," and "Hope of the Believers"], he intends to study diligently until it bears fruit. - Frölich has always been hated by the Papists and the Lutherans, and he has been hostile to the clergy since childhood. Thus, 23 years ago, he declined a lucrative priestly office and left it to another. This can be attested by the theologians of the Elector Palatine [Ludwig V. in Heidelberg] as well as the Nuremberg theologians and councilors. Everyone hated him because he refused to agree with their [crude doctrine of the Lord's Supper]. Therefore, he left his good positions at the Palatine court and in Nuremberg and went to Augsburg, where he received an even better position. But even there, he is not entirely satisfied with the state of the church. - As Bullinger also writes, there are many who disguise themselves in religious matters. However, Frölich wonders with Mt 10, 32, how they will justify this before God, and he struggles with the excuses of great men who believe that much must be forgiven and ignored to prevent evil. - Michael Keller sends his regards. - Frölich was convinced that only a few knew the "Speculum Osiandri." He is therefore surprised that Bullinger already possessed a copy of it. This writing is indeed biting, but it arose because [Andreas] Osiander had attacked [Zwingli and Oekolampad in his "Conjectures on the Last Times and the End of the World"]. Bullinger is not wrong in his assumption about the author's identity and will one day learn why he concealed his name. - Greetings to [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, Gwalther, and the others. - [P.S.:] Two laudatory distichs about the Zürich theologians and Konrad Gessner.</p>

      <p>Greetings and grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. Konrad Gessner, accompanied by the excellent man Christoph Froschauer, the distinguished printer, brought me letters from you, a man of utmost brilliance and my most esteemed, to which I am uncertain whether to respond or merely acknowledge receipt. For I am so occupied with various tasks that I am often forced to neglect not only my friends but also myself. Hence, I have not been able to treat the most excellent men with the honor and courtesy they deserve. Nevertheless, I invited them to my house and introduced them to Michael Keller, Musculus, Johann Heinrich, the Parrhecians, as well as Doctor Claudius Peutinger and Sixtus Birck, and during dinner, we discussed various topics, though not very scholarly, yet not inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Gessner, however, displayed remarkable gravity and modesty; he further demonstrated a rare example of scholarship with his gentleness and refined manners.</p>
      <p>He will therefore be someone I must cherish and respect forever. He will report himself on what he has arranged with Fugger. I believe Fugger will not spare money.</p>
      <p>But you know how dangerous it would be for such a man to go to and reside in Italy! However, seeing the man's unique wisdom and diligence, he is unlikely to commit any childish mistakes. May the Lord keep him with us along with all other good people for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>I do not believe that Luther is preparing an attack against you, except that I heard he wanted to convene a synod and, with the common votes of his followers, strike the Zürichers and their adherents with anathema. But many of his own are said to have resisted, and the plan has come to nothing. Whatever he plans and schemes, he will bring nothing but laughter and ridicule, for truth is the strongest of all, and may the Lord, the heavenly Father, to whom eternal praise, honor, and glory belong, perpetually preserve you and your invincible defenders. Amen.</p>
      <p>I will acquire Gessner's library and keep it sacredly, especially because it is so highly recommended by you, and I now recognize the author himself.</p>
      <p>Regarding Mr. Matthias Erb, you wisely write that Prince Georg would be reluctant to let him go, and therefore it is easy to see that our council's appointment of him might cause anger. Therefore, first of all, receive Erb's response to your letters, and if he can prepare his departure with good grace, let him first come to you. Then he will be summoned to us; for I have prepared an honorable position for him. This would be his condition with us, that he would preach freely in our church for some time. As soon as Michael Keller - who, alas, will not last long due to poor health - or another of our pastors can no longer preside over his church, Erb would immediately be appointed in his place. In the meantime, and even afterward, he would act as a kind of superintendent. Our council will also set an annual salary of 250 or 300 guilders and provide accommodation, etc., so that he can live here honorably.</p>
      <p>Regarding my visit to you, which I mentioned in my letters, I still intend to carry it out. May the Lord prosper the plan.</p>
      <p>The conditions under which the truce between the Turk and our heads was agreed upon are not yet truly known to us. However, some whisper that among other things, it was agreed that the Turk would almost possess Hungary up to Pressburg, and King Ferdinand would pay him twenty-four thousand ducats annually during the truce and publicly acknowledge and write that our people are tributaries to the Turk, etc. However, I would not want this to be spread as certain, especially not in my name.</p>
      <p>The pledge of friendship sent will sleep and wake with me, and will not leave my hands until it is well absorbed and bears worthy fruit. It is certain that my Heinrich will remain in my memory forever.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that I have always been hated by the Papists and after them the Lutherans, the Lord will testify, who wanted me to be an adversary to the priests from my youth and almost from my cradle, so much so that even a lucrative priesthood, which was offered to me voluntarily 23 years ago, I granted to another without any compensation. The theologians of the Elector Palatine, as well as the theologians and magistrates of Nuremberg, who persecuted me with deadly hatred for no other reason than that I refused to subscribe to their crude doctrine, will testify to this. This is also the sole reason why I left the Palatine court and Nuremberg itself, where I had a splendid position. But following the Lord's calling, I found a far more splendid and lucrative position in Augsburg, although even here I am not entirely satisfied with the state of religion. But since mortals find happiness nowhere in every respect, let us bear each other's weaknesses.</p>
      <p>As you write, my most honest brother, there are many who today pretend and dissemble in matters of religion. But what they will answer when the Lord demands an account of this word "Whoever acknowledges me before men" [Mt 10, 32], etc., they will see for themselves! I cannot at all accept this moral and political excuse, which I have also heard great men of our age offer. For they say that to prevent evil, much must be forgiven and overlooked, etc., as if the Lord in heaven could also be deceived and misled.</p>
      <p>Michael Keller, a faithful servant of Christ, wishes to be most warmly commended to you, and desires nothing more than to be received into the number of your followers, and wishes you many greetings.</p>
      <p>I thought the "Speculum Osiandri" had been seen by very few. However, since it has already reached you from such a distance, where I believe it was printed, I sense it has been communicated to many! It is indeed a biting poem and close to causing offense. But since Osiander did not blush to impiously tear apart the best men, now resting in Christ, it would have been lazy if some antagonist, like a shadowy avenger, had not appeared. Whoever the author of the "Speculum" is, you do not suspect in vain about him. You will one day hear why the author suppressed his name and, driven by piety, did not entirely avoid the mark of infamy. However, there are errors in the verses, which the scribe perhaps committed while transcribing by yawning; you will consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>Business does not allow me to write more at the moment. Greet Mr. Bibliander, Pellican, Gwalther, and all the learned. And you, fare so well that I can wish health for myself. July 28, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Very quickly.</p>
      <p>In favor of the Zürich theologians, this distich suddenly pours out to me: Hannibal at Cannae does not triumph with such slaughter, As the magnanimous Zürichers do over Rome.</p>
      <p>Congratulations: The presence of Gessner delights me as much As the curly Apollo of Thespiae delights the goddesses.</p>
      <p>For he speaks with one tongue in a threefold language And embraces all kinds of knowledge like a vessel.</p>
      <p>[To the] incomparable man, Mr. Heinrich [Bullinger], pastor of the Zürich church, [friend] and brother forever, etc.</p>
      <p>[Zurich.]</p>
