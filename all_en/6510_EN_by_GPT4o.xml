      <p>Greetings and grace through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Upon reading your most gracious letters to me, which were most pleasing to me, most illustrious Bullinger and most revered father, I was affected in two ways: with the greatest joy and not a little sorrow.</p>
      <p>But first, I will speak of the causes of my joy, and then I will declare what brought me sorrow. I was exceedingly delighted when I understood, indeed from you yourself, that is, from letters written by your own hand, that you had recovered from that most severe illness of the plague and had almost been called back from the dead, revived not without the admirable power of God, so that you might still live a little while longer with yours, that is, with us who are yours, piously and saintly (as you have done so far). Why should I not greatly rejoice? And what else could bring me greater joy than when we, having grieved not a little, as we ought, over the news of your death spread by rumor and announced by certain people, now being made certain by you yourself of your recovered health, it is no wonder that we leap with immense and extraordinary joy. For I have always revered you as a most gracious father towards me, and you have received me in the place of a son, so that I have experienced all the offices of kindness not once. Furthermore, we congratulate not only you and yours, that you have been preserved by our Savior from a deadly disease, from whose force few escape, but indeed we congratulate your church, which you have governed and administered for so many years, as befits a true and sincere minister of Christ.</p>
      <p>And although it has many distinguished men who teach, who write, who minister, who watch over, yet, to speak the truth, it does not have many Bullingers.</p>
      <p>Then also our Polish church, for which you have poured out so many prayers to God and have so often instructed and lovingly admonished against many heresies stirred up by innovators, do you not think that it, having felt the gravest distress from that false rumor, now indeed with the joyful news of your health brought, has not perceived incredible joy? It has indeed perceived it, and many of our knights and nobles, to whom I showed your letters, congratulated me with tears of joy and prayed to God to preserve you safe for a longer time.</p>
      <p>Do you think that so many noble, pious, and honest people have so quickly and completely forgotten your labors, offices, and benevolence? It is not so, my dearest father.</p>
      <p>Among the most ardent defenders of Christ we had, many of our countrymen say, Calvin of blessed memory has passed away in the Lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve our father Bullinger for us. So be it.</p>
      <p>These are the causes, most revered father, by which I and those who feel with me and love, revere, and observe you, who indeed are not few, have been filled with the greatest and incredible joy.</p>
      <p>Now I will briefly explain the causes of sorrow. I was greatly grieved when I understood that you had received none of my letters, although I had written many.</p>
      <p>I would not consider myself a man, much less a Christian, if I had not performed such a pious and due office. I could rightly be accused of ingratitude, from which I have always been far removed, if I wished to forget my most revered father, so gracious towards me, indeed even of impiety, if I had not written any letters to him, witnesses of love, gratitude, and reverence.</p>
      <p>But I would like you to be persuaded, most kind father, and believe me, and I affirm it to be so, that I have written not once and have also diligently sought to whom I might safely entrust them.</p>
      <p>But it is clear to me, as I have perceived from many indications, that there were some, especially those who profess the Arian doctrine, who deliberately intercepted letters.</p>
      <p>They strove to destroy both ours sent to you and yours (which was more troublesome to us) with such care, lest anything from your most pious writings sent to us should bring them shame, while you most gravely refute their errors, and lest we lose the benefit we derive from them, by which kind of impiety it has happened that for so many months mutual letters and writings between us, if there were any, have perished to our great mental distress.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe how diligent they have been in such a crime, which has grieved me more and more each day. And by their malice, rumors of your death were spread daily with all assertion, because they would have wished it so and it would have been very pleasing to them that we, as far as Christian edification is concerned, would be deprived of your support.</p>
      <p>Indeed, but it will not succeed for them.</p>
      <p>For when it pleases the Lord to call you, a vigilant pastor, from your labors to the most peaceful seat, we trust that God will not forsake His church, but rather will provide that the seed of evangelical truth sown in the hearts of many will not be choked by so many heresies, which sprout daily.</p>
      <p>May the Lord give them the spirit of truth.</p>
      <p>You have now understood the causes of both joy and sorrow, my best father, therefore I ask you, for the singular kindness that is in you, not to be burdened to write to me, your most loving and devoted, whenever you have the opportunity.</p>
      <p>For nothing can happen to me more pleasing than when I hear about your health and that of your household and especially about the progress of your church from you yourself.</p>
      <p>As for Polish affairs, I will speak briefly about the kingdom and then about the state of our church, as I know you are most eager to understand.</p>
      <p>That most severe war between our king and the most powerful Muscovite on the borders of Lithuania is not yet finished, where, whether by the negligence of our people or by the will of God, many fortresses have fallen into the power of the Muscovite by force of arms. Because of this war, our Poland is compelled to endure many exactions, by which our king, although he has a sufficiently numerous and equipped army, has not yet achieved anything successfully. The cause, as everyone thinks, was that Lithuania was separated from our Poland.</p>
      <p>From where help and protection could be prepared for it, nor did it wish to unite with Poland. This separation and stubbornness of the Lithuanians everyone attributed to Radziwiłł, the Palatine of Vilnius, who recently departed from this life, who was also infected with the heresy of Arius, as you well know, and promoted the Arians in every way, since he alone had taken up their patronage. Now our king has conscripted a great number of money and soldiers from Poland and has himself set out with some of the leading men of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>We do not know what will happen, but so far our efforts have been little successful. For some hidden force, which I indeed interpret as the vengeance of the contempt of the Christian religion, makes them more sluggish, so that in this part too we are greatly vexed, while we perceive not ordinary judgments of God against us.</p>
      <p>Now as for our churches.</p>
      <p>They are in no better condition.</p>
      <p>Know that the Arian sect persists in such a way that it has drawn many ministers to itself, so that our church lacks the best ministers.</p>
      <p>Among us, however, the number of the orthodox is greater, indeed there is a frequent gathering of nobles, in the senate of the kingdom there is no one from the Arians.</p>
      <p>All, I say, the senators are most favorable to us. Yet the Arians oppose us so stubbornly, so hostilely, that it is most lamentable that this Christian matter, which seemed to be on a happy course, has so miserably come to a standstill, so that we are uncertain what to hope for our church. We strive with the weakness of our strength, which we possess, to bring some help to the miserably failing church, while we devote our effort and diligence to the best education of the youth, so that some flourishing seminary of the city may arise for the time being.</p>
      <p>But in this matter too, it is hardly credible how many difficulties arise daily, what obstacles are thrown in our way by those who ought to favor us the most, so that with one hand we must build this temple and with the other not only repel enemies but also resist false and deceitful brothers, than which nothing more bitter can be conceived. I have opened a small school in the city of Kraków, or as we commonly say, a school, into which the flower of Polish youth flows, where they are instructed and formed in the elegance of letters, the probity of morals, and, which is most important, the purity of Christian doctrine, so that with God's favor we may dare to hope for some more cultivated and sound crop in this our kingdom than has appeared so far. But it is difficult to say how often I am called away from this duty for church matters, for public discussions, which often occur, for cases that arise daily. It is amazing how everyone seeks me alone, entrusts to me alone, which indeed the inclination of all towards me, you can hardly believe, how much burden of business it brings to me and how much heap of troubles it stirs up.</p>
      <p>I also have four assistant teachers, each of whom performs excellent work in their classes, labors diligently, and works hard. I preside over the daily sacred reading, then I labor much in Latin Cicero for forming both language and style and in dialectics and rhetoric, and we all strive with all our strength to show some fruit to these our distinguished men in their children and that they may not justly and rightly complain about our work (as they complain about being deceived by most others).</p>
      <p>You have the entire account of my plans and labors, my most pious and illustrious Bullinger, laid out to you with great joy of mind as to a father, to whom it is pleasant to reveal all the inner feelings of the mind. You see how grave were the causes of both joy and sorrow by which I was greatly affected, you see how much I have been troubled by these annoyances, while I am refreshed by conversing with you through letters. And since this our ecclesiastical assembly is such that discipline lies overturned, doctrine is torn and scattered by false opinions, so that you see nothing but a certain appearance and image of the Christian religion rather than solid and sincere religion itself, therefore I ask and beseech you again and again, and all who are with me, that you help and support us wretched ones with your best and holy writings. Whatever is sent to us from you is of the greatest help to us, as were those responses you recently sent to Radziwiłł, for which the entire poor little church of ours, along with me, gives you immense thanks and encourages, asks, and prays you to console, instruct, and fortify us more often with such writings. We have recently translated your sermons on the Apocalypse into our language and published them with great expectation from all, of which I will soon ensure a copy is delivered to you. We also have in hand and are translating your compendium of Christian religion into our language, of which a large part is already in the press. From this, you can infer how much you are esteemed by us and yours by ours.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most excellent father, concerning the death of your wife, who was indeed endowed with singular probity and adorned with the best morals, whom I always revered with the greatest respect as the ornament and glory of all matrons I have ever known and whose kindness and hospitality towards me I have experienced so often in daily interaction, I cannot but grieve greatly.</p>
      <p>Yet if we consider that God, the best and greatest, has called her to Himself by this way from this calamitous course of life and not only invited but also drawn her to that eternal and blessed life to be desired with all prayers, it is rather to be rejoiced than grieved. Added to this is that she always lived with utmost integrity, chastity, and holiness, providing a model of the highest probity to all others, so that since she has completed her course so excellently and piously, with this thought, my father, let us alleviate our common sorrow.</p>
      <p>The young men of Cików, who were kindly educated by you and excellently instructed in the knowledge of truth, now live in Pińczów in the school and church of the Arians, and you should know that the elder Stanisław has been almost drawn to the Arian side and adhered to their error, while the younger persists in the right course, and that Laurentius has left them because he was being drawn into Arianism by his own, and he is now serving as a tutor with Tomicz, the Castellan of Gniezno, in a certain town 30 miles from our city. The father of the Cików family was until now the head and leader of the Arians and, having been made the supreme commander of the Polish army against the Muscovite, greatly favored, protected, and promoted the Arian cause.</p>
      <p>He maintained an Arian preacher in the camp, so it is most lamentable that such a man, especially, is infected with this deadly plague. However, since in the recent Arian synod, into which many Anabaptists from Lithuania, Moravia, and other parts gathered, it was concluded among them and firmly that their children should not be baptized and perhaps some other things about rebaptism, I have heard that this very man Cików has begun to pursue them with hostile hatred for this reason and is also being regarded with greater execration among the rest every day.</p>
      <p>Oh times, oh Christianity, oh we most wretched! I wanted you to know this, my father, so that in your piety you do not yet abandon this man, but write to him once more and draw him back from Arianism.</p>
      <p>There is hope that he can still be won for Christ on this occasion. This is the last.</p>
      <p>We pray you for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you help us with your pious prayers to the most merciful Father and grieve for our situation. For we also pray constantly in our prayers that He may deign to favor your labors and especially protect and preserve you safe and healthy for us and fill you with length of days.</p>
      <p>To Gwalter, Gesner, Simler, Lavater, Zwingli, Haller, my most revered lords and teachers, many greetings. And although I write to each individually, I wanted to include them in these letters with your permission, my father, your sons. I am very glad to hear that your children are flourishing excellently, whom I also greet most dutifully as my brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, my father, and again, and embrace me, your most devoted and observant, with your exceptional love and memory, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Given at Kraków, the first of August 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and observant servant, disciple, and son Christoph Thretius... to the most reverend and pious man... Bullinger the elder, church... pastor and bishop... lord and revered father... of Zurich.</p>
