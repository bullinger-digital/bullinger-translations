    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has not written for a long time, and Vadian also did not write only because he had nothing new to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger has probably read what the St. Gallen council wrote to the Zurich council. In St. Gallen, they are still waiting for the return of the merchants and messengers who were at the Nuremberg fair. They will certainly have news to report, which Vadian will, of course, also share with Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He has probably already seen the monster of Krakow: Ugly and unworthy of the church! However, a multitude of such monsters and celestial signs were predicted for the last days before the end of the world!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] When the crowned poet Caspar Brusch, who teaches the fine arts in Lindau (a learned man who can compose such melodious verses!), saw the depiction of this monster at Vadian's, he had already composed an extensive epigram a few hours later. Since Vadian learned that he is on his way to Zurich for the [spring] synod, he would like to particularly recommend him. Brusch mainly wants to meet Bullinger, as well as Rudolf Gwalther and Theodor Bibliander. He has never been so excited to discover a city as he is now with Zurich, especially since it is not only beautifully situated and built but also provides a livelihood for so many learned and world-renowned people (whom he would like to count among his friends or patrons). Brusch will certainly grow fond of Bullinger!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has been a long time since you have written to me, and I, for the same reason, that there was nothing to write about until now, have neglected my small duty.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>But I believe, nevertheless, that you have also read those things which have been written by our council to your most esteemed council. We are awaiting both our merchants and messengers from the Nuremberg fair, who will undoubtedly bring some news. Whatever it may be, I will ensure you understand it promptly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I assume you have seen the Krakow monster. It is foul and unworthy of the church of Christ; however, it has been foretold that the heavens and earth will be filled with monsters and other signs when the last day approaches.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Caspar Brusch, the crowned poet who teaches the fine arts in Lindau, a learned man endowed with remarkable elegance and ease in composing and writing poetry, has most aptly depicted it. Having recently visited me, he, upon seeing the monster, delineated it in a copious epigram within a few hours. Since I understood that he is about to set out for your synod in Zurich, I thought it worthwhile to advise you to not disdain to treat him with your usual kindness. For he is seized with a great desire to see you, especially, and also Rudolf Gwalther and Theodor Bibliander, saying he would never visit any city with greater pleasure than Zurich, which, besides many and indeed great ornaments of the city and its people, nourishes men endowed with such diverse erudition and known to the whole world, with whom he himself would like to delight and be counted among friends, certainly even patrons, if possible. You will surely grow fond of the man, my Bullinger, once you have thoroughly observed him.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, April 29, 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a man not only of exceptional piety but also most learned and pious, his most esteemed lord.</p>
