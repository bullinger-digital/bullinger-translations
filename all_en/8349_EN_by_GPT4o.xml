      <p>Greetings. The same person who delivered my letter to you, Mr. Pisanus, a most courteous man, also delivered yours to me. Together with Bilioneus, I offered my services to him and did my utmost, motivated by your recommendation, which, as is fitting, held great weight with me.</p>
      <p>Nor will I fail Bilioneus in the future, provided he wishes to make use of my services. And so much for that. I am surprised that you did not also send something to Mr. Haller when you wrote to me.</p>
      <p>Everything is peaceful here; I would write to you about what is happening in the assembly if I thought you were unaware. Mr. Haugo, whom you wish to be greeted with your words, passed away some time ago, as I have written to you more than once. Hoser is quite well, except that old age, which is a disease in itself, is troublesome to him; he sends you his affectionate greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most courteous Mr. Bullinger, and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, August 12, 1570.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most courteous and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, and foremost friend.</p>
