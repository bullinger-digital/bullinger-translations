      <p>Greetings. Let the sign of my occupations be that I write this hastily and in my own hand.</p>
      <p>The fleet of the Genoese, having entered the port with great difficulty, which is under their control, has not yet disembarked the soldiers, as they are waiting for more troops and the leader Doria himself. Lord Ferdinand, with a large force of cavalry gathered from all sides, is preparing an expedition into some part of Piedmont. The preparations indicate that he intends to besiege some town. There has been unrest these days in Transylvania. The Turks are angered because a certain pasha named Campso was intercepted by Ferdinand's forces. I also hear that the envoys have returned from Constantinople without success. The envoys of the kings of Denmark and Poland have arrived there.</p>
      <p>The commissioners, as they are called, of Duke August and Margrave Albrecht himself are also present, because the rightful embassy belongs only to the kings. Nothing has yet been decided about peace. The Emperor has sent Schwendi, that good man, to the Margrave to disrupt it. The Caesarians would gladly have provided the cause for this tumult. Farewell. Chur, 10th of November.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>If it seems to you that it is necessary to write to Lord Vergerius, you will inform him in my name that I am no less concerned about those matters which he so earnestly commends to me, as if they pertained to me personally. As soon as I receive something clear and certain, I will send someone to convey it to him with dedicated effort; in the meantime, my warmest regards to him. I do not write to him, as he can be informed of all matters through you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend.</p>
