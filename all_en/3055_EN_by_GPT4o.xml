      <p>Although there was no new subject for writing, except what you will soon understand in a few words, I am compelled to somewhat break off the letter due to inconvenient health; for in these four days, dysentery has been very troublesome to me and now grants little relief. An Italian, who moved here with his family, asked me a month ago whether he could obtain citizenship with you, even though he does not reside in your jurisdiction. For he does not wish to change his place of residence nor does he desire to become your citizen for any other reason, except to comply with his brothers, who think it would be unpleasant for him to have moved here. I wanted to clearly testify to this so that you would not think he is cunningly seeking something; he is, however, a man of integrity and good reputation. I ask you, venerable brother, as soon as the opportunity arises, to inform me about this matter. I am glad that recently a certain doctor, Jakob Andreae, a pious and moderate man not alien to us, was called with Sulzer to reform the Duchy of Baden. Certainly, from Sulzer's letters, I understand that his presence was very useful.</p>
      <p>Farewell, distinguished man and brother to be respected by me. Diligently greet all the fellow ministers in my name. May the Lord always guide, protect, and bless you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 29, 1556.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man and brother to be respected by me, and most upright fellow minister, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
