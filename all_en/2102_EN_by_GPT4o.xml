      <p>Greetings. Lord Baionensis sends to us, instructing us to write to you, as he intends to send our letters along with his to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we write, even if there is nothing significant to write; yet we write this very thing. We can also add this: Johannes Angelus Ricius is still lingering here, and we do not know what he is waiting for; for he has already received a response from our Confederates, which was not to his liking. However, our lords are still expecting another response from him, which he claims he will bring from the Emperor and Don Fernando. We do not know what you might say: that Ricius uses me, Philipp, as his scribe for translating his letters from Italian into German, which he presents to the Confederates, and so far we have served him in this. - Do not trouble yourself as a petitioner for my son; for I will send him to Basel at my own expense. I can support him there for half a year; meanwhile, if anything happens, let us give thanks to God. - It seemed unworthy to report to your ears and those of all honorable men the disgraceful act of our Bishop of Chur; we tell you this in confidence. A butcher here was called by the bishop to slaughter a cow for him, which had given birth to a calf the day before and seemed to be on the verge of dying.</p>
      <p>The butcher replied to the bishop, having seen the cow first, that he did not want to perform this act; otherwise, he would be deprived of his butchering duties. When the bishop could not persuade the butcher, he ordered his cellarer and cupbearer to skin the cow, cut it up, and bring the meat to the castle, because it had been slaughtered in the loft near the cowshed where it had given birth. This is publicly spoken of and testified by the butcher about him. Since we had nothing else, we send this; consider it kindly. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man, and continue to love us perpetually. From Chur, on the 7th of December, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
