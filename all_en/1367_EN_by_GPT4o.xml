      <p>Excellent father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Since some business matters were left to me here by those Italians who traveled as far as Geneva, and since I have now completed everything and need to inform them of all matters, I have given this letter to your kindness to be delivered to them when they return to Zürich. Yesterday, we received news from a certain nobleman from Lucca, a very dear friend of Peter Martyr Vermigli from Florence, that Peter Martyr has exchanged life for death, or (to speak more accurately) death for life, and you can be certain that this is true. We had heard the same thing for a long time and had received letters, yet we did not believe it; but now we believe and know for certain. For that nobleman came from Antwerp and spoke with another nobleman from Lucca, as if he were Peter Martyr's brother. He was in England and reported that he is now dead. Certainly, it is untimely for such pillars of the church to depart from the world (I speak according to human understanding); but we hope in God, who continually raises new ones. We are all well in the Lord and have heard that you are well in the same way, and we rejoice. Please greet the brothers in my name. Basel, August 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Girolamo Massari.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent and faithful minister of the word of God. Zürich.</p>
