    <p xml:id="regest1">That he did not write earlier should not make them doubt his appreciation. He praises the confession to the doctrine of the Trinity that they sent; in Zurich, they have recognized Carolis' true nature and never believed his suspicions, and the pastors of Bern have reported on the matter several times. He recommends the bearers of the letter, students from England, and asks to provide them with accommodation. They are wealthy: Nicholas Eliott is studying with a royal scholarship, John Butler and Nicholas Partridge at their own expense.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>That I have not written to you until now, brothers in the Lord to be honored, is not because I love you less. For I have always loved the rare gifts of God in you and you yourselves as faithful ministers of Christ, and I have held you in high esteem. May the Lord grant that through your ministry you may win many to Christ the King, and continue to be faithful ministers in the kingdom of Christ. Your confession, which you sent to the Church of Z端rich, made concerning the Holy Trinity, pleased me greatly, nor have I heard anyone among us who was displeased with it. No one believes the slanderers. We have learned who Carolus is. Would that he understood the things that are of peace and the glory of God. The brothers in Bern have written to us about this matter many times. May the Lord scatter and bring all discord into harmony, and overturn the plans against the truth and those devoted to the truth, invented by Satan. The men who bear this letter are English. They come to you for the sake of seeing Calvin and Farel. They have lived with us in Z端rich for a whole year and several months. How they have conducted themselves will be shown to you by the commendation given to them by us. What more can I say? They are holy and learned men who seek God and truth from the heart. Therefore, do not fail these excellent brothers. I would wish for them to be provided with some quiet place through you where they could stay. For they wish to hear you for a time and to attend to piety. May they therefore obtain a suitable lodging. They are otherwise wealthy, born to honorable and noble parents. Mr. Nicholas Eliott lives on a royal stipend, the other two, Mr. John Butler and Mr. Nicholas Partridge, at their own expense. I have no doubt that you will do a most pleasing thing to God if you show them all kindness. If my prayers have any influence with you, then please hold these most holy men in high regard. Live, farewell, and pray for the Church of Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Z端rich, 1st of November 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Mr. G. Farel and Mr. John Calvin, most dear brothers, ministers of the Church of Geneva.</p>
