      <p>S. P. How much, most learned Bullinger, can mountains and rivers, which separate our companionship and conversation, affect us? It takes a year before letters are delivered; for your writings were returned in the summer of the previous year after the Ides of January. At that time, I was tossed by great waves, and this Pauline saying seemed very true: the last days will be perilous. Such is the cunning of men now, such is the artifice, that you could truly say that Satan has poured all his poison into men; for besides the mind eager to harm, there is the care and agility of harming, while one detracts, another testifies, acts like a Corycian, another betrays with a finger saying: this one is from the exiles, this one washes his hands like Pilate.</p>
      <p>Now I feel like exclaiming: oh the cares of men, oh how much emptiness there is in things. I abstained from books the whole winter, while I take care of myself, and furthermore, Claudius Frontius has the homilies of Maximinus and Ephrem in his hands because of my daily occupations; but he is sometimes forced to omit them, struck by the captivity of some studious and pious men, who were recently summoned before the Dolan senators; they were secretly examined by the Franciscans, Gaucher and Henry and some other Spaniard of the same ilk. What fate awaits them, I do not know, I certainly fear for them; they await their sentence and the tyrannical souls have incurred the gravest hatred of the people for the captivity of one, and by begging from door to door, they return to their nests, which they have built like royal palaces for themselves, burdened not with meat or candles nor bread, but with reproaches and insults, living on the idle and foreign labor of others.</p>
      <p>Sachetus, Paulinus, and Rutyus, the unlearned canons of Salins, noted down some articles from my books, which they were preparing to present to the Dolan senate, but they were restrained by some nobles, who sent these articles to me. Let the people strive to hate every sin more than anxiously counting the committed ones, nor is it necessary to run to the priest repeatedly; it is enough for the one confessing to God to have conceived a certain purpose of life, to approach the priest when the time invites, meanwhile serving God with a quiet conscience. It is established that the church is burdened with a multitude of festivals against ancient custom; there are many provincial ones, many of which can be omitted, nor will the bishops be reluctant to grant this. The Blessed Virgin has enough festivals; we read nothing certain about her nativity, and therefore it can be omitted, just as with the presentation; the visitation is remembered on the nativity of John the Baptist; a similar festival is the chair of Peter, about which we read nothing. It is expedient to remove all modulated songs from the temples, which burden the church more than adorn it, organs should be used sparingly, but moderately, not imitating thunder and cannons, which incite more to frenzy than to piety. The expenses by which these are maintained can be transferred to support good preachers. No one should be forced to invoke the saints; but it should be inculcated in everyone that neither adoration nor veneration is appropriate for anything devoid of reason. It is easy to admonish the people that only God is to be adored. Fictional arguments or uncertain miracles should not be painted in the temple, like the Virgin pierced by seven swords or the nine falls of Christ and the trunk raised affixed to the lowest garment and the plucked hair and the face taken with clay. Christopher carrying Jesus on his shoulders, George the knight slaying the dragon, the story of Barbara and others of that kind, which either the painters invent themselves or are taken from not very faithful histories. Indulgences and the filth of commissioners are already languishing of their own accord.</p>
      <p>Christians should be admonished to pray more with the mind than with the mouth; for one without the other is hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>However, it would be expedient for no images to be seen in the temple. Outside the temple, in the cloisters, the whole life of Christ could be painted in order with figures of the Old Testament aptly accommodated.</p>
      <p>They added that in many other things I subscribe to the Theology of the young.</p>
      <p>In my poems, I praise some who are hated by the monks and attack those who are dear to them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in my little book of prayers, there are some things that are inexplicable. They were preparing to present these and other similar things to the Dolan senate; but they were forbidden by letters from some nobles to attempt anything against me, but to send the described articles to them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my teacher, and cherish the disciple you have who is most observant of you. Frontinus and all the friends you have here, both many and singular, greet you. Given at Nozereth the day before the Ides of June in the Christian year 1554.</p>
      <p>I send the flowers of almost all theologians, a little book of narratives, and some other small things, among which are English. My little sister Artanda repeatedly asked me to greet you reverently in my letters in her name; she is daily engaged in the Old and New Testament, in your book on faith, in the method, all of which speak in our common language through me. Moreover, my mother ordered many greetings to be added. Please consider our small gifts, namely, small ones, with your usual kindness.</p>
      <p>Gilbert Cousin, most devoted to your name. I do not respond to your later letters, because they are not at hand; for I have sent all my papers to Savoy. I send some trifles, I do not know which, so that they may be safe with you, and I beg that they not be brought forth before the time, lest we provoke a race of men most ready to speak ill.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, truly the highest theologian, his uniquely esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
