      <p>I returned home safely, where everything is well, thanks to God. All is quiet; I only see the minds of all the princes prepared to support Albrecht of Brandenburg, lest he be completely oppressed, for which reason they are organizing a meeting.</p>
      <p>The matter is still pending, and we cannot know for sure whether we will have the Diet of Augsburg this summer. I am very afraid that good Colin will be deceived; his son Theodor is acting as a servant, wasting time, and will nevertheless be forced to pay 30 florins. But this is not enough; his host burdens him, as if he were wasting time elsewhere; but this is not the case. However, I would not want to seem to cause trouble here; but charity compelled me to write these few things to you. Listen, his host, in recent days, when he was scolding Theodor, called him a heretic, namely as a Z端rcher, oh highest God, from here people think they are evangelical. The booklet, which will be given to you by Laurentius, was not composed by me (though augmented), which I say so that you know I will not be involved in those trivial arguments in the future, although they do provoke and provoke in such a way that the Augsburg magistrate warned the bookseller not to bring in my books anymore; the papacy feels somewhat agitated by me and cannot bear me and will grieve more (as I hope).</p>
      <p>Bassafontaneus received me honorably, so that he did not let me go without a gift.</p>
      <p>"Take," he said, "a small gift for your journey, because I see you spend much," and he gave 30 crowns. I wish, when you write to him, you would opportunely add a word and say "Vergerius praises your generosity to me." I am thinking of establishing a library for myself soon, since I see the heavenly Father is not lacking to me. In the meantime, I pray to God to urge you and Gwalter so that you are compelled to the Thermae of Ferinas. Oh, I wish; I would add myself as a companion, even if I am not sick. Farewell, brother, pray for me. I send greetings to the whole family. T端bingen, June 15, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>In the booklet, which will be given to you by the Cremonese, it will be very ridiculous throughout Italy; for Gerardus Busdragus is known everywhere as the inquisitor and persecutor of all the worst. Therefore, I attributed the book to him; for he is such that he cannot speak better. But at least see the last reading, in which there is much about Julius III, the antichrist, and I beg you, Heinrich Bullinger, to endure with a calm mind, so that I may at least sometimes agitate those devils, when I rest from more serious studies.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Z端rich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
