      <p>What duty could have been rightfully demanded of me before, now the occasion invites me to fulfill; however, the sudden arrival and departure of the courier, and the lack of time, do not allow me to do as I should and as I would like. Therefore, please excuse the brevity and negligence in writing with your paternal kindness at this time. A bundle of letters came to me, with mine included, from Mr. Abel, which I send to your piety through this trustworthy man from Z端rich, who is not unknown to you. The other one you were asking for I have not yet had the chance to see; however, I have diligently searched for it both for my sake and yours and especially for others, and I still do not cease to inquire. They say that the coachman handed it over to someone at the sign of the wild man's cave.</p>
      <p>What happened to it after that, I do not know.</p>
      <p>If they fall into my hands, which I despair of after such a long interval, I will make sure, with God's will, that they reach you. And this is the first occasion that has prompted me to write to you, most honorable man.</p>
      <p>The second is the illness or death of our Frenschami: if he lives, that you, according to your custom, may raise the fallen man by consoling, encouraging, and helping him; whose advice he always greatly valued, and if I am not mistaken, even now half-dead and breathing his last, he will listen: if he is dead, that you may embrace the dead man with the care that befits him resting in the bosom of Abraham or rather Christ. Both I and Mr. Fox wish to hear in what state his affairs are, that is, whether he has died or is still alive: so that we may be present in body if necessary, or absent in prayers; if not, that we may at least accompany the funeral of our dearest friend with a pious tear.</p>
      <p>The third thing I wanted, namely to thank you for your kindnesses to me and others (when I lived in Z端rich with mine), I will defer to another opportunity. In the meantime, I commend your piety and holy labors to the Lord, who directs both our reborn church and yours, long confirmed, with His holy spirit, and advances all things honest, pious, and holy. Amen.</p>
      <p>June 23.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Laurence Humphrey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and honorable man, the Antistes of the Z端rich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. In Z端rich.</p>
