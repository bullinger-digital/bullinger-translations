      <p>Most Reverend Father,</p>
      <p>When recently, after one or two meetings with the French envoy, I discovered that he was not a bad man, and in the meantime, Mr. Coignet had commended his integrity and prudence in his letters to me, I began to discuss some matters with him a little more freely. The topic of the Zurichers was also mentioned.</p>
      <p>There, he presented his arguments on his behalf.</p>
      <p>I, who could not obscurely grasp your opinion, raised certain points that are usually brought into controversy. Then, after more serious discussion, he jotted down his thoughts on a note, which he also read aloud.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, he urged me to write the same to you and Mr. Gwalter.</p>
      <p>I refused to do this, because I said that in such a serious matter it was not my place to interpose my judgment, lest I seem to want to prescribe something to such great men by this very act. He, on the other hand, said that he would indeed write these things to you, if he was assured that his name would not be made public by you, because he wanted it to be concealed, lest the Five Cantons, with whom he had dealings, rage against him as they had previously against Mr. Coignet, since this action with the Zurichers would not be so pleasing to them. I replied that we have been accustomed to dealing with the greatest matters among ourselves in good faith; therefore, I do not doubt that you would take into account the person and the legation. He wrote his letter as if it had been sent to you from France by another, so that it could be shared with the other ministers of the church, which he indeed desires, but with his name suppressed. He asks that, after deliberation, you may deign to write a response, and since I mentioned your occupations, he said it would not be unpleasant for him to hear your opinion from Mr. Gwalter, with whom he also discussed everything at length.</p>
      <p>He solemnly affirms that Mr. Calvin, now dying, wished for nothing more than that the Zurichers and Bernese would agree to this alliance and grant this favor to the miserable and afflicted churches in France. Therefore, he earnestly implored me to take on the task of transmitting his letter to you; thus, you should understand that I have done this. I prescribe nothing to your piety and prudence; however, I pray to God that He may guide your counsels and lead them to some desired and salutary end for the church. - I have nothing new.</p>
      <p>The envoy of Philipp is expected.</p>
      <p>I have not re-read; thus / as? it had to be sealed suddenly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man and reverend father. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalter.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
