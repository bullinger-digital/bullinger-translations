      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear sir, we have received your recent letter with gracious willingness. We graciously inform you in response, firstly, that regarding the desertion of the Magdeburg soldiers, which happened recently, the officers and leaders, as we are informed, are innocent. We expect that the matter is not as bad as it seems and that we will soon hear better news.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you write to us about the unity of faith in England; it is not only pleasing to hear but also a great joy from the bottom of our hearts that the holy gospel and the saving word of God are not entirely suppressed, but rather in other places, where gratitude may be greater than among us Germans, will bear fruit and be accepted. May Almighty God keep us steadfast in His knowledge and true faith until a blessed end, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the Turkish attack in Transylvania, which is said to have been so powerful and to have taken many captives, we consider it to be somewhat significant, but not as dreadful as reported. The Count of Arch has been dispatched with some companies of soldiers to Hungary.</p>
      <p>However, regarding the Emperor along with the Prince, his son, remaining in Augsburg because of the Council of Trent, we have credible reports that the mentioned Prince intends to travel to Spain and will soon move to Augsburg. As you also mention in your letter, that Ferdinand is said to have handed over Parma to the King of France, this has been written to us several times, so it is likely to be true.</p>
      <p>We have heard from Bersio and others about the situation of those from Constance, and where they are being forced to go because of their faith. Truly, it is a pity to have compassion for their severe oppression, to pray for them, and to take it as an example, and it is to be lamented that these good people should now be helpless for a long time and remain so, etc.</p>
      <p>We did not want to hide this from you out of gracious intention. Dated Basel, the 8th of April, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear sir Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
