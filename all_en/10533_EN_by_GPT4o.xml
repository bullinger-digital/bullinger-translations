    <p xml:id="regest1">Moved from Paris to Strasbourg. The reasons were: on one hand, the high cost of living, on the other, the unbearable sight of violence. This tyranny was caused by some reckless individuals who had publicly posted an anti-mass writing in Paris, Orléans, etc. The writing is said to have been authored by Farel and an Augustinian and printed in Neuchâtel. Since the outbreak of the persecutions, over 300 people have been arrested and countless others have been issued arrest warrants. Torture, punishment, and execution are being carried out in previously unknown ways. However, only 10 people have been burned; the parliament is awaiting the king's return and his judgment. He set out on his journey because he did not want to witness the ugliness and because he found travel companions. Before these events, Bullinger's writings were eagerly bought and praised [in Paris]. But now all [reformational] literature has been burned or thrown into the Seine. He and a learned Spaniard escaped difficulties only with the help of the bishop's deputy [René du Bellay], after their landlord discovered their books. The latter is now himself imprisoned. However, they dare not do anything against his brother [Jean du Bellay], the evangelical-minded bishop. There are still a few thousand evangelicals. Even Budé is entirely on the reformed side. Johannes Fries remained in Paris. Account of his expenses. Peter Kolin and Andreas Wingarter helped him out. Wingarter is with a noble Frenchwoman in Strasbourg, as his activity, the import of "Lutheran" books, had been discovered. His wife is still being held. The judges will decide on the confiscation of his goods and books. Bullinger should inform Froschauer of this. He asks that Peter Kolin, who generously helped them out of his scholarship, be satisfied. He hopes for generosity and reminds Bullinger of his promise at their departure not to abandon them in case of further need. He is staying at Bucer's house, who is expected back from Marburg in the next few days. He would like to devote himself to Hebrew studies during his time in Strasbourg. They [the scholarship holders] hope that Bullinger's goodwill and protection will remain with them. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I came to Straßburg on the fifth day before the Ides of December, having left Paris, both because I was incurring greater expenses daily and because I could not bear to witness such tyranny, which I believe you have already heard about. As for literature, our Germany seemed to yield nothing to the French. But if you have already heard about such great disturbances and the beginning of a tragedy, you may skip this; if not, read on. Some reckless individuals posted pamphlets written in French, reportedly printed in Neuchâtel. Many attribute them to Farel and a certain Augustinian monk. The theme was against the abuse of the mass and the denial of the presence of the body in the Eucharist. On the same night, they were posted in Paris, Orléans, or Geneva, and on the door of the royal chamber. Hence the beginning of the war. Countless were captured. Rumor has it about three hundred and more. They are tortured in new and unheard-of ways, burned, their tongues are torn out, their hands are cut off. Moreover, the names of countless to be captured are listed on certain tables. But two students came to us here four days ago, having escaped from France, and a certain most noble woman with her servants and nobles. They say only ten have been burned so far, the king is coming to Paris, and his judgment, with such a number of captives, is awaited by the senate. I, having found suitable travel companions, departed so as not to see or hear such dire and atrocious things. Before these events arose, all the pious embraced your writings in a wonderful manner, eagerly bought them, and praised you most honorably and greatly. But in this time, when almost every house was searched, all the works of the pious were partly given to Vulcan, partly thrown into the Seine. A learned Spaniard and I, having many, were finally discovered by our host, who would not bear it otherwise unless the matter was referred to some ecclesiastic who would absolve us. We managed to have it dealt with by the bishop's brother, then his vicar and a supporter of the gospel. Thus we escaped. But now he himself is detained, for they dare nothing against his brother, the Bishop of Paris, although they know him to be evangelical. Thus all the persecutors are "with clamor and noise," but we hope and partly know that some thousands of those holding to orthodoxy "are silently breathing anger." You should not doubt Budé either. He is entirely ours with the most learned. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>Fries was not ready for the journey at this time. For both a swelling and inflammation of his leg hindered him, then he struggled somewhat with a fever and held a good part of the French language, which would not have been in vain for him on the journey, and he made fewer expenses than I did. Although, may I not live if I could have been more frugal. I bought not a few and most excellent books. I hope they will be sent to me here soon. I was away for almost two years. I paid 26 crowns for the annual portion - as they call it. I spent much on the first journey to Paris, then to Bourges, and repeating the same journey here to Straßburg. And lest I be more troublesome by recounting clothes, books, and whatever is required for necessities: You may believe that the same true account of expenses is given by me as by Pericles to the Athenians. If you compute a bushel of wheat for a crown, the stipend for the year will be twenty-five crowns, as I indeed compute. I spent 65 crowns in these two years. I received 50 francs, that is 22 crowns with a teston, as they call it, from Peter Kolin of Zug, 9 crowns from Andreas Wyngartner, 14 from you when departing, and you sent ten. Perhaps I spent these crowns beyond my portion in this whole two years.</p>
      <p>Andreas Wyngartner is with a certain noble Frenchwoman in Straßburg. They discovered that he brought in Lutheran books. His wife is detained, the confiscation of goods and books is in the hands of the judges. You will inform Froschauer of this.</p>
      <p>We ask again and again that Peter Kolin be satisfied. For he generously and liberally allowed us to use his stipend. We hope you, with your humanity, will not act so harshly with us. And you too, if you remember, promised those departing that if anything beyond the portion was needed, you would not fail us.</p>
      <p>I live here in Bucer's house, whom we expect to return from Marburg soon. While I am here, I will devote myself to Hebrew letters. You are our only and greatest hope. For you can. Therefore, we implore you again and again not to let us be deprived of your love, benevolence, and patronage.</p>
      <p>Send greetings to all your fellow ministers and my teachers Ammianus and Collinus, then to all the students, my uncle, my mother, and Mr. Johann Fricius.</p>
      <p>In Straßburg, in Bucer's house, December 27, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your servant, Konrad Geßner.</p>
