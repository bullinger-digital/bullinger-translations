      <p>Greetings. Together with my whole family, I am living well and in peace. These days I was in Bern. There, I presented both your letters and mine to the most illustrious senate, and after they were read, they were grateful for my affairs being honorably settled with three crowns; indeed, they gave me so much, over which my lord and dearest Haller, a senatorial man, the city's treasurer Sulpicius Haller, could not marvel enough, and he ordered me to send you many greetings. He was not in the senate while my case was being discussed. I give thanks to my lord God, who does not allow me to be overly troubled by temporal matters; through Him, I have learned to be both rich and poor; each fate embraces me equally.</p>
      <p>In you alone have I learned so far how well the Lord wishes for me; to Him alone be praise and honor in the age. I wrote to Lord Georg Subeker about how much salary I receive annually; he can inform you about this matter whenever you ask. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord, most excellent patron; greet your wife in the Lord, who is dear to me, along with your whole family, as courteously as possible from me.</p>
      <p>Given in Lenzburg in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius, in the Lord as always yours.</p>
      <p>The nobleman from Hallwyl, having seen your letters about me, treated me very kindly by promising all his efforts, as far as I judge, he is a very good and pious man. Hermann the scribe, a lover of truth and innocence, sends many greetings. To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, my lord brother and dearest old friend.</p>
