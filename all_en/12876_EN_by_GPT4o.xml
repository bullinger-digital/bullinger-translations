    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius' letter from February 6 [No. 2797] has been received well. Myconius can be reassured, as it is not true that the Five Places are demanding the extradition of Rudolf Gwalther and Bullinger. On January 29, they were summoned before the Council of Two Hundred. There, they were read the complaints that the Five Places had presented at the last Baden Diet [on January 10], according to which Gwalther, with the publication of his "Endtchrist," had violated the Second Peace of Kappel and the regulations for printers. Gwalther extensively explained his reasons for the publication and presented its content. Bullinger explained, among other things, why he, as the person responsible for censorship, allowed the publication of the writing. Afterwards, the council ordered them to go home without worry and to continue preaching the Gospel as before; the matter would be amicably resolved with the Confederates. Thus, no extradition was demanded, but a punishment for the troublemakers and spreaders of the booklet. So, no worries! The Lord will support the truth and its defenders. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Constance is so far (true to its name) steadfast, although some influential people are urging the city to surrender. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] The news about an alleged victory of Landgrave Philip of Hesse is not true, for it is rather said that he has dismissed his troops and is listening to the advocates of reconciliation with Emperor Charles V. Bullinger cannot believe the last part of this news! Should it nevertheless be true, then Philip, who is also only human, would be disappointed. Only the God of truth can be trusted. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] It is considered certain that the Turkish Sultan Suleiman intends to march against [Christendom]. God protect us! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] If the news of Myconius' fatal illness is true and God should call him to Himself, it would indeed be a painful loss for the Church, but also a blessing for him, as the example of [the Judean King] Josiah shows, who, because he died, no longer had to witness how the Jews had to suffer for their sins. [Bullinger and Myconius] have clearly pointed out the blasphemous state of the corrupt society, which will not remain unpunished in the long run. Bullinger already knows that the faithful Myconius would rather continue to support the endangered Church. But if the gracious Father calls him to Himself, then he must follow His voice. As long as he still lives, he should commend the Church to the Lord and ask Him not to destroy it in His wrath, but to chastise it fatherly and protect it from the Antichrist and his deceptions. The people of Zurich will, for their part, ask God to strengthen Myconius' faith and grant him patience and victory, so that after the destruction of this corrupt world, he may finally behold the face of the Lord (which David already longed for) and rejoice forever with all the redeemed. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings, also from the colleagues! May the Lord lead Myconius to eternal life! </p>

      <p>S. D. I received your letter, dearest brother, dated February 6. You ask whether it is true what they told you, that the Five Places are demanding the extradition of Gwalther and me. They did not tell the truth, my brother. Here is how the matter stands: On January 29, Gwalther and I were summoned by the Senate and the deacons. The complaints of the Five Places, presented at the last Baden Diet, were read to us. We were ordered to respond to them. The complaint was that Gwalther had written a booklet against the articles of peace, calling it the Antichrist, and that it was published against the accepted laws prescribed to printers. Gwalther spoke at length in his defense, explaining why and how he wrote that book. I showed many reasons why I allowed it to be published, as I am in charge of the press and reviewing books. I also said many other things that seemed relevant to the present matter, pertaining to the defense of truth and printing. After hearing everything, the deacons unanimously ordered us to return home and be of calm mind, to continue proclaiming the evangelical truth as before; they would amicably resolve the matter with the Swiss. But no one from the Swiss demanded either Gwalther or me, but they demanded punishment for the violators of peace and those who spread such a booklet, etc. I hope the matter will turn out well. Therefore, I urge you to be of secure mind in the Lord. We fear nothing from the adversaries. We know the Lord will not forsake the truth and its defenders.</p>

      <p>Constance still beautifully lives up to its name and stands firm, although it is being urged by influential men to defect. Let us pray that the Lord preserves it.</p>

      <p>I have no doubt that the news about the victory of Hesse that reached you is false. For we hear that Hesse, having dismissed all his soldiers, is listening to those who advise reconciliation with the Emperor. However, I cannot believe this last part about the noble prince. But if they speak the truth and man is deceived, yet He whom we trust and rely on, the God of truth, will not deceive!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is certain that the Turk is preparing for war and will come against us. May the Lord protect us.</p>

      <p>I hear, my brother, that you are gravely ill with a deadly disease. If what I hear is true, I grieve that you will be taken from us. I grieve that the church will be deprived of its pastor. Yet I also congratulate you on your greatest happiness. For if the Lord calls you from this world, He will do with you as He once did with His beloved King Josiah, whom He took away so that his eyes would not have to see the terrible evils that the Jews were to suffer because of their sins, ingratitude, and treachery. We all know what our morals are like, what our pursuits are, indeed each of us points out and cries out that the most wicked state of all, of both orders and states, cannot go unpunished for long. Therefore, the most just Lord will come and visit our iniquities, when many mock the preached repentance. And here I know well, your faith and charity desire to be present with the endangered church and to experience all adversities and hardships. But if the Lord calls you, you must follow Him who calls, the Lord of all things and the most gracious Father, indeed to be praised, who frees you from innumerable evils. However, while you live, commend the church, entrusted to your faith until now, to the Lord. Pray that He, having mercy on it and all of us, does not destroy us in His wrath, but chastises us gently and fatherly, and preserves us in His truth and holy will, protecting us from the Antichrist and all his deception. We will pray that He strengthens you in true faith, grants you patience and victory, so that, having shed the sinful flesh, having trampled this muddy world and overcome all evils, you may see Him, to whom David, sighing, prays: "You will make known to me the path of life; fullness of joy is in Your presence and pleasures at Your right hand forever." May the Lord Jesus, our life and resurrection, who took upon Himself our sins and washed them away, indeed abolished them, therefore died, and by rising again brought back life, keep you in His eternal kingdom, where we will soon be gathered and rejoice and exult forever in the presence of our God with all the saints!</p>

      <p>Farewell forever, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother! May the Lord Jesus, through the merit of His holy passion, lead you into eternal life! Zurich, February 26, 1547. All the brothers greet you. Your Bullinger. To the most illustrious man, Lord Oswald Myconius, his esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
