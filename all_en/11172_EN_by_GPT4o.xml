    <p xml:id="regest1">He has learned with joy from his letter as well as from Bucer's account about the outcome of the Zurich meeting. Reports on the discussions during the visit of Bucer and Grynaeus in Konstanz. Requests a more detailed report on the negotiations and the communication of the confessional texts that are to form the basis of the concord. Recommends [Sigmund?] von Landenberg, who has traveled to Zurich together with Joachim [Maler] to reach the council. Inquires about the reasons for the dismissal of Farel and Calvin; Ambrosius [Blarer] suggests recommending the two to Georg [of Württemberg]. Greetings. Asks about the lepers he recommended.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I was more delighted recently than I can express, dearest Bullinger, when I heard from your letters about the well-settled matter of your assembly. Bucer himself reported the same to me, whom I have most earnestly exhorted to be more at ease towards you, which I believe he will do.</p>
      <p>As for us, as you desire to know, nothing has been done, nor has Bucer attempted anything; he only excused himself before a few gathered for that purpose, saying that he had done nothing in the whole business of concord with a bad conscience and without orders.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus also added a few things, explaining how he had once resisted, and then how he was led to this opinion. We responded only amicably and in such a way as to give no occasion for disputes. The entire conversation barely lasted two hours. Privately, however, I discussed many things with Bucer, so that I hope his visit to us was not without fruit. The presence of Grynaeus, however, was most welcome to all of us.</p>
      <p>I am eager to know what was done with you, especially concerning the main points and topics of the discussion, and in which particular point of contention you were engaged. Then, since you write that the concord was rejected in both the Basel Confession and Exposition, I would like to see both, if possible; I would return them with the first messenger who happens to come. I do not dare to ask for the response to Luther; for I know how faithfully these matters must be handled.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is one thing I wish to obtain from you, however reluctantly you may be burdened by these troubles. Yet, because it sometimes helps to treat anyone more kindly, I also wish you to do so for my sake towards that Landenberg, with whom our Joachim has already set out to you. He has some case before the Zurich council - Joachim knows it -, and since he may now be expecting a decision, he asked me not to hesitate to recommend him to some friend. Therefore, however he may not attack our religion in any way, he is such that I wonder why he asks me for this recommendation. Thus, I would like you to do two things: first, to recommend the case of this Landenberg to Rösti, and if you have any other good ones from the senatorial order; second, to at least greet that nobleman, certainly a man of not bad character, with a single word, and to testify to him my diligence, and then yours as well.</p>
      <p>About Farel and Calvin, I forgot what Bucer recently reported to us; therefore, I would also like to know from you why they were forced to leave Geneva. Our Ambrosius earnestly asks that you recommend them to Duke George. Now farewell, dearest brother, with your mother, wife, children, and all good people. Our consul Thomas and brother Konrad send you diligent greetings. From Konstanz, May 17, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>But what about those lepers whom I recommended to you?</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent pastor of the Zurich church, my dearest lord and brother.</p>
