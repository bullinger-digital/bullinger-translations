      <p>Greetings. I am surprised that you, your brother, and all of you remain so silent amidst so many rumors; for I had hoped to receive some definite news from you by now. I wrote to your brother about the French conflict, which was being talked about, but subsequent rumors bring different news each time. Some claim that Cond√© has been freed again, and this has been privately written here from Geneva. Yesterday, we were informed that Guise has also died from the wounds he received from cannon shots, and I wish this were true! Others assert that Rouen has been occupied by the English; but among so many and such varied rumors, nothing certain is known, so our people have sent to Strasbourg to bring back definite news. I assume you also have the letter from the surviving Swiss captains; nevertheless, I add this to it; you can return it through this messenger; for I have no other copy. We expected that someone from your side would come to the wedding of Theobald Frisching, which took place yesterday; but we were all disappointed in our hope.</p>
      <p>This would have been very pleasing to Steiger the consul and all the relatives. I have nothing else at the moment. Greet your brother in my name along with all yours; for I am not writing to him now. I do not know for what reason this messenger is being sent. Our envoys have not yet returned from Baden; please let me know what is happening there. We have heard that the emperor has crossed to Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Also remind your brother, if he wishes to write anything through this messenger.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and compatriot, to be pursued with perpetual love.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
