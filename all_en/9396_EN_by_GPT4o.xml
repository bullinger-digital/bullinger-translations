      <p>Most illustrious man and honorable father, greetings.</p>
      <p>When I fell into various illnesses in Heidelberg and there was almost no hope left for me to recover my former health, I decided to place myself under the jurisdiction of these lords of Bern, both for the purity of the air and also for the purity of the church, so that I might pursue not only the health of the body but also the piety of the soul. I wanted to inform you, most illustrious father, of this matter, so that if ever my services can be of any use to you and your friends, you may know where I am; for I pursue you with the greatest love and respect as a pillar of the true church of our times. The one who will deliver this letter to you is that Italian who (as he told me), when he left the Babylon of the antichrist, greeted your piety and later went to Geneva, where he stayed for several months and made a pure confession of faith, as appears from the minister's testimony, and since he could not stay longer in that city due to lack of time, he was forced to leave and seek sustenance elsewhere, being ready to live and die not idly in the church of God. He taught philosophy for many years, as he himself says, in Bologna. Therefore, since he has decided to come to you, I wanted to commend him to you, my father, and to urge you that, if you can use his services in any honest matter, you may be willing to provide him with sustenance. This duty will be most pleasing to God and worthy of your piety, as a man exiled for the sake of the word of God is helped, and others who are weak may be more encouraged by such examples to leave superstitions and to join the church of God. I pray to the best and greatest God that He may deign to keep you safe for a long time for the benefit of His church, and I commend myself greatly to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Given at Payerne, 8 days before the calends of August 1573. Your most obedient son in piety, Odoardus Thyenäus, Count of Ciconia.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious minister of the word of God and theologian, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable father, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
