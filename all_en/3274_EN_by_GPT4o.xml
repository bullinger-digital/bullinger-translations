      <p>Greetings in Jesus Christ, who is the true and only salvation.</p>
      <p>Reverend sir, there is no need for you to be anxious about your son Christoph. For there will be nothing so arduous, so difficult, that I would not willingly undertake for your sake, even though I know my abilities are limited. However, I promise that I will do whatever seems necessary for your son's well-being and dignity with as much dedication as you showed in your support and service during my exile. For nothing is more desired than to be recognized with the greatest gratitude, first by you, and then by all others. I assure you that I will not fail in either spirit or diligence.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not want to keep from you that there is a booklet by Doctor Jakob Andreae from Göppingen, a truly magnificent work, which cannot but be most pleasing not only to you but to all learned men. It is highly approved by both Lutherans and Zwinglians (as they are called) and provides an excellent example of clear, true, and solid concord in the matter of the sacraments, so that you would feel he is particularly passionate about this work and dedicated to it with a certain unique spirit. If this booklet has not yet reached you, I would have sent it to you long ago.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that his modesty would be greatly approved by you. May God grant that not only the Papists but also we, from both sides, seek true and solid concord and the unity of the Church. I hear that the Papists are plotting strange things against the true concord of the Church, abusing the foolishness of certain charlatans, so that they would prefer to converse with us with swords and clubs rather than with true and solid arguments, and there are those who threaten war from all sides. But with the Lord protecting us as the apple of His eye, they can do nothing against us.</p>
      <p>Lord von Stetten asks you to ensure that these enclosed letters are presented to Lord Laurentius Agricola (to whom you should convey my greetings) by a certain messenger. I have conveyed your greetings to Lord Held and Milo.</p>
      <p>In the same way, you will greet on my behalf Lord Bibliander and all good and learned men. Hastily, most quickly, Augsburg, August 19, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Ehinger, whom you know. To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and worthy minister of the Church of Zürich, his lord and brother, to be honored with eternal veneration.</p>
