      <p>Greetings. After sealing those of mine, which you see here, my dear Bullinger, I receive, to which I have no time to respond. But I am as grateful as I can possibly be for your little book, which I will read as soon as possible, as I am indeed a distinguished admirer of your writings. If only the king, somewhat moved by this, would somewhat relent in his tyranny! Let us earnestly exhort to mature repentance and free our souls, whether the world listens or not. Let us pray to the Lord for the most afflicted churches of Swabia from the ministers of these exiles, especially since we are almost in the same boat with them, and what they experience today, we will experience tomorrow or the day after with no less severity.</p>
      <p>We await your Antithesis with impatient desire. My household greets you along with Funck. May all yours be well along with your fellow ministers and other friends. Farewell, my soul. November 14, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
