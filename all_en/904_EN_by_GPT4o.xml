      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that my letters have reached you, most esteemed man, in which I have rightly given you great thanks for your diligence, by which you have both preserved and sent back my letters. Furthermore, regarding the controversy that has been debated among our people until now, we hope, I say, that it will finally be completely resolved at the public assembly of the Three Leagues, which is scheduled for June 8th, etc.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the person you see here in person, Anton Stuppa from Bergell, a student and professor of the humanities, approached me, asking that I provide him with a letter of introduction to you, which I neither could nor wished to refuse. He will explain his case himself, and I do not think it necessary to commend him to you at length, since it is well known to all that you are the most faithful patron of all exiles and the needy. Farewell in the Lord our Savior, who may deign to keep you safe for us and for His church for a long time. Amen. Chur, May 12, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed patron.</p>
