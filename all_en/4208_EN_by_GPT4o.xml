      <p>Greetings. If I write rarely, most esteemed sir, attribute it to your occupations, as I do not wish to be a nuisance by interrupting your public duties, not to my own, which are few. For my very small or rather nonexistent service to your son, such great thanks were not necessary and with such great interest, that they far exceed the principal itself. It has been reported that some noble Venetians are traveling to the Baden assembly in disguise, which I do not believe; for what reason would they need to disguise themselves in this matter? Others say that the Venetians have made new treaties with the King of Spain and the Duke of Savoy and have agreed on all disputes. If this is so, those monarchs wanted to buy peace for themselves with their money; they, however, are plotting something. It has been heard, but with uncertain rumor and not yet believed, that Tripoli has been captured with great slaughter and loss of life on both sides. I have no news about our affairs in France and Scotland; for I have not received letters from there for a long time. If your lordship has anything, I would gladly hear from you.</p>
      <p>The Roman Pontiff is devoting his care and effort to promoting and placing his own people in the highest positions; for this is indeed the most important and principal foundation of the seat. Farewell, most esteemed sir, and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>From Haldenstein, February 6, 1561.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your lordship, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
