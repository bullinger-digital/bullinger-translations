      <p>Dearly beloved lord and brother, there is a rumor and talk that you have made Mr. Sebastian Castellio a professor in Lausanne. This greatly surprises me and the other ministers among us.</p>
      <p>It is no less, he is learned; but you should also strive and above all strive for what serves to maintain the unity of the church and its ministers. And consider it a favor that I write this to you; for I do it with good intention, and to prevent future disputes.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I do not hate Castellio at all, as he has never offended me; nor do I wish to have anything to do with him or to quarrel with him. But you know how there are some disputes between those in Geneva and him, and that those in Geneva have their reasons and claims against him, where we think you should have considered the glorious church in Geneva more than his single person, which you could well have done without and could have filled the position in Lausanne in another, more peaceful way.</p>
      <p>For it is to be feared that henceforth there will be little peace and will remain between Geneva and also you, even because of Castellio. And if he were sensible and considered what would follow, he would not have allowed himself to be used in Lausanne and become the subject of disputes. There is otherwise so much discord and incessant quarrel among the ministers that it is to be feared it will eventually end badly. There are also in many parts of France ministers who have a special animosity towards Geneva, and little goodwill towards you, yes, even towards Bern itself, because you have appointed Castellio almost as a provocation to Lausanne. Even if there were no lack in him, one should still consider the unity. We report this not to the detriment of Castellio, but for the good of the matter, as you have well seen in his preface over the Bible, how he goes about the bush, as if he would like to say the truth has not yet come to light: with which proposition all those gladly associate who carry all sorts of strange opinions hidden in their bosom and wait for the time to present their fantasies at an opportune time. And yet those companions in whom this is hidden would show the articles that have not yet come forth and yet are so highly necessary for salvation. For we teach and believe that all that serves for salvation is sufficiently contained in the scripture and has been brought to light in this time. This Castellio is also said, as I have heard, not to have been greatly pleased that Servetus was punished in Geneva with judgment and justice as a blasphemous seducer. He also inserts in his Bible in 2 Corinthians 10, as if no one should be punished for faith, yes, unbelief.</p>
      <p>And that is also the kind of companions who have all sorts of strange opinions hidden in their sack. If he should be of this opinion, you should consider what would follow, that this matter would cause you regret, when all sorts of quarrels and offenses are stirred up, etc. Vergerius has here publicly spoken before honorable people, Castellio flatters the Anabaptists, and he knows one who boasts that he has rebaptized Castellio with his own hand. With free will, he is also said to have had some disputes in Basel, of which I would rather let those speak who understand and know the matter better. But I write all this to you with a trusting good intention, that, since this person is such a contentious person, you look out for yourself in time and strive for peace and not unrest. For what can harm the church more than contentiousness? May God grant us true peace. Amen.</p>
