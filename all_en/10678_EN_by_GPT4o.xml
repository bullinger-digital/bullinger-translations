    <p xml:id="regest1">Has taken in the young man recommended by Bullinger. Confirms the news of the execution of [Thomas] More, but does not believe a rumor spread by Erasmus. Answers Bullinger's question about his activities in Tübingen and the conditions there: Despite the outwardly maintained unity, the church is divided into followers of [Ambrosius] Blarer and [Erhard] Schnepf. Since [Duke Ulrich] was not persuaded to appoint Bullinger, Phrygio has taken Grynäus' place. Grynäus himself is torn between his obligation to the Basel council and the task entrusted to him by the Duke.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received the young man to me, as you instructed, and I hope with as much benefit as one must expect from such talent.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death and demise of More, the situation is as follows. The act is regretted even in the name of the king himself, and I cannot judge what the king intends. If I learn anything certain, it will be reported to you; for I do not believe this rumor, which has been spread by Erasmus. This man does everything to bring our cause into disrepute.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you recently asked, that I should write to you in detail about what was done by me in Tübingen and how things stand there, I have delayed so far because I believed that everything was already known to you. For you often hear about the division in the province into followers of Blaurer and Schnepf. Although these factions are still restrained by either the authority of the prince or the beginnings of the matter itself, so that they do not erupt, it is certain that there is discord in their minds, especially if someone is a little more attentive to the matter; for to the indifferent, everything is the same. I have openly discussed with the prince more than once about calling you, but in vain. So, since I was not allowed to appoint whom I wanted, I appointed Phrygio, who was the only one available, so that there would be someone from us in such a renowned school in my place. I do not know whether I have rightly deserted him. The authority of our council led me, which I follow so far, hoping that the Lord will guide me according to His will. The prince never ceased to request me to be there before it was certain what I thought about the concord. I am between a rock and a hard place all this time. If I give myself to him and the fatherland, I will gravely offend our people, they will think me alien, they will believe my opinion has changed. Therefore, I have never needed the prayers of the pious and good as much as I do now. I want to implore you through Christ the Lord, that you truly pray, so that He may grant me to follow His will in this matter. If it were without offense to our people, no force would hold me back from serving the fatherland in such a distinguished matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Your S. Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
