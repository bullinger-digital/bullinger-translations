      <p>S. D. I hope, dear brother, that you have returned safely from the baths. May the Lord bless you and your companions! I have not written anything for 14 days now; for I have been laid up with a very severe head cold, which flowed continuously for 3 days and nights, so that I could neither sleep nor eat or drink. By the grace of the Lord, however, I have been somewhat restored and today I have begun to preach again. At this time, happy news has arrived about the peace made in France, and indeed good news from our side, as you will hear elsewhere. Letters were written to me from Lyon on August 14th, indicating that it was proclaimed there. This week, the king's letters were also read in the senate, testifying that peace has been made; therefore, there is no reason to doubt. Our neighboring allies are said to be returning soon. Soldiers passed through here, confirming this; but many of them are sick and suffering from dysentery, a just judgment of God. There is also contention between the captains and the king: the king wants to pay wages according to the living and present persons; the captains want to be paid according to the lists, nach den r√∂dlen, so that, just as priests and monks once collected tribute from the dead, the captains may collect the wages of the dead; see the vile greed, etc. Johannes Sylvanus is said to have been captured in Heidelberg, contaminated with Arianism; he received books and pamphlets from Transylvania from those accursed Italians, Blandrata and Alciato, etc., by whom he was subverted. What will happen, we will hear shortly, but we see the arts of Satan casting scandals into the church and hindering the course of the gospel; may the Lord soon subdue him under our feet! The Diet of Speyer has been suspended; the emperor indeed proposed it, but since few or no secular princes were there, it was moved to Augsburg. The proposal is almost entirely about giving and contributing. Now all the time is consumed in preparing for weddings. The emperor brought two daughters to Speyer, the first he married to the King of Spain and has now sent her from Speyer with 27 ships to Antwerp; from there she will go by sea to Spain, and the king in Spain is marrying his sister's daughter; the Pope's dispensation allows this. Let them just marry siblings over each other. O crime, etc.</p>
      <p>The latter he married to the King of France; her bedding and escort are said to be happening now. It is nothing but rejoicing, rejoicing, and the Venetians weeping, weeping, and soon others too. These are the times of Noah and Lot. Greet all our friends in order, especially the consuls, ministers, Pontisella, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>First of September 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about the affairs of the Turks, Venetians, Italians, and Spaniards, etc., share it.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my most honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
