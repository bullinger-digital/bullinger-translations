      <p>Greetings. The day before yesterday, I wrote through that Hungarian.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, yesterday at nightfall, your letter dated February 20th was delivered to me, along with the book by Heshusius and letters pertaining to Calvin. Musculus went through that book last night.</p>
      <p>Now, a messenger from Geneva is conveniently present, to whom I will give all those things to be carried to Geneva. The news we hear about Navarre is sad; may the Lord grant him greater integrity.</p>
      <p>What we have already heard about the meeting at the Alsatian Tabernas, we also had before. Concerning Castalio, I advise you to be of good cheer; there were those who tried to impose him on us, especially the chief secretary, who has some peculiar acquaintance with him; but we intervened in such a way that he withdrew, and we appointed another. Diesbach is again not at home; therefore, you did well to send those novelties to me; I shared them yesterday at dinner with the new treasurer, who had not heard them before and will report to the senate today. He greets you along with Treasurer Haller, with whom we made honorable mention of you at dinner yesterday. Abraham's booklet cannot be printed here, because we do not have a more equipped printer than one who can barely print a page by hand; therefore, it would be better to have it printed with you. You falsely imagine the author to be the father; I know that the son composed it without the father's help and gave it to the father to read, who changed little in it. What do you think of his talent, could he become a distinguished man if he gains experience? I think Musculus himself will write to you about this.</p>
      <p>I will inquire diligently about your son among those skilled in that art and will write to you soon. Now I cannot say more. Therefore, farewell. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 27, 1562.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
