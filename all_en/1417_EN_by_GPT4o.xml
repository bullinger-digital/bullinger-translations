      <p>Most illustrious man, as soon as I came to Raetia, I sent you the book you desired. I hope you have received it; but I will also send another one soon, for it was printed again much later.</p>
      <p>The controversy over the Bishopric of Chur is still ongoing and indeed with great disputes, for which reason I do not live safely in these valleys; for in favor of the Pope, there are many who wish to oppress me, as I see. But God will protect me until I can extricate myself; for I am thinking of coming to you. Indeed, my listeners strongly urge me not to leave anymore, and they promise protection; but I do not dare to entrust myself to them. In short: that faction will easily obtain the bishopric, which has oppressed Vergerius, and therefore the Pope is delaying the matter.</p>
      <p>From Italy, we have heard that Parma has been freed from siege; but I expect more soon and will share everything with you. Ensure that the book against the Council of Trent is translated into your language and that the Pope's oath, adorned with your annotations, is added, which I ask of you. If Mr. Haler has sent you some copies, you may distribute as many as you wish, at your discretion; the rest you will give to my nephews. Soon I will send the translation of your booklet, which pleases me more every hour, and at the same time, I will write something, which I do not dare now, as I do not know if the messenger who will carry these will be the safest. I wish you would send some of those same booklets to England and reveal through your letters who the preacher was. Farewell and be well; pray for me with the whole church. Vicosoprano in Bergell, 28th of September 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I commend to you from my heart my nephews. Soon I will send more money to Mr. Sebastian. Urge them, my Bullinger, to [fulfill...] their duty.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
