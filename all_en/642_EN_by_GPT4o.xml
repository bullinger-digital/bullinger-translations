      <p>Herewith the commission of the Pope, it would be well worth it to have it printed and illustrated with beautiful annotations. Please send it back to me after you have used and read it. It is all such a great disgrace and villainy; if the world were not completely and utterly blind, they should rightfully open their eyes.</p>
      <p>What you write about Thurgau, I believe. The commander has now returned home to Konstanz; what he will now arrange and handle will soon be known.</p>
      <p>He has a brother with him, who has also become a canon in Konstanz; some think there is a serious dispute between the king and the bishop, that they are at odds, and the king, through the canons who are in the city, as the senior part of the chapter and resident in the cathedral church, will want to appoint another bishop and then introduce him to the Confederates everywhere and make him possess what belongs to the bishopric, etc. Then there will have to be new unrest with the parties, and the Confederates will also have to deal with it and see which side they want to support. But God will surely moderate it.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly written this to you otherwise, but since unexpectedly my dear cousin Conrad Zwick is now coming to me and has advised, for reasons, to make a ride to Zurich himself, I have kept this writing entirely, since he can report this and other things to you orally; yet I send it alone, so that you see that I would not want to leave anything I am aware of unreported to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the reconciliation of his and my dear brother, you should speak with him yourself and find out what is most burdensome for him in this matter, which also has not a small significance for me; otherwise, there would be many good and useful reasons for them to be reconciled further. May the faithful God carry out everything for His honor and the good of many others.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my heart and soul in the Lord, to whom I commend myself and mine with pious and perpetual intercessions most diligently, that He may assist our counsels and endeavors with His right and most present divine power, so that we may not deviate even a hair's breadth from the rule of His most perfect will, but relying on solid faith in Christ and with the Holy Spirit as our guide, we may strive straight towards the goal of our heavenly calling. May your house be greeted and eternally flourish with the most gracious blessing of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers and friends. My wife and best sister send their most dutiful greetings to you and yours and commend themselves to your sacred prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell again from Griesenberg on the 13th day before the calends of September.</p>
      <p>My departure from here to Winterthur will be postponed for a while until the house of our Hieronymus is built in such a way that it can be comfortably inhabited by us; for certain reasons, we have decided to rent it.</p>
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär the younger has now written here, earnestly asking me once again to convey to you his very friendly, willing service, love, and loyalty from him; for he holds you dear in his heart; he desires that you pray to God faithfully for him and his wife, children, and household. He is certainly a devout heart and a godly man, as is his wife.</p>
      <p>He writes, among other things, that now a young nobleman, known to him, has come from Prague, claiming that the king in Prague is moving with a considerable army, and Duke Maurice is supposed to come to him with a special army; likewise, a force from the emperor is also supposed to come to them, and the whole move is supposed to go to Prussia. It is also the general rumor in Württemberg that the Spaniards, who are stationed in the country, are supposed to move within 14 days, etc., because of the move to Prussia. But God alone knows the plans and hearts of men!</p>
      <p>The emperor is supposed to be in Cologne now, etc. He claims that some letters are coming, but he gives little credence to them, that the Duke of Brunswick and Margrave Joachim of Brandenburg are supposed to be besieging Magdeburg; but it does not seem credible for reasons.</p>
      <p>He also writes that it is now the common rumor in Württemberg that the emperor has declared war on the French and will attack them vigorously; but he also gives little credence to that. He claims, however, that it is written to him by influential people that there are great dissensions at the court in France, because the constable has all the governance of the whole country in his hands and no lord at the king's court has any power; but the constable has always been good to the emperor, and there is great concern about treachery; for the emperor's practice and highest art lie in the fact that he always achieves his affairs and undertakings through such people. On Corpus Christi, the king had 6 burned in Paris, and there is much persecution against the pious Christians in France.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, it is written that the imperial majesty is supposed to be with the prince in Ghent; they have sworn allegiance to the prince, and all the hereditary lands of the Netherlands are supposed to pay homage to the prince; finally, he is supposed to go to Gelderland and from there into Germany.</p>
      <p>The war between England and Scotland continues on and on and is becoming more and more intense; for Scotland has great help from France. Yet it is generally hoped that Scotland will not be able to endure the war for another year, for the English have the castles and most fertile places of the kingdom of Scotland in their possession and administration, so that in the end they will be forced by hunger and lack of necessary provisions to surrender under the crown of England, under which they have been for a long time before. However, nothing remarkable has been done or accomplished this whole summer between England and Scotland, except for some skirmishes and robberies. On the first of June, the French attempted to fortify and take a bulwark near Boulogne at night, but they were poorly received, so that they carried away 14 wagons full of dead without achieving their goal, etc. Much is still written about England; I assume you have it before me.</p>
