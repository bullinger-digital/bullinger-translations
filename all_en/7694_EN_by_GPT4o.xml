      <p>My friendly greetings with the offering of all honors, love, and goods beforehand, especially to my gracious, honorable, dear lord and good friend. As I have learned that your wine in Zurich has not turned out well in all respects, I hereby send you a small barrel of my produce from Rolle. Please receive it and keep a third part for yourself, and let the remaining two parts be given to my gracious lords Zwingli, Lavater, Haller, and Lord JÃ¶rg Grebel, and that for a good, fortunate, new year. I hereby request to show you, as my especially gracious, dear lord, love and service according to my ability, and hereby commend you faithfully to God Almighty.</p>
      <p>From Bern, December 9, 1568. Your entirely well-wishing Johann Steiger [wrote].</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, honorable, and wise lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the divine word in Zurich, my gracious lord and good friend. Zurich.</p>
