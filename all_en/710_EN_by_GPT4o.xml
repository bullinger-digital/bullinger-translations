      <p>Strasbourg, 16th October 1549.</p>
      <p>Perpetual greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ! Your letters, dear friend and esteemed master Bullinger, have greatly delighted me for two reasons: firstly, because you are well and have not forgotten me, and secondly, because my relative John has been well received among all the good people. I will not need any reminder to meet your expectations. Apart from laziness, nothing will harm the young man; and this ailment, known to you, can be easily remedied. He lived very honorably with me in the past and gave great hope of becoming a good man; I pray to God Almighty that he may become so. The rumor of a new uprising in England is completely false: for eight days ago I received letters from our friend Mr. Richard, dated 18th September in London; also others written in Antwerp on 28th September, in which there was no mention of this, but quite the opposite; namely, that with matters settled in England, the king had decided to send all his forces against the French, to defend Boulogne and to assist those in Boulogne. There is also a rumor that the king has already recaptured the fortifications and defeated the French troops. I wish this were true! But as soon as I find out, you will be informed. The rumor about the English being killed while the French captured the fortresses was false; for I was informed from Antwerp that the French had taken the fortifications through treachery. Regarding the captured cannons, perhaps what was reported was true.</p>
      <p>The rumor of the Emperor coming here is frequent. Nothing certain, except that I heard from a good man that Jacob Sturm was the author of this. The plague is not raging here, but a very acute fever, and I do not intend to move, even if the plague were to come a thousand times.</p>
      <p>As far as I know, nothing unfortunate has happened to Mr. Hooper, but he is very busy confounding Lutheranism (as a trustworthy man wrote to me) and planting the truth. He acts as a vigorous Christian. He lectures publicly in London. He has a large audience. He is praised by all good people.</p>
      <p>Mr. Richard's wife has recovered from a dangerous illness; for a month there was little hope of life. Bucer has also recovered from the fever. But there was almost no hope of life left for Paul, wrote Mr. Richard.</p>
      <p>I ask you to share what seems new to you with Christopher Hales. I am eternally grateful for the favor that he is so well received by you; and please convey my greetings to your entire family along with the group of scholars. I pray that the Lord keeps you safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>After writing these letters and before sealing them, I received letters from Mr. Richard and from Antwerp, in which there was no mention of sedition.</p>
      <p>However, they were dated in London, 27th September; also others in Antwerp, 5th October. Mr. Richard wrote about the Bishop of London, who was taken to prison because he refused to inveigh against the seditious in a sermon, although ordered by royal authority. Please share this with our English friends. Mr. Richard and his wife send their regards to you and your family, whose health is improving daily. The rumor of the Emperor coming to Speyer by the first of December is spread by those who have defected from the faith and place their hope in him.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of London has been deposed from his dignity; he was accused by Hooper and another of his doctrine.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster, my gracious lord and good friend. Zurich.</p>
