      <p>Greetings. Here I am almost overwhelmed by vile and usurious complaints, nor do those whom you suspect admit any reason. We must await the judgment of the judges.</p>
      <p>You rightly guessed about the King of Navarra; for he is at the court in Orléans, but his brother, the Prince of Condé, whom he brought with him, is held captive, and now the Guises triumph. I will remain silent on the rest for now and commend myself to your prayers and those of your friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Payerne, 13th of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, as you know.</p>
      <p>You will inform me about your affairs and diet.</p>
      <p>Many from Orléans have been thrown into prison. The inquisition will continue.</p>
      <p>No mention of the council.</p>
      <p>The Lord is not idle in the meantime.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
