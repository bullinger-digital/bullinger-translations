    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If Enzinas were not aware of his limitations, Bullinger's letter would have completely enchanted him. He would not lack goodwill if he possessed better learning ability. Despite his limitations, however, he was of the opinion that something about the fate [of Juan Diaz] needed to be published. Perhaps Enzinas will have the opportunity again [to do it better]. However, he fears that it will never come to that, as the tyrant [Emperor Charles V] is preparing to suppress and crush the [Protestants]. He already holds the most important cities of the empire. He also receives help from Italy and is forging cruel plans. A victory could only come from heaven! The rumor from St. Gallen about the alleged death of the tyrant thus seems to be false.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Basel, one also hears terrible things about Maurice of Saxony's deceit. If Bullinger knows more about the Emperor or the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, he should share it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enzinas hopes to visit Zurich in about a month. He would have liked to travel there by Christmas, but he is held back by various businesses in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter to St. Gallen and apologize for the disturbance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Also enclosed is a letter [to Bullinger] that Enzinas received from an Italian [Baldassare Altieri?] in Venice, about which he will tell more orally.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would have been enchanted by your letters, if I were not aware of my own limitations. I do not lack the will, if I had the ability to speak equally well. But it will be useful to have a record of this example written in any manner. If a longer life is granted, I will not neglect another opportunity. But I fear that we may all be overwhelmed first, either worn out by the calamities of the church or torn apart by the cruelty of the most wicked tyrant. I hear that he occupies the principal cities of the empire, receives new reinforcements from Italy, and finally is plotting the most cruel things. Victory must be awaited from heaven, otherwise we are too weakened by human forces. Recently, I received from St. Gallen that the tyrant himself has died, but since I have not seen this confirmed by the authority of any more serious opinion, I believe it was a false rumor.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We also hear cruel things here about the treachery of Maurice of Saxony. If you have any information about the Emperor or Saxony, I ask you to share it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I hope to come to you within a month, although I would have preferred to come by the Christmas festival, but I am unwillingly detained here due to certain business.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will send the letters to St. Gallen and forgive, I ask, my audacity, which burdens you with perpetual importunity.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of December, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Francisco Dryander.</p>

      <p>The letters I am sending, I received from Venice to you from a certain Italian, about whom I will say more in person, God willing.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
