      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>I hear you are occupied, most excellent and learned Bullinger, in preparing an apology against the slanders of Brenz and the impious doctrine of ubiquity. Be steadfast in your resolve, and may the gracious God strengthen you with His spirit, so that, as you have begun, the glory of Christ may be vindicated from the clear and impious doctrine, which I hope will happen soon. Indeed, their foolishness, not to say obstinacy, is clearer than light to all good people, nor will they impose their sycophancies on the elect, who, imbued with truth, clearly understand what that Huldrych Encaustius and his followers aim for in the church.</p>
      <p>O God, O Son of God, shut the mouths of the shameless, who strive with their logomachy (word battles) (albeit in vain) to diminish Your majesty, etc. The Novatians of Richenweiler (Riquewihr) continue.</p>
      <p>On Christ's Nativity, none of the senators, none of the citizens communicated, only the courtiers and those in power, numbering sixteen. The same happened in Hunawihr.</p>
      <p>The ceremonialists are almost bursting with rage and threaten greatly.</p>
      <p>Dr. Nikolaus Regius (I think you are not unaware) made an excellent confession in my presence and that of the lord of Rappoltstein with his mother and family on the tenth of December at noon, and with great patience gave up his soul. He was buried in the chapel of the castle, which, having been purged of superstitions, had not had a sacrifice for eight years, and this in the presence of the lord himself, and also of the nobles, not without some tears. The ceremonialists envied this honor to the faithful minister of God.</p>
      <p>I made an epitaph which hangs on the wall, etc.</p>
      <p>I would have long since completed the translation of Dr. Peter Martyr's dialogue; but since my wife is still gravely ill, I have progressed at a tortoise's pace. As soon as it is finished, I will send it, on the condition, however, that you be the censor before it sees the public. Nothing new with us, except that soldiers are being enlisted in Alsace, for whose favor, we do not know; they are so silent that you hear not a word. Many affirm that some princes will soon hold a diet; I fear that the Germans may again nurture a monster; however, this day will declare it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, God with His Son Jesus Christ must be earnestly entreated, that at some point with His glorious coming He may scatter the assemblies of those who gradually fall away from the truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>Rappoltsweiler (Ribeauvillé) by the lamp, with the messenger waiting; otherwise more copiously. January 23.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>Especially to the most excellent in piety and learning, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, to be observed as a lord and brother, etc.</p>
