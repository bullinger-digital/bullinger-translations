      <p>To the most excellent and learned men, dearest brothers, pastors and readers of the Church of Zurich, Erasmus Ritter wishes grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To inform you, most excellent men, dearest brothers, I present to you a copy of our confession, which we have attached to yours, although if the other brothers had obeyed me, I would have added nothing except the names. Your work was so polished and complete that there was no need to repeat what had been said, nor to sing the Iliad after Homer.</p>
      <p>That you have placed us in your number, that you recognize us as brothers, fellow members, and indeed as your members, and that you have finally given us the opportunity and power to defend ourselves under your most renowned confession against Lutheran slanders, I am grateful and will be most grateful as long as I live, from whom I am so far from wishing to be separated that I would rather wish to die with you from the heart. Meanwhile, continue your love towards us. This will be as pleasing to me as it is most pleasing.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, December 16, 1534.</p>
