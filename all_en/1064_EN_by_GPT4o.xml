      <p>I seem to owe an immense debt to divine kindness, dearest brother in Christ, who has compensated my brief and barren letters with such abundance of writings and indeed with a most ample treasure. This is the custom of our Lord God, who is accustomed to add all things most abundantly to those who diligently seek Him. You have followed this: imitating His fruitful fields, which yield more than they receive, you have written back to me not without great interest. Your letters ought to be most gratefully received by me for three reasons: first, because they are full of all humanity and love towards me and are the most certain indicators; then, because they reflect a heart burning with all piety and divine love; finally, because with such zeal and duty they signify that not only the queen mother but also other nobles of our kingdom, who are not a little devoted to piety, pursue their Bullinger. Your little work dedicated to the royal majesty was received by him most graciously and eagerly embraced and read. Nothing can happen to him more pleasing than the studious labors originating from pious men. For the fact that you have again gifted me with another work, not so much on paper as breathing heavenly ambrosia from all sides, I give immense thanks. Furthermore, there is no need for you to fear the proscription of your books, as long as divine clemency preserves for us our king, in whom even now shines an incredible (believe me) example of learning, zeal for piety, and almost mature judgment in matters. I have diligently conveyed your greetings to the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Warwick, and the Marquess of Dorset, who have most graciously ordered me to return their greetings to you. We eagerly await your other works, which you have promised to publish shortly, so that you may never cease to deserve well of us and receive the most ample reward not from us, but from Him, whom you serve most especially. Farewell.</p>
      <p>After I had written this, because they might be sent to you later either due to my negligence or due to the rarity of couriers, it was announced to me that some other of your little works have been published, which diligence of yours I congratulate both you and us very much. Again, farewell, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>London, on the calends of November 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Richard Cox.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished leader in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Prefect of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>These letters are from Cox, an Englishman, the most serene king's tutor, and later almoner and chancellor of Oxford.</p>
