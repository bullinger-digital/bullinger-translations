      <p>Greetings. I do not have the time to write much now, nor will I touch upon the foolishness of Pfiffer, as I do not think anything could be a fraud to the king or bring prejudice, if justice and equity prevail and treaties are upheld. Those good theologians, who were traveling to Philipp to encourage him in the name of religion in France, have been captured. Other tragedies will arise.</p>
      <p>This was their intention: If I cannot bend the heavens, I will move Acheron. They wanted to burn and kill all those suspected, so that nothing would detract from their gain and ambition. Your letters were received by r.N. along with the book; everything was most pleasing to him, to the queen mother, and to many others. On the 6th of this month in Rome, the head of Duke Paliano was cut off, Count d'Alife and Mr. Leonardo de Cardine were executed, and Cardinal Carafa was strangled in prison, a mockery of fate. Before the next diet, I will visit the lords, and we will converse.</p>
      <p>Greet them and all friends, and love us. You know the council was postponed to the assembly, which will be in Worms.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, perhaps it will be national and French. Solothurn, March 19.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>I am sending Mr. Valentin two booklets written in Italian by Vergerio about the council. He sent me the Latin ones handwritten; if you wish, I will send them to you.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
