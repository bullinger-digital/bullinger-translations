      <p>Greetings and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>How pleasing your greeting was to me, which was announced through Utinger, you may know from the fact that it prompted these letters, however brief. Otherwise, I would not have dared to write to you without some great occasion. But since you have anticipated me with your kindness, I could not help but greet you in return, and meanwhile, to signify what is of utmost concern to me, since I took on the duty of teaching Christ, how necessary mutual consolation is for the churches and how frequent it should be in these most calamitous times. It cannot be said how much it aids the weakness of the flesh. And although I am not ignorant of the spirit's duty in this matter, nevertheless, I see what was done by the apostles, what was done by holy men back and forth. No one is unaware of how frequent those who are united by the friendship of the flesh are in such matters, indeed they judge that not a little has been lost to love if someone acts otherwise. How much more do you think this should be done by those whose friendship is in the Lord? Therefore, to remain silent as if we do not know each other seems not to accept the excuse of business or something similar, but to indicate the fault of forgetting brothers. Let us beware, I beg you by the Lord, of this mark, lest we finally reproach ourselves with it in judgment, and then indeed follow what burdens us more severely. Indeed, I am wholly in this, that whatever grace I have (I feel how moderate it is), I have destined to impart to brothers and churches whatsoever. Thus I would like it to be done similarly by you, who abound through the Lord. In this way, the bond of charity would finally be tightened more closely, we would become more eager in carrying out the Lord's business, and we would more easily resist evil. Therefore, make sure, my Bullinger, that I see you do not abhor this affection of mine, since it is honest.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we read on May 12th what you wrote against Fabri. It pleased good men so much that they contended that it was something that could be opposed to such beasts to defeat them. Continue, as you have begun, to labor for the Lord, and never be deprived of His help.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with all yours. Greet all the brothers in the Lord in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the 13th day of May in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word of the Lord among the people of Zurich.</p>
