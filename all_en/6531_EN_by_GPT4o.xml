      <p>Most Reverend Father in Christ, I wrote on the Sabbath day and indeed very hastily.</p>
      <p>I was also thinking of sending you a copy of the summons to the assembly and the episcopal appeal, in which many things are contained that are not unworthy of knowing; but I have not yet been able to obtain it; due to its length, it could not be copied so quickly. The situation is miserable and in a lost state, unless God helps us.</p>
      <p>Because I saw religion being attacked under the pretext of those who are of our profession, those practices had to be exposed once, but with the modesty that was possible: Ich han mich uff der Kanzel mengglichem, der sy nit entpären wölte, des rächten erbotten. I said many things that can no longer be concealed, unless we wish to betray religion; for unless our people were warned, they would stubbornly rush to their own destruction. Whatever outcome follows, which certainly must be risked to the extreme: I am in the Lord's hand.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>I am waiting to see what happens with Mr. Haller and what happens in Luzern.</p>
      <p>I will soon know and write what has been done in Rome by Lussio.</p>
