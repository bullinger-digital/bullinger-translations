      <p>Grace and consolation of the Holy Spirit! The renowned fame of your name and your exceptional learning, most distinguished man, have for many years now stirred my heart to love you; so much so that I have long wished for nothing more than that at some time, if not to speak with you in person, at least to be given a just occasion to write letters to you, so that mutual love might be fostered between us. And to this my ardent desire, some satisfaction has been given, when a decade ago, by chance, Nicholas Partridge, a man very closely connected to me in many ways, was setting out for Italy, and, having fallen ill on the journey, stayed with you in your house, and having recovered his health with some of your expenses, returned to England with your Rudolf, bringing letters from you to me. These letters, which I keep with no less pleasure than diligence as a token of your love towards me, I greatly embrace and venerate your kindness, who, although you surpass all easily in learning, have deigned to write to me, a humble man, seeking my friendship, as you most kindly said yourself. And seizing that happy occasion to write, I wrote letters, indeed rustic ones, to your excellence through the same servant of yours, intending to write more often if a convenient messenger had intervened. Now, however, I more boldly address your lordship again with these writings, because not long ago Johannes von Ulm, a young man of good hope, conveyed your greetings to me, as you had instructed him through letters, as he informed me, especially so that Johannes Rudolf Stumpf, a young man no less upright than studious, who most kindly offered me his service, would not return to you empty-handed of letters.</p>
      <p>Whom I gladly commend to you, and if you would be willing to support his studies with your utmost kindness, there is no doubt that he could someday be of use to the republic. Farewell, most distinguished man, and may the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time and support your studies! From Oxford, at Magdalen College, on the third day before the Kalends of November.</p>
      <p>Your excellence's most loving Owen Oglethorpe.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, archbishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most dear brother.</p>
