    <p xml:id="regest1">Is troubled by the impression that could arise that the preachers are in conflict, but cannot accommodate Capito on the issue of the doctorate. Reiterates his concerns regarding the concept of the "exhibitio" [of the body of Christ in the Lord's Supper]. Chelius stayed in Basel. Despite reassuring statements from envoys, the persecutions in France continue, as evidenced by the arrival of refugees. The French king is said to have allied with Barbarossa, and he is reportedly advancing on Ancona. Reports of disputes triggered by the efforts for concord in the churches of Augsburg, Strasbourg, Württemberg, and Frankfurt; there are also signs of discord among the Swiss. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If you had not learned from Theodor (Bibliander) what Satan has sown among us, you might have urged me to say something; now I completely refrain. I am tormented by how to uproot the conceived opinion of the dissension of the preachers from the hearts of the people, and I find no way, until I see that no bitterness remains among us. But this seems impossible to me, unless I regard the human doctorate, dismissing the doctorate of the spirit and the church - for I would not dare to say neglecting it. Capito left writings on this matter for the senate without our knowledge. If only you had seen them! For I saw them as if through a screen quite marvelously and recognized the distinction between a pastor and an ecclesiastical doctor, which I previously ignored. But what have we to do with trifles?</p>
      <p>Theodor (Bibliander) saw what I wrote to the people of Bern about the exhibition. Indeed, unless persuaded by divine matters, I cannot think otherwise. You seem to speak very truly: "Let us admit the word of exhibition, and the power of the keys and the Lutheran absolution will stick at the doors."</p>
      <p>About Chelius, I do not know how the matter stands. He was here these days, but he did not visit me.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman rages as before, although his envoys (as Capito recently wrote to me) promise all safety. But what they promise, their actions defile; for a few days ago, exiles fled here. There are those who will undertake the defense of the pious to the king by letters or other means, and they hope well. I do not know what it is. I remember that you once wrote that the king would neglect no friendship that could give hope of a solid kingdom. For it is rumored that he has made an alliance with Barbarossa and that he is on his way to Italy, about to land at Ancona, and that this pertains to the fact that such a force of Germans is setting out for Italy. If this is the case, I expect the counsel of God.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in my view, that action for concord has stirred up dissensions in almost all evangelical churches. In Augsburg, the preachers disagree, which is why Bucer has been called there anew; the people of Strasbourg have granted two or three months. In Strasbourg, things are going very badly among them, even if about other matters than the Eucharist. In Württemberg, Dr. Grynaeus's integrity disagrees with almost everyone, and so much so that he does not even maintain complete friendship with Bucer, which we had not long ago thought impossible. And in Frankfurt, they disagree, hence the fear that some evil may arise there; for the emperor harasses that city through the chamber to restore the mass.</p>
      <p>Among us, nothing of this sort could be stirred up; therefore, that wicked one has set another fire. But has not the appearance of dissension also appeared among our Swiss? Indeed, the instituted concord is marvelous, about which Theodor (Bibliander) has surely informed you sufficiently. May God, the best and greatest, defend His own forever, as He will.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with yours and our Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of March in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
