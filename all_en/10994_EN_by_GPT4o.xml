      <p>Greetings. Your letters are not neglected by me, most kind Bullinger, and although it is not happening now, in the coming days you will receive a message that will meet your expectations, so I ask you not to be anxious.</p>
      <p>We have received your commentaries on the Pauline epistles, a most serious and delightful token of your friendship towards our families and also of your diligence in the Christian commonwealth.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings and those of the people of Zurich to all the pious and learned, especially to the consul RÃ¶sch himself.</p>
      <p>If you give me Theodore's verses, I will repay you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From Constance, February 19, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, herald of the evangelical truth among the people of Zurich, his venerable lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
