    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Strasbourg are pleased that Bullinger wants to advocate for the Concord. Bucer cannot send the [Ten Articles] of the London Synod now due to his imminent departure to Tübingen, but he has already sent them to the Englishmen [Partridge, Butler, and Woodroffe] in Zurich. He regrets that the embassy [of the Schmalkaldic League] desired by King [Henry VIII] did not materialize, but in England, there is already correct teaching about the Pope and justification. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our people here are very delighted, as we have preached to them about your faith and zeal in supporting the Concord there and your promise to assist among your own.</p>
      <p>I wanted to send you the articles of the London Synod, but time was lacking. For I am now departing to Tübingen. I have sent the articles to your English guests; you will receive them from them. We have failed the kingdom of Christ by refusing to send a delegation to participate in the synod, as the king had requested. But we must accept what the Lord grants. It is well, as long as this kingdom persists in rejecting the Pope and has accepted the doctrine of justification, and the Lord will provide the rest in due time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, all you saints there, Pellican, Leo, Theodore, and keep us commended in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your entirely in the Lord, M. Bu.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, my singular patron and dearest brother, the lord Heinrich Bullinger, with exceptional piety and learning. To Zurich.</p>
