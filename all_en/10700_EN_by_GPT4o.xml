    <p xml:id="regest1">Can hardly wait for Vadian's new book on the Lord's Supper. Reports from a letter by Berchtold [Haller] [No. 659] about a peace offer from the Duke of Savoy and an unauthorized departure of Bernese in favor of Geneva. Inquires about the misfortune that is said to have befallen the Emperor. The French King is up to something; his envoy [Guillaume du Bellay, Seigneur] de Langer is expected in Strasbourg, and Capito writes that the King wants to unite the Pope with the German Protestants against the Emperor. There is talk of a conspiracy against the Emperor. Georg of Württemberg has asked the Zurich council to release Leo [Jud] to him, but now Erasmus Schmid [is being sent as pastor to Reichenweier]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express, most learned Vadian, how much I long to see your book written on the Eucharist. Believe me, whoever brings it to me from you will have given me the most noble and most desired treasure. Therefore, I beg through Christ, fulfill this joy of mine.</p>
      <p>On October 14th, Berchtold from Bern writes to me: "On that unfortunate and dark day of October 11th, the Duke of Savoy offers himself, with a legate sent of his own accord, to enter into peace terms with the Bernese, but without arbitrators, if only they allow the assembly to be held in their city" (Bern). "Perhaps the misfortune of the Emperor has frightened him." He adds: "The best people will strive to ensure that this certainly happens, so that even in this way the Genevans may be well advised. Some soldiers had gone to them in these days; some have returned, they say only 18 still remain in Geneva. The magistrate has decreed that no more may leave." I did not want you to be unaware of these things from Berchtold. You will pray to the Lord to bless these matters.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we do not know what misfortune has befallen the Emperor. If you have any certain information, let me know.</p>
      <p>I do not know what the French King is plotting. Certainly, I do not doubt that he is attempting something great. The eloquent and cunning envoy of the French, [Guillaume du Bellay, Seigneur] de Langer, is expected in Strasbourg, with whom you conversed last year in St. Gallen. Capito at the end of September writes: "There is talk of a plan. The French King attempts to undermine the plans of others with his arts. He courts some. An honorable embassy is expected. He is plotting strange things: I think he wants to unite the Roman Pope against the Emperor with us Germans, who embrace the reborn doctrine of Christ." This from Capito. But you easily judge, my Vadian, what evil lies hidden under this pretext. He seeks something else. For who would commit Satan to Christ? In these difficulties of affairs, we struggle and waver today.</p>
      <p>Today, in good faith, someone reports that the French King, the Venetians, and the Duke of Milan have conspired against the Emperor. If you have any certain information, write, I beg you.</p>
      <p>Prince Georg of Württemberg, brother of Duke Ulrich, has sent a third envoy to our council. Twice he sought Leo; the third time Erasmus Schmid was given to him for a certain time. The rest will be reported by the messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Vogler.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, esteemed lord.</p>
