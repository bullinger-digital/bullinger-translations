      <p>Greetings. Our brothers have obtained from our most honorable council what they requested. From there, they are departing to Schaffhausen and Basel.</p>
      <p>We have discussed the presented confession amicably. They promised that they will ensure nothing of the sort happens in the future.</p>
      <p>We all agreed on our consensus. They further promised that they would explain their opinion more broadly, fully, and clearly if the Saxons or others continue to challenge us with that confession. Thus, we parted with the utmost agreement of minds.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>A young man here is held by a wonderful desire to see you, so encourage him towards virtues. Again, live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 26th of September, 1557. The brothers greet you. Greet all the brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
