    <p xml:id="regest1">In a detailed discussion of Bucer's letter to Leo Jud dated June 23, 1532, his proposals for reconciliation and the defense of Luther are rejected. If the differences between Luther and the Swiss are so minor, why are efforts for concord necessary at all? Luther's behavior towards the Swiss is unworthy of a Christian. The greater love of truth is found among Luther's opponents. The Swiss cannot approve or understand Strasbourg's signature under the Confessio Augustana, as their doctrine has not changed. Various statements made in this confession are unacceptable. Not only Jud and Bullinger, but also other theologians like Pellikan, Bibliander, Karlstadt, and Schmid share this opinion. As indicated in a letter from the pastors of Bern, Solothurn, and Biel gathered in Zofingen, No. 109, they approve of Zurich's rejecting stance. Bucer should remember his agreement to the ten theses of the Bern Disputation.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I was so astonished by your letter to Leo, most learned Bucer, that I could not help but respond with these humble words of mine. Since they come from a friendly spirit, I have no doubt that you will consider them kindly. Your entire letter revolves around persuading us to either subscribe to or yield to Luther in the matter of the Eucharist, as you have subscribed to the Saxon doctrines. Before you begin, you try to obtain permission to enjoy your faith, since you allow Leo to abound in his. To which I would not strongly object, provided that faith keeps its rule. For we know that "faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God" [Romans 10:17]. We also know that the apostle wrote: "If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God" [1 Peter 4:11]; "if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent" [1 Corinthians 14:30]; "and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion but of peace" [1 Corinthians 14:32-33], and elsewhere: "Therefore, as many as are perfect, let us have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you, nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind" [Philippians 3:15-16]. Therefore, if your faith, my dear Bucer, or anyone else's, is from the word of truth, we accept it; if not, we decline it with modesty. So it is with Luther's matter. If Luther has the prophetic spirit, he is subject to the prophets; if he is subject to the prophets, he will plainly confess the truth, and if he confesses this truth, all discord will be removed. However, if he is not subject but causes disturbances, he does not have the spirit of God, who is the author of peace, not of disturbances. Who then would subscribe to him? Indeed, Paul does not want the weaker to be accepted for the sake of concord, but he says that the weaker are led by God to embrace what is more perfect. Now, you yourself may explain what is more perfect in the Eucharist. Explain to us, most learned Bucer, what kind of doctrine it is that we have attained from God in the Eucharist, in which we agree and proceed by the same rule, whether it is Luther's or ours. Certainly, Luther's doctrine is weaker, as even your own books prove, so ours is more perfect. For if the opinion of both is the same, why do you labor for concord, which otherwise comes through the assent of truth? But if it is different and ours is more perfect, and that weaker, why do you call us to a concord to which Paul did not call?</p>
      <p>But you say: "I know from words and writings that he attributes nothing to words or sacraments but admonition and exercise of the mind to faith." And would that it were so, and that Luther himself would freely confess what you impose on him unwillingly. You indeed would greatly wish Luther to speak, think, and understand his own words in this way. And perhaps he would, if you would appeal from the contentious to the tranquil. But he does not want to be such. For if he had ever wanted, you would not have spent so much labor in vain in mending concord, as you yourself confess, having been repeatedly frustrated with the matter unfinished in the written dialogue, and in the colloquies held at Marburg, Augsburg, and Coburg. What then do we make him feel other than what he himself feels or wants to feel? Why do we attribute him to Satan, who has already delivered himself to the demon, if he begins to feel as you preach about him? What, since you yourself in this very letter: "If he believes and teaches concerning the Eucharist from the promise of God that a certain bodily presence of Christ is established above it, by which he inserts himself into our minds, yet he does not expressly admit that this presence or its faith is of any benefit to anyone's salvation, but places everything in that faith by which it is believed that Christ died for us, how great, I ask, is the error?" You think this error should be forgiven him. And indeed we would forgive, if we had ever found anything of candid sincerity in this man, if he did not abuse our indulgence, indeed, if it were permissible to forgive this through the simplicity of truth. For what need is there to feign another presence than that which is handed down in the scriptures? What promises of God will he cite to us about bodily presence? But what was the necessity to establish a bodily presence, finally to devise another faith with the sophists than that which is saving? But if he admits that all those his figments, about which there is meanwhile dispute, do nothing for salvation, certainly he contends for a thing of no value, but with a treacherous and most impious judgment he has condemned us, indeed, and has hitherto mocked the church of God. For if the flesh profits nothing when eaten, why does he perpetually draw the cord of contention? Why does he pursue those who teach this, drive them into exile, and advise that they be beaten? Is this the sincerity of a theologian, to involve the light of truth in darkness, to cover impostures in an open matter, and to weave tricks in Christian simplicity, and to do all this out of a zeal for contention and arrogance? Has it escaped us what the poet said: "The tale of truth is simple, but the unjust word, sick in itself, needs wise drugs," or that most sacred saying of Paul: "Do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no? But I call God as witness, that our word toward you was not yes and no. For the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, was not yes and no, but in him was yes" [2 Corinthians 1:17-19]. "For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ" [2 Corinthians 2:17]? Therefore, what you advise, that the whole church of Christ should be considered, judge for yourself, dearest Bucer, whether it is to have regard for the church to consent to some deceiver, to connive at his impostures, to allow him to impose on the simpler with a veil of words, and to lead astray and defame the more discerning, and thus to mock the whole church of God, the holy bride of Christ, in the sight of God, and to do all this so that he may not seem to confess the designated error.</p>
      <p>David indeed yielded to Saul, but in matters concerning the worldly kingdom and his own body. We are in the church, which is the kingdom of Christ and truth, which relies on true faith and pure simplicity, is led by them, and is preserved by the same. If these are dear to Luther, he will know no other faith than the saving one, and he will not involve Christian simplicity in tricks. You think indeed that a quarrelsome captain, if his stubbornness can be borne without significant danger to the ship, should be yielded to, lest the whole ship perish through contention. But meanwhile, my dear Bucer, it comes into controversy whether Luther's stubbornness and intolerable pride, that biting wit against the best people, and more than rapid madness, that lust against the most sacred truth and simplicity, by which he fixes and refixes, involves and perverts things at will, whether, I say, these can be borne without loss of truth, again, whether it is the part of good men to sail in the same ship and connive at the captain's drunkenness, rashness, and wickedness, from which later arises a capital danger for all good men. And you indeed: "Would you not rather bear this," you say, "than if someone makes such a necessity of the ceremonies of Moses that without their observance he does not consider Christ sufficient?" But what, my dear Bucer, if I bear neither this nor that, because this one utterly nullifies Christ, and that one resists the acknowledged truth, and not only resists but with singular impudence dares to demand that the whole world swear by his words and use no others than those he is accustomed to use? "But Paul bore that error," you say, "and not only bore it, but also proved himself an observer of ceremonies by deed." But here you seem, Bucer, to see what Paul bore, why he bore it, and how long he bore it. I indeed find quite different things in Acts chapter 15 [1-21] and especially in Galatians chapter 2 [11-21], where he also openly resists Peter for somewhat Judaizing to his face and shortly after adds these words: "For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor" [Galatians 2:18], and again: "Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing" etc. [Galatians 5:2]. Behold, what could be said more plainly? What more vividly than what he wrote to the Hebrews? What then shall we say? That which heretics say, if Tertullian tells the truth, that the apostles delivered different things to different people? But this opinion, as most false, has long since been expelled from the theater of Christ. For even if Paul became all things to all men, yet the doctrine of Christ always remained the same with him. For as far as the single example of purification is concerned, we know that the reason of the deed is different from that of the law.</p>
      <p>But you, who leave no stone unturned, repeatedly insist: "For those who are not one are not of Christ. But those who are doubted to be of Christ will never have preached the gospel with worthy fruit." Here, however, you perpetually omit, dearest Bucer, whose fault it is that we are not one. Certainly not ours. On our part stands constant truth and Christian simplicity, which cannot be safely and with a clear conscience abandoned by us. It is Luther's fault that we do not agree. He, seized by logomachy and vainglory, neither yields to the truth nor ceases to bring forth new threads of quarrel. Therefore, what you say, that the gospel cannot be preached with worthy fruit by dissenters, applies to him, not to us. And so you seem to have preferred Luther to all the doctors in the world. For if one considers the zeal for slander and loquacity, he will hold the first place among the learned, just as Thersites held the chief place among the Greek heroes. But if one considers the restoration of piety, pious learning, and the sharpest judgment in sacred matters, indefatigable labor, and the most exercised constancy and prudence with a pure mind, now Luther can neither hand a chamber pot to Capnion nor Erasmus nor Pellican nor Oecolampadius nor Zwingli, the foremost men in true religion. Why then do we linger on these things? Why do we still regard persons? To whom that of Paul should have been long since most evident: "From those who seemed to be something - whatever they were, it makes no difference to me. God shows personal favoritism to no man - for those who seemed to be something added nothing to me" [Galatians 2:6], and again: "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? Neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase" [1 Corinthians 3:4-7]. As for the progress and increase of the Lutheran churches, we know that the day of the Lord will declare what each one's work is like. Meanwhile, we know that the doctrine of Arius and Muhammad was spread almost throughout the entire East, although we do not yet fully compare Luther to them. We speak of the increase and assent of the churches.</p>
      <p>You ask here, how then shall we repel this evil from us. Certainly with no loss of truth. For it is more excellent to bear this evil even with our own harm for a longer time than to accept a poorly mended peace with that man who prefers all glory to be given to himself rather than to the truth. "Will you then repay insult with insult?" I do not think so. For we have not been accustomed to this hitherto. For as often as adversaries have hurled such thunderbolts at us, which neither the glory of God and faith itself nor the ministry of the word itself advised to ignore, yet they have been extinguished with such modesty that we have not treated any of them according to their dignity. Therefore, even now, and as often as the glory of God and the welfare of our churches will advise, we will defend the cause of truth in the present case and in other necessary matters not only against Luther but against all enemies, disturbers, and perverters of truth with the strength that divine grace will supply to us. But you will achieve nothing "with those," you say, "to whom the defense was to be approved." This indeed has not happened to us first, but also to the greatest and most holy men from the very beginning of the world. For neither the prophets nor the apostles, even with the most loving writings, achieved anything with the enemies of truth. But did they for that reason leave the palm of the defense of truth to the adversaries? Therefore: "He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still" [Revelation 22:11]. But if Luther himself is more irritated by this, the more vigorously we defend the simplicity of truth, we hope that from this matter all the saints in the church may learn by what spirit Luther is driven.</p>
      <p>But why many words? We have not learned, dearest Bucer, to sit on two stools. If the body of Christ is corporally at the right hand of God, certainly it is not corporally in the supper. Nor do we meanwhile ignore what and how the ancients spoke. Moreover, if it is at the right hand of the Father and in the supper at the same time corporally, the body of Christ is infinite. But what is infinite is not a body. Therefore, the body of Christ is not a body. Indeed, Elijah cried out: "How long will you falter between two opinions?" [1 Kings 18:21] Paul also cries out: "What communion has light with darkness?" [2 Corinthians 6:14] And all antiquity cried out: "The just things are simple and clear." Now we testify to God that we do not envy Luther's glory, as much as God has imparted to him, nor do we willingly dispute with him, but whatever we do, we do out of love for truth and simplicity. We will prove that this is so by this matter and now promise you that we will receive Luther as a most dear brother as soon as he gives all glory to the truth, ceases to bite and persecute the saints and men who have deserved well of the church of Christ, and those who follow our, indeed not our, but God's doctrine concerning the Eucharist, whether it be Carlstadt, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, or someone else, ceases to involve simplicity in clouds, to pervert the right, to express the pure captiously, to write biting papers and infamous, as they say, libels, to slander, to calumniate, and to proclaim heretics or supernumerary prophets. These things will not be grievous to him, indeed he will most readily and of his own accord, if he is of our opinion with us, as you say, perform them. But if not, we would rather hear ill from the turbulent band of Lutherans than be called hypocrites by all the saints both in reality and in name. For we have once resolved, and by the grace of God we will perform, to devote our life to holy truth and pious simplicity, to yield to no one, unless something better "is revealed to another who sits by" [1 Corinthians 14:30]. "The time is short" [1 Corinthians 7:29], the world is unstable, men are more unstable, fearful and trembling at the holy cross of God. But we do not want to be marked by that Pauline sentence, if God will inspire: "As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ" etc. [Galatians 6:12].</p>
      <p>Now indeed, that you not only permitted but also were authors of subscribing to the Saxon Confession in your public affairs, we neither wish to approve nor disapprove, since the deed, as the proverb goes, cannot be undone. Certainly, we would not have done such a thing without consulting you. But perhaps it is so ordained by God that we may once be deprived of all human aid and fellowship. But come, "let the will of the Lord be done" [Acts 21:14]. It is indeed more manifest than can be denied that there are things in that confession that are contrary to sincere doctrine, some things also that we ourselves have formerly attacked and disapproved, some even quite obscure and childish. Such as that the Holy Spirit is given through the sacraments as instruments, that faith is confirmed by the same, that baptism is necessary for salvation. But they speak of the baptism of water. Those things, however, which they philosophize about confession, absolution, and the mass, are more known than it is necessary to repeat, and it is well known what they have defined about the Eucharist. Which have also condemned ours entirely. For whom else have they condemned, if they have not condemned us? Or how could it be that they have not yet rightly understood ours after so many excellent works? Zwingli wrote very many things, Oecolampadius also wrote many and religious things, Bucer wrote, you met at Marburg, the confession of both parties was heard. And yet an impudent condemnation followed. Nor did our people say anything different then than now. The doctrine was always the same. What, that Zwingli himself wrote so clearly, so religiously about the sacraments, indeed about the whole religion, both "To Charles" and "To the princes gathered at Augsburg," that no one ever wrote more clearly about this matter? But not even then could any peace be obtained from those contentious and arrogant ones. Nevertheless, the condemnation stood firm, to which we now so promptly subscribe.</p>
      <p>From this subscription, indeed, that will emerge for us which is now on the lips of all among us, that both the good and the bad will accuse us of inconstancy. By which the authority of our ministry will be endangered beyond measure, not indeed by itself, but because we will seem to be, as it is said, innovators and fearful, to think, believe, and teach one thing formerly, another now. But you: "That many may think," you say, "that we have departed from our opinion, I would rather they say this about me than that I have nothing of Christ, that I tear apart the words of Christ, that I measure all things of God by the reason of the flesh." As if we, who do not subscribe to Luther or have not hitherto wished to agree, have nothing of Christ, tear apart his words, and measure all things of God by the reason of the flesh. We grieve, Bucer, we grieve greatly, and these things of yours displease us, they displease us, I say, more than can be said, nor would we ever have expected such from most dear brothers. For if you said these things about the slanders and maledictions of the Lutherans, we are amazed if that saying of the Lord has so quickly escaped you: "Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake" [Matthew 5:11]. We are also amazed at what you still write to us about concord and the consensus of doctrines, when you still feel such atrocious slanders against us in these matters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what Leo advised, dearest Bucer, I advise the same, that you conduct this play in such a way that it does not end in a dark tragedy. For even if you say not without emphasis that Zwingli opposed these things being received by our people hitherto, who nevertheless could not oppose the admission of graver things, we indeed acknowledge that now indeed all the blame for misfortune, loss, and evil is not only cast by the adversaries but also by our own people on the man of holy memory, Zwingli, but by what right, we will not now dispute. But we do not know what graver things our people have admitted, since nothing has yet departed from solid and sincere doctrine among us. But we know well that all who were in Asia turned away from the apostle Paul with the glory of God and the doctrine of truth unscathed. We also know that he said: "All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived" [2 Timothy 3:12-13], and again: "Nevertheless, the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and 'Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity'" [2 Timothy 2:19]. Therefore, we pray, dearest brother, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that you look more closely into this matter, do not yield too much to Luther, nor believe him. He is a scorpion, whom if you observe with all diligence, he will still sting, however much he may seem to lick at first. We also pray that you pursue us with the same love with which we sincerely embrace you. I wanted to pour out this fervor of my mind to you as a singular friend and most dear brother, indeed a teacher to be observed. I pray, however, that you consider it kindly. Farewell together with your companions, especially my Capito, whom we also earnestly beseech not to involve us in the little book in which he promises to expose to the world that we run on both sides outside the bounds. Let him weigh what such little books can produce in the church both among the weak and the stronger. Pellican, Theodorus, Carolstadius, and Erasmus Fabritius, who are all of the same opinion with us and beseech you with as many words as Leo and I have entreated in this matter, wish you well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 12, 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Bernese have also written these days from the city and countryside, as well as some brothers from Solothurn and Biel, bishops, to the leaders of Zurich in this sentiment: "We have commonly and unanimously resolved and decided among ourselves, regardless of the agreement of Luther and Strasbourg, to remain true and steadfast to the holy word of God, as maintained in our disputation and preached by us until now, without any change. Therefore, we have also earnestly asked you to remain faithfully by the same according to your promise. We will rightly await what God will work with us, etc. Given at Zofingen in our assembly, July 8, 1532."</p>
      <p>Remember, Bucer, your promise and subscription, which the Senate and people of Bern have in writing about you.</p>
      <p>To Martin Bucer, most dear brother.</p>
