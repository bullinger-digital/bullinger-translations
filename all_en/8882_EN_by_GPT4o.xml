      <p>I send what I have been able to gather in the successive hours among countless other tasks.</p>
      <p>They proceed with great success in the initiated reformation and learn to become more and more gentle day by day. Those summoned from the Upper League also appeared, whose mere stubbornness seemed to feed something monstrous. But what we should fear now, we do not see. Tomorrow at the break of dawn, Mr. Consul Ambrosius will present his case.</p>
      <p>I fear that it will erupt more harshly, for example regarding wealth, etc. Today in the evening, a public courier from Schwyz arrived with letters pertaining to the judgment. What they contain, not even Mr. Consul Willius, whom I asked, can yet know.</p>
      <p>The president Rh√§ticus is still absent. Josua von Salis, a knight with a bull, whose case has not yet been acted upon because he made himself a leader among the Venetians against the Turks, has been thrown into chains in Venice. You will learn the case from the records. - Merius and Gantner have gone to Ulm, summoned by a certain nobleman, namely a Schwenckfeldian.</p>
      <p>Please write if you have any experience and knowledge of the Ulm church.</p>
      <p>We wish to find out what these disturbers of ours are plotting and to which god they serve. - If Guler from Davos had not had such testimony from us, many lawyers affirm that he would not have come away with 2000 crowns. Conradin Planta was absent and missed the prescribed day, who through one of his friends requested and obtained letters of favor and recommendation or intercession with certain conditions written by your most honorable magistrate, as your most honorable treasurer wrote to me. However, I fear that all is in vain, for he has passed judgment on himself, having declared not only to us but also to others: If his brother has more bulls than the two small ones, they should be considered or held as traitors to the country. He lies in Wesen in the right place and cannot stop crying. It is believed that nothing heavier will fall upon him, and that revenge will be swift this week. May God grant grace and blessing. Great fruit has already been achieved; may God increase and confirm it.</p>
