      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, esteemed colleague and brother.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Upon returning home, I found no letters from you or from Lelio, but Lelio's followed not long after. Yours, however, were delivered to me by one of the royal envoys on June 17, and indeed they were unsealed. He claimed to have taken this liberty by the right of our old friendship. I was not surprised by his action, whatever it was.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we must be careful that our letters do not fall into such hands. The document we received from you was read to the brothers with the utmost gratitude from all. Passing through Lausanne, I not only recited it to Viret and his colleagues but also allowed it to be copied.</p>
      <p>All were filled with no small joy and eagerly gave thanks to God. However, some suggested that if it were ever to be published, a few things might be desired, which if added, would bring some light and grace.</p>
      <p>First, where we say that Christ must be considered in his flesh as a priest, king, etc., then immediately after we add: This is a spiritual communication, this certainly is too abrupt.</p>
      <p>However, the flaw could easily be corrected by inserting this sentence: "Moreover, for Christ to present himself to us as such and to produce such effects in us, we must become one with him and coalesce into his body, because he does not otherwise diffuse his life into us, unless he is our head, from which the whole body, being compacted and connected through every joint of supply, according to the working in the measure of every part, makes the increase of the body." In these words, I know there is nothing that would not please you.</p>
      <p>And indeed, something like this is necessary for the weaving of the discourse. In the sixth chapter, where it is stated: and for these benefits once exhibited on the cross, but truly received by us in faith, etc., I later noticed that the discourse, otherwise somewhat harsh, could be softened [in this way]: and what we daily receive by faith. Thus, the sense will be fuller.</p>
      <p>After the eighteenth chapter, where we figuratively explain the words of the supper: This is my body, this is my blood, I thought it would not be untimely to address the doubts of some.</p>
      <p>For there will undoubtedly be some good men who will be troubled that no mention is made of the matter, where only the sign is named, especially since in the whole writing no word is made of the eating of the flesh. But just as we cannot be too cautious that our words do not smell of gross opinions, so again we must strive that moderate and rightly thinking men do not find less than what is sufficient. And yet it would not be difficult to satisfy, if such an exposition were added: But that Christ feeds our souls by the eating of his flesh and the drinking of his blood, which are here figured, is not to be understood as if there were any mixture or transfusion of substance, but because we draw life from the flesh once offered in sacrifice and from the blood shed for expiation.</p>
      <p>Here too, I think there is nothing contained that would displease you, or could be suspect to others, or finally be subject to calumny. But if it is omitted, many complaints will be heard that what was most pertinent to the matter was passed over. Nor will there be lacking those who will cunningly object that it was done. Those who are less unjust and malicious interpreters will suspect that we deliberately concealed it, because we did not agree among ourselves. Moreover, in the minds of many, a scruple about the manner and reason of the eating will remain. No one will excuse haste, because in such a matter all will require maturity, and it will scarcely be persuaded to anyone that we were in such a hurry.</p>
      <p>And indeed, these things are brought forward by me in a friendly manner with the intention that while the matter is still whole, you may consult with our brothers about what is more expedient. Meanwhile, if you decide that nothing should be changed or added, I promise that there will be no delay on our part in subscribing.</p>
      <p>Although perhaps it is not so urgent to labor about this matter at present, since our Bernese brothers are averse to publication. Unless finally, swayed by the example of others, they concede to a different opinion.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the reasons by which they are hindered seem to me to be rather weak. For we do not profess that there has been any dissension among us hitherto, nor do we give the wicked an opportunity to slander, as if we were removing envy from ourselves out of fear of present disturbances. None of these things can be said, but rather the spirits of the good will be uplifted by our agreement to break the impious. Our constancy and freedom will be of great value in these turbulent times. Those who were previously persuaded otherwise will understand that we think piously and rightly. Many, who today hang in suspense, will have something in which to rest: those who are alienated from you in distant regions, I hope, will soon extend their hands. Finally, whatever happens, posterity will have a testimony of our faith which could not be gathered from contentious disputes. But I leave this to be governed by God, to whose grace I commend you with your family, and indeed your whole church. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, much esteemed in the Lord. Please diligently greet Mr. Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and the rest of the colleagues in my name. My brothers also send you and them many greetings.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 6th of the Calends of July, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
