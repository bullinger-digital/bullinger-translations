      <p>My friendly, willing service along with the offering of all honors, love, and all capabilities beforehand, highly learned, honorable, distinguished, wise, especially gracious, dear sir. I have received your writings, now and previously done to me, along with the little books, and I express to you my friendly great thanks, and regarding your request about the letters, to obtain from the late Mr. Morlet's secretary, I have therefore spoken with Mr. von Bassefontaine, the royal majesty's attorney here in the Confederation, who has promised me that as soon as we come to Solothurn, he will provide them to me.</p>
      <p>There are only three; for he has searched through all the writings of the late Morlet and found no more.</p>
      <p>As soon as they are with me, they will certainly be sent to you by me. Furthermore, gracious, dear sir, I do not want to withhold from you, but rather show good intentions, that I am inclined to think that this gentleman has a particularly good disposition; however, he wants to be without suspicion, and if you (considering the current circumstances) write to him, I am sure you would show him a pleasant favor.</p>
      <p>I also consider it good, he needs to be strengthened, regarding religion, and just with a word, as you might write to him among other things, as you can well do. So that the letter you sent to me to Paris may arrive there more securely, I have given it to the gentleman with the request to send it there at the first opportunity, who promised me that he will do it for you and others with good will. If I have not written to you as often as I would have liked regarding your many writings to me, I ask you not to take it too harshly. It has pleased the Almighty to call my late wife to Him; to Him be praise and thanks. Herewith I commend myself to you most highly, praying to God the Lord that He may keep you in His divine protection. Dated at Baden, the 15th of December 1552. Your willing servant Hans Wunderlich.</p>
      <p>I have delivered your city scribe's letter from Farello to you. If you wish to reply to him, send your letter here.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, honorable, distinguished, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
