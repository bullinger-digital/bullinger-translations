      <p>What you ask, most illustrious man in piety and learning of all, that I send to you the books which you had arranged to be purchased for you through Gastius, I will do willingly, also to gratify you in more serious matters, as far as my ability and strength will allow.</p>
      <p>However, I understood from the wife of the piously deceased Gastius that none of them were purchased for you, and therefore I send to you through Peter Mechlingensem the Micropresbytiron, namely some small works of ancient theologians, which Heinrich Petri sends to you as a gift, in whose workshop they were printed, furthermore the Württemberg Confession, a booklet on neutrals, and some things published in our language, which were purchased by me for 4 Constance bazions with a double Basel one. I could not explore the works of Clement in the booksellers' shops with the attached letters of the popes, which were printed in France, as you will find with Theodor Bibliander, who a few years ago, unless my mind deceives me, received them from Oporinus. We will arrange for the remaining books to be brought to us from Strasbourg at the next opportunity, if it pleases the Lord. I hear nothing of new matters; however, it is certain that Frankfurt is still surrounded by a heavy siege of princes, Oppenheim plundered, Speyer, Mainz, and Worms surrendered. On July 17th, the Hochmeister came from Prussia to Strasbourg, whom Maurice expelled from Mergentheim and his possession. After him, the Duchess of Lorraine came with the sister of her deceased husband, namely to hide for a while under the wings of the Strasbourg republic, until Phoebus would drive away the clouds of the sky; but they could not obtain what they had planned, and so they left, I know not where, with the matter unfinished. Later, the canons of Mainz came in the guise of merchants, who learned from the bishop that they were not at all accepted by the citizens, whence it happened that the Bishop of Mainz, who had implored the help of the Strasbourg people, was received with little courtesy, and when he felt he was a burden to the citizens, he left indignantly the next morning by the walls, not by the royal road, to Freiburg in Breisgau, as some say, or as others, retreating to the castle of Hohenklingsperg to hide there with a great treasure of goods. Behold, I pray, the marvelous vicissitude of things; a year ago you would have said that all evangelical doctors would sooner be driven beyond the Sarmatians and the icy Ocean than those well-fed canons, bishops, and archbishops electors would be moved even a foot from their place, as they were convinced they had firmly planted their roots to the very foundations of the earth. But we must pray and beseech the thrice-great God to defend His church against impious enemies and the power of the antichrist, which He will dissipate with the spirit of His mouth.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, safe and sound to all the church of Christ and yourself.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the Nones of August, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>I have heard that you received your Decades, which you had sent to the piously remembered Gastius, still wrapped in leather, through Peter Mechlingensem. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
      <p>From Mr. Konrad Lycosthenes 1552.</p>
