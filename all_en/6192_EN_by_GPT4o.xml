      <p>Greetings. What kind and how great was Castalio's honesty and integrity, I do not know; for he was not known to me personally.</p>
      <p>This much I do know for certain, that he is almost worshipped by the Anabaptists even now, and indeed by the most perverse of them, whose remnants still exist in the Low Countries and in Lower Germany. I have heard from reputable men present, who said that he himself had rebaptized Castalio with his own hand; however that matter may stand, he himself fostered monstrous doctrines and among these attributed too much to human strength against the apostolic preaching of grace.</p>
      <p>But, since he is dead, he has had his judge. And you, my dear Laski, since you openly profess in your letters to me that you have nothing in common with his foreign doctrines, I do not shrink from your friendship and that of Tretius, our mutual friend, and I want you to know that if you continue to follow sound doctrines, as you profess and as I fully trust you will do, I will consider you a brother and sincere friend. I do not deny that certain things have been written in Basel about you and some other Poles; but whatever they were, it will not be useful to bring them up now. However, this has not harmed you in my eyes, nor will it separate me from you and the other Poles, whom I understand to reject foreign and curious doctrines, but to hold firmly to orthodox ones and to live a holy life. Farewell, my dear Laski, and greet my lords and brothers, the Poles, who are with you in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13th of July, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
