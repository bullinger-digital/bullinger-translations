    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Bullinger's warning came too late, [the Bernese pastors] were prepared thanks to Myconius when the [Passau] Dean [Ruprecht von Mosham] arrived in Bern on August 22; after he had scouted the situation, he requested a disputation with the pastors from the council, but they had already ensured that he was prohibited from staying in the city and the countryside. When Mayor [Hans Franz] Nägeli discovered that he wanted to have his writings printed by Apiarius, he was summoned again and immediately expelled due to his criticism of the doctrine prevailing in Bern; he claims that man is also justified by his works and presents himself very skillfully, which is why he must be approached with caution.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Your warning came too late, but Myconius's preceded it. The dean came to Bern on Monday, which was August 22, and hid in the Crown Inn without our knowledge until Friday, meanwhile carefully considering everything to devise a way to cunningly attack us. Finally, having found a plan, he approached the council to request permission to meet and debate with us about our faith and religion. We, having been warned, anticipated him and described the man to the council as we had understood from Myconius's letters. The council prohibited him from the city and the countryside.</p>
      <p>The next day, Mayor Nägeli, being a prudent man, learned that one of his servants (for he has two) frequently visited the house of Apiarius, our printer, many times. He thought that perhaps Apiarius was printing some of his nonsense.</p>
      <p>He went to Apiarius's house and found the situation as he suspected. Therefore, the dean was immediately summoned to the council and questioned by what authority he attempted this without the council's consent. Among other things, he responded that our faith is not the Christian faith, but full of offenses and not supported by the authority of scripture, wherefore he was immediately expelled from the city and the countryside. He teaches, however, that justification for man comes not from faith alone, but also from works. Therefore, be very cautious; for he is not unlearned and is exceedingly eloquent, cunning, and a notable hypocrite, who presents himself as a master of deception in appearance, dress, and demeanor. Thus, you have what has been done with the scoundrel here.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern, August 27, 1541.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my kind and dear lord, to his hands.</p>
