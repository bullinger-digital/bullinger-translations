    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A few days ago, Schuler wanted to send a letter [not received] to Bullinger through the [former] mayor [Balthasar] Funk, who was sent to Konstanz on behalf of the [Memmingen] council. However, due to the danger posed by the roaming enemies, Funk refused to take the letter. Schuler is now writing with a messenger going to Zurich [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Despite the turmoil of war, things are going well (thank God), even though the many events give rise to contradictory rumors. Those who trust in God hope for a happier outcome of the war than the one threatened by the enemies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Emperor's [Charles V] army is currently camped at Giengen, with the [Schmalkaldic] army about 2 km away. Skirmishes occur daily, endangering both sides, but especially the Emperor's, who recently lost some of his best men, including the counts [Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of] Musso, [Eriprando] Madruzzo, [Vladislaus von] Bernstein, and [...] of Bavaria.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The army of the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] has already challenged the enemy to battle five times, but the Emperor has always evaded it. Schuler suspects the reason but can only write about it when it is less dangerous to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Swiss Confederates have been expected for several days. Schuler does not know why [their attack] is delayed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Like an oracle, it is claimed that it would be pleasing to God if Germany made peace [with the Emperor]; otherwise, it would perish!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Schuler could write much, but it would not be wise to entrust it to paper. May the Lord preserve His Church! Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler] and to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Savior. A few days ago, I wrote to you, incomparable friend, through Funck, our mayor, to deliver the letters, as he was about to leave for Konstanz on behalf of the council. But he refused to take the letters from me due to the danger of enemies roaming here and there. Now, the bearer of this letter, who is about to leave for Zurich, came to me, and I decided to entrust the letters to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In this war turmoil, we are doing well through the Lord with us, although various rumors arise due to the variety of events. But we, trusting in the Lord, hope for a happier outcome than our enemies threaten.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>While I write this, the army of Charles is encamped near Giengen. The Protestant army has set up camp a quarter of a mile away from it. Daily skirmishes occur, not without danger to both sides, but more so to Charles, who recently lost Count of Musso, another of Madruzzo, a third of Bernstein, and a fourth of Bavaria - men, as I hear, very dear to Charles in military matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The army of the Landgrave has already tried five times to engage with the enemy, but Charles always retreats. What he has in mind, I could guess, if it were safe to discuss the matter in writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Swiss Confederates were expected a few days ago, but I do not know why they are delayed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In summary, it is like an oracle that a peace pleasing to God should be made, otherwise Germany will become prey to the enemies.</p>

      <p>I could write much more, but it is not safe to entrust these things to paper. May the Lord preserve you long for the Church. Greet your wife in my name and Mr. Pellican. Given at N., October 28, 1546. G. S. Your friend, well known to you by hand.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, etc.</p>
