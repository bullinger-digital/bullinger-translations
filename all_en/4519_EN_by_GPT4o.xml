      <p>Greetings. All your items, reverend father in Christ, have been delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I acknowledge the diligence, kindness, and indeed humility of your fatherhood, who instructs us so candidly and faithfully about all matters, and we hope that your labor will also have its reward. I am returning the theses of the adversaries, and I hope to send back the rest in 8 days when a reliable courier is available. I do not doubt that my letters have been delivered to you in return, some of which I gave to Paul Pul, the Landammann of Davos, and others wrapped in a booklet, which our consul took charge of delivering.</p>
      <p>The booklet should be given to Mr. Lavater, and if it seems worthy of reading, it should be published; if not, and you think otherwise, I do not care much. For I do not value my work so highly as to wish to impose it on anyone, especially with such a great abundance of writings that have treated the same subject. But it is almost customary that domestic writings are read while foreign ones are neglected.</p>
      <p>Thus, I hoped that my writings could be read here and elsewhere in the Confederation not without benefit. However, I leave this entirely to your discretion. - Furthermore, know that we are vigilant and daily discover the strange practices and singular treachery of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>But I remember this: "Do not yield to misfortunes, but go forth more boldly against them." You understood what the bishop could do among the people of Sutz: they have decided, they do not want to burden themselves with the matter, and even if it leads to war, they will sit quietly, while in the meantime, the papal communities in the Upper Confederation have conducted themselves excellently concerning this cause. Not content with this, the people of Sutz sent Peter Planta here to Chur, who also tried to disturb everything here.</p>
      <p>Nor did he fail himself, and with the episcopal faction, he attempted to turn many away by approaching first one group, then another. But in vain; for he found here in Chur those who openly opposed him to his face.</p>
      <p>You will gather that the rumor about the bishop was not entirely unfounded from the fact that the chaplain of the Bishop of Chur was seen in the bishop's court after the bishop's return to us. Added to this is that a certain priest, a doctor of theology, an old man, once summoned by our bishop from Rome to these parts, who presided over the church in Ems, which is half a mile from Chur, and did not hesitate during his sermons to call the people of Chur and Zurich heretics and condemn them. (He often said: the heretic at Chur at St. Martin; likewise the Zurichers, who print rogue books. Therefore, he did not dare to come to Chur; we also did not press him on this because he made our case good with his great indiscretion). This same man pretended three months ago to go to Rome and left from here. However, it is said that he was in Trento in the meantime, and now, when our envoys were going to Baden, he encountered them in Walenstadt and has as a companion a priest from Pfäfers, a young Tschudi, a cunning man. This Tschudi had said here a few months ago: "Let St. Michael's Day come, then we will lie," when the conversation was about the people of Glarus. From this, we see that this is an old practice and that this priest is also involved in the game.</p>
      <p>This doctor, when found in Wesen by Süler, who was once the bishop's chamberlain, and asked how he came there, whether he had not been to Rome, answered: "I do not know where I have been; tell the bishop, my gracious lord, he is too harsh (as if to say: he must spend more), and the council proceeds on its own, and I have arranged everything with Cornelius (who he is, I do not know)." It also contributes to this that Peter Planta of Sutz insinuates to everyone or at least tries to insinuate that the pope is not involved in this war; in this way, he hopes that our bishop will also be excused.</p>
      <p>But this very thing by which he wants to excuse himself accuses and makes the matter suspicious; for when G. Carlin heard this, he said: "Whoever says that the pope is not involved in the game lies like a rogue; for I know the whole foundation, and what the envoys of the five places promised the pope in Rome, and I heard it from the envoys themselves, who thought I was one of theirs." Thus he spoke. Also: "The Bishop of Chur spends eighteen hundred crowns every month on the table and otherwise in a confederation." Thus Carlin heard in Baden from them. Believe me, father, the practice of the Plantas is manifold and the faction strong. I experience daily how excellently I have been deceived by many.</p>
      <p>One thing is missing that I would like to know: whether it was done against the Bishop of Constance, about which Mr. Coignetius could secretly inform us. - I must not omit this: The Gallen merchants from Constance traveled through here these days; they informed the mayor (from whom I) how the confederates are meeting, and their meeting began on October 22, and they wrote to their governor from that day, and in such a way, as they understood, that nothing but war. And although it is not customary in Constance to let anyone in at night, a messenger from the confederates came at midnight, and they quickly let him in. These things they affirmed, trustworthy noblemen, the Gallen merchants from Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>The mayor and I could not resolve this; they also could not say from which places the letter was written; but that it came from the confederates who are meeting, they confirmed clearly and for certain. But now, as I hear from you that they are meeting in Lucerne, I can well perceive who sent the letter, namely the five places that have some secret practice with Ferdinand at the instigation of the pope. Therefore, let one be on guard, and if the Bolwyler first wants to accept soldiers on this writing, the matter does not look good.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this.</p>
      <p>It is also said that the nobility is meeting in Bregenz; you may know better.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Mr. Philippus and Pontisella, with all yours, wish you well. Chur, October 28, 1560.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in humanity, learning, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
