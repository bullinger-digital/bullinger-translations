      <p>Venerable and kind, dear lord and friend, I have received your letter along with the enclosed Latin concept and have read it thoroughly, and I am so pleased with your honorable exhortation not to consent to the universal council that I will send it to my king along with my own persuasions, which I have firmly, without delay, hoping to God that it will turn out well. Whatever response I receive on this matter, I will not keep it from you. Your writing is the pure truth, and for well-known reasons, I believe the king will be pleased with it, and it will be a very necessary work.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I express my sincere thanks for your faithful sympathy, which you bear with me, and I shall not withhold from you that on the last Tuesday, the people of Basel once again sent for me and reminded me of their long-held freedom, the eternal peace, and the renewed alliance made with my king, established and sworn, of my steadfast loyalty, and that I have purchased and paid for houses and estates here with their mayor and court's approval for 2000 florins, consumed 10000 florins here in 3 years, and built much, improved their city well, and that I have moved here with their foreknowledge and will, and have lived here quietly and Christianly with my household, adhering to their city's statutes and regulations in clothing and all other matters, and that I, especially as one driven out for the sake of the beloved word of God and the salvation of the fatherland, knowing that the pure word of God is preached among them purely and clearly, have preferred to come to them to spend my money, have been informed that a council has once again, and over my written protest, decided to tell me that I should change my residence to France, to another place in the Confederation, or elsewhere, where I could and might, to prevent war, unrest, which might befall them from some Confederates. Now you can well understand how it would be for me to move to France, whose language I do not know, and above all, I must leave the dear word of God. And if I were to negotiate with the emperor; wherever I might come, if I should not come to that place, how it is also ill to me for the reasons mentioned. Therefore, my most confident request is to give me faithful fatherly advice on where I should turn, and since the time is short, to inform me first, and whether you hope to intercede with my lord in Zurich and ask to perhaps place me in a corner until God from heaven, as is already in sight for His praise, sends improvement. In this, I ask for your faithful advice.</p>
      <p>I also have no new news, except that Lord Hans von Heideck and Mansfeld are now said to be strong with 16000 foot soldiers and 3000 horsemen, and 800 horses are joining them in a group. Among them, there are said to be 1500 musketeers who have given the city of Torgau the artillery instead of a dance, both the bishoprics of Magdeburg and Werden along with the strong castle of Rothenburg entirely within, and also Duke Eric of Brunswick's land, and now they are going against Duke Henry. On the other hand, the opposition from the Netherlands and the upper regions is said to be strengthening greatly. In summary, I believe there will be or has now been a brave battle. May the merciful God support His saving word. They have taken our advice and good opinion away in trust before this time; I am confident they will not live long behind themselves and will not celebrate for long. I also notice well that money is not yet lacking; I am confident of further supplies; may God from heaven send it well. Amen. I should not have withheld all this from you, my highly trusted kind lord. Herewith, wishing you, along with your wife and children, a happy new year. Dated Basel, January 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>S[ebastian] S[chertlin], knight, wrote. To the honorable, my most gracious lord H. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
