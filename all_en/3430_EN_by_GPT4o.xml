      <p>Greetings. When I considered your venerable age, the greatness of your intellect, the richness of your learning, and on the other hand, my own youth, the poverty of my intellect, the barrenness of my knowledge, most learned of all men, and when I contemplated the many reasons that demanded a letter from me, I hesitated for some time, whether I should write or remain silent. While I was long trying to dispel this doubt and achieved nothing, my sense of humanity came to mind; it gave me good hope that you would take kindly whatever little letter it might be that was sent by me.</p>
      <p>Relying on this kindness, I dared to entrust this very brief letter of mine to this messenger to be delivered to you. For military service has made many illustrious, but especially when they were men: learning has made many famous, but after many labors spent in studies; but how much happier I will be than them, if it should happen to me to have your friendship and through you to be of some renown, especially now, when neither age in military matters nor judgment in letters can in any way make me distinguished among my people.</p>
      <p>That this can happen is a fact more evident than can be denied, since you, for your outstanding virtues and singular learning and rare piety, are said to be and indeed are among the learned the most learned. Farewell and do not forget your Nikolaus, I beg you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 9th day of December, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your ever most devoted Nikolaus Dlusius, the Pole.</p>
      <p>Greet, if you please, your wife in my name and others who will inquire about me, whom I know will indeed be few. To the most learned, most pious, and most wise man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, my lord and reverend father, always to be honored. In Zürich.</p>
