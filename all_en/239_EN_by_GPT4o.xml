      <p>S. D. I beseech you, my dear Bullinger, not to take it badly that my letters occasionally interrupt your studies. Such is the condition of my fortune now that I must rely on the services of friends; but if ever the opportunity arises to serve you and other friends in return, I will be most ready.</p>
      <p>I am deeply troubled by my wife's health, which makes my exile exceedingly burdensome. I move back and forth between my children and my bedridden wife, and thus I am afflicted and wearied not only by physical discomfort but also by mental disturbances, so that I repeatedly cry out: How long, O Lord, how long. I have neither the use nor the knowledge of domestic affairs, the care of which I have hitherto been accustomed to cast upon my wife's shoulders; therefore, I am insufficient for the care of myself, my wife, and my children. Meanwhile, all my studies lie neglected, and touched by the memory of them, I proclaim you and those like you, who are still established in peace, to be thrice blessed; but such is the will of the Lord; may His name be blessed forever. There will come a time when we shall feel the benefit and fruit of these tribulations, as many of us as endure the burden of exile for the sake of the faith and confession of the Gospel of God. Meanwhile, I commend myself to your faith and that of the other brothers, whom the Lord, I pray, may deign to preserve in peace and the tranquil exercise of piety. Amen.</p>
      <p>Please send these letters, which you will find addressed to Hervagius, to Basel when the opportunity arises; I would not burden you with this kind of duty if it were possible to use another means. If you have any news about your affairs and those of the people of Constance, let me know. Bucer writes nothing certain yet about the people of Strasbourg, but he writes consistently about the Saxons and the maritime cities, that they are unwilling to accept that leaven of hypocrisy. The voice of the Lord is: beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; let it be observed by all the pious as a certain heavenly admonition.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest of men. A decision will have to be made about my affairs when my wife recovers; meanwhile, however, if any suitable opportunity arises for me to serve some church, you can let me know. Greetings to your wife and children in my name and that of mine, and finally to all the brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 23 August 1548.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, yours in all things.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
