    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger encloses a letter from [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater about a possible alliance between Zurich and Constance]. - [Haab and Lavater] ask Blarer to once again admonish Konrad Zwick to keep his [military] skills secret; at the moment they cannot deal with it, as they are negotiating with Schaffhausen regarding [the jurisdiction over] the [Rhine] bridge and with the lawyers [of Ferdinand I., Hans Jakob von Landau and Hans Melchior Heggentzer at Wasserstelzen] and Stein [am Rhein] [about the sale of the Hegau communities Bibern and Ramsen]. - Bullinger hopes that the Confederates will write to the city [council]. When the Confederate messenger sent to the Emperor [Charles V.] has returned, a day [in Baden] will be set to discuss the drafting of such a letter; [due to the relocation of the city council to Worms] a provisional letter from Zurich to Ulm is unnecessary. - Bullinger thanks for the sending of the messenger and conveys the 24 Batzen. - Bullinger will write to [Wolfgang] Musculus as soon as he has time. If Blarer writes to Musculus, he should convey New Year's greetings. - Greetings to Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Please faithfully deliver the enclosed letter, which was entrusted to me by my lords, the mayors. I do not know what it is about, but I think it concerns the matter I previously wrote to you about.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned lords have also very kindly and earnestly urged me to ask and admonish you to speak and act faithfully with your dear cousin Konrad Zwick, so that he may continue to act discreetly as he has done so far, and not reveal the skills he undoubtedly received from God for the comfort of his own and not against his own, to the bloody princes. He should keep them for the benefit of the believers and act accordingly, as he himself knows better according to his wisdom and reason, which he is obliged to do before God. At the moment, it is not possible for them to deal with him, as they are otherwise burdened with business; they will both ride away in the coming days, and when they return home, they will have to visit for a few days, first with those from Schaffhausen regarding their bridge and my lords' rights, then with the Roman king's lawyers concerning the monastery Stein and the tithes in Hegau, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the writing of the Confederates to the free and imperial cities, I hope it will be undertaken and have precedence. Perhaps Zurich has now written in haste to Ulm, reporting that they are hopeful, and when it is brought up at the next Confederate day, they will all be very pleased with it, etc. However, as it may have been requested, as we now understand from your writing, it will be taken into consideration, as far as I have understood from my lords, the mayors. No specific day has been set. But when the messenger sent to the Emperor returns with a response, it is thought that the day will be set, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the messenger, they are satisfied; you have done my lords a favor and not acted unjustly. Here are the 24 Batzen with friendly thanks and an offer to serve you willingly. Do as we trust you. I will write to Musculus, my dearest brother, when I have more leisure; if you ever write to him, please convey my wishes for a very happy year. God be with you all. Greet my dear lords Thomas Blarer, brother, and Konrad Zwick, etc. January 4, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his always esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
