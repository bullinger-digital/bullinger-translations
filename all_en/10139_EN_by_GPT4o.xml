      <p>Grace and peace from God our Lord beforehand, dear brothers.</p>
      <p>We have understood your message and, after all, etc., have commonly and unanimously advised and decided among ourselves, regardless of the agreement and interaction of those from Strasbourg and Luther in the same, to remain true and steadfast (constant) to the holy word of God, as maintained in our disputation and preached by us until now, without any change, etc. Therefore, we have also most faithfully admonished and requested you to remain true and steadfast to the same, as you have promised, as we hope; we want to see what God will further work through and with us, may He also preserve us all in His name and blessing with the power of His spirit, which we especially wish for you.</p>
      <p>Dated July 9, in the year etc. 32.</p>
      <p>Your willing common brothers, servants in the word, from the city and territory of Bern, along with some from Solothurn and Biel, at the discussion in Zofingen.</p>
      <p>To the honorable servants and leaders (supervisors) in the word of the Lord, Zurich, our especially faithful dear brothers.</p>
