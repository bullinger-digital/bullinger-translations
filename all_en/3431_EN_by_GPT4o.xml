      <p>Greetings. Dearest compater in the Lord, I received the letter you sent me on the third of this month, along with the gift sent to my son Johann Heinrich, for which we give you the greatest thanks possible for your kindness and generosity. We pray that this year will be especially happy for your entire household in the Lord and also not inconvenient according to the world. As for the mutual exchange of letters, it is so far from being the case that I should be upset by the rarity of your letters to me, that it is more fitting for me to ask your pardon for not writing to you more frequently; but I know you understand well enough how sluggish and cold old age is, and therefore you are abundantly content if our friendship is in the truth of Christ, even if nothing comes of letters. Our compater Haller, being younger, is also more eager and quicker to write. Therefore, I do not doubt that he fulfills whatever duty there is, especially in serious matters, the communication of which is required for the common cause of our churches. If you have anything about the assembly and colloquy at Worms, especially about its conclusion, please share it briefly. I promised myself nothing good from that colloquy at the beginning, nor do I doubt that its outcome is such that it becomes clear to all that it was established by human counsel, not divine. I saw your archigrammateus returned here from France, a man of honest stature and form and a very pleasant face. I greeted him briefly after the sermon, although I did not know who he was; for I only learned later from Mr. Haller who he was; therefore, I ask you to excuse me to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest compater.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours in my name and in the name of mine, along with all your fellow ministers, not only the Germans but also the Italians, Mr. Peter Martyr and Mr. Bernardino, dearest brothers in the Lord. Bern, December 11, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest lord and compater. Zurich.</p>
