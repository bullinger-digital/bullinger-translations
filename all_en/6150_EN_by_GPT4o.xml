      <p>Now I receive a letter from Augsburg from a distinguished man who knows much; he writes, among other things, as follows: "On the 8th of May, I received certain news from Vienna that the Roman Emperor is sick unto death and has renounced all temporal matters. He has also handed over all his secret councils to the Roman King and earnestly asked them to accept him as their lord. He also has all his children with him to bid them a final farewell, and it is quite evident, and people now fear great unrest as soon as His Majesty closes his eyes for good."</p>
      <p>In addition, the aforementioned writes that now many are already planning and instigating much here and there upon the Emperor's death, some clergy out of great fear, others for other reasons; but the Emperor had long ago prophesied to the clergy that once he closes his eyes, their cause will be no more.</p>
      <p>But they will not yield to other people's great harm without taking many with them, so they must go to ruin. Thus he.</p>
      <p>Huser, our mayor, who will ensure this is delivered to you, cannot deliver it himself due to business; he will return here again today. Through him, if you have any news from the recent Lyon fairs, as you always do, please share it with me, I earnestly beseech you again and again. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet your family along with all the brothers and friends, to whom commend me to Christ in a Christian manner. Winterthur, 26th of May, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer... forgive me.</p>
