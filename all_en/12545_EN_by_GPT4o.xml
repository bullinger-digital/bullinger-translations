    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller has received two letters [shipments] from Bullinger. The first on July 3, [among others] with Bullinger's letter from June 29 [No. 2479]. In it, he was admonished to be brave. Meanwhile, Bullinger will have received Haller's letters [No. 2462, No. 2467, and No. 2473] and noted Haller's determination. Haller is a Swiss, a Christian, a man, and a pastor. Why should he fear the threats of the Emperor [Charles V] or the Pope [Paul III]? Everyone admires his courage. His sermons attract so many listeners that the regular seats are not enough. He possesses the faith that Bullinger taught him and is ready to suffer for Christ, even to die. His [wife Elsbeth, née Kambli] shares this attitude. Haller has left his homeland, his family, and his friends for Christ. This should sufficiently prove his willingness to obey God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In the same letter, Bullinger advised him to be cautious with his communications to the doctor Jakob [Ruf]. Haller knows that he cannot keep anything to himself. However, he does not understand what in his letters could have led this person or the father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli] to the opinion that he was afraid. He only shared things that were already known anyway. Be that as it may, he will no longer write to either of them. He includes a short letter for the father-in-law to dissuade him from his false opinion. Bullinger should also defend Haller against the unjustified slanders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Along with the letter [from June 29], Haller also received the short letter from June 27 [not received] with similar admonitions. The colleagues [in Augsburg] thank for the public prayers of the [Zurichers].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- On July 7, Bullinger's letter from July 1 [not received] arrived. Haller was very pleased because it clearly expressed a better opinion of him. With this letter, Haller also received a letter from [Rudolf] Gwalther and notes on the Book of Jonah. Rightly, Bullinger believes that given the [tense] situation, sermons on this book would be appropriate. However, another colleague is already preaching [...] about it. In calmer times, he would have liked to interpret the Book of Genesis. Instead, he has now begun to preach on the Book of Judges, as it also fits the situation in Augsburg. He uses the notes he made during Bullinger's lectures on it. The Book of Judges, like the Book of Jonah, calls for repentance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller has not yet heard anything about the Confederates and their decision. It is true that one should not rely on people. However, it is not reprehensible to want to seek the help of the good. Haller also wants the Confederates to continue to be appreciated. Should they refuse their help to the [Schmalkaldic League], they would bitterly disappoint everyone. Haller would also be blamed, and he himself would find it hard to bear that the Helvetians would calmly watch the downfall of Germany, to which they themselves belong! Undoubtedly, decisions have already been made [at the Diet] in Baden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller would like to write frequently, but currently, there is a lack of messengers. He sends the present letter via Ulm. Bullinger will probably receive it late.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The Emperor had about 6000 soldiers in Füssen, which belongs to the Bishop of Augsburg, [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], and others in Eichstätt. Augsburg was the target of an attack. Therefore, they wrote hastily to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and the [evangelical imperial] estates and began recruiting mercenaries. On July 4, 13 companies with 5600 soldiers were mustered in Augsburg. Ten of the companies bore the coats of arms of Augsburg as field signs. The other three had a white field sign with golden inscriptions. On [Hans Wilpert] Zoller's field sign it says: "Fight for the Fatherland!". On the second: "God's Word endures forever". On the third is a red rooster with the inscription: "Defend yourself, our rooster!", which of course refers to [Philipp of Hesse], as Gwalther knows. Meanwhile, the people of Ulm and Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg have also mustered troops. But no one knew for what purpose. Secretly, [Sebastian] Schertlin had agreed with Württemberg and Ulm to march against the [imperial] army in Füssen. In Augsburg, no one knew about it. To lay a false trail, a company was sent from the camp towards Dillingen on July 5. Thus, Füssen was not prepared for an attack. On July 6, no one was allowed to leave the city [Augsburg], but everyone was allowed to enter. From 4 p.m., the cavalry gathered at the wine market. They left the city with freight wagons, cannons, and field equipment. The 12 companies camped outside the city, including not a few Confederates, then immediately set off and gathered at this very market. At nightfall, Schertlin gave them a speech, which Haller could not hear. But he heard everyone enthusiastically shout "Yes!". Then the army, accompanied by a pastor [Johann Flinner], set off towards Denklingen. There, neither the peasants nor the [Catholic pastor] [...] and the bailiff [...] refused them the purchase of provisions. Schertlin then had their houses plundered and the plunder destroyed. When the army arrived in front of Füssen on Thursday [July 8], the [imperial] army had withdrawn to various areas of Bavaria. Afterwards, the contingent from Ulm and Württemberg, as well as troops from Kempten, joined [Schertlin's] army and attacked Füssen. The place surrendered on Friday morning [July 9]. The pass [Ehrenberg], which belonged to [King] Ferdinand, was also taken. Allegedly, Schertlin is sending 200 wagonloads of grain to [Augsburg], which he captured in the monastery [St. Mang] in Füssen. His troops leave the population in peace and only confiscate the property of the monks and priests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Emperor has at most four companies with him at the Regensburg [Diet]. The [Catholic bishops] promise him much but deliver little. The Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] is said to have reminded the Emperor of his oath to them and the empire in Regensburg on behalf of the electors. He is said to have quoted Julius Caesar: "In the interest of the empire, an oath may well be broken."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- On July 3 at midnight, a severe fire broke out in the Regensburg monastery [St. Jakob]. Three chamberlains [of Charles V] lost their lives. Fortunately, gunpowder stored nearby did not explode! Otherwise, half the city would have been destroyed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Landgrave is arming. He has provided several places in [Hesse] with troops and risked the rest. Allegedly, he wants to march against the [imperial] troops in Eichstätt. King [Christian III] of Denmark has sent troops to Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony. The Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and [Elector Friedrich of the] Palatinate are holding out bravely. [Elector Joachim II of] Brandenburg would also like to [arm], but he is bankrupt. What the bishops are plotting is unknown. The greatest danger, however, comes from the advancing Spaniards and Italians. It is hoped that the Confederates [will deny them passage].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Last week, Albrecht, the son of Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria, and [Anna of Austria], the daughter of Ferdinand, got married. The Emperor is said to be going to Munich this week.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Allegedly, Pope [Paul III] has died. In Augsburg, a joke is being told about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- As soon as Haller receives reliable news, he will report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Greetings. In Zurich, they should continue to pray for God's church. Gwalther is thanked for what was sent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Only after [dinner] did Haller meet the [letter] carrier [...], who is leaving for Ulm tomorrow. So it has already become 11 o'clock at night!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [Enclosure:] This week, for the first time in many years, the [Augsburg] Great Council met. They unanimously decided to defend the Gospel. It is hard to believe how much the patricians who fled from Augsburg tried to push the city towards an understanding with the Emperor. Presumably, the Fuggers and the others will never return because of the people's anger. That would be good!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Of the 200 wagons [with grain] mentioned above, 70 have meanwhile arrived.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Today, ten companies of the [Schmalkaldic League] are supposed to march to Innsbruck to block the passage for the [Italians and Spaniards]. Allegedly, the Grisons want to help the [Schmalkaldic League] with this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- It is considered certain that the Turks have arrived in Buda with numerous troops.</p>

      <p>Health and life through the Savior Christ, etc. I have already received two letters from you, venerable father. The first, which you wrote on the day of Peter and Paul, I received on July 3. In it, you ask two things of me: first, that in the present dangers I should be strong and fearless, and also be an example of courage to others. However, from the letters you have received from me in the meantime, you have understood, I believe, what kind of person I am; and I will continue to be such as long as I live. I fear God, yet I do not doubt His goodness. Why should I fear a mortal man, who passes like a flower and withers like grass? Hence, "I do not fear the threats of the emperor or the pope," to speak in verse. I therefore ask you not to persuade yourself of anything else about me than that I am a Swiss, a Christian, a man, a pastor. Why should he fear the wolf? Indeed, I present myself to everyone in such a way (although I write unwillingly, lest I seem to want to praise myself; but since you write as if you suspect my courage and constancy, I cannot refrain from writing - but take it in good part), that all admire the unshaken hope and courage that is in me. Therefore, I now have such a frequent audience that it cannot accommodate everyone, but they listen to me with ladders brought in. But why do I write this? I prefer to express what kind of person I am by deeds rather than words. I seek only this, that you recognize me as having such faith, which I learned especially from you, that I would like to testify to it with my blood, if it pleases the Lord, and I will glory in the cross of my Savior and say that it has gone well with me. For I am unworthy to suffer anything for Christ. My family feels the same way. We know that he lives unhappily who does not live in Christ. Hence we desire to live with Him, whether in the present or in the future, if it is not allowed in this world. Why then should we not hope well, since our life cannot be taken from us? For life is Christ. Indeed, you would more rightly call the present life death than life. I am ready, in short, to do and suffer whatever He wills, who brought me out of my homeland. For if I had not wanted to follow Him, I would never have left my homeland, parents, friends, but would have obstinately freed myself from this yoke like the others. Therefore, I think this obedience of mine is a sufficiently clear example of how I am affected towards my God. May the Lord preserve this spirit in me and increase it by His Spirit. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The second thing you ask is that I write prudently to Jacob the surgeon, my relative, which brother Gwalther also advises. I thank you. I know what he is like, full of leaks. But indeed I do not know if I wrote anything to him by which I could be accused of either cowardice or infidelity; so also to my father-in-law. I wrote simply what was then common knowledge. But since you prudently and piously advise, I will obey you and will not write to them in the future, lest I give them material for spreading vain and trivial things about me. I write here a few things to my father-in-law, in which I clear myself if he has conceived any negative opinion about me. I also write to him joyful things, as I will also inform you about the present state, as you ordered. In short, I ask you to defend me against these slanders, into which I have imprudently fallen while trying to act prudently. I wish to be regarded as I am. For I do not think a minister can commit anything more disgraceful at this time than to be of a dejected spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Along with these, I also received a short letter written on June 27, in which you advise the same as in the others. The brothers gratefully received that you have instituted public prayers for us. They gave great thanks to the Lord and to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Then on July 7, I received another letter from you written on the first of July, which I was very pleased with, because from it I understood that you think better of me than in the previous ones. With these, I also received a letter from my dearest brother Gwalther and some notes on Jonah. You prudently advise that I should take this (the book of Jonah) for interpretation; which I had also previously decided, unless another minister had anticipated me. Therefore, since if the times had been peaceful, I would have expounded Genesis, I have now taken up the book of Judges, which is most suitable for our republic. For this purpose, I am greatly helped by what I once wrote down from your mouth and have greatly achieved with annotations. This plan also pleases the church, and they listen with great applause, because I imitate your method in application as much as I can. It teaches repentance just as Jonah does, whose preaching is certainly very necessary in our time. Therefore, we are all diligent, and indeed we feel great progress in our church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>You write nothing about the Swiss, because you had nothing at the time. Therefore, I still do not know what they are going to do. I know it is cursed to trust in man, yet I do not think it impious to seek the help of the good. And I especially desire this, not because I think we will perish without their help, but because I would like them to preserve the reputation and goodwill that all good people have of them. For you know how much bitterness will arise against them if they refuse. Moreover, I am very concerned about this matter. I promise nothing, I deny nothing. I command to hope in God. Meanwhile, I would certainly be much worse off. Furthermore, I could hardly bear it if I heard even one of the Swiss complain about faith, while they quietly watched the destruction of Germany, of which they themselves are a part. However, I do not doubt that it has already been decided at the Baths what they are going to do, although I still do not know. These are in response to yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Since you ask that I write frequently, I will do so diligently, wherever I can have messengers, of which we are now certainly lacking; for I am sending these to Ulm, not doubting that you will receive them late.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>These are the news with us, and thus our situation is: The Emperor has sent up to 6000 soldiers to Füssen (which belongs to the Bishop of Augsburg), and another group to Eichstätt. Thus, the plan was made against Augsburg. Our people have hastily written to the Landgrave and all the estates and begun to recruit soldiers. On July 4, 13 companies were mustered in our city: up to 5600 soldiers, all in the city's colors, except for three, which are entirely white. On one banner with golden letters: "Fight for the Fatherland". This is carried by Zoller, indeed with great applause from all (I have instructed him on what a soldier should be; his affairs are well). On the second banner: "The word of the Lord endures forever". On the third banner, a red rooster with golden claws and comb, and above it written: "Defend yourself, our rooster". It is good landgrave-like, as Gwalther knows. Meanwhile, the people of Ulm have also gathered some cohorts, and the Duke of Württemberg has conscripted strong soldiers. No one knew where from, what they intended to do. Schertlin had posted at night and made a plan with Württemberg and Ulm to march on the same day to Füssen against that group. But no one in Augsburg knew about it. On July 5 in the morning, a company was sent from the camp (for all the soldiers were camped outside the city) a mile towards Dillingen, which is the bishop's seat, with the sole intention of spreading the rumor among the people that they intended to go to Dillingen, so that those in Füssen would not become aware that they were going against them. The whole day after that, the gates were closed. No one was allowed out, but everyone was allowed in. Around 4 in the evening, a cavalry group gathered unexpectedly in the city at the wine market. They waited until about 5 before they came together. Then they went out with some cavalry to the gate. Soon they began to bring other cavalry, then 17 large cannons, then hoes, shovels, storm ladders. No one knew what it would become. Likewise, the camp broke up, the 12 remaining companies moved to the wine market. There they waited for the decision, among them not a few Confederates. When it was almost night, Colonel Schertlin came, made a speech to the group; I do not know what, yet they all shouted "Yes" with great joy. Upon that, the departure happened with great joy. With them, a pastor was sent. When they came to Denklingen (a village), they asked for provisions for money. The peasants gave what they had (it was paid for honorably). Only the priest and bailiff did not want to do it. Schertlin gave their houses to the soldiers to plunder and make a heap. They quickly tore it apart. On Thursday morning, they came before Füssen. The group fled, scattered here and there into Bavaria. Then the Ulm and Württemberg troops came together with them, also other companies from Kempten, etc. Then they shot into the small town, which surrendered to them on Friday morning. Then they advanced, took a castle and fortress belonging to Ferdinand in the mountains, a mile from Füssen. What they will do next, I do not know. I was told today that Schertlin sent 200 wagons with grain into the city, which he found in the monastery at Füssen. They leave everyone else in peace. Only what is monks and priests, they share with them. They do nothing to them in life. These are about our affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Emperor has no more than 4 companies with him at Regensburg. The priests promised much, now they deliver little. The Archbishop of Mainz is said to have come to him with 300 horses in the name of all the electors, to remind him of the oath he swore to them and the empire. They say he said that tyrannical saying of Julius Caesar: "If an oath is to be violated, it should be violated for the sake of the empire."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>On July 3 at midnight, a great fire broke out in a monastery in Regensburg, so that many burned, among them also three of the emperor's chamberlains. Not far from there was a large heap of barrels of gunpowder. If it had come to the same, they think half the city would have been destroyed. But God spared the pious, showing the emperor what he might well do if he wanted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Landgrave is in great armament. He has occupied several cities in the land, the rest as if struck in the air. They say he is marching against the group that is in Eichstätt, to break it up. The King of Denmark also sends aid to the elector. Cologne and the Palatinate hold themselves well. Brandenburg would like to; so he is ruined. What the bishops are plotting is now uncertain. The greatest danger seems to be from the Spaniards and Italians coming, in which part the faith of the Swiss is greatly desired.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Last week, the wedding of Albert, son of the Duke of Bavaria, with Ferdinand's daughter took place. It is uncertain what monster is being nurtured. The emperor will come to Munich this week.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The rumor is with us that the pope has died, from which some of ours made this jest about him: "The devil is so idle that he had to leave hell. Therefore, he took the pope and set him as his deputy, since he knew no one who could manage his affairs better."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>These are what I had, dearest father Bullinger, to write to you now hastily, partly in German, partly in Latin. Take it in good part, I beseech you. There are many other things, but uncertain. What is certain, I have written. As soon as I can, I will write more.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Greet the brothers, and as you have begun, continue faithfully to pray to the Lord for His church. We do the same unceasingly. Thank Mr. Gwalther for what he sent me. Farewell with all your family and live happily. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>In Augsburg, July 12, already sounding 11 at night; for I just found the messenger after dinner, who will leave for Ulm tomorrow. Therefore, forgive me.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>This almost slipped my mind, which I especially wanted you to know. This week a great council was held, which has not happened in many years. There, a whole unanimous agreement was made, they want to commit body, honor, goods, and blood to the Gospel and this cause. By what means those who fled, more powerful, try to draw ours into a not very honorable agreement with the emperor, is indescribable; but they labor in vain. For this, as I said, was concluded in that universal council. I do not believe the Fuggers and others will ever return to the city; the people are so exceedingly angry with them. If that happens, our republic will be much better off.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I wrote above about 200 wagons, of which 70 have already arrived, which I saw. It is up to 600 bushels of grain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>And this: the rumor comes that today 10 companies of ours are marching to Innsbruck to take and occupy the land, so that the foreign troops present cannot come out. To this, they say, the Bündner want to help them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>These on July 13 in the morning.</p>
      <p>It is most certain that the Turks have arrived in Buda with great forces.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
