      <p>God with His grace be with us. Regarding the letter, it was not handled honestly and did not proceed without deceit; however, I am glad that nothing was found in it that could harm you or me. I gave the letter to young master Hans Butler, my godfather, and I do not know how he took care of it; yet I sent it to him and read the letter to him, after which he went to learn about the matter, and he will report to you; I would not place much on the matter, etc.</p>
      <p>I am very eager to know the punishment and confession of the Pythoness; for it is a matter of rare example in our age. How I wish that Christoph could obtain the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg, but I fear the Austrian and Spanish harpies; however, God lives.</p>
      <p>I received the letters you sent from Musculus; which I received from him in turn, indeed the last ones written, I share with you, so that you may return them the following week.</p>
      <p>I could not describe anything. I wish the things received about the Magdeburgers are true.</p>
      <p>This month I received letters written from England on October 20th and published from Strasbourg on November 21st. The course of the word of God is not hindered in England.</p>
      <p>Our Hopper is doing well and conducts himself bravely; he opposes the Bishop of London himself, who wishes to burden him with I don't know what ceremonies. Hopper, after the laying on of hands as handed down by the apostles, does not endure anything being imposed in the inauguration. The dispute is under judgment. Otherwise, in England, what happens elsewhere happens; many use the freedom of the flesh as a pretext for the license of the flesh; but these are the customs of the last age. I wish the Lord would soon come to judge the living and the dead. The best things are hoped for in England; the king grows in both age and holy manners; may the Lord grant him to persevere, so that he does not follow in the footsteps of Joash. Farewell, dearest brother, and write more frequently. Why is there so much silence about the Emperor? I think the rumors about Schwendi gathering soldiers are vain. December 5, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and brother, Master Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur.</p>
