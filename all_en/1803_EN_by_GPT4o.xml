      <p>Greetings. I wrote yesterday about other matters. Now I have nothing, except that I received these from Mr. Charles du Moulin (about whom you inquire in your letters, what he is doing), in which you will learn from him himself what he is doing and where, so that I do not need to write about it.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote some things about him, which I do not know if you have received. You know part of the story of the Transylvanian pastor; we expect him today; when he arrives, I will write to you about what more I have learned. I will have the cause of Theobald, his companion, recommended to me. I will think about giving a minister to Count George of Württemberg; certainly, such Frenchmen as he seems to seek are rare. However, I will think about a pious, learned, modest, peaceful man. Meanwhile, may you and all yours fare well. We expect our Gwalther; Trempelius, who sends you many greetings along with him, also expects the same. Bern, February 7, 1553.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Viret writes that he will soon write to you; he does not have his nephew at home and has not yet arranged anything certain with Mr. Beza; however, as soon as this has been done, he will write to you, and he asks me to remind you of this.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
