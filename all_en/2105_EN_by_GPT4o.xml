      <p>S. Frisius, our mutual friend, will deliver to you a bundle of letters in my name, which you should send to Mr. Vergerius; I would like you to add this letter to the same bundle for him, which is included with this letter to you; for a new occasion to write has arisen after the bundle was already sealed. Therefore, you will ensure, with your usual kindness, that everything is safely transmitted to him at your convenience. While I was writing this, a rumor was brought from Como that the Pope has passed away in recent days; if this is true, it will be regrettable, especially because it will be difficult to find someone willing to succeed him. But let the dead bury their own dead. But you, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, fare well and convey my greetings to the reverend fathers and brothers there who know me. In Chiavenna, on the third day before the Ides of December 1553. Your most devoted Francesco Negri.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by him. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
