      <p>Greetings. Having returned from Heidelberg, where I had to go to intercede with the prince for the health of Mr. Burgius, that distinguished senator of Paris, I found your letters with Mr. Calvin, in which you explained the reasons why it does not seem expedient to you to hold a colloquium. But, to speak frankly, I feel entirely differently and do not see how we can excuse our actions before God and sensible men if we refuse to come to a just and equitably prescribed colloquium. Yet we will achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would not dare to hope for full agreement; but I cannot judge these plans to proceed from an evil spirit, whether I consider the matter itself, the aim of the plan, or even the persons who are managing this business. Therefore, I prefer to hope well with uncertain outcomes and commit everything to the Lord rather than despair once by relying on conjectures. Finally, I would rather embrace even the slightest hope and attempt everything in the Lord than confirm our adversaries by our refusal and cast the weaker into some doubt. Nor can I see with what face we can pray to God for the settlement of this dissension and yet not only not seek this remedy but also reject it when offered, which has always been and ought to be the one ordinary means in the church of God whenever there has been a dispute about doctrines. And would that we did not have in these regions such a recent and calamitous and sad example of synods being scorned! Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I feel this way and, since I can do nothing else, I wholeheartedly wish that others, who have more influence in this matter, would devote themselves entirely to obtaining and accomplishing this.</p>
      <p>This desire of mine is further increased by a new opportunity that has presented itself, about which I would have written to you earlier if a convenient messenger had been available. But I beseech you, my father, to keep this to yourself for a while, until the matter itself becomes apparent. When I had taken leave of the prince in Heidelberg, with whom, as I solemnly assure you, I had no conversation whatsoever about these matters, behold, a certain learned and pious man, very dear to the prince by his own merit, came to me unsolicited at my lodging and asked why I had done nothing about these matters; for the prince had expected it from me. I replied that I had no instructions from anyone on that matter and, moreover, that I did not dare to move anything in such inflamed matters. "Indeed," he said, "know that it was only due to one prince at the Diet of Augsburg that a free and Christian colloquium between our churches and yours was not established by the common will of the Protestant princes, unless perhaps you refused." "What then," I asked, "is all hope of this matter lost?" "On the contrary," he said, "I inform you that a certain prince of the greatest authority and dignity has the utmost willingness to accomplish this matter, so that this unfortunate controversy may once and for all be resolved by the judgment of learned and peaceable men, or at least be brought back to some equitable conditions, and thus we all who profess the same religion may finally be united by a common bond. But know this especially," he said, "that it is requested that your entire opinion be explained in a brief and as clear as possible writing, from which it can be plainly and certainly established in what matters we agree and disagree, and all the calumnies of some who do not cease to burden us with the princes may be cut off.</p>
      <p>For whatever has been written up to this day seems to most of us either too lengthy, or obscure, or ambiguous. Therefore, take care of this one thing immediately upon returning home: know that you will not have labored in vain in what you send to us. He added only this, that I should entrust it to only a very few men of complete faith, through whom I might judge that it could be accomplished as well as possible. Therefore, having returned home, I informed Calvin of these things, and now I thought it necessary to lay them before you, so that you may see what you think I should answer.</p>
      <p>Calvin himself wrote what he sends to you. I also, by his will and advice, have written something, distributed according to those questions about which I saw them most inquire and doubt. Whatever it is, I send it to you first, so that I may not err twice through imprudence, and also for another reason about which it is necessary that I deal with you separately in a few words. When the confession of Mr. Farel and myself, published with the late Palatine and the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, displeased you for two reasons, namely that we seemed to attribute more to the adversaries than was proper, and then that we had inscribed the name of your churches as well, when, I say, for that reason our action displeased you, you know that we both by letters and in person used that purgation which befits brothers agreeing with you in doctrine and spirit, and certainly we left you with the impression that we had fully satisfied you.</p>
      <p>For as far as doctrine is concerned, even if some things then written by us seem either ambiguous or not sufficiently explained, as could easily happen in such brevity, yet we testified, as I now also sincerely testify before the Lord: nothing was written by us except simply and with the best intention, nor did we ever think of departing even a little from the agreement of our churches. But it is certainly a hard condition to be so bound by certain syllables or words or forms of speaking that no account may be taken of those with whom we are dealing.</p>
      <p>For example, the name of substance does not please you to be used in any way, from which I also willingly abstained in the entire writing that I send to you. But our adversaries slander us for the matter of the sacrament, or for what is signified by the symbols, that we establish not the body but the spirit of Christ, and take away our union with Christ himself. Others say that we only deal with the fruits that we draw from Christ, not with Christ himself, as if anyone could draw anything from Christ who does not possess Christ himself.</p>
      <p>Others chatter that we attribute a spiritual body to Christ, which yet fits much better those who posit the ubiquity of the flesh. Therefore, if we argue with them, to avoid these slanders, we confess that Christ himself, or the body of Christ, is given to us, that is, not only the fruit and efficacy of Christ's death, but the very substance of Christ, so that being made one with him, all things are derived from him into us. Then, to remove all gross imagination, we say that this is done through faith, by the power of the Holy Spirit, although the flesh of Christ is in heaven and nowhere else, while the sacraments are with us on earth and nowhere else. I ask, is this to defect from our agreement? And when the Lord says: This is my body, and Paul says the bread is the communion of the body, do they understand it of a body that is devoid of substance? Finally, I would not wish to use the term substance otherwise than Mr. Martyr explained it in his preface to the Archbishop of Canterbury and in his Commentaries on the Corinthians, folio 302, at the beginning of the former page, from whom I do not dissent even a little, and therefore neither from you, as I think, nor from any of yours. As for the other matter, namely that we inscribed the name of the Helvetian churches in that confession, what I said in person I say again, by the grace of God I was never so impudent as to lie about the name of any church, or to wish to prescribe a form of confession to anyone, much less to you and so many churches. It never came to my mind, nor will it, I hope.</p>
      <p>But when I was asked what was taught about the sacraments in the French churches, could I dissemble what the matter was, or should I have said that it was their peculiar doctrine, and not rather testified to our mutual agreement? If I did not explain this aptly enough, it is my fault, which I have apologized for, and do apologize for, and will apologize for, whenever any error is pointed out to me. But this matter can bring no prejudice to those who were absent, and from whom I had no mandate. Therefore, if anything was done amiss, it is my fault, and this error can reflect on no one but Farel and myself. But you will say, this confession will be imposed on us.</p>
      <p>I do not see from where you infer this, and if it happens, which I do not think, is there not a ready exception for you, which you can confirm even by my own testimony? But they will infer that we do not agree among ourselves, and we will be set against each other. God grant better things.</p>
      <p>I will not consider any injury done to me in this matter, who, as I said before, neither could nor wished to dictate a form of confession to others, and they will vainly infer that I dissent from you, who in reality testify the contrary, and would rather die a thousand times than knowingly and deliberately deviate even a little from the agreement of our churches, so may God love me, who has united us mutually, and never, I hope, will he be so angry with me as to give occasion for disturbances in any churches. But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>Your piety, I am sure, will forgive me for having familiarly deposited all these things in your bosom, which were pressing upon me. But I ask you to freely not only admonish me but also rebuke and reproach me, in those matters in which you perceive I have erred, and in reality, as I hope, you will find that I am accustomed to attribute much more to your judgment and that of those like you than to myself: certainly, you will have done me a great favor if you will not be reluctant to read this writing of mine, which I send to you along with these letters, and to let me know whatever you find lacking in it when it is convenient for you.</p>
      <p>But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>About the miserable condition of the pious in Aachen, as well as in Trier and Metz, I suppose you have heard, but these are nothing compared to the most cruel slaughter that is being carried out in France and especially in Paris, and which our neighboring adversaries threaten us with. May the Lord comfort his own and crush Satan.</p>
