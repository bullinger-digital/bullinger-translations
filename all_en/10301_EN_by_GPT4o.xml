Emphasizes the greed for money of the Five Places and warns against accepting French pension funds. Reports on the indignation of some Basel councilors who had to observe in Zurich how the Catholic opponents are being flattered; Bullinger should be vigilant. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Whenever a courier is available, I write, provided there is a little time to spare. Therefore, I was surprised that you wrote that you almost conceived some evil due to my silence. However, I would not wish it to have been otherwise. For through this occasion, I have discovered your eagerness for my letters, which I am more than delighted about. You cannot desire them without love for me. Continue, for I also love and revere you, as you are worthy.</p>
      <p>At present, there is nothing else to write, except that you should know I cannot sufficiently admire the plans of God, by which He causes our adversaries to revel in gold and silver at this time, just as ducks do in water while they bathe. They seem not entirely unlike that Greek Alcmaeon, of whom you know, as he wallowed in the treasures of Croesus. For I see what I cannot express. A calamity is forthcoming, but when or what kind, God knows. But since nothing is clearer, while here they draw to themselves, one after another, than that no one can be satisfied - for they expose themselves to the desires of all - unless they also drag those whom they have not yet had as consenting to their depravity, it seems to be diligently incumbent upon everyone, but especially upon you, whose people they most seek, to ensure that no one is tainted by French gold or that of others. For as soon as this poison has intoxicated us, it is over for the gospel and therefore also for salvation. It comes to mind what you wrote a few months ago, fearing that if autumn deceives, poverty will drive the people astray. If God permits this, you see the opportunity for the people to be lost. We are otherwise more than prone to the desire for money. What do you think will happen if such an opportunity arises? Therefore, God must be prayed to, and we must work, sweat, cry out, and be vigilant, if by any means we can prevent what would be so unhappily harmful.</p>
      <p>Some senators from us were with you on the first day of the fair. How it grieved them, good God, when they saw dissimilar pairs marching through the city with drums sounding something joyful, I say dissimilar in people, not in affection. Does the Zurich magistrate lack love for his own to such an extent that he led before the eyes of the wretched those who recently inflicted such a disaster, especially at a time that by itself could renew the disaster? Indeed, it grieved me too when I heard them lamenting thus. Truly, to speak frankly, I cannot help but shudder at hearing their name alone. What if I see them? What if I see honor being shown by those whom they so recently oppressed? A bad sign, as it reveals the minds of those who can bear it without any trouble. I seem to see what it is, but it is not safe to say everything at all times. You make sure to be as you are judged by all, namely diligent, severe, never ceasing when you see wolves, indeed demons, rushing against your people.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord. I wish Utinger, Leo, and all to be safe.</p>
      <p>Basel, the first of October, in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant Antistes among the Zurichers, his esteemed lord.</p>
