      <p> Greetings. Although, reverend father in Christ, I have nothing of great importance to inform you, since a remarkably learned man, who is delivering this letter to you, is traveling to you, I did not want him to arrive without my letter to you. This is both so that he might come more recommended and so that, if you wish to hear any news from Italy, you might most conveniently learn from him as if from a living letter. Certainly, as far as I can judge, he is a learned and pious man, who, while professing himself a doctor of medicine, has also Christianly joined the reading of sacred literature, which I have very well understood from the conversations he had with me on the matter of religion. Therefore, I consider him entirely worthy of the kindness you are expected to show to pious and good men. Indeed, the modesty of the man pleases me exceedingly, which, when combined with rare learning, arouses a wonderful love for him. In summary: you will not be bestowing your service upon an unworthy or ungrateful person. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, since he is from Cologne, which nurtured you for some time in your youth, he will undoubtedly be able to inform you about the state of that republic, which may recall to your memory some summary of your past life, not without pleasure. This is all for now. </p>
      <p> For informing me so kindly and familiarly about recent events, I give you my greatest thanks. We hear that Calvin, with some bitter writing, has somewhat disturbed the proceedings of the colloquy. We doubt whether this is true. </p>
      <p> I have carefully attended to the tasks you entrusted to me for the most distinguished men from Salice and Travers. Farewell, most distinguished man, with all your family. </p>
      <p> All of ours send their greetings to you. </p>
      <p> Chur, 16th October 1557. </p>
      <p> Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. After I had already sealed the letters, I encountered in the inn a nobleman who follows the Emperor's camp. He told me that no peace has yet been made with Ferrara and no troops have been brought to Piedmont. He said that he had helped the Ferrara to capture a castle and some villages just eight or fourteen days ago. I thought it necessary to add this. </p>
      <p> Frölich is still in the Duke's land. To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most honorable president of the Church of Zürich, his patron and benefactor, to be greatly honored. Zürich. </p>
