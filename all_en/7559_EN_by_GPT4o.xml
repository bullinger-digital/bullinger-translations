      <p>If there is any humanity in you, my father, which is certainly great, I beg you again and again to let this nobleman and his teacher know it. Since I am his guide, I have allowed and advised him to see the good and learned men there, whose writings they have long known. If they need your help in any matter, I beg you, good father, to make them understand that you are also a lover of the people of our nation who are devoted to you. I am sending Mr. Simler the catalog of writings of the most outstanding mathematician of his time, Joachim Rheticus, whom our Krakau nurtures, so that he may include it in the library of Gesner.</p>
      <p>Farewell and finally send our Turk back to us sometime. Farewell, dearest and most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, August 8, 1568.</p>
