      <p> Greetings. I, reverend father in Christ, had intended to write nothing, because I had nothing to give you, nor was there anything else that would be of great importance for you to know. Now, unexpectedly, Peter Perna has come from Venice, and when he met with me to greet me, he said among other things that he had heard from a great man in Venice that six Catholics (as they call them) and six Evangelicals have been appointed for a future colloquy, and among others, he named you; the same had already been written by someone from Zurich. You seem to conceal something in your letters; therefore, I ask you, my father, since these things are brought to us from Venice, do not let us remain ignorant of the truth any longer. As for your commands, I will remember them; now I cannot write more. </p>
      <p> Farewell with all your people. </p>
      <p> I have not reread this. </p>
      <p> Chur, August 5, in the year of our Lord 1561. </p>
      <p> Your most observant Fabricius. </p>
      <p> To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord. </p>
      <p> In Zurich. </p>
      <p> To Mr. H. Bullinger. </p>
