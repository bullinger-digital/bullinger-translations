      <p>To the most humane and much respected pastor and father, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, greetings and best wishes. For a long time (respected father), I have wanted to write to you about how we are living here, but since I have not had the leisure nor found any couriers, I have had to delay until now.</p>
      <p>When we arrived in this city, we visited Dr. Erastus, who received us as guests in your name.</p>
      <p>We live comfortably with him; however, since we could not have a heated room in his house, we had to find another place, which is very inconvenient for us in winter, especially at night when the cold is severe, as we will have to move through the city.</p>
      <p>We study the German language and good sciences daily; we have learned teachers, under whom we hope to apply ourselves excellently to our studies.</p>
      <p>I do not know what more to write to you, except to give you my greatest thanks for the benefits we have received from you; they will always be remembered by me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to keep you safe and grant you a long life.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, September 8, 1565. Your most obedient son, Jacques de Cougn√©e.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most vigilant pastor and minister of the word of God, his most respected father. Zurich.</p>
