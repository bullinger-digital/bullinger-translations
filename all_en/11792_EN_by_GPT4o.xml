    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over Bullinger's recovery and is grateful to have such a friend. Has received all of Bullinger's works and also some by Vadian through him, and only purchased the anonymous writing ["Anklag und ernstliches ermanen gottes"] himself. Thanks for answering his question about church discipline - it is handled somewhat differently in Basel - and regrets that Bullinger cannot help him regarding [an incomplete copy of] Appian. The Spanish Minorite recommended by Myconius apparently did not dare to visit Bullinger; he will no longer recommend monks. Bucer, previously in Bonn, has been appointed to the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] for Easter and will soon return home; the child [Martin], born to him [Wibrandis Rosenblatt], has died. A report on the defeat of Maria [Governor of the Netherlands] [at Sittard] will have been sent by Gast as promised; Myconius adds a report by Farel on the events in Metz as a loan; if Gast has not transmitted the epitaphs on [Albert] Pigge, [Johannes] Fabri, [Johannes] Eck, and [Konrad] Treger, Bullinger should also receive these. Hedio writes that Count [Philipp IV.] of Hanau[-Lichtenberg] is ready to introduce the Reformation if he finds learned [theologians]; according to Hedio, the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I.] has informed the French [King Francis I.] about a peace offer from Emperor [Charles V.] and [King] Ferdinand, which the Turk has rejected; furthermore, the latter has offered Duke [Charles] of Orléans a daughter of the Polish King [Sigismund I.] along with Hungary, which seems unlikely given the marriage of [Sigismund II. Augustus] to Ferdinand's daughter [Elisabeth]. Myconius is concerned about the impending stay of the - personally esteemed by him - French envoy Maurus [Antoine Morelet du Museau] in Basel, as some Basel families might be susceptible to his persuasions. It was written to [John] Butler that King [Henry VIII.] has bought 60 ships, which he could use against France or Spain; he is also trying to subdue Scotland. Myconius will only report on the actions of the Strasbourg [in favor of the Protestants in Metz] when he knows more details. Inquires about the Nuremberg Diet. Greetings; has received the booklet [„Argumenta omnium... capitum“] sent by [Rudolf] Gwalther, but has not yet been able to write to him. Recommends two evangelically minded Valaisans; one is a nephew of Georg Ab der Fluͤ [Supersaxo], the other a canon of Sion.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is good that you have recovered; for your health is of utmost concern to me. I will refrain from expressing my gratitude for your immense kindness at present, but I am truly grateful to have such a friend who does everything for me.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that I may be able to use and enjoy this friendship for the benefit of my life and that I may someday show my gratitude towards you in action; for you have been more than generous to me. May the Lord repay you.</p>
      <p>You are uncertain whether you have given me all the books you have written; indeed, I have all that I know of, and not only those, but also some by Vadian, thanks to your generosity. I could list a large catalog if necessary; but I trust you will believe me when I say this. I purchased one book, which you wrote in German without a name about our ancestors (the title does not come to mind now), and no other.</p>
      <p>You have addressed the issue of correcting vices according to your method; ours is slightly different due to the form of excommunication we use. I am forced to despair about Appian, which is regrettable; for he is not a bad author.</p>
      <p>It is not displeasing that the Spanish Minorite did not come to you; perhaps he feared I had given him letters of Bellerophon[!]. Henceforth, I will be quiet in recommending monks.</p>
      <p>Bucer has been in Bonn until now. He was called by the Bishop of Münster for the Easter festival; he will return home after a few days. The little child, whom his later wife bore to him in his absence, has died.</p>
      <p>The war and the massacre that Maria suffered, Gastius sent; for he promised me so. You have here Farel's hand on the events in Metz; after you have read it sufficiently, return it. Did not the same Gastius send the epitaphs of Pighius, Fabri, Eck, and Treger? Indicate what you do not have; for I will send them.</p>
      <p>Hedio recently wrote about Count Hanau, a neighbor of the Strasbourg people, that there is good hope; for he whispered to a friend that if he could find learned men, he would allow the doctrine of justification, communion of both kinds, and marriage (the marriage of priests). He also wrote that he received letters from a certain count, indicating that the Turk sent a delegation from Constantinople to the French, reporting that the Emperor and Ferdinand sent to the Turk and requested a one-year truce, and after the year, Ferdinand promised two principal cities of Hungary, but the Turk refused, as he desires something in the faith of Charles and Ferdinand. Besides this (which is surprising), it is said that the Turk offers the daughter of the King of Poland to the son of the King of France, Duke of Orléans, and if he marries her, he will give him all of Hungary to possess quietly and without tribute.</p>
      <p>To me, it certainly does not seem likely because of the betrothal of the King of Poland and Ferdinand's daughter, who is said to be on her way to her betrothed today with five hundred horsemen. We heard yesterday that the Moorish Frenchman is coming here in the name of his king and will stay for some time, which I dread; for although he is a good man and my friend, he is nevertheless an envoy and minister of his king. I fear he may bring some evil with him unless the spirit of the gospel prevents it. There are families well-known among us, who nevertheless decline into poverty. If the Moor acts as I know French envoys have always acted in Switzerland, we are lost.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if anything of this is to happen, I am uncertain what to do. Letters from England have indicated that Butler has informed the king is entirely engaged in preparing for war. He has purchased 60 ships for his fleet, which he has already brought to himself. What he intends is unknown. However, it is speculated that it is either prepared against the French or to bring the Emperor out of Spain, after all his routes are closed. It is being negotiated that Scotland will henceforth be subjected to the English.</p>
      <p>I was going to write about the attempt of the Strasbourg people; but since the rumors vary too much, I think it best to remain silent until I know more clearly whatever it is.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about the consultations of the Nuremberg Diet, you will inform me sometime.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your household, along with Pellican, Theodor, and Gwalther, to whom tell from Quirinus that I have received the booklet he sent and have begun to write for the third time from his penultimate letter and have never been able to come to an end due to business; which I have indeed wondered at. I will write soon.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 14, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Have the Valaisans, who deliver my letters to you, recommended. One is the nephew of Georg Ab der Flüe, the other a canon of Sion. They are very favorable to the gospel, certainly worthy of being received as friends.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, most dear and esteemed in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
