      <p>God's grace through Christ Jesus, our Lord, beforehand. Gracious, honorable, dear godfather, N. Ban, the glass painter in Zürich, has a son; he has worked here for a while with Hans Brandolf, the glazier. It happened that his master had a girl with him, who is the stepdaughter of Doctor Christoph, our city physician, and the sister of Master Benedict Martin, the schoolmaster. They have promised each other marriage and have also slept together. The girl's relatives became aware of this and have taken the boy to court, where he has not been known to them further than that he alone, on his father's behalf, promised marriage to the girl. He could not deny the sleeping together.</p>
      <p>And although the girl's relatives might have made some acquaintances aware that the boy was known in other places for having taken the girl without any promise, my lords of the court have considered it good not to rush the matter, but rather to first inquire about the father's will. Therefore, the relatives send this very messenger to see if the father might be persuaded in friendship to give his consent, so that further legal proceedings and other troubles that might follow could be avoided. They have also kindly asked me to write to you on their behalf and request that you work for the good of the matter as much as possible and speak with the father to do what is best. Master Benedict also writes to Doctor Gessner, asking him to help you speak for the best in the matter. Therefore, since the aforementioned N. Ban is well known to you, I ask you to speak for the good of the honorable people, so that the matter may be resolved in friendship and not through legal means, or that the daughter might not have to be deprived of her honor. She belongs to honorable people, as you hear; Master Benedict has her as a sister; she also has something to expect from her father and still some beauty from her mother; and she has brought the favor into foolishness. The relatives also offer themselves for all good and honorable things. Therefore, let the matter be entrusted to you, so that a good and certain answer may be brought back by this messenger.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, I have nothing new to write to you at this time. Last Friday, my lord Venner von Grafenried rode to Saanen, intending to bring a preacher with him; but some displeasure has arisen in the land, so that it has been postponed for now. I hope, however, that it will soon follow, although I am worried that the lot might fall to me, as he has requested my provision. God's will be done. The Confederates from Bern have almost all passed through here these days. Greet all yours for me. Dated in Bern, December 23, 1555.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, your willing servant always.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather.</p>
