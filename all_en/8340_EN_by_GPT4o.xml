      <p>Greetings. Since I entirely assume that you have gone to bathe at the Pfäfers springs, I did not want to send anything, although I had various things; I only inform you that I have received yours.</p>
      <p>Froschauer also hopes that his letters have been delivered to you, which he sent to you 8 days ago, in which he explains his entire business to you.</p>
      <p>The bookseller is bathing in Baden. Beza writes that the plague is raging severely in Geneva; he adds that he received letters from the Admiral written on July 7th, in which he states that on June 27th he successfully scattered the king's first line and killed Valette, the king's distinguished leader, along with several others; the night interrupted the battle; at the same time, Lord La Loue not far from the city of Poitiers routed the king's banners of 21 veterans and 6 cohorts of cavalry; more than 1500 of the enemy fell, two cavalry leaders and 18 infantry were captured. Furthermore, on July 5th, the king sent a delegation with safe conduct and requested from the princes and the Admiral two people to negotiate peace with him; they were given, and now there is more hope for peace than ever before. The German princes sent a legate from Heidelberg with letters, in which they seriously urge the king towards peace; I would have sent a copy, had I not feared that you had already left. Farewell. May the Lord grant that you bathe successfully, I mean you and the most honorable Lord Consul with all the fellowship.</p>
      <p>Greet the consul and all our acquaintances for me. Zürich, very quickly, August 4th, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Beza gave his letters to me on July 22nd.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli and, in his absence, to Mr. Johannes Pontisella, my honorable and beloved lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
