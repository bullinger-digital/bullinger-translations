      <p>Greetings. Although my strength is barely sufficient to write due to a severe illness I have suffered for eight days, I did not want to send that good man to you without my letter. I received the book of Sermons about Christ on our feast days and for that, I give you great thanks, wishing also to repay you if ever the occasion arises. You continue, not without great benefit to the church, to bring back your talent with interest to the Lord, whom I also pray from the heart to keep you safe with us for a long time. My mind longs to speak with you about many and serious matters, but now I cannot; I hope that at another time the Lord will grant me the time, strength, and opportunity. Lord Mayor Theodor Brand is now in his final moments, not without great lamentation from our city. I ask you to convey my greetings to Lord Wolfgang and to ensure that satisfaction is given in the name of his Poles, to whom it is owed; I am waiting by the hour and also urging others to wait. Farewell, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Basel, 4th of October, 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed the letter, it was already announced that the mayor had breathed his last at the ninth hour before noon. May the Lord look after his church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beg you, for writing so poorly; trembling hands and a headache do not allow for better. To the man of distinguished piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
