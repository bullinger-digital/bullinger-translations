    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received Bucer's long letter from December 13, 1545, only at the beginning of February and with [a broken seal]. He will not address Bucer's defense of Luther's [behavior] here. However, the brothers were astonished by this defense. - When Bucer's letter arrived, the response to [Luther's "Short Confession"] had already been written, and if this had not been the case, [Bucer would not have been able to silence the people of Zurich]. The opponents should now know that the people of Zurich would sacrifice everything for their faith, even if Bucer were to join the opponents. - Luther was answered in a moderate manner. Bucer was necessarily mentioned, but always in a decent, truthful, and friendly way. Should he feel offended despite everything, continue to act unjustly towards the Swiss Confederates, and join the opponents, the people of Zurich will have to reject him. - Certainly, an enjoyable spectacle will be presented to the [Catholic] opponents here. Especially in view of the current state of affairs, Luther should have restrained himself. But since he did not, the people of Zurich must now bring their case for judgment, especially since silence confirms the opponents and a writing might convince them. Protected in the Lord's stronghold, they want to await God's judgment fearlessly. - Bullinger thanks for [the forwarding] of [Ottheinrich's] letter. - [Christoph] Froschauer will hand Bucer a copy of the ["True Confession"].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your lengthy letter, Bucer, written on December 13, I received at the beginning of February, opened and unsealed. In it, you strive to defend Luther against us in many ways; what these are, I leave unexamined for now.</p>
      <p>All the brothers who saw it here were astonished by your counsel and plan.</p>
      <p>And when your letter was delivered to us, the confession and response were already prepared, and even if they had not been prepared, you would not have persuaded us to silence. For indeed, many clear and significant occasions for confessing and responding justly were offered, indeed forced upon us. And since the adversary with his followers has driven us to this point, let him be assured that we are prepared to lay down our lives, our way of life, and whatever resources God has granted us for this confession. Nor will we yield or remain silent here unless we are convicted of error in doctrine by clear passages of Scripture. And if you too join the adversaries—as you threaten, saying you will contradict us if we mention anything about you or your actions in restoring concord among us—we will not for that reason abandon our position and cause.</p>
      <p>We responded to Luther modestly. We mentioned you out of necessity, not dishonorably, nor did we say anything about you that we cannot prove with living testimonies and the acts or records of the assemblies. We could have said more, but we conducted ourselves towards you in a friendly and brotherly manner. Therefore, if you claim to be offended by us without any petulance on our part, if you persist in being ungrateful and unjust to us, if you think there are not enough injuries and quarrels in the church, and you too begin to engage with us alongside Luther and his followers, we will be compelled to treat you as we do them. We desire to have peace with all, as much as it depends on us; we have not provoked anyone petulantly, nor do we provoke; yet in the meantime, relying on God's help and the goodness of our cause, we will not cease to respond when provoked by others, deferring judgment to God and the holy church.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we will present a pleasant spectacle to our enemies. But let those who provide the occasion for this answer to God. Luther should have refrained from insults and condemnation, especially at this present time. Since this could not be entirely avoided, and many now do not disapprove of his rashness—by remaining silent, they almost confirm it, and perhaps will even approve it in writing—we humbly offer our cause to God, our judge, to be judged, and standing fearlessly in the camp of our Lord, invoking the help of Christ, we will await, etc. May the Lord Jesus preserve His church.</p>
      <p>I received the letter from the most illustrious Prince of Bavaria, and I thank you greatly. Froschauer will give you a copy of our response and confession in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Bucer.</p>
