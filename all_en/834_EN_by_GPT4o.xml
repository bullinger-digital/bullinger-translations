      <p>Greetings. You suspect that I am dealing with gout from Gastio; far from it, for it dwells in the houses of kings and princes, cardinals and bishops, not of the poor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am not yet convinced that it can have anything to do with my habits.</p>
      <p>I am overflowing with humors, certainly not from food and drink, which are the cheapest with me, but from excessive leisure, not indeed the bad kind, but literary, unless you prefer to call it sleepy. Come now, whatever it is, I have indeed suffered badly for six whole weeks, until God, having had mercy on me, restored me to myself somewhat. I also laughed when you wrote that you did not want to trouble me with your letters, because you understood that letters were almost a burden. I truly say, even if I were at the point of death and a friend offered me something in writing, I believe I would be somewhat refreshed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will abandon this opinion if I relapse into some illness in the future.</p>
      <p>What follows is serious, and I would like to commend it to you: We have Brother Caspar Schwicker, a parish priest in the small town of Laufen, who is extremely troubled. He dealt with Froschauer when he was still a bookseller and became a debtor, finally paying Froschauer a considerable amount, who forgave him much; but for that payment, he does not even have a letter. He therefore asks Froschauer for a written acknowledgment that he has paid, so that no trouble arises after his death. Then he paid certain debts for Caspar and received satisfaction for them; he asks that the satisfactions also be sent, for the same reason, so that his wife is not troubled if she lacks these after her husband's death. Froschauer knows the man's integrity; therefore, Caspar thinks nothing will be disturbed because of these requests, as he knows they are made in good faith.</p>
      <p>I indeed urge you not to hesitate to explain these things to Froschauer and to respond to us, and that in time; for we do not know when the Lord will make an end with Caspar. However, I would not want you to be hindered by these matters of ours. You do well to continue with your Decades; for Richerius writes from Lorraine that having read the first and second, he is so refreshed that he eagerly awaits the rest; for he is, as it were, in exile, and therefore needs some refreshment, especially from the word, because he loves it. About the exile, in your ear.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Strasbourg has finally achieved his desire: on the first of February, he began with evening prayers, and the next day he celebrated mass diabolically in three occupied churches, the main one, at St. Peter the Old and at St. Peter the Young; most of the other churches are claimed for evangelical preaching.</p>
      <p>But see what our Lord ordains: while I write this, Lord Gabriel Arnold comes to me for this reason, to announce from a certain person from Colmar what he told Count Georg about the truth to be spoken openly about Strasbourg: "I was," he said, "in Strasbourg on business for merchants, to whom I am indeed bound. A priest came to preach in the temple. Here a citizen, having seized a turnip, threw it at the priest, so that he fell. Rising, he proceeded to the designated place, ascended the pulpit, and began to preach. There soon was someone saying: 'Priest, you lie.' But ignoring these words, he continued, so the same person repeated: 'Priest, you lie again,' and while he repeated it a third time, a Spaniard or Italian (a foreigner) struck him in the face with a fist. Then, with an attack made on the Italian, he was beautifully punished and enough. With this done, the priest trying to descend had BÃ¶ckli meeting him and urging him to continue; but unmoved, he descended. As he came into the midst of the people, he was received just as the Italian was. Therefore, the remaining priests, understanding the situation, returned from where they came, most leaving the city. The count then said: 'Do you say this truly?' The person from Colmar: 'Truly.' The count added: 'Is it permissible to tell others?' The person from Colmar: 'It is; for I myself saw the turnip thrown at the priest; the rest was told by those who were present at the tumult and indeed told me.'" You have something to laugh at once.</p>
      <p>And rumors have come to us that the Emperor is about to attempt something against Basel shortly. Nothing new about the diets. Farewell with your household in the Lord. Greet Mr. Pellican and Otto. Basel, February 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, learned and pious, Antistes of the people of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, venerable.</p>
