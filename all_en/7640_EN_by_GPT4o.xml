      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have no small hesitation, reverend lord and father, to so frequently and so suddenly interrupt your holy studies with my nonsense, and yet, incited by the persistent requests of a certain good man and encouraged by your humanity, I dare to do so with my usual recklessness. The matter is this: Some time ago, I recommended to you Mr. Stephan Dominik along with the students he brought; now, however, I particularly ask you to consider one of them as recommended to you, so that, with the authority you possess, you may act, if it can be done conveniently, to have him, who is called Johannes Simon, accepted into the number of those students who are supported there by the public stipend from the lords and dedicate themselves to good letters; for he is both talented and seems to be a young man of good character and promise, so that there is hope that, with God's blessing on his efforts, the benefit bestowed upon him will be fruitful.</p>
