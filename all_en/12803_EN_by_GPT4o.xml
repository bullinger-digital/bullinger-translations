    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer writes in haste, as he has to preach and has just learned from this messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He encloses a letter dispatch from Georg Frölich [No. 2741 and No. 2742] as well as a letter addressed to him, which Bullinger should send back. He has also received letters from the Augsburg mayors Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot. Welser is fearful and does not assess the situation correctly. However, Blarer hopes that Augsburg will remain steadfast, as the councilors and citizens are holding up well there. They will certainly resist and not surrender unconditionally like the others. A Konstanz council messenger [...] is setting off there, so Blarer has much to write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Emperor Charles V is supposed to come to Ulm with his troops and decide the fate of the cities not yet subdued. The warned Konstanz council will surely inform the Zurich council about this. At the same time, there are repeated reports of the Emperor's death, and that the Imperialists are playing theater with his corpse or likeness. It is indeed strange that no one gets to see him up close. During their audience, the city envoys only caught a fleeting glimpse of the Emperor from a distance behind a curtain, and he said nothing, did not extend his hand, but only had others apologize for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Württemberg has surrendered. However, the peace terms are not known, as Duke Ulrich does not disclose them despite the Konstanz council's inquiry. Either he had to bite the bullet, or the Emperor granted him privileges that no one should know about. The latter seems unlikely, as the Duke of Alba, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, continued to demand the capitulation of various localities even after the signing of the [Hohentwiel] treaty. On January 11, Ulrich was in Balingen and then moved to Pfullingen, while the [imperial captain] Francisco Duarte is stationed in Tübingen. He is selling the ducal grain and wine stocks at ridiculous prices! One cannot make sense of all this. May the Lord set it right!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The day in Baden is supposed to be serious: the papal [Girolamo Franco], the imperial, and the French [François de La Rivière] envoys are present.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Besides the news conveyed by Frölich, there is nothing new. Bullinger should earnestly pray for [the German Protestants]! Blarer still believes that they must endure great tribulation and be abandoned by all before God will save them. Blarer is ready to go through this trial with God, but he cannot accept a worldly peace against Him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Few are aware of what the [Emperor's demanded] submission to the Imperial Chamber Court means: That it would reintroduce abominations, idolatry, and the swarm of priests. God protect us from this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The small towns in the Allgäu, especially Isny, have decided to yield. However, they want to resist as soon as they are forced to act against God's word.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Oh God, what a misery this failure is!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger should forgive the hasty writing. Erhard Schnepf is still in Konstanz and sends thanks and greetings. The situation displeases him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Allegedly, Duke Ulrich now wishes he had not acted so hastily. Everything is in disarray! May God bring improvement.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [Enclosed note:] The Emperor is dismissing many destitute mercenaries. With the remaining ones, he is moving to Ulm. He plans to winter there until new Italians join him in the spring. He has great plans, but the Lord will thwart them all!</p>

      <p>In utmost haste, as I have to preach and have just learned from this messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Friendly, dear lord and brother, herewith a letter from our Leto to you. He has written to me, which I hereby send to you. I have also received letters from Mayor Welser and Herbrot. Welser is somewhat fearful. He does not understand the situation correctly. Still hoping that Augsburg will remain steadfast. Please send Leto's letter back to me. A messenger from my lords is also going to Augsburg. I truly have much to write. May God grant me grace! The common senator is good there along with the community, so I still hope they will take a stand and not surrender unconditionally.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor is supposed to come to Ulm with all his might and see how to deal with the cities that have not yet submitted. My lords have been warned, as I believe they wrote to yours. Meanwhile, it is repeatedly said (it should also be certain) that the Emperor is dead. Yet they continue their charade with the corpse or likeness of the Emperor! It is a wonder upon wonder that no one can see him properly or approach him. Even the envoys of the cities that have submitted had to stand from afar, and behind a curtain, they saw an Emperor who neither spoke with them nor extended his hand, but had others apologize for him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Württemberg has surrendered. Under what conditions, one cannot know, as he does not want to disclose them, although my lords would have liked to hear from him. But he avoided it. Perhaps he also had to bite a sour apple, or perhaps the Emperor granted him an advantage that he does not want to be revealed to others, although it does not seem likely for many reasons, as the Duke of Alba has continued to demand the capitulation of towns and villages in the land, even after the Duke received the sealed peace from the Emperor, etc. The Duke was in Balingen last Tuesday, then moved to Pfullingen, and nevertheless, Francisco Duarte is in Tübingen. He sells grain and wine from the Duke's stores and cellars. Everything is sold for a pittance. These are wondrous dealings, from which nothing can be accomplished! May God bring it to a good end!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From the day in Baden, it is said how serious it is, and papal, French, and imperial envoys are there. May God help us out of our troubles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We have no other news than what you also find in Leto's letters. Earnestly praying to God, truly, truly, truly for us! I always feel that we will have to endure great danger and be abandoned by everyone, and then be saved by the Lord. Let it happen! For I willingly want to endure all dangers with God and a good conscience, but I cannot and will not accept worldly peace against God, as long as God leaves me this heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Few want to think about being obedient to the Imperial Chamber Court, and that with it all abominations and idolatry, all the swarm of priests will be restored. May God be gracious and merciful to us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The small towns in the Allgäu would have liked to hold out, especially Isny. But they could not in this great apostasy; however, they have resolved that as soon as they are forced to do something against God's word, they would rather lose everything and risk it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Oh God, it is a great misery that we are so miserably falling apart and not at all united!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Forgive me this hasty writing. I scribble as I can. I cannot do better. Schnepf is still here. He thanks and greets you kindly. The situation does not please him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I now hear that Duke Ulrich would also like to have acted differently, as he still found a way with God. But everything is in disarray and nothing is healthy. May God help us to something better.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Greet all good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The Emperor is letting many destitute, ragged people leave him. The rest are all moving to Ulm. In the spring, fresh Italians are supposed to come, etc. But he now intends to have his quarters in Ulm in peace until the beginning of spring. He has great plans. But the Lord knows how to break them all.</p>
