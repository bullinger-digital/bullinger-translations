      <p>That no letters have been sent to you so far, most learned man, by my lord Mr. Heinrich Deuneius, who on the 19th of May, while enjoying your most pleasant company in Zurich, voluntarily promised you that if he learned anything new in Geneva that seemed worthy of writing, he would share it with you; know that he was prevented from fulfilling his promised duty by his hasty departure from here.</p>
      <p>For when he had set out from Geneva to Lyon three months ago, driven by some necessary occupations of his own, thinking of nothing less than not returning, behold! He received unexpected news there, which required his immediate departure to England without any delay. However, when he was already near Calais, hastening with great journeys, and was not more than half a day's journey from the port; he opportunely met a most distinguished man, as if sent from heaven, on the road, Mr. Francis Walsingham, his close relative, who at that time was sent as an ambassador by our most serene princess Elizabeth to King Charles to congratulate on the new peace, and now serves as the successor to Mr. Norris in a continuous embassy with the French. Better informed by him about the state of affairs at home and abroad, and thus freed from great mental anguish and troubles, he returned to Paris with him, where he decided to spend the winter (with God's favor) in the same house. Therefore, from Paris, he writes to me in recent days, among other things, instructing me to inform you of this by letter in his name as soon as I could conveniently, to free his conscience; and at the same time to declare the utmost constancy of his great benevolence towards you, more by deeds than by words, ready for anything for your sake, if he can, if you wish; especially, to give you the greatest thanks for that great kindness you have shown him. And he adds that if in any matter my service (as I am staying in the Geneva college with Mr. Portus, professor of Greek literature) can be of use to you, I should offer it to you by letter, and take the same thought and care for any of your affairs that you entrust to me as if they were his own. I indeed do so, and willingly: not only for the sake of my lord, to whom I owe it, whom I see wishes it so; but also for your own sake, whom I revere and honor for those remarkable gifts of God and illustrious ornaments, with which you shine in the church of God like a certain star of the first magnitude (to speak astronomically). Therefore, command, order, instruct; you will find everything in me at your command: if I cannot achieve them with prudence, industry, and effort; yet I will not fail in providing them with duty, diligence, and faith. Therefore, nothing remains now but to wait for what you wish, to satisfy the expectation, even if perhaps not the expectation itself.</p>
      <p>But I almost forgot to greet you in the name of my lord, which he certainly ordered; but I do not dare to add the manner. For if I were to say that he ordered me to greet you diligently, that [diligently] might cause me prejudice, as if I could come into doubt with you about my diligence in handling your affairs here, having conducted myself so negligently in imparting the greeting to you, which ought to have been done at the very first opportunity, by relegating it to the end of the letter. Moreover, I must also ask you in the greatest way to convey my greetings to Mr. Julius Martyritius (for I do not know what other name he has), who is working on correcting the Froschauer prints. See now another impudence following another, with which I, the lowest of men, deal with the highest man, so that I dare to impose some burden on you, and indeed impose it before I have received anything to be done from the same, who have the right to prescribe and command me. But I know the humanity of Mr. Bullinger, to whom I commend myself, him to Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 18th of November.</p>
      <p>Yours truly from the heart, James Leith, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the best man and most learned theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God in Zurich, let these letters be delivered.</p>
