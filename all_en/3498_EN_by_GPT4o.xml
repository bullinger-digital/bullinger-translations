      <p>Honorable, kind sir and godfather.</p>
      <p>This old motherly woman, who brings this letter, has often asked me to give her a letter of recommendation to you, and in the end, I could not refuse her. She claims to be a Bullinger on her mother's side, and she had a poor, miserable husband, Joachim Gochlinger, who treated her badly and left her without a penny or anything of value. The good woman would like to return to her brother in Mellingen, with whom she is in disfavor, and she kindly asks you to write a note to him for God's sake, hoping that this will help her to appear more favorably in her brother's eyes. Kind sir and godfather, you would be doing a great act of charity if you could assist and advise this poor, old, distressed woman. May God reward you for this.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur on the 1st of February, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich, his kind lord, to respond.</p>
