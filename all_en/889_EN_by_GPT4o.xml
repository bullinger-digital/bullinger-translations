      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, dearest godfather in the Lord, along with those that Mr. Montius wrote to you, which I am sending back here. As for Mr. Schertlin and the other exiles being disappointed in their hopes, although that has gained little credibility with me, I hope it brings no greater inconvenience. It is indeed the duty of the pious to sigh for the liberation of the struggling church and the cause of Christ, which is in such great danger; however, it is also incumbent upon them to commit this to the hand of God and seek redemption from Him.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, it is easily gathered, as you yourself write, that such plans are hindered not without cause, which, if they were to proceed, might perhaps bring more ferocity to the flesh than to the spirits of our piety and faith. What the plans of the Emperor are is not obscure; just as he seeks Christ, so in turn, let those things which are Christ's be sought from him. He has not yet weakened, who is perverted with the perverse and scatters the plans of princes, terrible to the kings of the earth and taking away the spirit of princes. I greatly fear and grieve for my people in Augsburg if the established assemblies proceed. That church must be commended to Christ the Lord, who, if any other, desires with burning prayers to retain the freedom of the truth of Christ.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Mr. Buttler wrote to me that his compatriot Mr. Hopper has been chosen as the royal preacher. May the Lord grant that he serves that calling faithfully and usefully for the glory of Christ; he could easily find out, being in the court, whether the codex of ecclesiastical histories, which I dedicated to the king and sent last year in the month of August with added letters to Bernardino the Italian to be presented to the king, has come into the king's hands. To this day, I have been able to learn nothing about this matter from anyone.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, if you ever write to Hopper, to obtain this service from him, that he inquires about this matter and writes back to you. By the grace of the Lord, everything at my home is still quite peaceful. We greet you and all yours from the heart. Greetings to the lords, brothers, and friends. Bern, 1550, April 25.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your godfather in the Lord. To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, lord and dearest godfather in Christ.</p>
