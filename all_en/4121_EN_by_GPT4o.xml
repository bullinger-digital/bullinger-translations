      <p>Greetings. If I had received any news from Italy, I would not have kept it from your paternity; but it is certain that the election of the pope has not yet proceeded. Every day, as I hear, sharp and very witty pasquinades (satirical writings) are published (I cannot understand them because they are written in Italian) against those involved in this election. The French say that the wickedness of the Italian cardinals is so great that there is not one among them who has not been ennobled by some notable crime; therefore, it is hardly or very reluctantly that any Italian will be elected. They hope, therefore, that the papacy will eventually be transferred to a Frenchman, and since Bellay and Tournon are very influential, both known for their prudence, and the latter also for his learning, there is good hope that one of them might obtain this dignity. However, there are reasons to believe that the cardinals are more inclined to favor Tournon. So say the French; but others claim that the Milanese carry the papacy in their hands.</p>
      <p>These are the things I have heard; although they are not very weighty, I thought they should not be omitted. I am now sending a boy to the legate in Haldenstein (for he now resides in that castle); if he has anything further, he will share it with his usual kindness. I hear that the Duke of Savoy is gathering a great sum of money from all sides, which is sufficient to maintain an army; this seems to portend something for the Genevans; it is certain that the duke is making many names. It is written that the King of Navarre is taking the daughter of Henry to Philip in Spain, which to me is evidence that the disturbances in Spain have been settled. The Scots, as I hear, have defected from the French; however, the legate said that he does not hear that his king intends to pursue this injury at present, as he seems to act with a certain plan, considering that one should not oppose a running fury, and lest, when he makes force against the Scots, the English also take this opportunity to join arms with the Scots. This indeed was recently said by the legate.</p>
      <p>He also added that the constable had long foreseen this fire and had even predicted to King Henry at the time when the marriage between the dauphin and the Scottish girl was being arranged.</p>
      <p>For the constable said: "Now you, O king, seem to want to buy dearly what you have had for free until now and could continue to have. For since the Scots do not have enough strength to repel foreign force, they would come to you voluntarily and indeed as supplicants to ask for help; if you send soldiers, they will pay the wages from their own; nothing will be left to them except the title of the kingdom, everything else will be in your power. But if you intend to rule them against their will, there is a danger that they will reserve the revenues of the kingdom for themselves, but leave the expenses of the war to you alone, and you will indeed usurp the title of the kingdom, but lack the benefits" etc. But the opinion of Cardinal Guise prevailed, who thought to illustrate his family and place it in greater favor with the king. There is a rumor, but still unclear, that King Philip fell headlong with his horse while hunting and died on the third day after; but I do not dare to affirm this yet. If it is true, the marriages are twice mournful.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I write this, the legate from Haldenstein announces that he has nothing new at all, but hears that the Romans are still without a pope (these are his words). Farewell, most illustrious man, for as long and as happily as possible with all yours.</p>
      <p>The consuls, the elder Tscharner, Philipp, Pontisella, and all friends who were with me when your letters were delivered to me, have ordered me to send you their greetings. You will bid my patrons and teachers, whom I must always respect, to be well on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Chur, November 6, 1559.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron, to be especially honored. Zurich.</p>
