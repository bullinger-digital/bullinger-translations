    <p xml:id="regest1">Defends the overly philosophical Württemberg Concord with God's indwelling in Christ and the biblical anthropomorphisms about God. Only the "how" of Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper is disputed. Zwingli adopted the Marburg formula for himself, like Oecolampadius, Bucer, Philipp Melanchthon, and Luther, but not for the Zurich church. Therefore, Blarer rightly believed that he could overcome Schnepf with it. Contrary to Pellikan's fear, Blarer did not admit that the bread is materially Christ's body. Even Luther does not claim this, so Blarer was not duped by the Lutherans. Blarer reports on the emergence of the heresy of the Savoyard Claude d'Aliod and wishes for Bullinger's orientation on the Concord and the obligation of the Württemberg pastors to the Augsburg Confession. Zwick sends back Bullinger's writings against the heretics. Zwick has not yet succeeded in making writing reeds for Hebrew, as Jud wished. Pellikan should greet Werner Steiner, and he should not blame him for Mötteli's actions. Greetings. Is ready to meet Pellikan in St. Gallen.</p>

      <p>To Bullinger and Pellikan, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>We too would wish for a less philosophical view on the sacrament, but what can you do? Is not the edification of the churches to be preferred over these verbose disputes - although the view is not so philosophical that it cannot be said with truth that the body of Christ is present in the supper substantially, essentially, and even corporally, provided you immediately add how you understand the body, namely not as tangible or local. Does not God dwell corporally in Christ, even though God is not a body? Scripture attributes to God a mouth, eyelids, nose, ears, indeed not only human body parts but also those of birds: We pray under the shadow of wings for protection, and yet God is spirit as much as He is. Can it not also be said: Where two or three are gathered in the name of Christ, He is in the midst of them substantially and essentially, but not locally, nor in size or form. Do not these latter words sufficiently express the presence of Christ that I assert? Now if it is asked whether the body of Christ is truly in the supper, all will answer that it is so. But what is the dispute about? Namely about the manner and form in which it is present. Now if I say that the body of Christ is present in the supper substantially without prescribed limits, it could be suspected that it is said of a certain fleshly presence of the body. To prevent this suspicion, I prescribe the manner of presence, which is not according to this body, which is tangible and local, leaving you now to judge that I feel Christ is present either in the supper or among two or three according to the spirit. Why then is it not prescribed that the body of Christ is only spiritually in the supper? Some say so. I ask, why did not Christ also say: "Unless you eat my flesh" etc. and add: "spiritually" or when handing the bread in the supper: "This is my body, namely spiritually" or something like that.</p>
      <p>Hence Zwingli also received this view (which is currently in question) from Oecolampadius and Bucer, when he heard it was also received by Philipp Melanchthon and Luther. "But I will not bring this manner of speaking to my church," said the pious memory of the soldier, "however the view is not disapproved by me." Therefore, by whatever reasoning those most holy men, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and Bucer, composed this view on the Eucharist for the sake of concord, the most integral brother Ambrosius thought that Schnepf's opinion and affections could be overcome in the same way and by no other. But you, Pellikan, write that you dislike the view for this reason, that it has never been conceded that the bread is substantially the body of the Lord. But neither did Ambrosius concede this, nor is there any question whether the body of Christ is the bread. That would be a real fire-starter. Luther also does not assert that the bread is the body or is under the species of bread. Therefore, as nothing is changed in this matter, so nothing was deceived in Ambrosius by the impious Lutherans, to use your words. Much less did he confirm this question with a signature, as it never arose among them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I cannot know what is currently happening in the prince's domain. But from Ambrosius's recent letters, as far as it concerns you, Bullinger, he writes, indeed it is written to all of us:</p>
      <p>"The heresy of the Savoyard does not sprout in just one place. If only the Lutherans and Zwinglians, having settled their disputes, would turn their united forces to vigorously combat this!" Thus he.</p>
      <p>Oh, how truly this pious brother wishes this, since we must be very vigilant, lest these wandering errors impose on us the hope of humility. For the adversary of Christ always nurtures some monstrosity in the church.</p>
      <p>He also adds the following:</p>
      <p>"You will inform Bullinger as soon as possible about the nature of our concord, and in the meantime, indicating this, that it has been arranged by the prince that we simply prescribe to the ministers of the word in his domain the formula of the Saxon Confession in the matter of the supper. It states that the body and blood of Christ are truly present in the supper and distributed to those who partake. He does not want any disturbances to be stirred here, nor will he tolerate anyone insulting another with reproaches on this account, but each should present the truth to be viewed in its simple form."</p>
      <p>Pray persistently, excellent men, that the word of God may run with much fruit.</p>
      <p>I leave the judgments on dealing with heretics. If you expect the remaining part on the places of the divinity of Christ, let me know. Otherwise, it will remain with me.</p>
      <p>I am trying to prepare a Hebrew pen, as Leo would like, but it is not succeeding. However, I will try more and more.</p>
      <p>Greet Werner Steiner for me, you Pellikan, most dutifully. In the meantime, encourage the best friend not to blame me if Mötteli has done something wrong, as if impure jokes displease me, but not more impure ones. It certainly pains me if anything has been done by him, namely Mötteli, for which he cannot give the most honorable account. I will not give an account. For in this matter, he did not have me as an author or consultant.</p>
      <p>May Christ preserve Theodor, the most holy and least arrogant heart, with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all your families, especially your wives and children.</p>
      <p>Forgive the blots.</p>
      <p>I hear you, Pellikan, will soon depart for St. Gallen. I am ready to meet you there if you set a date.</p>
      <p>Given in Constance, September 9, 1534.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
