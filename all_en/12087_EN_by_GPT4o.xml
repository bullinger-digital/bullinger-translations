    <p xml:id="regest1">Would have liked to send the German Bible; however, found only a single bound copy, which was very expensive because its illustrations were colored; if [Hans von Rütte] still wishes to purchase it, he should indicate to whom the Bible should be entrusted for transport; if he wishes for another copy to be bound, Rümlang should report this early. The [Bernese] disputes are very inconvenient; as the council tolerates them, it loses the sympathy of the people; until now, what the council prescribed to the people was declared as truth; now they change their view, and some believe they have discovered something more precise; consequently, the Bernese church would have been a victim of false doctrine, and the authorities as well as the people misled; the Bernese Disputation [of 1528] was recognized and committed to; it is now declared false by those who claim that at that time they did not dispute against Luther, but against the Pope; accordingly, a new disputation should be organized to acknowledge Luther; however, Bullinger believes that the disputation [of 1528] was rather instigated against Luther than against the Pope: One should remember the Lutherans of that time, Benedikt Burgauer and [Andreas] Althamer, and the subject of the debates at that time. 16 days ago, Bullinger finished the [“Brevis ἀντιβολή”]; he is waiting for it to be printed by Froschauer. Luther has written a furious book about the Eucharist against [the Zurichers], in which he directs his anathema against all those who do not confess that Christ is bodily present in the Lord's Supper and is eaten; so far [the Zurichers] have not received the book; but scholars who have read the book wrote to them; Vadian expresses amazement at [Luther's behavior]; many will still have their eyes opened. Greetings, among others, to [Sulpitius Haller], [Peter im] Haag; for a long time, Rümlang has been among the best friends of [Zurich]; greetings from everyone.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I would have very gladly sent you the German Bible, but I could not find any bound copies in the entire city at any bookseller. There was only one copy for sale, whose illustrations were colored, and the seller did not want to sell it for less than 7 Zurich gold coins. Although it is very beautiful, I did not dare to send it because it was so expensive. If he still wishes to have it sent to him, he should indicate someone who will transport it. If he wishes for another copy to be bound, let me know promptly, and it will be arranged.</p>
      <p>I would very much like those unfortunate disputes to be settled, especially at this time when almost everything else is torn and disrupted. The magistrate does not win the people's favor by tolerating such disputes. Until now, the doctrine that the people received by the magistrate's command was sold as the certain truth. Now it is being disputed, and some think they have found something more precise. Thus, the Bernese church has been misled by false doctrine; the magistrate and the people have been deceived. They accepted the Disputation and mutually bound themselves by oath to the conclusions, which those who shout against the papists in Bern will soon show to be false, not against Luther. Therefore, a new disputation should be held to establish the case for Luther. But I say that the disputation in Bern was more against Luther than against the Pope. For Benedikt Burgauer and Andreas Althamer were Lutherans, not papists; and the arguments show what they were, etc.</p>
      <p>I completed the Response against Cochlaeus 16 days ago. I am waiting for when it will be convenient for Froschauer to print it.</p>
      <p>Luther has written a furious book against us about the Eucharist, in which he condemns with an anathema all who do not confess that Christ is bodily present and eaten in the Lord's Supper. Therefore, he also condemns the Bernese conclusions.</p>
      <p>We have not yet been able to obtain the book. However, learned and pious men who have read the book write to us. Vadian writes that he cannot sufficiently marvel at what has come to this man's mind, that he deals with such a serious matter so childishly. But it is well. By God's grace and kindness, these things happen. The eyes of many will now be opened.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to your lord, the treasurer, my special friend, Haag, and the others. Farewell. We are not writing you into the book of friends for the first time now; you have long been inscribed among the first. Remain by God's grace as you have been until now. All of us here send you greetings.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and distinguished man, Eberhard von Rümlang, brother and special friend. To the treasurer in Bern.</p>
