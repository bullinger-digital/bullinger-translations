      <p>S. D. I certainly saw and read what you wrote, most illustrious man, about the siege of Teruan. But what you now add in my letters has rendered me exceedingly sorrowful, the unspeakable poisoning of the most serene king. For your wisdom knows how much hope there was for this prince; he was learned, pious, merciful, and shone with examples of remarkable wisdom and courage. Great would be the wrath of God against the peoples of Europe if this prince were to be taken from our midst. However, in this sadness, it is especially comforting that with the Lord all things are possible, who also said: if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them."</p>
      <p>It is comforting that all things are conducted by divine providence with holiness and the most just judgment. For either the good Lord and just judge permits what happens in the world for certain and most just reasons, or he himself works what is fitting for his goodness and serves our benefit. Since he is both a father and kind and just and the preserver of his faithful, he tempers his works so that the faithful cannot complain anywhere, but everywhere some clear benefit accrues to the world. To him be glory and dominion forever. If Charles is the author of such evil, you will find that he did not do it with impunity. This exhausted little body is burdened with other enormous and most heinous crimes and the heavy vengeance of the Lord; it will not be long endured.</p>
      <p>Would that he recognize the impiety committed, repent, and be saved. Otherwise, in Pharaoh, Ahab, Antiochus, Herod, Diocletian, and many other most savage disturbers of the church of this kind, he has living and most certain examples of his fate: it is a grave thing to fall into the hands of the most just God.</p>
      <p>But listen, my venerable lord. That most powerful king of yours, about whom everyone had conceived great hope, begins to be spoken of most badly in the church of the saints, because he himself does not cease to shed the innocent blood of those confessing the name of Christ. Recently, he ordered those five famous confessors of Christ in Lyon to be roasted over a slow fire, not just burned.</p>
      <p>This matter has so exasperated the spirits of our people that I have not seen such impatience before. Certainly, those to whom the king's name was not previously unpleasant now curse it.</p>
      <p>For the most illustrious republics of the greatest peoples in Switzerland, Zurich and Bern, etc., had humbly undertaken to plead the cause of the best men with the king, and they acted long and faithfully. Those affected by the punishment were not Anabaptists, not Quintinians, not Georgians, or infected with other heresies. They professed the faith that we all profess, which, if a fair opportunity is granted to us, we can clearly and evidently show to be supported by the holy scriptures: moreover, we can demonstrate that our religion is truly prophetic and apostolic, that is, the ancient Christian and orthodox one. Therefore, it rightly pains our people when they hear that fellow believers are burned as heretics and sacrilegious by your king. For they gather from this what he also thinks of our faith and what he would decide about us if he were granted power over us. Nor do I see any other matter that could so divide spirits, especially of prudent and good men, as this one alone. Therefore, those who provoke the king and make him more cruel give him the worst advice.</p>
      <p>They themselves will someday feel the avenging hand of God and will hand over their king to the severe hands of God. Joash, king of Judah, as the sacred history recounts, raged against Zechariah and other professors of the true faith, but not long after, his well-equipped army was routed and put to flight by a small band of Syrians, and he himself was stabbed by his servants in his bed.</p>
      <p>Herod, the son of the great Herod, because he mocked the Son of God, the eternal truth, and beheaded blessed John the Baptist, not long after was defeated by Aretas, king of the Arabs, and the king himself was sent into exile by Gaius Caesar, to this very Lyon in your Gaul, where he was taken away by a miserable death and became an example to all those who persecute the truth and cruelly slaughter the servants of God.</p>
      <p>But there is no need to mention foreign examples: there are many domestic examples of our age that show with what misfortune kings and princes persecute the gospel.</p>
      <p>This Charles, the Emperor, issued a decree at Worms at the beginning of his reign, very much like Diocletian's, against the apostolic faith, but soon after, those most savage wars followed, waged between King Francis and himself with much bloodshed in Picardy and Lombardy. For King Francis also began to persecute somewhat. When that war was pacified, Ferdinand in Austria and Germany enacted bloodthirsty laws: soon, therefore, the Turks were present and besieged the very metropolis of Austria, Vienna, and also inflicted many disasters on Ferdinand's forces.</p>
      <p>The Emperor again, around the year 1536, ordered decrees to be written in blood in the Netherlands against the evangelicals, and behold, the most atrocious war was renewed between him and King Francis.</p>
      <p>At Marseille, the Emperor's army was extinguished by plague, at Avignon the French themselves were in danger. In the year 1540, Diocletianic laws were renewed in Brabant and Austria, but soon Charles suffered an irreparable loss at Algiers. Ferdinand was stripped of all Hungary. In recent years, the Emperor oppressed Germany with severe tyranny and indeed pretended honorable reasons.</p>
      <p>But the hatred of truth and the pursuit of monarchy were the true causes of that tyranny. Hence, we saw last year that invincible victor being driven in disgraceful flight from Innsbruck to Villach in Carinthia, struck by panic terror. And when he had restored his strength and regained his spirit, and wanted to wash away that stain, after a splendid victory won by the most powerful king, we saw again with how much disgrace and with what calamities he was forced to abandon the most expensive siege of Metz. Meanwhile, I do not mention with how many plagues of diseases the wretched man is tormented. He is afflicted by epilepsy, arthritis, gout, and other such Antiochian diseases. Your Gaul indeed triumphed over him last year, but with what, I ask, inconvenience? How many, I pray, cities and villages burned in Picardy, devastated by that impious Rossheym Martin? How many nobles were intercepted by diseases and perished? How many soldiers perished partly by arms, partly by plague in the French camps?</p>
      <p>The matter itself cries out that the wrath of the Lord works these things, especially because of the innocent blood of the faithful shed. But I fear that these are the beginnings of the greatest sorrows. Would that I were a vain prophet. Would that your young king would learn to be moderate and not persecute the truth from the old Emperor Charles, a more foreign and severe enemy of the church of God. What have the most powerful kings and princes achieved with their most severe persecutions for more than thirty years? Nothing but that they have increased their own calamities. And the more they wanted the truth extinguished by the blood of the saints, the more it shone. That same thing will happen again, and all who do not want Christ to reign over them will perish.</p>
      <p>For the truth is invincible and Christ will live forever and ever.</p>
      <p>My love for you and for all of Gaul, certainly a most flourishing kingdom, compels me to speak with you at length. For I am most certain that Gaul cannot perish sooner and fall into the hands of enemies, nor have an angry God as king, than when it wants the gospel extinguished and innocent blood shed, and I do not envy this miserable fate for it, and I most desire it to be preserved, I speak with you, most illustrious man, whose influence and counsel I know to have much weight in Gaul. Therefore, I urge you, I beg you to consider these things, which come from my most friendly heart, in a good light and to help with all your might, so that the truth and the faithful are not so cruelly persecuted. And what I do here with you in writing, I recently did in person with the most illustrious man, Cardinal Bellay, a prudent man and not ignorant of the sincere truth. May the Lord grant a spirit and mind that weighs these things exactly according to necessity.</p>
      <p>Do not be concerned about the Florentine prince. Our people, as they do not unite with any prince, so they are least united with this one, most distant from us and an adversary in religion; but recently his envoy was dismissed in such a way that he understood well that he should not return. Yesterday, at the Baden assembly, the envoys were declared: the most illustrious Mr. Lavater, a distinguished man and a lover of religion and justice, and Johannes Aescher, the chief scribe of our city, a prudent and eloquent man, my singular relatives and esteemed lords.</p>
      <p>The same truculent things are reported and written here about the marquis as you mention in yours. The fear in Swabia is significant, as can be gathered from the fact that my friends from Augsburg and other places write nothing to me, who have been very frequent in writing until now. However, some think that army will be led over the Alps into Italy. I have nothing certain about these things. Certainly, the marquis is gathering the greatest resources, lest he be deprived of the sinew of war, money. But meanwhile, he lives, who can both dissipate money and disarm the soldier, although excellent, and overthrow and destroy war instruments and dissolve the whole army with its leaders, although brave, and most prudent counselors, our almighty God in heaven. Would that we serve him and fear him, so that we may have him as our defender. To him be glory. Live and farewell, most illustrious man. Zurich, the first of June, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bassefontaine, the most distinguished envoy of the most Christian King of the French to the Swiss, my most esteemed lord. Solothurn.</p>
