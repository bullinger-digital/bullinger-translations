    <p xml:id="regest1">From Bullinger's letter, it is understood that he did not receive his letter; Bullinger's concern that he might have offended him is unfounded. Melanchthon's letter [No. 1966] gives him hope that the conflict [with the Lutherans] will one day be overcome through better insight. In Bern, [Bucer's followers] undermine the council's orders by invoking the word of God and relying on the fact that they are locals; they would like to bring Bucer to Bern as a mediator, and only the fear of the common people prevents a majority of the leading circles from openly committing to Bucer's direction; Rümlang remains undaunted, even if they try to displace him. Sends back the copy [of Melanchthon's letter] and has adhered to the instruction not to copy it. Wants to change his life situation, but not without consulting Bullinger; cannot write more extensively about it due to the messenger's haste. Regrets having missed the visit of [Johannes] Stumpf, to whom he would have gladly offered his services and companionship; is also at Bullinger's service and suggests that he write about [the Lord's Supper], as his style is admirable and he would find ample material in the fight against current heresies.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From your writings, most eloquent Bullinger, I gather that my letters sent to you have been lost, which, although it has troubled me, I do not fear, as I remain consistent in my words and writings, regardless of whose hands they may fall into. My most distinguished Bullinger, I want it entirely removed from your mind that you have ever offended me in any way; for what could come from such a candid heart that would not be most pleasing to me? To whom I owe not only all my possessions but also my entire self, so that I am entirely in your debt and will never be able to repay it.</p>
      <p>I have also read Melanchthon's letter, which filled me with the greatest joy, as I hope that someday some will think better and all madness will be removed.</p>
      <p>Here, everything is in turmoil; whatever the senate decides or has previously decided, some are attempting to overturn everything, if they can, so that they do not hesitate to introduce horrible heresies to establish their own positions, and they do this under the pretext of the word of God. They do not want to be bound by decrees or oaths; they strive to exempt themselves from these. All shame has perished among them, and they have hardened their foreheads, attempting to break through, confident because they are locals and supported by other carnal assurances. They consult with Bucer, whom they would like to call here to pacify the disputes, if we did not resist. There are two great factions among us; the Bucerian contagion has infected the greater part of the nobility, only held back by the fear of the common people from openly joining Bucer. Let us pray to the Lord to deign to assist his truth. As for me, I am undaunted, even if they wish to drive me away, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending back to you the copy, which no one, not even I, have rewritten; therefore, fear nothing, I have faithfully complied with your letters and conditions.</p>
      <p>I have decided to change my situation; however, I will inform you first, and I will not attempt anything without consulting you, etc. I would write more if there were time; the messenger is hastening his departure.</p>
      <p>I regret not being at home when Stumpf was present, to whom I would have gladly offered my services, if only I had understood how I could have been of assistance to him.</p>
      <p>I would have also accompanied him and joined him as a companion on his journeys. I will not refuse anything in your name, to whom I am entirely devoted. I pray, if your spirit allows, that you would deign to write in the symbol. I revere and admire your abundance, moderation, and how everything coheres most appropriately. You would have abundant material to counter the resurgent heresies.</p>
      <p>Consider it favorably, I ask.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, September 18, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished, faithful, and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, my ever-respected lord.</p>
