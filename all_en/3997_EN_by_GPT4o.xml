      <p>Greetings. I had planned to see and speak with you; but many things have prevented it.</p>
      <p>I hope it will happen soon. I commend my son to you, and when the host wishes for the money, it will be sent immediately. There are persecutions in Spain, in Flanders, and in France.</p>
      <p>Many are seeking the emperor's legation and the states' name to the king and have allowed the emperor's election. They wanted to reject the article of religion and the council; however, the Protestants gave conditions, which the emperor reluctantly accepted; these were offered to the Emperor on the third of June 1559: That a general Christian council, favoring neither party, be held in Germany. That it be convened by the Emperor, not the Pope.</p>
      <p>That the Pope should not be the president or judge in it, but should be subject to the decrees as a part of the council. That the Pope should release archbishops, bishops, and prelates from the obligation of oaths, so that they can freely express their opinion. That the sacred prophetic and apostolic scripture be the judge in the council, not human doctrine. That the doctors of the states of the Augsburg Confession, who will be sent to the council, not only be heard in it, but also have decisive votes and find secure and free faculty not only in persons but also in confessions and votes. That decisive votes should not derive their force from a plurality, as is customary in political matters, but that the summaries of decisions be collected, which should be concluded directly after the word of God. That the acts of the Council of Trent be nullified, because the other party was not heard, nor was it celebrated as promised. If in this council concord and unanimity on the articles of religion cannot be achieved, that the decrees of Passau and the Peace of Augsburg in 1551 should be retained and observed by both parties in the future in matters of religion. The legation, which Lübeck and Hamburg, the King of Poland, and the Elector of Saxony had sent to the King of Moscow, has returned and announced very harsh conditions for peace or war. The main point of the petition proposed by the Muscovite was that he wanted the fortresses taken from the Lithuanians before and recently taken again by him to be restored to him intact, and that no fortification be made against him or a fortress be erected to defend the borders. These conditions are intolerable to the neighbors.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they are beginning to think about defeating the barbarian enemy; however, they refuse to provide any assistance to the Lithuanians because of the incredible cowardice and abasement of spirit they have shown in this war. Therefore, whatever defenses they decide to oppose to the enemy, they will manage through their own means. They have sent to all the other Maritime Cities, those which I mentioned before, to draw them into the society of war because, due to the opportunity of commerce, this danger seems to concern all, which threatens Lübeck and Hamburg. However, they have received no response from them so far; but the matter has been referred to the convention of the Maritime Cities to be held on the calends of July in Bremen, where many other things will be discussed about the broken treaties by the King of England and the preservation of old privileges and the restoration of the former alliance among themselves and other matters concerning the free cities adjacent to the Ocean. The King of England has been brought into the highest disrepute among them, because he has taken away from them those privileges, which they had received from the king's ancestors and had used until now, without any knowledge of the cause, and although the English republic no longer pertains to his care, yet, because he was the author of their infringement, at the time when the supreme power of the kingdom was in his hands, and he committed a similar thing against them in his Flanders, they have now resolved to direct all their plans to recover what was taken away both in England and in Flanders and to ensure that no force is used against them in the future in those things which they had legitimately received from their ancestors... they render it plausible to all neighboring Pomeranian, Mecklenburg, Brunswick princes, and also to the King of Denmark, because they consider it most pertinent that commerce be left free to their subjects, with those benefits which their ancestors used. Therefore, by that day not only the Maritime Cities, but whoever are the states whose provinces border the sea, will contribute their counsel and aid to that deliberation. The King of Denmark and the Duke of Holstein are waging a fierce war against the inhabitants of Dithmarschen. Greet the friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Baden, 22nd of June.</p>
      <p>Yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
