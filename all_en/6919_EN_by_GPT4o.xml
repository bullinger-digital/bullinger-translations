      <p> Greetings. I received your letters, honorable father, through this Knöulius of yours and I give you my greatest thanks for those things you have shared with me. I truly thank the Lord from my heart for that marvelous promotion of truth, which He exercises everywhere. I pray to Him to defend all the pious and to advance their efforts more and more for His glory. Meanwhile, it pains me that Mr. Erastus writes that in those Belgian churches, which are so recent, there is already a growing sacramental contention. However, it is comforting that it is certain that the truth will ultimately prevail, for the promotion and defense of which I continually pray to the Lord to preserve you for a long time; for I recognize that the Lord accomplishes a great part of this good through you. As for those things you sent with the condition that I return them to you, I beg you not to be upset that I am not returning them to you through this same person; for he came yesterday at nightfall and will leave immediately today, so I could not yet share them with anyone. Therefore, I ask for a temporary reprieve until I find another messenger through whom I can send them. As for how things are going with the people of Unterwalden, you will hear a fine story from my brother. Otherwise, I have nothing else. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Mr. Consul Steiger, both treasurers, Diesbach, Mülinen, Madi, Zehender, my father-in-law, and many others, especially Abraham Musculus, my mother, and my wife, diligently greet you. </p>
      <p> Bern, October 8, 1566. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my lord, father, and compatriot, to be honored with the greatest respect always. </p>
