      <p>Greetings. I have seen, esteemed father and relative, a more detailed description of the case of that matrimonial issue, which is being disputed among the people of Schaffhausen. Jakob seeks to marry Barbara, who was the wife of Ursula's uncle, his previous wife, and whose son Peter is Ursula's cousin. However, according to our laws, it seems to me that this is not permissible, firstly because Barbara and Ursula were connected in the second degree of affinity, and secondly because there is a consanguinity between the children of Barbara and Ursula, which prohibits them from marrying. Let us also suppose that a son is to be born to Jakob from Barbara; he will have Peter as a brother from his mother, and Dorothea as a sister from his father, who is Peter's cousin and is only in the third degree removed from Heinrich, Peter's father and her mother's uncle. Therefore, besides the bond of affinity, which now exists between Jakob and Barbara, there will also follow a clear and legally prohibited confusion of blood between those who are already very closely related. I know indeed that in divine laws this case is not expressed nor is such a marriage prohibited; but among Christian people, who profess the name of purer doctrine and faith, the law of public decency should especially prevail, so that we do not give unnecessary scandal to anyone. I wanted to briefly share my opinion with you, my father, because you requested it, and if it seems worthy, to transmit it to Johann Konrad Ulmer, our beloved and esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>Farewell. April 27, 1571.</p>
      <p>Johann, Margaretha's daughter [...] Heinrich's son, whose wife is Barbara.</p>

      <p>Dorothea Jakob, Ursula's recent husband, now wishes to marry Barbara, who was the wife of Heinrich, Ursula's uncle.</p>
