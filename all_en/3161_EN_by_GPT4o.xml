      <p>Strassburg, 23rd April. I received your letter, most learned man, along with that sermon on the confession and denial of our Lord Christ. However, because I was to set out for Frankfurt the next day, I was unable to respond to you, nor have I been able to satisfy myself in what I had proposed until now. But now, having returned and having found the leisure to respond, I have nothing else to say except to give thanks to your kindness, not only in my name but also in the name of England. For you have done something most pleasing not only to me but also most useful to England, unless we begrudge our own benefit. It is already decided with me to translate your sermon into our common language as soon as possible and thus give it to the English to read. But I was partly advised not to have the Latin printed because of the nature of my request, which was intended only for the benefit of the English, and partly because I was not certain of your will. Therefore, I leave the Latin to your prudence, about which, however, if I were allowed to say to you what I feel, I would say it is very necessary for this deficient age. However, I will take care to do what I have willingly undertaken as faithfully as I can. England owes you thanks, and I hope it will give them. May God, in His mercy, preserve you living and strong for a long time for His church, and consider me most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>For I am yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>We all commend our brothers to your kindness, who will inform you about our affairs.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
