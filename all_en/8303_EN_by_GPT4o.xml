      <p>God be with you, dear son, I thank you and Susanna for the roast. As I gave you the first part of my chronicles, bound in black, or lent it for a while, it is now my earnest request that you send it back to me as soon as you can, but make sure it is well taken care of and returned to me properly, etc. I will explain the reason to you at another time. All the people and I send greetings to you, Susanna, Lisenbethli, etc. Young Hans Mey is appointed to the Rüden as a member of the twelve or eighteen; however, Hans Heinrich Schmid is set as a replacement and the decision will be made tomorrow for the council and citizens, whom they will name. May God guide it to the good side, amen, etc. At the Meysen, Mr. Bercker was well appointed, yet he has no more than 4 votes and no bad word was spoken against him; before him, Mr. Hans Müller the goldsmith, the son of the late lord, was appointed; he was almost unanimously chosen with great support. At the bakers(?) to the Weggen, the master became the old Rütlinger, at the Camel Hans Ulrich Stapffer. The citizens will be taken in tomorrow and on Saturday by the mayor and council, lacking one in the Sprossen place. May it be whoever is good. Cousin Hans at Kappel is otherwise weak, also(?) the lady from Cham, etc.</p>
      <p>In great haste. Tuesday, June 30, 1570. H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
