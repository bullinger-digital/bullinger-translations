      <p>I would be ashamed, distinguished man and esteemed brother, that I have not responded to your two letters, except because there was some reason for silence. For I did not want to write until matters were settled, lest our conflicts would keep you perplexed and anxious, a trouble that would be shared with our best and most faithful brothers. And we have been so agitated in such variety that no day has shone upon us that did not depend on the next. Finally, it has come to this, that all have reconciled among themselves. For the senate was openly divided into factions: and hatreds had erupted so openly that the wicked felt the vengeance of God pressing upon their necks. Yet the good did not have enough spirit to strive to settle the state of the church, over which there was such a fierce struggle. Only right hands were given, with an oath interposed, that no one would favor evil causes in the future. And indeed, by this prejudice, the opposing party silently condemned itself. But with the plausible color of peace, it happened that the legitimate order, the sole guardian of peace, was neglected, or at least postponed. I, called into the court, professed that I forgive all who sincerely repent: yet I am only one from the consistory: I would rather die a hundred times than arrogate to myself what was common to the whole church. This was observed by us, that Satan desires nothing more than that in doubtful and suspended matters, some occasion for future disturbance should arise. But we intend to forestall it. Although perhaps the enemies will tumult with less force than before, yet shortly we will have to contend again.</p>
      <p>You see more clearly the reason for the silence, that I wished to cover the domestic disgrace. Yet know this: although the church is tossed about in various ways everywhere, in Geneva it fluctuates no differently than Noah's ark in the flood. From this also gather how much I dislike to trouble your most illustrious senate with questions. However, this was recently attested to you with a clear document, when you were not consulted about the spiritual governance of the church. But what could I do, when all good men groan, yet cannot bring a remedy? It is well, however, that we have a helmsman presiding over us, under whom we will be safe from shipwreck: and then that we are not far from the port.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the condition of those must be learned, who must undergo the same voyage.</p>
      <p>The refutation of Servetus's impiety will have been sent to you, I hope, before my letters reach you. The booklet is brief and written in haste. Yet it will accomplish more than if nothing were written. I suppose the disturbances in England are already known there: and in the meantime, while the letter is still on the way, perhaps something more certain will have been brought. Farewell, most distinguished man and my very esteemed brother. Greet diligently in my name Mr. Gwalther, the sons-in-law, and the other brothers. Mr. Marchese Caracciolo, our Budaeus, and my colleagues wish you well. May the Lord protect you with His hand, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors. Amen.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 7th day before the calends of March, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
