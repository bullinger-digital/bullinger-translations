      <p>Greetings. At the moment, I do not have any necessary material to write about. Everything is silent now. From France, I have nothing except that it is reported that there is a great scarcity of all things there, and everyone fears that there will be greater turmoil due to those warlike disturbances. I am waiting to hear what news you have for us from Trento, also about Maurice, whether it is true that he has gone to the Emperor, and what has been done with the Magdeburgers in Zürich, what you think about them, etc. I also hear about certain plots prepared against you and Mr. Gwalther; however, I cannot ascertain anything certain; otherwise, I would warn you; if there is anything, please inform me. It is also reported about Blaurer that he has instituted the Constance discipline in Biel, public penance, and a certain monetary fine if not a single person from each family attends each sermon. I fear that it may be too much; I do not read that Christ or the apostles did so. The greater the hypocrisy will be, which eventually erupts, as we see has happened in Constance. However, I am not yet well informed about all these things; when I am, I will inform you. Please send this letter to Mr. Vergerius as soon as possible; I know he is anxiously waiting for it. Farewell. Musculus greets you with all his, and my family also sends many greetings to you and all yours, whom you will also greet from me.</p>
      <p>The plague is somewhat resurging here. Bern, February 11, 1552.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
