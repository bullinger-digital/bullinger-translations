    <p xml:id="regest1">Philipp von Hessen received the letter [from the Zurichers] dated March 12 [No. 2103] along with the three copies [of the "True Confession"]. He is very reluctant to hear about the newly rekindled dispute between Luther and the [Zurichers]. - The books of the [Zurichers] are not banned [in the Landgraviate of Hesse]. Philipp has even read the book that was sent. Essentially, the [Zurichers] and Luther do not have such different positions. - Consequently, the dispute was probably instigated by people who would not like to see harmony between the two [parties]. The dispute must be settled so that the enemies of the Gospel do not have cause for joy. - Two of the sent copies will be forwarded to Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Duke Maurice of Saxony. - Philipp wanted to inform [the Zurichers], to whom he is well-disposed, of this.</p>

      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, etc.</p>
      <p>Our gracious greetings beforehand. Highly and well-learned, also honorable, dear, special ones, we have received your letter, dated the 12th day of March, along with the three booklets enclosed, read its content, and truthfully heard with great reluctance about the tension and discord between you and Doctor Martin Luther, partly from the reasons you mentioned in your letter and also from other additional motives. We could hardly hear anything more burdensome than that these matters, which had been quiet, are now being dragged out again to the offense and scandal of so many people.</p>
      <p>As for your books, we have not banned them in our lands, and we have read your recently published booklet with diligence. According to our judgment and opinion, you and Doctor Luther are not fundamentally as far apart in your opinions as in your words. For Luther acknowledges that Christ is not present in the sacrament or external signs in the manner of straw in a sack.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must actually consider it as if perhaps there are other people who are inciting you against each other and do not wish to hear of your reconciliation. We would therefore like nothing more than to see these harmful matters resolved and the door of joy not opened further to the enemies of the Gospel, causing great offense and scandal to many good-hearted people.</p>
      <p>We also do not want to refrain from sending two of your booklets to the high-born princes, Lord Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, and Lord Maurice, both Dukes of Saxony, etc., our friendly dear cousins, brothers, sons, and godfathers, and kindly ask them to read them.</p>
      <p>We do not wish to conceal from you our gracious opinion in response to your aforementioned letter, to whom we are graciously inclined.</p>
      <p>Given. Response to the Zurichers.</p>
