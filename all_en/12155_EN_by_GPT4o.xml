    <p xml:id="regest1">[The people of Zürich] know that Albert [Hardenberg] has been familiar with Luther's [„Short Confession“] for a long time. Full of anger, hatred, envy, and bitterness, the book attacks them as public opponents of the faith and as stubborn heretics. - They regret this, not so much because they feel their honor is wounded, but because it poses a great danger to the already sufficiently tormented times. Luther sets a bad example for many here, so that the people of Zürich could no longer remain silent, especially since he rages against the truth and claims that bread and wine are truly and naturally Christ's body and blood and are physically eaten and drunk. If Luther is allowed to establish articles of faith at his own discretion, it is to be expected that everyone will present their own inventions as accepted truths of faith and impose them on others. This would lead to a new papacy. The people of Zürich also fear that [the devil] wants to bring about their oppression through this. - They have not become enemies with Luther out of private hatred. Even though he is a significant man, they cannot recognize everything that comes from him as the work of the [Holy] Spirit, especially since he is driven by such intemperance of emotions. - They have not written their [enclosed] response, the [„True Confession“], out of mere contentiousness, but to stand up for the truth and publicly declare the innocence of their churches. The pious and learned of Zürich, as well as Zürich's Great Council, have approved this endeavor and seen the writing. - [The people of Zürich] now turn to Hardenberg because he is capable of standing up for the truth to a considerable extent and opposing Luther (who sets himself up as plaintiff, witness, and judge) in his endeavor to suppress their writings. Hardenberg should work with the pious princes friendly to him (especially with the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and with [Franz von Waldeck, the Bishop of] Münster) to ensure that they do not condemn, prohibit, and hinder the reading of the books [of the people of Zürich] through public or secret edicts. There is no danger that these writings could stand in the way of the begun Reformation, and there is no lack of [places that have become evangelical] where such a prohibition could have more deterrent than beneficial effects on the Reformation. The people of Zürich do not want to impose anything on anyone and gladly submit to the decisions of the faithful churches. - They ask Hardenberg to recommend them to [Hermann von Wied].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We know well enough, dear brother Albert, that you have already seen Luther's book recently published against us. Nor are you unaware that many have opposed its being brought to us. But it seemed otherwise to our God. For we too have seen it, swelling with feelings of anger, hatred, envy, and all kinds of bitterness. For he does not attack us as private enemies of the Lutheran name, but as public opponents of the Catholic faith and true religion, as stubborn heretics who do not know how to repent.</p>
      <p>We have indeed received no small grief from this; not because we could be so grieved by the violation of our fame and honor, but because we see a far greater and more pernicious stumbling block arising from this than the calamity of our already more than sufficiently afflicted age demands. For we have long since learned to endure and overcome many things of this kind. And our minds, well aware of themselves, do not greatly fear such threats. For we are mindful of Christ our Savior and of what He Himself pronounces: "Blessed," He says, "are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven" [Mt 5:11-12]. Since, however, Luther's deed can provide an occasion for a bad example to many and be a stumbling block to many weak ones, we did not think we should remain silent any longer. For he rages not against us as private individuals, but against our doctrine, and thus against the truth itself; if we had wanted to deny our defense of it, it could not have been done without serious loss. We know indeed how great the authority of the Lutheran name is among many. But all the more must it be countered wherever it begins to be the author of a bad example. He strikes with a dire anathema and delivers to Satan all those who do not wish to believe that bread and wine are the true and natural body and blood of Christ and are physically eaten and drunk. But if no one publicly disapproves of this rash sentence of excommunication, how much, I ask, is the danger threatening the truth? Will not many think that the truth must either be denied or kept silent? Again, if Luther is allowed to establish articles of faith at his own discretion and impose them on everyone to be believed by his private authority, what else can we expect to happen from this than that the most audacious will bring forth all the figments and dreams of their own heads as accepted articles of faith and strike those who contradict them with the dire thunderbolt of anathema? And yet we read that these were not the least beginnings and increases of the rising papacy. What? Luther also openly joins himself to the Papists, saying that their opinion is orthodox and that the church under the papacy is holy and catholic. We indeed greatly fear here that, blinded by the stubbornness of hatred and envy, he seeks this one thing, that he may oppress us by whatever plans or aids he can.</p>
      <p>We, however, frankly confess and testify that we have never fallen into enmity with Luther out of private hatred. We do not deny that he was a great man and a servant not to be regretted in the house of the Lord. Yet we cannot yet pronounce that all things done by him are works of the Spirit, since he is agitated by such great and immoderate intemperance of emotions, that he, unmindful of his duty and of the church, rages so much against the innocent without any just cause and is the author of such a pernicious stumbling block.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Albert, we have not undertaken this response because we wish to detract anything from the authority of the Lutheran name, or because we delight in the pernicious desire to contend, but because we were compelled by the weapon of extreme necessity to take up the public and common cause of truth and to assert the innocence of our churches by public writing. All those who are truly pious and faithful among us have seen this. The same has been seen by the most honorable council of our city, by whose advice and consent these things have been written and published.</p>
      <p>We now turn to you, dear brother Albert, concerning these many matters, because your faith and integrity are fully known to us, which can also provide no small support to divine truth in this place. You undoubtedly see where Luther primarily aims. For he tries to teach and accomplish by his example that neither we nor our writings can find any place, that no one may hear us, that no one may admit or read our writings. And what is this injustice in so great a theologian! He accuses us of heresy and, as far as he is able, takes away all means of defense. He thus constitutes himself both accuser and witness and judge.</p>
      <p>Since it is known that the minds of some depend almost entirely on his nod, there is a danger that they, following Luther's example, may reject the truth and proscribe our books, with which we have endeavored to support it. Therefore, as we seek the helping hands of many, so we uniquely request your assistance in this most honorable cause. Your faith and proven integrity have earned you the favor and friendship of many most faithful and powerful princes. They use your counsel, they listen to you speaking, they desire your assistance in all things. The first of them is the most valiant soldier of Christ and fearless patron of evangelical truth, the Archbishop of Cologne, to whom the Bishop of Münster, a follower of the same studies, is added. We therefore beseech and implore you again and again to deign to act with these men on our behalf, or rather on behalf of the truth, so that they do not condemn our books, do not proscribe them, do not prohibit their reading by public or more secret edicts.</p>
      <p>For there is no danger, nor can they in any way hinder the begun Reformation: For as we have strived for simplicity in all things, so too have we strived for modesty.</p>
      <p>Nor are there lacking in every place those who recognize and profess the truth, whom the proscription of our books could terrify more than the begun zeal for Reformation could gladden. These know Paul's opinion, who commands to test all things and hold fast to what is good. Nor is there such insolence in our minds that we wish to impose all our private authority on anyone as divine oracles. We willingly endure the judgments of truly faithful churches, and whoever can finally teach us better will find us grateful. Therefore, we hope that you will by no means fail those who ask for such just things. For you know that no man's authority is so great that the estimation of divine truth should not be greater. May the Lord God enlighten both you and all the faithful who are with you with His Spirit and always advance you to the glory and honor of His name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Faithfully commend us to the most reverend Lord Archbishop of Cologne, for whose safety we continually pray; to whom, as we wish all joyful things, so we offer him our service and all our efforts with all our hearts.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed Albert.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, the day before the Ides of March, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>The ministers and readers of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Albert Hardenberg of Friesland, a friend and brother in Christ, uniquely beloved, etc.</p>
