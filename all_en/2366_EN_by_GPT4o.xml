      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Theodoricus Bitter sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I do not know for what reason your most friendly and always most welcome letters to me have been completely interrupted for several years, unless it is because you recently accused me of brevity in your letters.</p>
      <p>But I confess frankly the tepidity and the unrefined and unpracticed nature of my writing, which is why I have also held back my hand for some time. However, if I have sinned in this, I pray you grant me pardon; for I have always thought to myself: to whom will the verbosity of the unrefined and unlearned be pleasing? Believe me, this is the one thing that has made me not only brief but also more hesitant in writing before. And because I noticed that this displeased you, I have completely refrained for several years, not because your memory has diminished or been buried with me, which will never happen while I live; for you can hardly believe how much I desire to converse with you in person, even for just one hour; then I would most easily remove what you have gathered as a nuisance in me - but because this is denied, I beseech and implore you to begin again to speak familiarly with your old comrade in studies, at least through writing. And if you wish to be informed of my affairs, I am still in good health along with my poor wife and children, as well as that old master Lysius, whom I left healthy when departing from Cologne. With these few words, farewell; for the affairs in which I was involved called me far elsewhere. And if, by God's will, you enjoy your most delightful letters or are again deemed worthy, I will write more copiously about each matter. Given in Speyer, in the year of our Lord 1554, on Tuesday, August 21.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and also distinguished in piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful ecclesiastic in Zürich, my most integral friend and always to be honored lord.</p>
      <p>From Zürich.</p>
