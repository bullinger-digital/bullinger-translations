      <p>Greetings. I am often without messengers; hence, I write to you less frequently, and for this reason, I also think I receive fewer letters from you. However, I did receive those you sent recently, along with these, which I now return to you and thank you for them. I cannot write much at present.</p>
      <p>Several Swiss cohorts passed through here on the 23rd and 24th of this month; where they are headed and for whose aid, they themselves do not know. Great disturbances are feared; however, no one knows anything for certain. It is generally asserted that the king has summoned them only for the defense of his borders, as he sees preparations being made elsewhere. We will soon hear how the matter will turn out. Many believe that an attack was entirely intended against Geneva, had that peace with Savoy not intervened; others deny this. It is certain that in recent days, the lord of Movans, who commanded the Geneva garrison, passed through Neuchâtel with 12 horsemen towards Germany. Everyone concludes from this that he will summon German troops and lead them into France. We hear nothing more about the emperor wanting to wage war against the French; I hope to have something certain from you soon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the matter I recently wrote about is being discussed here. The French are pressing; many of our people, especially the more powerful, are very inclined towards them; those who are more pious abhor it. We cry out and do our duty; what we will achieve, the Lord knows. The affairs of France are now in such a state that those who wish to form alliances with them seem insane; but private gains blind the eyes of even the prudent.</p>
      <p>May the Lord resist Satan and the counsels of Ahithophel! Our Steiger has taken a wife these days, the daughter of Lord Consul Nägeli; on the next new moon, which will be August 4th, he will celebrate the wedding with her at Bremgarten Castle; she is called Magdalena.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the wife of Lord Weber died in childbirth, leaving the poor old man with 6 small children, whom he had with her, whom he married not many years ago as a young woman. Nothing else comes to mind now.</p>
      <p>I am sending these to Bruges, so that you may receive them from there, as I have no other messenger now.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of mine greet you and yours; I also pray for the health of all yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 30, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
