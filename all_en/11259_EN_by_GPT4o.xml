    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not respond to Vadian's letter [No. 1213] immediately because he could not speak with Provost [Heinrich Brennwald] or the widow [Rubli] until the messenger's return. However, she has now agreed, according to a letter from Brennwald, to pay the ten guilders on October 16th; Bullinger recommends the orphan boy [Sebastian Uriel Appenzeller] to Vadian. Assumes that the council has now set the date for the assembly in Baden, after he reminded [Diethelm] Röist about it. The printer is pressing. Thanks for the [satirical] poem.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I ask you, my most esteemed Vadian, not to be upset that I did not respond to your recent letter. The young man delivered it in the evening, when night was already approaching and darkness was driving away the light; he left before 7 in the morning. In the meantime, I was not able to speak with the Provost or the widow; therefore, I could not respond to your matters. But now I inform you of the widow's consent. She will pay ten guilders on the day of St. Gall; this is confirmed by a note written to me by Provost Brennwald in his own hand. I did not want this to be hidden from you, lest it be a disadvantage to the orphan, whom I commend to you. Farewell. I believe the council has set the date for the assembly in Baden; for I reminded Röist. I cannot say more now. The printer is pressing me. I thank you for the excellent poem. January 21, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
