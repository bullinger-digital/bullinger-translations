    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter from March 17, which he received after returning from Venice, and is pleased with his work on the Matthew commentary; [at the fair] in Frankfurt, there was no negotiation about the cloth mediated to Heinrich [Falkner] [see No. 1587]; Hilles will not reduce the already favorable price, but he is willing to either accept the money or the remaining cloth, which he can even sell at a higher price. Asks Bullinger to pay the proceeds from the sale of the cloth [see No. 1569] to poor [religious refugees]; he has also sent money to Calvin for the same purpose, without, however, disclosing his involvement in Zurich; Falkner is to pay Bullinger 31½ guilders for the cloth for this purpose; if he does not agree, Bullinger should sell the cloth himself or send it to Hilles in Strasbourg, so that he can sell it there for the charitable purpose. Thanks for the written recommendation of Peter Hürtzel [Hirzel] and Andreas Rappenstein; his wife [Anna Hilles] would not have let C[hristoph] Froschauer vouch for them if she had known this; the two have paid off their debts to him except for a small amount through Konrad Eblie [Äbli?], quite unlike Falkner. [John] Butler sold his entire inheritance [in Warwickshire] during the last Lent, but he is still waiting for part of the proceeds; Hilles is worried that Butler may not be allowed to leave England if news of this sale reaches the king [Henry VIII.] through the husband [Edmund Felton?] of Butler's sister [Frances Butler?], a courtier; [Nicholas] Eliott is studying law and already holds a well-paid position due to his talent; Bartholomew Traheron has withdrawn from the court to the countryside with many difficulties, where he intends to marry the daughter of a pious and financially well-off nobleman; Traheron also plans to run a grammar school there. Various news from England: The king [Henry VIII.] had his wife Catherine Howard executed, whom he married right after divorcing Anne of Cleves; Catherine was suspected of adultery with two nobles [Thomas Culpepper and Francis Derham]; Lady Rochford [Jane Parker], the widow of [George Boleyn], who was executed for incest with his sister Anne [Boleyn], was also beheaded because she knew about the adultery. The old Duchess [Agnes] of Norfolk and William Howard, the brother of the Duke [Thomas] of Norfolk, are imprisoned in the Tower of London for being aware of Catherine's sinful lifestyle; one of the convicted adulterers [Thomas Culpepper?] was a courtier whom the king had pardoned after a previous rape and subsequent manslaughter. It would be dangerous for Hilles if Bullinger were to dedicate [a publication] on religious matters to him, and he is not worthy of it; has received the cheese and regrets Bullinger's illness; asks him to keep a piece of cloth as a gift; apologizes for this barbaric letter; does not intend to write further to Bullinger; regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings and steadfastness in the truth of Christ! After I safely returned home from Venice, I received your letter written on March 17th. Upon reading it, I was filled with great joy to learn that you have been working on such a pious and useful task for the church, intending to publish some commentaries on Matthew. May God, the Best and Greatest, bless your endeavor and grant it a successful outcome!</p>
      <p>Regarding the sheared cloth, nothing was negotiated with H. Falkner in Frankfurt; and there is no reason to hope that I would willingly or even be able to reduce the price by a single batz. However, if there is any of the same cloth left, let him send it to me here at our fair; I am content with that, and I will receive the remaining cloth as gladly as the money itself: for I am not mistaken about the quality of that cloth. I set the price at 11 batz per Frankfurt ell with the cross, and if I had the same cloth here, I could quickly sell it for twelve batz per full Strasbourg ell.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, my lord, that we do not delay any longer in deciding something about what I have intended for the poor exiles from the same cloth; namely, half of its price, or, if you prefer, the whole. For I have already given some money to Lord Calvin for such a purpose; but I have never mentioned anything to him about you or that cloth, nor do I wish to do so in the future. Therefore, what I have willingly intended to distribute to the poor through you, I beg you to carry out, whether you wish to retain the price of half or, if the matter requires, the whole cloth: for the more I distribute through you, the less I leave for myself to distribute for a similar purpose. Whatever I do in such matters, I do willingly and with a cheerful heart without murmuring. Therefore, I pray you, whether you decide to keep half the sum, if you prefer, or the entire sum, which I would prefer, to inform me of this through your letters at our fair. For I wish that immediately after receiving these letters, you would receive 31½ florins from H. Falkner (calculated at 16 batz per florin) for that sheared cloth; so that when Falkner comes, there will be no need for further accounting between me and him regarding that cloth. If he objects that the cloth was not worth that much, then I pray you to receive whatever remains from him, and if you can, sell it there to your friends; or, which I would prefer (so as not to hinder your studies), arrange for it to be transferred to me here through some merchant: and I will faithfully send you the equivalent amount of money in Zurich.</p>
      <p>I am glad that you commend Peter Hürtzel, and especially Andreas Rappenstein, to me in your letters; and if my wife had known this at the last fair, she would not have asked C. Froschauer to vouch for them. However, I pray that they do not take it amiss that this was done through my wife. For she had never seen them before, nor, as far as I remember, had she ever heard them commended by me as they deserve. These two good men treated me faithfully in the previous fair in Frankfurt: for they owed me about 133 florins at that time, all of which, except for three, they sent to me through D. Conrad Eble. However, Heinrich does not deal with me in such good faith: for he owed me about 200 florins at the last fair (besides the aforementioned sheared cloth); of which, instead of batz (in Rabpemintze), he paid only 46 florins and 14 batz in Basel for a certain friend of mine: and he paid them so untimely that my friend had to send his servant from Strasbourg with 20 of those 46 florins to Basel during Lent, because Falkner did not fulfill what he promised even in such a small matter. Butler's brother sold his entire inheritance in England, as I received by letters, during the last Lent: but he has not yet received all his money. However, I fear for him that after what he did reaches the king's ears through his brother-in-law, the courtier, he may again be forbidden to leave the kingdom. Eliott is studying civil law, or, to speak more correctly, the laws of our kingdom: and he has advanced so much in that order that he now holds a position from which he receives an income of nearly 200 florins annually. Bartholomew Trehern has withdrawn from the court with much labor to the countryside, where he intends to marry the daughter of a nobleman who favors pious doctrine, and with that virgin, he will have an annual income of 120 florins (as I hear) for 60 years from a field leased at a fixed price for the same number of years by his father-in-law. Moreover, he intends to teach grammar in a small town in that region and thus instruct the young ones.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of the entire kingdom, I have nothing certain to write, except what I believe you heard three months ago, namely, that the king beheaded his wife Catherine Howard, whom he married immediately after divorcing Anne of Cleves. This Catherine was condemned for great suspicion of adultery (as all the English say) with two nobles, who also had relations with her before the king married her. Furthermore, Lady Rochford, the widow of that nobleman who was executed for incest with his sister (Queen Anne), as you know, was also beheaded. This widow, they say, was aware of the unchastity of this recently beheaded Catherine. For she often slept with the queen; and when she knew that she was once away from the chamber for a long time at the privy, at the same time, they say, when one of those nobles who were beheaded was also there, she nevertheless did not disclose this matter to the king, etc. The old Duchess of Norfolk was also handed over to perpetual custody in the Tower of London, as well as a certain Lord William Howard, the brother of the Duke of Norfolk: because they knew that Queen Catherine was a harlot when the king was inflamed with love for her, and they did not inform him of this before those sudden nuptials were consummated. One of those nobles now first hanged for adultery with the queen, then beheaded and dismembered, was one of the king's chamberlains, and less than two years ago, he violently raped the wife of a certain man who guards enclosed deer in the wilder fields (a heinous crime), with three or four of his most impious servants holding her at his command. Nevertheless, he was pardoned by the king for this crime after he had been handed over by the peasants to chains for this crime, and moreover, for murder in resisting them when they first wanted to capture him. God, who is just, does not always overlook crimes among us, nor anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Without endangering my affairs, you cannot inscribe anything about the Christian religion: moreover, if it were allowed, I am not worthy of such glory. Therefore, I have many thanks for your goodwill towards me; and I pray you to bestow this honor on someone else who is worthy of it. I received your cheese before these letters were sealed, and I regret that you have spent so much money on my behalf; especially since you are suffering from a fever. But all the works of the Lord are just judgments, who corrects those he loves, and chastises every son he receives. I beseech you to accept those eight ells of cloth, which you have, as a gift from me, and do not send money: for I would sincerely wish that you keep them with you, and use that cloth, if you please, as a sign, whatever it may be, that I love and truly honor your piety in the Lord. When I read these barbaric letters again, I was so overcome with shame that I almost decided to break them and write nothing at all to you: which I certainly would have done if you had not so much provoked me to write about the state of all of us.</p>
      <p>Now farewell in Christ, my most esteemed lord: for I do not intend to write back to you in the future, unless perhaps through some messenger, when necessity urges me. My wife wishes you and your most pious wife well. Do not disdain to greet your wife in my name as well. Again, farewell in God, who is our portion in the land of the living, and our hope for the future. Amen. Strasbourg, May 10, 1542.</p>
      <p>You know who, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed friend in the Lord, let letters be given, in Zurich.</p>
