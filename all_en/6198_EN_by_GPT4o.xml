      <p>S. I wrote another letter three days ago; but since the messenger has delayed his departure until today, I now add this to it: Firstly, my lords, councilors, and citizens yesterday heard the written responses that have come from all the held assemblies of the countryside regarding the Saffoic affair, and since it dragged on past noon, the remaining deliberation was postponed until today. It will be dealt with today; may God grant that it ends well! As soon as I learn how it went, I will let you know, and perhaps even before this letter reaches you; for I am sending this to Birrweil, as I have no other messenger available. Meanwhile, there is lamentable news from the Augst Valley; for on the 6th day of this month of July, around 7 in the morning, a mountain is said to have fallen and buried the village of Arras, not far from the city of Augst, along with people, cattle, and everything that was there, so that nothing remains and neither stump nor stone of anything can be seen anymore; only a bell from the tower is said to have been thrown out. The brook that flowed there is also said to have swelled, and the breach is so large that no way can be made, and they fear it will go for them as it did for those in Bellinzona years ago. There is someone here in the city who is said to have seen it since; however, I have not heard it from him myself.</p>
      <p>But the bailiff of Aelen, who was sent there to investigate the matter, has reported it to me as such. From France, nothing further comes than that it is said the Prince of Cond√©, the Admiral, and others have earnestly offered to the King and Queen that they are lying and keeping the peace and edict; for if not, there will be a much more miserable lamentation in France than ever before. The German princes have also offered them the same.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is also a rumor that the Admiral has taken the city of Abbeville in Picardy, which is very strong and a real pass into Germany, and that the war will begin as firmly as before.</p>
      <p>However, it is not yet known for certain.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God prevent it and protect them and us from disaster.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell well with all yours.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 18, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compatriot. Zurich.</p>
