      <p>Greetings. At the same time, your letters, honorable man and dearest brother, written on the 10th of this month, are delivered by post, for which we give the greatest thanks, praying without interruption to the Lord, that He may bless our efforts, and within the hour I must preach, finally these letters must be written; for after the sermon, our envoys will depart for Solothurn. Therefore, no time is left for me to write.</p>
      <p>Our envoys are instructed to seriously negotiate with the 11 cantons, who are in the French alliance, not to send soldiers against the nobility and princes of France, but rather to send a delegation that seeks peace. However, those who come from the 5 Cantons affirm that the soldiers absolutely want to depart and that everything is already being prepared and almost ready. What will happen, I cannot say for certain; however, I fear that our people will no longer be able to restrain those furious ones, and if they are to depart, only the most bitter enemies of the gospel from the 5 Cantons, from other disobedient places, will depart. Would that the most illustrious Prince of Condé would take care of himself in time!</p>
      <p>I fear the Guise faction deliberately prolongs the matter until they are ready; then they will not spare them. Thus, 30 years ago, the 5 Cantons dealt with us; they pretended peace when we were ready, while they also gathered strength, saw us unprepared, and attacked us. Let the prince be warned in time.</p>
      <p>The envoy Coignet gravely complains about Frölich; he is solely pressing this matter. Letters have been written to the court in Solothurn, in which the envoy is accused of having prevented the soldiers from being sent until now; but he says he is sustained by good hope and awaits the helping hand of God.</p>
      <p>It will be beneficial if you confirm him with written letters, which I also do. The prefect of Frauenfeld informs me of the vile lies being spread about you: that France follows your doctrine, but you teach the most impious doctrine, hence he thinks it would be beneficial if you publish a brief confession; he is unaware, of course, that many of this kind have been published by you. But I am now compelled to break off the letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you together with your church and fellow ministers! May 18, 1562.</p>
      <p>I have not reread.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
