The opponents only refer to it in a veiled manner. They try to promote their secret Lutheranism through new customs; however, their cunning has meanwhile been uncovered. - The Small Council would be divided if it were to discuss the [Eucharist]. Therefore, it has not reacted to the [“True Confession”] of the [Zurichers]. However, many read this booklet, and it is very well received. - Greetings to the friends.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although I am greatly troubled by the serious illness of my little daughter, who is suffering, and the absence of my wife, who now hopes to recover her former health at the spa, and whose health has also been severely shaken, to pass over other things that attack me both privately and publicly, I did not want to let this messenger return to you empty-handed, lest you suspect that my mind has changed. It pains me that you might consider me so inconstant and fickle. However much Satan sifts me, the Lord, my support, sustains me.</p>
      <p>The sacramental dispute is almost asleep among us, so that, having made little progress, they speak only covertly, so that only the sharp-minded understand. But by another way, they urge ceremonies and obscure Lutheranism. But their deceit is detected, so I trust they will succumb.</p>
      <p>The Small Council is divided into two parts, if anything is to be discussed on this matter. Therefore, they suspend it and fear each other, for they flare up against one another. Therefore, your booklet is also kept silent about and nothing is written back, although it is bought and read by many; and it pleases very much.</p>
      <p>Greet all good friends, to whom you will commend me everywhere, especially. Farewell excellently. Given hastily, June 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and faithful man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zurich church, his ever-to-be-respected patron.</p>
