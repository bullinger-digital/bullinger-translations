    <p xml:id="regest1">Today [Johannes] Haller shared that the messenger [Markus...] returning to Zurich could take a letter with him. The [Zurichers] who had accompanied Haller to Augsburg left Augsburg without Musculus knowing about it. Now, however, he wants to take the opportunity to write to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [religious] discussion in Regensburg has come to nothing. The Emperor [Charles V] wanted the presidents, who are all papists, to choose the recorders only from the [Catholic camp]; that all participants in the discussion should swear an oath not to disclose anything about the negotiations to anyone; and that at the end of the meeting there should be no report, but only a list of the [points of faith] on which agreement could or could not be reached, and which should be signed by all. [Johann Frederick I] of Saxony then ordered that everyone should leave the meeting until a better procedure could be agreed upon. The envoys from Saxony [Lorenz Zoch and Georg Maior] departed on the 20th, Bucer and [Martin] Frecht on the 21st of March. Bucer headed towards Heidelberg to [Frederick II] of the Palatinate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Spaniard Juan Diaz was murdered with an axe on the morning of March 27th by [Juan Prieto], the servant of his brother Alfonso Diaz, in Neuburg [on the Danube]. The two perpetrators managed to escape with the carter but were intercepted in Füssen: A terrible example of how the Roman Curia kills the pious to assert their standpoint; as if it were possible to extinguish the truth of Christ.</p>

      <p>S.D. Today, our Haller informed me after my sermon, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, that there is a certain messenger here who will return to you, through whom, if there is time, I can write to you. Although there is nothing that necessarily needs to be written, I did not want to neglect the opportunity presented; for those who came with Haller left without my knowledge.</p>

      <p>The colloquium in Regensburg has come to nothing, and for the following reasons: The Emperor wanted the notaries to be chosen by the presidents, who are, however, professed papists, and he did not want any of our people to be appointed. Then he wanted all the persons appointed to the colloquium to be bound to silence by an oath, so that none of them would reveal to any mortal what was being done or had been done in this colloquium, without the consent and permission of his majesty. Thirdly, he did not want anything of the proceedings to be written down by the notaries, but only the bare articles to be noted, in which there was agreement or disagreement. Our people sent these conditions to the Elector of Saxony, who replied that, having bid farewell to this colloquium, each should return to his home until a better form and manner of colloquy is established.</p>

      <p>Thus, on the 20th of this month, the Saxons departed, and on the 21st, Bucer and Frecht. Bucer went to Heidelberg, called by the Elector Palatine. On the 27th of this month, Juan Diaz, a learned and pious Spaniard who had come to Regensburg with Bucer, was killed in Neuburg between the 5th and 6th hour by the servant of his brother Alfonso Diaz, a doctor of the anti-Christian court, struck with an axe in the basement, while the brother waited for the servant, with whom and the courier he fled. But, as I hear, he was intercepted not far from Füssen. It is a horrible story of the deed and a clear example of the Roman Curia's actions, committed by a brother against a brother for the sake of the antichrist. They want to defend their cause with these arguments, as if it were possible that the truth of Christ could be extinguished by the shedding of the blood of the pious. Farewell, dearest of men. Greet Mr. Gessner and Mr. Gwalther, the most esteemed lords and brothers. Augsburg, March 30, 1546.</p>
