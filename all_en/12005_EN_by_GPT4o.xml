    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes that a Lasco has received his letter written in June; this was entrusted to Bucer in Strasbourg for further delivery, along with a letter to Johannes Reekamp and two book gifts: for a Lasco, the refutation of Cochläus's writing ["Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio"] and for Reekamp the same book as well as the writings dedicated to the King of England [Henry VIII.] "De scripturae [sanctae] authoritate... [deque episcoporum... institutione et] functione"; however, Bullinger fears that Bucer might not have forwarded the shipment, as Bullinger disapproves of Bucer's negotiations and retractions [in the matter of the Lord's Supper]; accordingly, he sends again a copy of the letter to Reekamp, prepared by his little son [Heinrich], but cannot do the same with a Lasco's letter, as he does not have a copy of it. Enno Frisius [Cirksena] from Emden was briefly visiting Zürich with others [Joachim Münsinger and... from Freiburg] and praised a Lasco highly to them. Bullinger encloses another letter for Hermann Aquilomontanus, who serves in Oldersum near Emden. If the latter has died, a Lasco may consider the letter as delivered to him.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote to your kindness, most illustrious man, in the month of June and I hope you have received it. For I sent it to Strasbourg to Mr. Bucer, only asking him to ensure in good faith that it was delivered to you. I also enclosed another letter for the venerable father Mr. Johannes Reekamp, Abbot of Aduard, whom I encourage to reform the churches of Friesland. To both of you, I sent a small paper gift: to you, my response to Mr. Johannes Cochlaeus's book On the Authority of Scripture and the Church; to the abbot, I gave the same book, but I also added Cochlaeus's and two other books of mine On the Authority of Scriptures and the Function of Bishops dedicated to the King of England. If Bucer did not take care of this, I think of nothing else than that he is more negligent in handling my matters, which I have not yet been able to approve of his compositions and Retractions, by which he indeed wishes to benefit the church; but I truly think they do much harm. Certainly, I am sending here a copy of my letter to Mr. Abbot, so that if anything has been neglected by his negligence, it may be repaired by you with this example written by the hand of my boy. I did not take care to have yours copied, so I could not give any copy. However, I replied to your most welcome letters, namely those given to me in March. Otherwise, I hope everything has been returned in good faith. If not, I beg you, do not let me remain ignorant.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write at present, except that this month a certain learned young man, Enno Frisius, a citizen of Emden, was with us, who highly commended your faith and diligence in the gospel of Christ to the ministers and brothers of Zürich. But he stayed with us scarcely an hour or two.</p>
      <p>For he had companions on his journey who were in great haste. I also wrote to Mr. Hermann Aquilomontanus, minister of the church of Oldersum near Emden, an old friend and brother. If you deliver these to him, you will have done a most welcome deed. I instructed him to also present them to your kindness. If therefore he has passed away, you may consider them addressed to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and kindly excuse my rusticity. Zürich in Switzerland, August 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Johannes a Lasco, Polish Baron, now residing in Emden in Friesland, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Emden.</p>
