      <p>Greetings. Dear son, I have nothing to write at the moment. I am expecting your letter along with the promised booklet on the types of divination. We are all quite well. Take care of the enclosed items.</p>
      <p>Especially greet Mr. Christoph Froschauer; pray that he does not take it badly that I am not writing now, for I am overwhelmed and exhausted by the multitude of tasks. Live well and farewell. Greet Mr. Garnier, the head of the French church. Everyone here sends their regards to you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 22. Spend your time well. Kindly greet the master and mistress.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, your father.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Heinrich Bullinger with Mr. Johann Burckhardt, Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>March 22, 1554.</p>
