      <p>Greetings in the Lord. There are many things I should write to your kindness if I were to indulge the sentiments of my heart; but due to the numerous affairs with which I am presently overwhelmed, I can scarcely write anything, nor indeed could all these matters be properly entrusted to letters, and this Johannes Smutz will convey them much better in speech. Oh, the great disaster received by our people, oh, the true piety rejected, oh, the divine wrath justly stirred against us! I dare not say more; understand the rest. We were not so much in the highest hope of restoring true religion as we are now in fear of impious and nefarious idolatry being recalled. Pour out, I pray, prayers for me and those like me.</p>
      <p>We few such men are compelled to testify about true piety and religion; all our leaders are overwhelmed by that disaster and thrown into prisons; I mean the bishops and such. May God be with us! We also speak in vain; for what will happen, (unless God changes it otherwise), is determined. Only that we may profess in whom we believe and what religion we hold, the condition has been offered to us to resist the adversaries; what the end will be, God knows, and whether this is the last thing I write to your kindness or not. I am very sorry that I could not provide for your Smutz as fully through the Duke of Suffolk as I would have wished and hoped, unless it had happened in such a way that I cannot recall without tears. Therefore, forgive me for not writing more about it; I do not doubt that the entire series of the tragedy has been conveyed to you. The Duke himself retains his true God and, I hope, will fully retain his opinion of true religion (with God's help) especially against the devil's will and his members' utmost efforts to act against his dominion. That he may do this better, I commend his dominion to your prayers and commend myself and those like me. I pray, give my greetings to Mr. Bibliander. May God be with you by His Spirit to the end and through you always illuminate His name, as He has done so far.</p>
      <p>London, 30th November 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed father in Christ, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
