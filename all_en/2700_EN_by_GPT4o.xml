      <p>As Bartholomew returns, I am compelled to send you some letters, most illustrious Bullinger; however, I will not write much, as he will tell you in person what is happening with us. Listen to him, to whom I have also given some writings to deliver.</p>
      <p>Mr. Laski sent his own messenger to me from Frankfurt and in very detailed letters asked me whether it seemed advisable to me if he were to proceed to Worms, where some princes were to convene, and discuss concord in the sacramental cause. I replied that it did not seem to me the time for such a harvest, as the grapes have not yet ripened, so he refrained. When the plague subsides in TÃ¼bingen, he writes that he will come to me to confer on some matters for a few weeks. I truly embrace the man as if someone sent from heaven, very much also for your favor, indeed I wrote to him that I knew from you what he had done for me in England, if I had wished to go there.</p>
      <p>From the kingdom of Poland, almost nothing or absolutely nothing good. The priests have prevailed; that marshal has been appointed as an envoy to the Antichrist, to ask him for permission to reform the churches. When the most illustrious prince, about to go hunting, told me this over lunch, I replied: "It is as if you were to send an embassy to the boars and deer and ask for permission to hunt; for who does not know that they will refuse? Much better is hoped for from the king of Bohemia; it is certain that he favors us. It can hardly be said how fervent many are in Carinthia, Styria, Carniola, I speak of the leading men. These are the ones who ask for the New Testament to be sent to them in Slavic and have prepared not a small amount of money for the expense.</p>
      <p>I now cultivate those provinces more diligently; I am entirely there, with those who seem truly pious to me. But listen, Bullinger, God has sent me a man from Dalmatia, who has translated the entire Bible into Slavic and has written it in the characters of that language.</p>
      <p>It is a treasure; therefore, when I have given the New Testament, which is now in hand, I will turn to the labor of all the Scriptures and I hope money will not be lacking; for I use God as my treasurer; do I not have a rich one? I said I would write little and yet you see it flows, from the abundance of the heart with my Bullinger. I will add two things: someone from Locarno is coming to me to bring the horse I lent to Bartholomew. Therefore, since I wrote to Sanlaurenzianus, the king's envoy, I say, if he wishes to send any letters to me, which the Locarnese now brings to me, to send them to you; I beseech you, if he sends them, give them to the one you hear is coming. If Bartholomew wishes to devote himself to letters, I offered him free lodging under my roof for a year and I hope to give it even longer. You recommended him to me; behold, how I am disposed towards him, and certainly he is of good talent and wonderfully pious.</p>
      <p>I almost omitted what is of more importance: I thank your senate, I thank you, I thank all the colleagues very much for receiving Occhino; nothing could have been done more beneficially for this Italian church.</p>
      <p>I bid your sons-in-law, Mr. Gwalter and the other ministers, to be well. Pray for me. Listen, which I must not omit: Beza complains very vehemently in letters with me, that I have helped Mr. Gribaldi. I replied modestly and among other things that Gribaldi himself made a confession of his faith with you and satisfied you. It will be useful for you to know this, not that I ask you to give this testimony spontaneously, but if they ask for anything. They are certainly good; but sometimes they are carried away by a certain (so to speak) immoderate zeal. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Reutlingen, August 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>We have been silent for a very long time between us. The cause of my silence was the long delay of Mr. Gribaldi; for as I expected him daily, I omitted[...]</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, honorable brother.</p>
