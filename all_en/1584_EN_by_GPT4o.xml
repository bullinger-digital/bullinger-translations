      <p>Greetings in Christ, and joy of the Holy Spirit!</p>
      <p>Our affairs are such, most excellent man, that I hardly have anything to convey to you in my letter, unless perhaps you wish to know what is being decided in the synod regarding ecclesiastical matters, and in what state the affairs of our prince are. However, since I am certain that you will learn all these things from the letters of Johanna, the duke's daughter, and Treherne, I consider it unnecessary to write more about these matters at present. Instead, I eagerly await your letters every single day, and hope they are as I most desire. You will recognize Chekum as a most learned and faithful friend, and Warwick as a most gracious and courageous prince. If they are delivered by me, I dare to pledge my word that you will receive a response from all of them immediately. As soon as I receive them, you will know what has been done by me. There is nothing new in my affairs, except that I have assumed the dignity of the masters by the order of Cox and with the consent of Martyr. At the same time, I will lay aside these trifles and the desires of my homeland, and with singular diligence and study, I will strive to achieve the purpose for which I departed from there. Farewell for a long time, most learned man and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Oxford, written hastily on the calends of March, 1552.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johannes von Ulm, in the Lord, your son.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
