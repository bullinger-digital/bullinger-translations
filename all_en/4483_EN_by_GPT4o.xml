      <p>Greetings. A good woman came to me inquiring whether I had written anything to you; she said she had brought letters the day before to Simpertus and concerning me; but I had not yet received any. I inquire about them; finally, they are returned.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I ask the woman to wait a little while I write quickly; if therefore it is less composed, do not take offense. Would that the lord from Navarra would request military aid from the 4 Evangelical Cities for the defense of his side; the Guises from the Cantons for theirs; thus we hope that auxiliary forces would be denied to both parties and the Swiss would remain at home, hence the matter might perhaps be settled in another way. I am sending then the theses on the Lord's Supper debated in Heidelberg, as you will understand from the attached letters; return them as soon as possible; for Mr. Laurentianus requests them. Here Mr. Peyer wrote in August, but he had not yet received your writings. He also reports that Hosius is still lingering in Vienna, earnestly urging the emperor that a council be held without delay, but in such a way that the council recently held in Trent be continued, that what was done there be ratified, and where it ended, it should now begin anew. The Emperor completely opposes this, adding the reason that the Protestants, etc., would never agree to this council and therefore none will be held at all.</p>
      <p>We will wait to see what response the bishop will give to our people. We hope for reconciliation between the 5 Cantons and the people of Glarus.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Mr. Bullinger, the woman is in such a hurry that I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Simpertus sends his greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, October 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Jakob Rüeger. To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
