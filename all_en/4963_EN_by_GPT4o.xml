      <p>Greetings. Since Mr. Peter Martyr is writing to you, I do not doubt that from his letters you will sufficiently understand his good health, and that I have neglected nothing in maintaining it. You will also be informed about the progress of religion; I will write more in the future.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>At Saint-Germain 14th of September.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
