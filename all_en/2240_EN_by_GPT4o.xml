      <p>To the most distinguished man and faithful pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed brother and fellow minister. Greetings. These two English brothers had already crossed the sea just before the death of King Edward. At that time, they brought me a recommendation from our Richard Heill, whose integrity is known to you. Since then, they have conducted themselves honorably and modestly among us and in Lausanne, so I have no hesitation in recommending them to you, especially since they will not cause you any trouble, except in one matter, which will be neither bothersome nor laborious for you. Namely, that you join them with trustworthy companions with whom they can safely reach Italy. Not that they demand this care from you, but because they hope that if you just say a word to a host or someone else, it will be very beneficial to them.</p>
      <p>Our situation, though not well settled, is now quite peaceful. The Lord has looked upon His flock, which He has gathered from various places. For the wicked had experienced everything before they yielded. Would that our patience and gentleness might correct their depravity. They cannot deny that the private injuries, which were very serious, were calmly forgiven by me. Indeed, I do not doubt that the Lord, suspending the punishment they deserve and continually provoke, has spared His elect. For no correction is yet apparent in that part. However, just as if nothing had been heard about our disturbances in France, a great multitude of people has gathered from all sides to celebrate Easter. And although the king has placed guards to block all passages, and the prefects diligently execute this mandate, and even the most wicked traitor of a legate from a nearby watchtower plots whatever ambushes he can, the zeal for piety overcomes all fears, so that good men penetrate through so many obstacles. In France, persecution continues as usual. Recently, the king decreed in each province that he would punish the judges for their lethargy, as if they were complicit, unless they more vigorously investigate the professors of our faith. Meanwhile, I do not know what omen it is that changes the entire legal system. He arms the soldiers to inflame the English movements with new fuel. He equips a strong fleet at Marseille: but the main nerves of war seem to be directed towards Italy, unless Caesar diverts his course from the opposite side. It is also said that he is raising troops among your people. In short, he is as busy as if he intended to mix heaven and earth. But because he is guided by the worst counsels, and against the pure doctrine he does not relent from his usual cruelty and arrogance, I expect nothing but a sad and unfortunate outcome from all these machinations, which he undertakes as if against an opposing god.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to you for the sermons, not only because you sent the book, but because I see that a friendly and honorable mention of me was made there. It was rightly done that you purged our churches from the slanders of the wicked, who do not cease to vex them with the fans of discord. However, I do not know how much you have achieved with the King of Denmark. For I suppose you already know how inhumanely Mr. Johannes a Lasco was recently received by him, along with the crowd of exiles he was leading. For he was ordered by a violent edict to immediately leave the kingdom's borders in the harshest winter.</p>
      <p>Since you wrote to our Beza about a certain Master Westphal, I have finally obtained the book. Furthermore, I would like to know from you whether it is advisable to respond. For if you think so, I will gladly spend three days' work on that writing. A book was also recently printed in Basel under false names, in which Castalio and N. argue that heretics should not be coerced by the sword.</p>
      <p>Would that the pastors of that church awaken, even if late, so that the evil does not spread further. Farewell, most distinguished man and my honored brother. You will convey my warmest greetings to Mr. Gwalther, Pellican, your family, and the other brothers and fellow ministers in my name. Mr. Margrave Vici, our Celsus Martinengo, Budaeus, my fellow ministers, and many friends all greet you. May the Lord continually protect you and your family and guide you with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Geneva, March 28, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
