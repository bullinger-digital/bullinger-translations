      <p>Most illustrious and revered father, may God keep you safe and sound for us for a very long time and may He grant all your wishes!</p>
      <p>Not long ago, I wrote to you at great length and to my other teachers, whom I hold in all due respect, and I also sent three of my students to Basel, including the Mischkov brothers. One of them is the brother of those who live with Wolphius, and the other two are their cousins, the nephews of our Palatine of Krak처w. However, I did not want to neglect, even amidst my very serious occupations, to write something to you for the upcoming Frankfurt fair and to sing the same song about the very disturbed state of all things, both in terms of religion and public and civil affairs in our Sarmatia. For, to say nothing of the confusion of the Arian and Anabaptist religion, whose progress we sent to you with the oracles of Blandrata, know that great dangers threaten this kingdom from three most powerful enemies. The Muscovite is about to invade Lithuania with very large armies, unless God prevents it. The Tatars have recently inflicted much damage by plundering and devastating the borders of Podolia, and everyone fears the Turk, who is descending into Hungary with a very numerous army, lest a neighboring war, although the Turk is united with the Pole by treaty, be very harmful and pernicious to the kingdom through raids and incursions. Something new is also being reported from Prussia, as if they are considering defection there as well, and therefore a very large delegation has been sent there. Scalichius is in bad repute here, and he will hardly escape the hands of the princes. From my letters, you will learn about the horrendous death of Lismanini...</p>
      <p>We pray to the Son of God, reigning at the right hand of the Father, that He Himself may protect His church and His glory against the furies of the devils in these last times of the world, and that He may allow you and your church to flourish in a state of tranquility. To Him, I humbly commend myself and my services, and I greet everyone, especially your domestic church. Farewell again, father, most revered with all respect.</p>
      <p>Given in Krak처w on the first of August, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and respectful Christoph Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, the most faithful pastor of the Z체rich church, lord and father to be revered with all respect.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
