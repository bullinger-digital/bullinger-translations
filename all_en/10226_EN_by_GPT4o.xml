      <p>Greetings. I am aware of your new responsibilities, most excellent man. Therefore, so as not to be a hindrance to you, I have decided to declare my intention to you in this letter. It is customary to give letters to those departing, which can testify that they have come to Zürich and have been supported at your expense. You will send me from here to the next courier. Therefore, I ask you, most distinguished man, to prepare such letters for me as well. Frysius and Konrad have had such letters, and Otho has one too, if I am not mistaken. Doctor Christoph Klauser wishes to know which region or town I should go to, so that he too may write, if a relative can be of any help to another relative through letters. You have, venerable man, the whole matter briefly. If it is convenient, respond only through Gualther, or set a time when I may approach you, at your convenience.</p>
      <p>Farewell, always happy with your family.</p>
      <p>Konrad Klauser the Younger, yours sincerely, if you allow it.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
