      <p>Strasbourg, June 1, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings. After I had sent my previous letters, dearest Bullinger, and was entirely concerned about the messenger, I happened by chance to meet this nobleman from Ghent, who has decided to set out to you.</p>
      <p>He is a man noble both by birth and by character, faith, and piety; he lived for some time in Strasbourg, then went to England, from where he has now come here to the Baths of Baden due to the necessity of bathing. From the baths, he decided to visit unknown parts, Zürich being especially renowned for its pure doctrine and reputation. He is not averse to our religion, being otherwise learned and of pious judgment; he will be with you for fourteen days.</p>
      <p>He desired my recommendations; therefore, I commend him to you, most kind Bullinger, in such a way that he may not be less pleasing to you and the church than any of the people of Zürich are to me and will be everywhere. He is a member of the French church, which does not differ from your religion. As for the rest, I do not doubt that you will willingly offer assistance after you have met the man a second and third time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Mr. Bullinger, esteemed friend. In Zürich.</p>
