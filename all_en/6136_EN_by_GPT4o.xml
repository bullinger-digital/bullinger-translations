      <p>Greetings. If you had not once given me, reverend father, this rule, that I should not omit any occasion to write, I would certainly have often doubted whether your most holy occupations in such a variety of affairs should be interrupted by my trifles.</p>
      <p>Especially since I am often forced to write in great haste due to the pressure of time, which haste could have accused me of negligence in your eyes.</p>
      <p>But, as I said, your incredible kindness makes me act too familiarly with you, so that it could often come to your mind that you did not know how familiar you were with me, like the saying of the Emperor Augustus. Therefore, I maintain the old habit of writing, because I understand that you wish it so.</p>
      <p>And as for your matters, I thank you very much for sending me the letters of individual friends to read. I shudder with my whole heart when I see what the devil can do in otherwise learned men by the just judgment of God; these things should exercise us in humility, so that we do not exceed sobriety and moderation. But I think the adversary should be answered boldly, so that his ferocity is finally fully subdued. Your singular modesty is known to all the pious; yet there have been not bad men who desired a little more sharpness in your last response.</p>
      <p>I know the holy ends of your counsel; but you must consider the men you have encountered. But why should I teach Minerva? If you ever write to Dr. Erastus, I ask you to kindly greet him on my behalf; he has often written to me very familiarly, so there is no need to fear that you are announcing a greeting to him from an unknown person, etc.</p>
      <p>As for your advice on renewing the alliance among the Swiss, I fully agree with you in all respects and had already discussed some of these matters with Carlino and other great men among us.</p>
      <p>For the situation in Rhaetia is such that the choice between the French and the Spanish must be accepted rather than both being repelled; bribery and corruption of all kinds have now grown to such an extent. If I were with you for just one hour, I would prove this to you extensively, so that I would fully satisfy you.</p>
      <p>I will indeed make an effort that, if our people engage in the alliance, which I finally think will happen, it will be concluded separately from the 7 Cantons and separately on those terms that are not adverse to religion and the republic.</p>
      <p>I hope to be able to use the help of great men, to whom my advice is not displeasing. But in such a doubtful and varied matter, I can promise nothing. - The envoy, although he is a learned man, is, as far as I understood from the first meeting, not at all experienced in embassies.</p>
      <p>What I can promise myself about religion, I do not yet see. There are those who firmly assert that he belongs to the Guise faction.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, he is quite humane.</p>
      <p>But since he has come without any money, thinking he can accomplish everything with words, I foresee that the matter will be prolonged. For our people have learned from the French doctors to do nothing for free.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I am determined; I do not yet know what I should preach. For the sermons, I am dealing with the first book of Samuel on weekdays; I have completed the 18th chapter, which has provided me with ample material on the manners of kings and courtiers. I have said many things that pertain to the point that our people should be content with their lot; but the Curia is only a thirtieth part of the communities of Rhaetia. I cannot say publicly that they should all go idle.</p>
      <p>For I also have unskilled listeners; they are then restless with words and deeds. In winter, the more powerful push their practices for themselves; but the common man is unstable.</p>
      <p>In winter, I am excluded from all councils, and later they do something more foolish. I would otherwise like to bring it about here in the city and also with the help of the preachers in the countryside in many places that it would be once and for all decided and the envoy would be given the dismissal.</p>
      <p>But I doubt whether it is useful; the reason is, it does not exist, and then the last will be worse than the first. So I pray to God day and night that he may grant me wisdom and understanding in this difficult matter; for whatever I say, however I do it, I always fear that I am doing too much or too little for the matter. I do not want to advise them, but also not to oppose them openly; for if it goes away, then Philip's message comes to the city. My request to you is that you would articulate how one might make a covenant with God and for the good of religion; I will use myself in such a way that I hope your work will not be unfruitful.</p>
      <p>Now it is noticed; the brothers are coming; we might discuss with each other. As for new news, you should know that Hannibal from Emps is coming next from Rome: he reports that the Pope is healthy and upright, but he has been sent by Philip to lead a regiment of landsknechts against the Turks through the Adige; for they have shown themselves in the 70 sails not far from Genoa and have led some away, etc.</p>
      <p>Cornelius, a Genoese captain, has also traveled through here with him. Hannibal reports that Philip has given him the 3 Pleve (this land borders on Valtellina) as his property; therefore he is now pursuing the Confederates below and above. He has offered much good, differently than his usual practice; for he was not a good confederate before and otherwise a rough man; but now he has been very smooth, has also taken a strong fellow here as a bodyguard and said he has orders that, where there are honorable confederates who desire service, he should give them pay and service, and if there is a matter concerning religion, he would not use the confederates for that; it is to be done against the common enemy, the Turks.</p>
      <p>So he says.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, they write to Dr. Ambrosio, consul of Genoa, that 6000 Spaniards are to arrive there in a port, also for the same reason; for the Turkish pirates have shown themselves strong, and it is feared that a great armada is now present, etc. So says Hannibal, and at the same time it is written from elsewhere; but the matter is suspect to many and also to the royal envoy, to whom the consul said this at the table in my presence, as he had heard from Hannibal. I stop because the paper ends.</p>
