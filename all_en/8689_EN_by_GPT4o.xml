      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most illustrious man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, in response to my last ones sent to you, one dated September 29th, the other October 10th, to which I now briefly reply, as I did not wish to trouble you without cause until now. First, I sincerely sympathize with you, as you mention suffering again from scotoma, and I pray to the Lord that He does not take you from us in this most perilous time.</p>
      <p>You write that you are pleased with my plan to translate the booklet on the authority of Scripture, published in German; therefore, I will endeavor, with God's help, to have it speak in German soon. I received the form of public supplication and congratulate you on your most holy and necessary institution.</p>
      <p>I communicated what you sent regarding the decree from the magistrate to Mr. Consul Peyer, so that he might incite our magistrate to follow a similar example, which he did immediately. I was very grateful for what you conveyed from the letters of the most illustrious Beza, whose booklet against Selnecker, though brief, is most excellent in all respects and comprehensively covers the main points of his controversy, which you sent as a gift, for which I am most grateful, as well as for sharing the other writings from Wittenberg, the letters of the Prince of Hesse, Count of Wittgenstein, and other new matters from Saxony, England, France, and Poland. The booklet from Wittenberg agrees excellently with Beza's writing; thus, the noble Count of Wittgenstein rightly writes that the disputes of these turbulent men have the advantage that, on this occasion, the truth is brought to light more and more each day through the best booklets. For there must indeed be heresies, so that those who are approved may become manifest.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not at all acquiesce to those courtly counsels that advise true and pious teachers to remain silent, for the opposing side does not cease to rabidly attack the truth and disturb the wretched church. Just as the holy fathers fought against both the heretics and pagans of their time with equal spirit, so too do I judge that we must contend with Christian modesty, piety, sharpness, and gravity against domestic enemies no less than against the Antichrist, and commend the outcomes to the Lord. I have also received some writings from the fairs about the Cadmean battle in Saxony, the catalog of which I send, so that if you desire any, you may request them, and since the Landgrave Prince encourages us to wield the pen against the Pope, I would wish for the refutation of the papal bull to finally be published; with this book, you would serve the church and those still held in Babylonian captivity far better than many others fighting against the nonsense of Marbach, Hasi, and Isengrin, and the fables of the Jesuits with some unknown kind of gravity and piety. The son of Mr. Consul Peyer, whom you wrote was still alive, was different from the one who died of the plague in Geneva. I informed Mr. Consul of your concern, who thanks you sincerely and, with the utmost reverence, sends greetings to you along with his brother Martin, Beatus Leo, and Consul Rinck. All the brothers here greet you most dutifully with me, whom we truly embrace with the same love as Elisha did Elijah, and we recognize you in our hearts no less as the charioteer and chariot of Switzerland than Elisha did Elijah of the Israelite people, and for this reason, we earnestly pray to the Lord to deign to keep you safe for a long time for the glory of His name, the salvation of the church, and the consolation of many.</p>
      <p>Greet all the lords and brothers in Christ on our behalf with reverence. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on October 18th, in the year 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, friend and father in Christ, to be honored with the highest reverence.</p>
