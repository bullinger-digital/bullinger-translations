      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write, dearest compater in the Lord, except this one thing: yesterday evening I began to feel somewhat unwell, especially in my stomach, which I still feel discomfort from; however, I hope gradually to feel better through the grace of the Lord, who heals the weak and preserves the strong.</p>
      <p>There is no certain news of new things here. A certain rumor is flying about concerning the Count of Mansfeld, which side he will take, I have not yet learned for certain. They say he is a scourge of bishops and prelates and threatens some evil against the cities of the empire, especially the more powerful ones. My people in Augsburg are in great fear; neighbors are bringing their possessions from the countryside into the city. I received this from letters written to Mr. Blaurer. Today some merchants reported about the margrave that what he did was done for the most just reasons and that it is not true that he defected to the emperor. But you will hear about this from your young man, who returned from England, visited me, and received this letter from me. Farewell very well, dearest compater, with all your household and the other lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Rudolf, and Mr. Butler. Bern, Switzerland, 26th of November, 1552.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, compater in the Lord, dearest by far.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
