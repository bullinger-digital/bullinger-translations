      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I received your letter, dear Bullinger, from which I understood that Servetus, the heresiarch, has suffered deserved punishment. Certainly, our times greatly need the most perceptive eyes, so that heresies may be extinguished everywhere and those monsters may be blocked. Schwenkfeld is sowing the worst seeds in Swabia and Allgäu, he has several noble patrons and is already attempting everything in Ulm, Memmingen, and other neighboring cities of ours. And in Wittenberg, as I hear, a very subtle heresy concerning justification has emerged. I am eagerly awaiting those three books of yours on justification, which I hope you will soon have published once they are completed. May the Lord protect His church from those monsters. Amen. Our relative has returned from Strasbourg with things conducted very well and prosperously, which greatly delighted us on account of the widow and the orphans. Now we need your assistance in humanity, so that your senate may change its decision, granting them grace. In this matter, we implore your humanity. We have furthermore pledged those five hundred, which Gerhard Rihmut owes, to be paid in the coming days along with the rest of the sum to a certain person for the great benefit of the orphans. I therefore beg you, as much as I can, to persuade the senate to overlook this payment of Gerhard and to kindly remit the arrest, if my relative does not bring those five hundred from Gerhard with him. Certainly, we would be ill-spoken of, for we have promised and will pay them.</p>
      <p>No news is spreading among us, except that they say Charles has sent envoys and many nobles to England to negotiate the marriage of Philip and the queen, and there are many among us who hope these nuptials will certainly take place. If you have any news, share it and farewell together with your whole family and colleagues, and consider me yours. From Lindau, January 2, 1554.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus Pappus, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God in Zürich, my most gentle lord and friend.</p>
