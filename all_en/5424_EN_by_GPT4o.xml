      <p>Greetings. Believe me, venerable brother, it is not out of negligence that I write to you less frequently; but because I see things constantly changing, a certain shame makes me reluctant, lest I be forced to retract what I have written shortly after. Finally, it has been obtained from the Bernese that they should prepare to recover the cities of Burgundy; however, progress is slow, and we fear that the entire expedition will soon come to nothing, because the senate responded too timidly and servilely to Mendoza. They always persist in the childish quibble that they came to guard the city, as if there were not enough who would consume the otherwise scarce provisions. If Chalon is recaptured and fortified with a strong garrison, navigation through the Saône will be safe, providing a large supply of many things. This will be the true protection of the city.</p>
      <p>However, something else is required, that with that region pacified, which will be done without any trouble, they should proceed directly to the prince. But they stubbornly deny that they will do this, and the senate cannot be persuaded to allow it.</p>
      <p>To what end, then, was it necessary to raise the banners? The prince himself recently indicated that he is gathering his scattered forces again and will soon have a strong army. The arrival of the English, who have already set up their camp in the middle of Normandy, and the Scots will soon join them, greatly terrified the enemies. Therefore, the queen has again turned to her arts and sends envoys to negotiate peace.</p>
      <p>However, Admiral assures us to be secure about this matter. The aid we hoped for from Germany, unless I am mistaken, will vanish, because money is nowhere to be found. Our senate has instructed Budaeus to borrow twelve thousand gold coins either in Basel or Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>If others, who have far greater resources, had the same spirit, we would not be so destitute. Therefore, we must pray to God to provide for us from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Navarre is equipped with a moderate army, sufficient to retain part of Aquitaine. However, unless new reinforcements arrive, it is not yet equal to invading the enemies: which would be most desirable, as it would be extremely useful for the overall situation. And it is regrettable that the cruelty of the Toulouse senate cannot yet be restrained, which has killed over three hundred wealthy and honorable men, even nobles and those who had held public offices, by the executioner's hand. If you see that you have any authority to influence the Bernese senate to allow their soldiers to go to the prince, I beseech you to exert yourself, because if the war is prolonged, we are doomed along with the kingdom. I wish they had never left home.</p>
      <p>But by your prudence, you understand how important it is for the reputation of the war that they do not depart: indeed, if a battle is to be decided, they should not be far away. From the German musketeers whom the enemies had hired, one banner has come over to us: others have promised not to engage in conflict. The French cavalry also has the Guises very anxious.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they sent to the King of Navarre to bring the king into the camp, so that neither the Swiss nor other foreign soldiers, nor the French, who profess to be solely devoted to the king, will refuse military service any longer. However, this scheme, I hope, will turn into a tale.</p>
      <p>Now a whole month has passed since Beza should have been with us. However, since he safely arrived in Champagne with Count Sanportiano, not even the slightest rumor has reached us about where he might be. Because I do not wish to forebode anything sad yet, I conjecture that he has been detained in that province where serious disturbances are now raging. As soon as I learn anything certain and worth knowing, I will make up for the 15 days of silence with the diligence of writing. Farewell, most illustrious man and honorable brother, together with Mr. P. Martyr, Gwalther, and all colleagues. May the Lord keep you safe and grant success to your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>Ionville greets you respectfully.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
