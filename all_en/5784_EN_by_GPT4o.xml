      <p>S. I could not yet send back through the scribe of our republic what you sent, who is also the schoolmaster, called "underschryber" in German, but you will receive it shortly and certainly.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I made no mention of your name; however, I informed Mr. Consul Peyer, who is the chief of the schoolmasters, about what was written to me concerning Schaltenbrand.</p>
      <p>I did this so that if the more ignorant senators (I speak with you) were to be informed, they might perhaps try to overturn everything.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the decree of the schoolmasters and the main request is that, in the presence of Johannes Oschwald Huber, who indicated when he could be present, your kindness should summon to the auditorium those who are to be summoned, and reproach the prodigality, negligence, and wandering. If something of this kind is heard about him shortly, he will experience what kind of spirit our people have towards such matters.</p>
      <p>Here, let him openly declare whether he has married or promised to marry the daughter of Grübel.</p>
      <p>Regarding all these matters, do not disdain to inform the schoolmasters of our republic through Huber, they earnestly request.</p>
      <p>There is an urgent necessity to examine the life, morals, and studies of our people; they promise in the meantime, if they cannot repay in kind, they will never be ungrateful.</p>
      <p>Consul Ringg celebrated your and Mr. Gwalther's kindness greatly among us, and in your name, he bid me farewell; he praises the benefits rendered to him and other Schaffhusians there; may the Lord repay.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, as I said, that our people will never be ungrateful. But I cease now.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, who may keep you safe with us for a long time. Everything threatens ruin; I have no other news.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all who inquire about me.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, June 22, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
