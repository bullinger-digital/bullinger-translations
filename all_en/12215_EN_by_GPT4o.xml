    <p xml:id="regest1">Frecht asks Vadian to report to Bullinger what he has just communicated [about the letter from Bullinger addressed to him - not received - dated April 12]. Vadian should also convey Frecht's thanks for the books recently sent to him by Bullinger; in the [accompanying] letter, Bullinger asked Frecht not to believe the slanders circulating against the people of Zurich. Bullinger added the following sentences, which were pleasing to Frecht: "Certainly, we are all human. We lack many things, but we have never disregarded the advice and admonitions of the brothers, nor will we ever do so."</p>

      <p>I would like, if your honor writes to Bullinger, to inform him on my behalf and also to thank him for his remarkable and generous goodwill and kindness towards me, for sending some booklets and likewise in his recent letters to me, he asked and implored that I should not turn my mind away from them because of the slander of some against them - adding this assertion, that they are not such as those people portray them -, and (which was very pleasing to me) he added: "Certainly, we are human. We lack many things, but we have never disregarded the advice and admonitions of the brothers, nor will we ever disregard them in the future." This is Bullinger...</p>
