      <p>S. D. You think, most esteemed and beloved brother in the Lord, that the meetings which you say are odious to us are the only remedy for evils, and that the princes, if they had hoped that we would be inclined to a friendly meeting, would never have allowed us to be condemned or anything more severe to be decided about us. As if we were condemned because we refused a conference.</p>
      <p>I do not see why you write this way, since no legitimate conference has ever been legitimately convened, nor have we ever been summoned to any by the princes, and indeed we have not written a single word to any prince about any conference being refused.</p>
      <p>What Sulcerus wrote about the conference was of such a nature that it promised nothing certain. And when he sent those to us, we had already been condemned in Zwingli's case, and indeed at Worms by the more moderate ones. And if we were averse to a conference, we would not be averse without reason.</p>
      <p>Before our brothers set out to the princes, no one wrote anything about any conference. Then only did mention begin to be more frequent when they, without the knowledge of other brothers, presented a confession to the princes.</p>
      <p>Which we could not approve in every part.</p>
      <p>If indeed we come to a conference and such a confession is presented to us as if it were ours, and we do not acknowledge it in all respects, what is likely to arise from that except odious quarrels and mutual dissension among us? What you promise yourself about the princes and their learned men, you will see for yourself. I understand that they did not think well of us and our doctrine even before our people reached them, seeking a conference of their own accord, who did not want to act in the cause of the afflicted brothers in France before such confessions were written. Everything that had been published by our churches so far did not satisfy them.</p>
      <p>And now it is also certain that they issued a formula of faith in Frankfurt, in the months of February and March, which clearly shows what their attitude is towards our doctrine. They are in German: but I suppose you have seen those works translated into Latin by friends.</p>
      <p>I am increasingly confirmed in my opinion that these men will not depart even a hair's breadth from the Augsburg Confession and its Apology, nor will they return to favor with anyone unless they subscribe to that Apology and confession. I mention this so that if you ever enter into a conference with these men, you may act wisely. I do not understand what you say at the end of your letter about what we have been doing so far.</p>
      <p>I know that we have done nothing unworthy of the faithful ministers of Christ. You say without reason that you are suspect to us.</p>
      <p>I say you suspect this of us without reason. See, my brother, that those who seek dissension among us do not imbue you with bad opinions, so that you suspect things of us that are not true. Let us love each other mutually.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, man esteemed by me in the Lord and most beloved brother. ZÃ¼rich, June 11, 1558.</p>
      <p>This brother is commended to me by Mr. Georg Cassander: if you help him with your work, you will have done well.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers for us as well.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
