      <p>To the most distinguished and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich and my greatly respected mentor, Hotman sends greetings. Venerable father, it is rarely possible for me to write to you due to my academic duties.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I have also had numerous dealings concerning the French churches, from which six honorable men have recently come here to seek refuge for more than four hundred people, who are forced to leave their homeland due to the immense cruelty of Cardinal Lorraine. I have embraced them as honorably as I could, and I have included the entire story in these letters. I ask you, if it is not too much trouble, to show it to the reverend and most esteemed Mr. Peter Martyr and at the same time to have the pious refugee families recommended in your regions. Our senate, as I hope, will diligently handle their cause, having sent envoys to the princes. You can hardly believe how good a service Mr. Sturm has rendered us, nor was Mr. Zanchi, my neighbor and greatest friend, lacking, whom I saw weeping when he bid farewell to such honorable and modest men, some of whom are held in great esteem in France. I pray to God to comfort them and to guide you and your church and family with His perpetual spirit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed and reverend father. Strasbourg, November 23, 1559.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Stucki, greetings. Unless I feared that I might seem to have forgotten my modesty, I would ask you the same thing I once asked; however, the difficulty of my financial situation excuses me, nor could anything of this kind be burdensome to him; I believe he owes me 23 thalers. The Landgrave of Hesse wishes to appoint me in place of the late Ferrarius Montanus, offering a splendid position in Marburg; but, as I hope, I will undertake nothing without good counsel, especially since in the meantime it will be in our interest and no mass will be celebrated by the grace of God.</p>
