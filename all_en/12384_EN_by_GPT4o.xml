    <p xml:id="regest1">The silence that Bullinger accused Lavater of in two letters [not preserved] resulted from a lack of messengers due to the harsh winter; Lavater also wanted to wait until he could provide reliable news about himself. Bullinger has obviously not yet received his letter [No. 2320].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Johannes] Sturm has returned [from his mission]; Lavater will attend his lectures. Luther has admonished the Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse through a letter [“To the Electors”] not to release Duke Heinrich of Brunswick; Bullinger probably already has this writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Should [Johannes Marbach] speak disparagingly about Zwingli, he would hear unpleasant things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger also receives a letter [No. 2336] from a learned and well-disposed Englishman [John Hooper], which he should respond to if possible, as [Hooper] supports the Zwinglian party, which is rare in Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the whole family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should fully trust in Lavater's sense of duty!</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. If you are well, that is good; I am well. I have received two letters from you, most kind father, in which I could understand that you have taken my silence more than enough as troublesome; however, I have not been silent due to forgetfulness of your kindness, but partly due to the lack of messengers, which I believe the severity of winter has hindered, and partly so that I could describe something certain about what is happening with me. However, as far as I understand from your letters, mine have not yet been delivered to you. If I knew this, I would soon inform you of all matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now I have nothing worthy to write to you, except that our rector Sturmius has returned; whom I will also hear. And Mr. Martin Luther has written an exhortation to the Prince of Hesse not to release the Duke of Brunswick; which I think you have.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is no need to worry about my lord troubling me about the sacrament, for if he were to speak about Zwingli as he wishes, he would hear what he does not wish; and I know to what extent all Lutherans can be trusted and what they are plotting.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will also receive a letter from a certain Englishman, a most observant and studious admirer of yours, a learned man of great humanity, and, as far as I judge, most worthy of your friendship; to whom I would wish, if it were possible, that you would reply, for that would be most pleasing to him. For he defends the Zwinglian party, which is rare in this city. Furthermore, you will bind him to you forever with the greatest service and respect.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell. Do not disdain to convey my greetings to your most honorable wife and the whole family.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In Strasbourg, in the year 1546, at the house of Mr. Johannes Marbach, January 27, etc. Meanwhile, you can trust that I will not fail in my duty in any matter, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours with all my heart and soul, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most pious head of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise, and highly learned gentleman, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my especially beloved lord and good friend in Zurich.</p>
