      <p>S. You will learn about the state of affairs in France from the present letters of Mr. Beza. The whole country is ablaze with war, and a Trojan War of evils is imminent unless God assists His own and miraculously extinguishes such a great fire, which, however, will hardly happen without much bloodshed. To help you understand the whole matter more fully, I will explain, as far as I have been able to learn from our people, more fully than is expressed in Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>The plans and practices this year, as you know, have been carried out on both sides, especially as our people intended to bring the king and his mother under their control above all else. However, this has been delayed in the hope that peace might be maintained. Now it is breaking out everywhere, and as I understand, the plan is that the Duke of Montmorency should take Lyon and the Admiral along with the Prince of Condé should seize Paris and thus capture the king. How things are going in Paris and around it, we have no news yet.</p>
      <p>But the Duke of Montmorency has gathered about 400 horsemen in haste and rushed to Lyon, where he had an understanding with our people that they should open a gate for him. However, the Papists were warned and quickly rose up, and our people, who had gathered, were driven out of the city. The rest have hidden in houses; many are captured, many flee as they can. Meanwhile, the others have taken the gates and fortifications; they are plundering the houses and goods of the Evangelicals, have torn down their new churches that they had built, and great misery is taking place, as you will find in the letter. On the other hand, it is said that our people have taken Mâcon or Matiscon above Lyon and have driven out the Papists in the same manner. Montmorency, as the plan fails, moves into the Dauphiné; many people join him, and he takes what he can. On the other hand, it is said that the Marquis of Provence is slaughtering and driving out the believers everywhere, and thus there is great misery everywhere. May God have mercy on His own and grant peace! It is credibly said of the German riders that they are still present; on the other hand, it is also said that the king desires a new uprising from the Confederates; thus, it is going on all sides. The Duke of Savoy remains quiet; however, there is concern that it will also go over Geneva; with this, we would also be involved. I hear that the people of Lucerne have refused to send an envoy to the negotiations between the Duke and the city of Geneva. If the same matter could have been settled before, it would have been good. It will be a bad hindrance. Roseti's brother is riding to Lucerne, and from there he will come to you in Zurich; from him, you will learn everything.</p>
      <p>The first note you sent me from Augsburg, I am sending back to you herewith. Recently, Valentinus came home, who brought me the other one; I will also send it to you with the next message. My lords are being heavily solicited in this matter. There is concern that it will be a general matter; if one then sits still, it will soon be upon us, and there are many plans. May God protect us from evil and give wise and peaceful counsel! Oh, how good it is now and how well God has protected that one has refrained from the French union! May the Lord continue to protect us!</p>
      <p>Dear friend, inform me about Dr. Pistorius concerning Hesse. I hear he is in Heidelberg. From Basel, there was talk that Landgrave Wilhelm had to judge in a matter because he consented to his father's bigamy. There will be something to it, as he has only now gone there at his age. We hear that the Landgrave has issued a mandate that Zwingli and Calvin should not be mentioned disgracefully in the pulpits. Otherwise, I know nothing at this time.</p>
      <p>Diesbach, Gravenried, and Zehender greet you. Steiger is still in Münsingen. May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 9, 1567.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste; therefore, forgive me.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
