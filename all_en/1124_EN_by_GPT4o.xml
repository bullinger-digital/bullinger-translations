      <p>Greetings in the Lord. You have the latest news from our side in great detail from Mr. Schertlin, who has volunteered to write to you about what is happening in the Saxon cities.</p>
      <p>May the Lord help those brave soldiers and grant them the spirit of fortitude, so that they may resist all the enemies of Christ and not exceed the measure through an impenitent life.</p>
      <p>The minds of the Saxons are uncertain, and I do not know where they will turn due to the impending danger.</p>
      <p>They would prefer Maurice; he is beyond the Caspian mountains. We will see the Lord's just judgment.</p>
      <p>They say the old Duke of Saxony was invited by King Ferdinand, and among other things, there was mention of the royal majesty of Rome, which Ferdinand obtained through the other electors. To this, Ferdinand said: "Her..., if you had helped me confirm the royal majesty, I would have long since ensured that you were freed from this captivity." What this portends, you undoubtedly know.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the King of France came to us today; Mr. Maurus will bring some news and will work for Schertlin, so that a man worthy of greater honor is not expelled. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 29, 1550. I pray for a most prosperous year for you and yours.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich. Zurich.</p>
