      <p>Greetings. We are suffering somewhat here regarding the swearing by saints, as if we are enemies of the Swiss Confederation, yet the Lord knows what we truly are in this matter. Valentin alone opposes here, not by debating or discussing, but by submitting to the authorities as those who seek nothing but common peace in this cause, of which we also wish to be partakers. We responded in writing to the magistrate; here Valentin refused to sign his name along with Pantaleon, whom you know. The magistrate, however, remains silent as if contemptuous, and seems to want to uphold by force what he has decreed. Meanwhile, he observes if he can catch anyone in speech and accuse them of disobedience, etc. I tell you this in confidence, so that I may avoid danger, without which these things cannot be known from me.</p>
      <p>I am surprised about the three volumes of your Sermons; I have the first, but hear nothing of the others; I therefore doubt whether anything more will follow.</p>
      <p>The news I have is this: The Emperor's military preparations are said to be cooling both among the Belgians and elsewhere, and those who had orders to gather cavalry and infantry have been dismissed.</p>
      <p>They assert that Margrave Albert resigned his captaincy for this reason; for he had given many hope of a great expedition, but after they had prepared themselves, he could not fulfill his promises. Only the people of Magdeburg are harassed by the Emperor's ban and the plots of neighbors; efforts are made to break the rest either by negotiations or delay.</p>
      <p>It is written from Nuremberg that the Elector of Brandenburg has transferred the fair from Magdeburg to a certain neighboring town of his. However, within five weeks, when the fair was there, the people of Magdeburg, breaking into the town, carried off 40 merchants with their goods, yet leaving the townspeople and their properties unharmed. Since the Emperor gave them as prey, they in turn repel force with force wherever they can, and are said to be undaunted.</p>
      <p>It is also written by the Emperor's men that a captain was bribed to explore their plans and the weaker parts of the city. He was eventually caught and beheaded, having for some time excellently concealed his purpose.</p>
      <p>The envoy from Strasbourg has returned from Brussels. He reports more about the Emperor's clemency towards this republic; however, regarding the Interim, the bishop has a commission to establish it according to the concessions that came from Rome; but he has not yet begun, and they hope that not everything will be done at the bishop's discretion. Merchants say the Belgians refuse the homage that the Emperor wants to be rendered to his son; they think it sufficient that they swore to the father while he was alive; they also refuse the perpetual and hereditary alliance that he wishes to establish between them and the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>Merchants also spread the word that the Turk no longer wishes to abide by the truce agreements, which the Austrians first broke; now even the Turks are breaking them, so that the roads from Hungary have become very dangerous.</p>
      <p>Finally, someone adds: "Believe me: the Moorish Seraph and the renewed Swiss Confederation are considerably delaying the Emperor's plans."</p>
      <p>Besides these, there are letters from Lower Germany, which announce that persecution among them is raging greatly according to the Spanish Inquisition; it begins with the great ones, among whom are two brothers of the House of Valois, who are now in Geneva, a certain noblewoman, a servant of the Lord of Breda, a trumpeter of the Lord of Ludick, and Lord Johannes de BroÍ¤rn, a merchant of Antwerp. They ask our churches to pray to the Lord that they may remain steadfast in the word. I wished to share these things with you. Farewell in the Lord with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 20, 1549. I commend this bachelor of mine to you.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
