      <p>Greetings. Your silence was excused by Sulzer, the bearer of this letter.</p>
      <p>I bear it all the more equitably, although I am very eager for your letters, because I estimate your affairs from my own, which, although they cannot be compared to yours, often prevent me from being able to provide the services I wish towards friends. However, I pray that you, whenever you have the time, continue to delight me with your letters as usual. What you recently wrote about the delegation of the 7 Cantons to the Pope made me somewhat anxious, lest it should plot and contrive something to the detriment of religion, although this very thing is not unusual and could not harm as much if, as much as they are preposterous in hindering and demolishing, so much our people would watch and strive with just and holy zeal in promoting the kingdom of Christ. But, as we rightly lament, the spirits of not a few have begun to languish and are neither cold nor hot, to be spewed out by the Lord at some point. Let us pray to Him all the more fervently, that He may deign to kindle the fire of His love and scatter the plans of the impious.</p>
      <p>The Diet is again destined for Augsburg. The rumor of the Emperor's departure is sufficiently spread, although he still lingers in Germany, perhaps not to depart even this year unless driven by fatal necessity. However, the princes seem to have somewhat regained their spirits, whether he leaves or stays, and to seriously consider the restoration of the German republic, for which a constant pursuit of true piety must be prayed for above all. Ferdinand is said to have granted something in religious freedom to the Styrians, Carinthians, and Austrians, driven by fear of the Turk, so that he may have them more prepared against him. The Frenchman rages savagely against Christ and does not cease to call the Turk into the heart of the Christian world, as the recent Turkish delegation to the Venetians sufficiently declared, soliciting their friendship and requesting passage through their territories into Ferdinand's domain. But these things, my dear Bullinger, I do not doubt are very well known to you. Meanwhile, we rely on this so profane and God-hostile staff and worship this deity most religiously, would that it were not to the certain ruin of our common fatherland. For the exiles from Locarno, a public collection has finally been held among us in the parishes; once it is completed, the magistrate will decide what should be added from the treasury, so that even from here the most pious brothers may receive some support. I desire to obtain your commentaries on the evangelists and the Decades of sermons, and because our booksellers increase the price more than is just, I pray that through your intervention, Froschauer may send them to me in your name, so that our people may not be offended; to whom I will, when he passes through Frankfurt, satisfy and pay in good faith whatever price he shall indicate. I am grateful for the letters of obscure men; they have a certain use, that the image of a corrupt and barbarous age may stand out, although it is clear enough that the author was neither obscure nor barbarous, who, if he had wished, could have given (undoubtedly) very different, learned, serious, and truly eloquent letters. But farewell well in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 21, 1556.</p>
      <p>Greet all your people with my words.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
