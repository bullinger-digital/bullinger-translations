      <p>Honorable, highly learned, especially dear lord and friend, my willing and friendly services are at your disposal. Since I have written to my dear lord and friend Rudolf Funck regarding my three sons and sent the overdue annual payment, I have mentioned in a separate article in that same letter that, as my eldest son Wilhelm is growing older, and I have been informed by Lord Funck that he has a decent understanding of the fundamentals of the Latin language, I have always been (by divine grace) willing and intending to let my son learn other languages alongside further studies. However, as my intention stands, I wish to first seek the advice of highly intelligent, trusted lords and friends. I have therefore confidentially and friendly asked Lord Funck, as the guardian of my sons, for his faithful advice and good opinion, just as I hereby request and ask your honor and friendship to also share your faithful advice with me on what to undertake for Wilhelm's welfare, whether he should remain here or be sent elsewhere, what his honorable and beneficial education (which he may use in his God-given life) should be, where he should go to receive instruction and discipline from an excellent teacher, where such a teacher can be found, and other necessary considerations, some of which I have mentioned in my letter to Lord Funck. But you, lord, as the highly intelligent one, know what to consider and reflect upon, and in doing so, you perform a good work before God. If I can also serve you and yours in return, I am no less eager than I am obliged due to all the friendship shown so far, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I await your advice and further writing with eagerness. May God, our dear Lord Jesus Christ, graciously protect you and all yours for His praise and honor. Dated Munich, the 14th of August, in the year 55.</p>
      <p>Pankraz von Freyberg, Bavarian court marshal, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, etc., my especially dear friend, to be delivered.</p>
