      <p>Greetings. I now send back to you, my venerable and dearest brother, the booklet which you recently sent to me through Funck to read, but with the condition that I return it to you immediately after reading. I am greatly thankful to you, especially since the truth of the matter, concerning the death of this prince, is faithfully written in this booklet and dispels the falsehoods of the widely spread lies.</p>
      <p>Regarding your venerable and very pious relative, since Sulzer was not at home recently, I wrote diligently to Johannes Jung, my old colleague and now a faithful minister of the church in Basel, who responded to me in this manner, as you can read in the fragment I send here, just four days ago. I have no doubt, given his diligence and especially his respect towards you, that he will try everything so that we may achieve our desire, with our constant prayers to the Lord, which He will eventually hear favorably. Farewell, my soul, and kindly excuse this brevity, which you will do more willingly, as I know neither you have the time to read nor I to write due to many engagements.</p>
      <p>Greet your most holy wife along with your household church and all the brothers and friends who love us in the Lord, especially Walther and Theodor, etc. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Biel, April 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Theodore Beza of Lausanne wrote to me these days that the word of grace is running and being glorified successfully in Western India, and that there, with the consent of the rulers, four ports have been built by the French. Then, in France, 22 churches have embraced the gospel of Christ with ardent desires; these remarkable advances seem to compel the king to allow some freedom of preaching the gospel. Let us pray with supplicant hearts to the heavenly Father, that He may extend the boundaries of the kingdom of His Christ more and more to the glory of His great name.</p>
