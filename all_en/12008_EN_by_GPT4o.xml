    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the news; shortly thereafter it was reported that Emperor [Charles V] had conquered Saint-Dizier and was now marching on Paris. [Francis I of] France and [Henry VIII of] England are said to have made peace; the previously mentioned [Jörg] Knöringer has returned from a military campaign. [Hans] Welser reported that [Hayreddin] Barbarossa caused great damage around Naples but spared the Papal States; there is no news from Hungary. The troops of [Henry] of Brunswick have disbanded due to lack of payment. More on [the connection of Konstanz to the Swiss Confederation?] another time. The [Konstanzers] are sending a patrician to the Emperor for unknown reasons. He asks for the delivery of a letter to the surgeon Jakob Ruf, whom he should admonish, without mentioning Blarer's name, to take care of the widow [...] of his brother [Michel Ruf?] and her two children [...] as promised; Bullinger should urge him to take up the matter, otherwise the widow will send the children to Ruf [in Zurich].</p>

      <p>Especially trusted, dear lord and brother. I thank you most diligently for the shared news, and the news has been the same here, and yet a message has come that His Imperial Majesty has conquered San Desiderio after several lost assaults and has slaughtered and destroyed everything that was there, and is now moving further with his plan, not relenting until he has it according to his will, and is advancing more and more towards Paris. But everything is in the hands of the wondrous God, who raises and lowers according to His pleasure; may He be gracious to us.</p>
      <p>Those who were with the King of England have also returned, reporting that there is peace between these two kings, France and England, having brought back little money. The Knöringer, who then sits in Thurgau not far from us, about whom I wrote to you previously, that the bailiff had taken an imperial messenger, who was sought, into custody and had taken some money from him, has also returned, having captured several thousand crowns from the king last year. Now he has been there again; they are wondrous people.</p>
      <p>It is certain that Barbarossa has caused considerable damage in Naples, completely devastated and destroyed several places and carried off over 1500 Christians, but in the Pope's land, no one has been harmed. Mayor Welser from Augsburg writes to me. From Hungary, one hears nothing at all at this time.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick's troops have all scattered and dispersed, are poorly paid, and therefore dissatisfied. The Emperor has summoned them several times. Nothing has been decided until their poverty forces them to abandon their plans.</p>
      <p>About our business, otherwise. Would that there be the closest bond of peace among yours! Our people are now sending to the Emperor, which I pour into your lap; for what reason, I am completely ignorant and cannot find out anything from anyone.</p>
      <p>It is not from the number of senators who is sent, but a patrician, however, who is skilled in language and quite knowledgeable in matters. I am, however, gladly persuaded that whatever it is that is being done, it is nothing that could be harmful to you, would that it were also not to us. If I learn anything further, I will ensure that you find out as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell. August 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>I earnestly beseech you, when you call Jacob Ruff, your surgeon, to you, to give him this letter, which you see addressed to him here, and to exhort him to take care of his deceased brother's widow with two children as is fitting.</p>
      <p>He had promised the previous year to send 13 florins annually to his brother's family, but he has not fulfilled it. Urge him, however, to respond as soon as possible to the letters written in the name of his brother's family and to send them here through you. For unless he helps his nephew and niece from his deceased brother, their mother will send them there, so that he himself may devise a plan for their sustenance and education according to the pious custom of your city. You will not tell the man that I wrote this to you, but rather some distinguished citizen of Constance. You will have done a most pleasing thing not only to me but to Christ Himself, for the woman is very afflicted with a most grievous cross.</p>
      <p>To the very excellent man, Mr. H. Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
