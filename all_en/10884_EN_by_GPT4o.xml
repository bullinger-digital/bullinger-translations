    <p xml:id="regest1">Spoke in Ottenbach with a nobleman from Paris, who is supposedly bringing a large pack of hounds as a gift from the Frenchman [Francis I] to the Pope [Paul III] in Rome; however, his interpreter did not contradict the suspicion that the dogs are actually intended for the Turk [Suleiman I]. Greetings. Will send him the book with the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, which he has almost finished reading, if necessary.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, yesterday a nobleman - an acquaintance from Paris - passed through Ottenbach with 5 servants, having approximately 44 very handsome dogs: 36 hunting dogs, one tracking dog, the others truly very large. Among them are two colossi (so to speak) of remarkable size; they have become footsore, so they had to be transported in a basket on a cart. I approached the nobleman, went a fair distance with the dogs, and asked where he was from and where he was going with the gift. He answered me, the Frenchman</p>
      <p>is sending the gift to the Pope and did not want to say much more. But I also went with the interpreter for a while, who is a German, and asked him as well. He said the same; after a long time, he asked me how far the sea is beyond Rome; he might not want to go to sea with him. I said to him: "I bet the dogs are meant for the Turk?" He did not say much against it, only that he did not want to help bring them to him; he is indeed concerned. I could not learn more from him, as the nobleman was unwilling to go with me, etc. They consume 2 crowns every day, and he has to pay a lot because they tear things apart, like pigs, dogs, when they become hungry, etc. When he hired the interpreter, he bound him to travel with him on the sea for 8 days; he does not like that.</p>
      <p>Nothing more, may God be with you. Greet the relatives for me. If you need the same book, the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, within eight days, I will send it to you; for I have almost finished reading it, and with benefit, for it has given me much light in many places.</p>
      <p>Given on the third day before the Feast of Corpus Christi.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in Zurich.</p>
