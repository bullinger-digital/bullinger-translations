      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I thank you, dearest brother, for the exceptional gift, which was delivered to me by Peter Schnyder, who announces the gospel of Christ at the Rhine Falls in Zurich. Believe me, the gift is most welcome to me, not only because it demonstrates learning and solid piety, but because it is the most certain testimony of your wonderful love towards me. Therefore, I do not wish to flatter you in any way, but I urge you not to desist from your undertaking, but to apply yourself with all your might to the task, so that what you have meditated on in the Epistle to the Hebrews may come to light sooner. In this matter, you will do something not only pleasing to all of us, but also extremely useful to the Christian cause.</p>
      <p>We will deal with Karlstadt in these days, so that it might be possible for such a great man to acquire a position worthy of him.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, March 19, 1532.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, who steadfastly announces the gospel of Christ in Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
