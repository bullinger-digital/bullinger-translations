      <p>Most illustrious man, I came to Casaccia upon being called, to speak against the Pope and the Mass, his creation. Here, therefore, I encountered a man who came to you in the morning, and I write in haste.</p>
      <p>There were five villages that had one preacher, now each has its own; in summary: the Gospel is advancing. But the Pope shouts and threatens to destroy the Rhaetians if they continue to listen to me. You would hardly believe how many words that Antichrist has spoken about me. Finally, he noticed my little words, which I was spreading throughout Italy; for it is not yet the end.</p>
      <p>Your demonstration has already been widely spread, (as I have certainly learned), to the great distress of that beast. But let him rage and roar; for soon he will be destroyed.</p>
      <p>He reproaches the Venetians with a bull (papal decree), who do not allow only the monks to be able to plot what they want against the brothers, but have added some magistrate to preside over them. Now they will contend among themselves; I hope the Venetians will not yield. Persecution is raging in Italy. I will finally return to you soon. I greet the entire school and church. Pray for us, who are laboring greatly.</p>
      <p>In Casaccia, on the fifth of May, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
