    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends his godson [...] from Thun; has promised the treasurer, without prior consultation, that [Johannes] Fries will take him in. [Peter] Kunz praises Bullinger's Matthew [Commentary] and recommends it for purchase; since the book is not available in Bern, R端mlang requests the sending of two copies; he would have brought them himself from Zurich if he had known that [Johannes] Kymo had given up the book trade due to his appointment to the pastorate. Bullinger should write to Kunz, saying he has heard from R端mlang about the positive reception of the book and the letter [from Bullinger and Erasmus Schmid] and is pleased that Kunz agrees with them; R端mlang refers to his other letter [No. 1669] and is confident that Kunz is on the way to better insight.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since that young man, most eloquent and upright Bullinger, is particularly dear to me, of whom I am the godfather (Taufpate), and who has an honest and upright father from Thun, I did not want to fail to recommend him to you also in private letters. Therefore, I am adding these letters to those you will find wrapped in the bundle, not indeed sealed, urging that Fries may deign to take him under his protection. For I, trusting in his kindness, and assuming he would not object, even though I have not previously discussed this with him, told the treasurer to send the young man only to Fries; for he will be kindly received and supported by him, etc.</p>
      <p>Kunz praises your Matthew [Commentary] and extols it with many commendations, urging others to acquire it for themselves. No bookseller here has it; therefore, I would request that two copies be sent here through this servant and the price be indicated; I would ensure they are paid for. I assumed I would find them for sale here in Zurich; but the bookseller Kymo, having been called to the office of preacher, has ceased from this trade; had I known, I would have brought the book with me.</p>
      <p>Please write to Kunz that I have informed you that he praises and extols your book and your opinion on the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and that your letters were most welcome and eagerly awaited, and that you agree beautifully with him in all things, and that you will never fail him with your work and zeal, etc. Also, consider what is written in other letters; for being ashamed of error is the first step to repentance. Let us therefore cover the lapse and overlook and forgive all, so that what follows may remain intact. I trust that the hope I have conceived for improvement will not deceive me; take him in, who is entirely inclined towards you, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the last day of September in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Forgive the importunity, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard von R端mlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his ever-beloved brother in Christ.</p>
