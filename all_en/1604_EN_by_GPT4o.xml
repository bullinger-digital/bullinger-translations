      <p> Greetings and blessings. I have received the sessions, most esteemed lord and brother, and I do not know whose fault it is that they have finally come into your hands, as I intended them to come first to you and to Gast. If he has ever been ungrateful or unfair to me, I have not known it until now; certainly, he faithfully takes care of everything I entrust to him, and I do not wish to burden you with these matters out of respect. With great sorrow of my heart, I inform you that my most pious and learned fellow minister, my dearest brother Otto Werdm√ºller, passed away yesterday at the beginning of the night at the ninth hour, departing from the darkness of this world with a sound faith to that eternal light. Everyone agrees that it was indeed well for him, as he is freed from the troubles and evils that the Lord will send upon this most ungrateful age; but in the meantime, he has left us fellow ministers and brothers in great mourning. You know what kind of man he was: pious, benevolent, modest, diligent, and solidly learned, and especially loving towards me. May the Lord, who gives teachers and pastors to His church, provide another in his place who is useful to His church. </p>
      <p> This second German war torments me like nothing else. I fear many things; if the Emperor first occupies Strasbourg, you will soon see astonishing things. If only, if only the Germans would still repent; if only we would all pour out more fervent prayers to the Lord and change our wicked lives; for there will be no salvation in the French cavalry or the German infantry, but in the mercy of our God. I doubt what the Pagans are doing and planning, but I know for certain that they will remain true to themselves, until etc. I am deeply grieved by our ways and expect nothing but unspeakable evils. May the Lord have mercy on us. </p>
      <p> I hope you have received my little book recently sent, in which I believe I clear our churches from the stain of heresy and schism, etc. The brothers greet you, and especially my three sons-in-law, Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler, my relative Gwalther, and the lords and brothers Pellican, Theodor, Gessner, Wolf, and Frisius, etc. Farewell. March 26, 1552. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the Basel church, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Basel. </p>
