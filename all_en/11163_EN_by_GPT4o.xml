    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for his book on the Scripture and the Bishops [HBBibl I 111] and sends in return Bucer's work on pastoral service, a topic of utmost importance in the building of the church. Has heard with joy about the good condition of the [Zurich] church and calls for further promotion of proper order and unity among the pastors. Wishes him that his new colleague Megander will relieve him, who is capable of great things if he seeks the welfare of the church instead of conflict. Points to a concord-hostile writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Your book on Scripture and bishops has now been returned, which I enjoy as a most delightful gift, for which I am grateful to you. In return, I am sending Bucer's and our own thoughts on pastoral care, upon which the dignity of the ministry of the word and its ministers, of which I speak, depends. I ask you to kindly go through this booklet; for in this matter, many of us are involved, and from it, we hope to restore the true face of the church. Neither order nor reason will stand in the churches without this care, I believe.</p>
      <p>It is most joyful to hear of the people's will, the magistrate's zeal, and the concord of the ministers, some of whose crimes we experience here as hindrances to edification, no less than ignorance and laziness. We believe this evil must be remedied by order and discipline, which we almost lack still.</p>
      <p>We strive to restore it. If we achieve anything noteworthy, you will know through us, my Bullinger; for we are indeed in perilous times, and I dread internal evils more than external ones. Make an effort to maintain that pleasant and agreeable gentleness of spirit; for there are those who easily indulge their own and their affections, neglecting friendship and the bond of goodwill with brothers.</p>
      <p>I hope that Megander, given as a colleague, will relieve you of your labors, as he is truly a great man, when he is engaged in the contemplation of the church without contention; for he has acquired wisdom through experience.</p>
      <p>A booklet hostile to concord is flying through the hands of men, from which I know you are distant. We will strive in turn to be mindful of our duty, so that we do nothing beyond decorum or against the reputation of the best brothers. For such fumes would naturally disappear from well-reconciled minds, to which I especially devote my efforts.</p>
      <p>I will greet your friends in your name, as you command, tomorrow; for I owe this day to writing very diverse letters. And yet, in their name, I greet you and yours in return, which I know they will approve, Pellican, Bibliander, whose letter to Sapidus I partly heard, truly learned, Megander, and also Rellican, whom we pray remain with us in the Lord; for we are hastening to the end, so our strength fails.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 2nd day before the Nones of April 1538.</p>
      <p>Your V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, to be held in greater esteem in the Lord.</p>
