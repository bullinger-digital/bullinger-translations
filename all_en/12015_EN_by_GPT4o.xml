    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Erb's pious, dutiful letter [No. 1953]; blesses Erb. Shares that Johannes Fries has already translated the 12th book of his commentary on Matthew into German and sends a copy, but leaves it up to Erb to have a Latin edition printed, which [Christoph] Froschauer will surely approve. A student [Diethelm Keller] translated Bullinger's "Apodixis" ["The Old Faith"] from German into Latin, a copy of which is with Hans Vogler [the Younger]. Heard that Erb is being called to other churches, but wishes that Erb would remain in his church; on the other hand, he would also like to see him with him in the Confederation; requests news about his plans. Greetings; [Konrad] Pellikan praised the brotherly love of the [Alsatians] for [the Zurichers]. The young, talented Gerold Meyer [the Younger], son of Gerold Meyer [the Elder], to whom Zwingli dedicated his writing "Quo pacto ingenui adolescentes formandi sint," would like to be trained as a city clerk [in Reichenweier]; Bullinger asks Erb to advocate for Meyer with [Oswald FÃ¼rstenlob], who also accepted Hans Vogler [as an apprentice]; he currently lives with his relative Johannes Escher, the sub-scribe of Zurich; greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letters and read them with pleasure, dearest Erb, both because they breathe piety and because they testify to the loving and devoted spirit you have towards me. May the Lord, who is love, embrace you and do good to you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fries has preceded you in translating the 12th book of the commentary on Matthew, which he undertook to complete, a task you were going to undertake for the sake of promoting piety. I am sending you a copy of it here. I see, however, a harmony of the same spirit in both. May it be read by many with much fruit! However, it is up to you, if it seems beneficial to the scholars, to have it printed separately in Latin.</p>
      <p>I think Froschauer will not make a bad decision, as it seems to pertain to the education of many.</p>
      <p>A certain diligent person has just translated from German into Latin the "Apodixis," which shows that the Christian faith began soon after the creation of the world and has endured to our times. For I wrote it in German seven years ago. I gave a copy to my Vogler, with whom you will find it.</p>
      <p>I hear you are being called to care for other churches; but whether you will leave the one you now govern with the spirit of Christ and the word of truth, I do not know. What if you were called back to us in the Swiss Confederation, if you do not wish to remain in the place where you are now? I would like you to stay in the church where you are now; but again, I would like you to be with us, if you decide to leave. Let me know your thoughts.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you, especially Megander. You will greet all the brothers, especially Regius. Master Pellican has preached to us many times about your faith and love towards us. For which we give you great thanks, praying to the Lord Jesus to strengthen you in all good. Pray for us to the Lord. Farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 3, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Here is a God-fearing, talented, and well-bred young man, Gerold Meyer, of patrician lineage, from a very old, honorable, and powerful family in Zurich. His father was Gerold Meyer the Elder and remained at the Battle of Cappel, to whom Zwingli dedicated the booklet "Quo formandi adolescentes ingenui." He has a desire to become your city clerk, which would also be very agreeable to the family of honor. Therefore, it is my very friendly request that you advocate with the aforementioned city clerk, that he accepts him, as he did with Vogler from the lineage of Georgii. He will not regret it. For he is a very honorable, well-off young man and still very young. Currently, the young man is with his brother-in-law, young Hans Escher, the sub-scribe of the city of Zurich. Let me know a good answer.</p>
      <p>I want to earn where I can; also greet the city clerk for me, etc.</p>
