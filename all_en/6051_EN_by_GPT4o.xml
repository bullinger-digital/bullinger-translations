      <p>Most illustrious and revered lord.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have not sent you any letters because I had nothing certain to inform you about; but even now, I have nothing worthy of your ears. However, I wanted to greet you with this opportunity of sending the decrees of the last session; I had believed that I could have sent them to you two months ago; but somehow, two copies that were being brought to me (which I believe I wrote to Mr. Fabrizio about in recent days) were lost, one after the other. Whatever the case, if it was not convenient for you to be served, I ask you to excuse me; for it was not my fault, but happened by chance. In recent days, it was announced that King Philipp (Philipp II of Spain), by order of the Pope and with all other papist princes as allies in war, was preparing an expedition against the Queen of England (Elizabeth I). The Marquis of Pescara was said to return from the court with great sums of money to be spent on this war and was appointed the leader of all Italian and Spanish infantry. However, these things have not yet appeared; for neither has the marquis yet reached Milan (Mailand), nor have any soldiers been enlisted in Italy this year except those who have been sent to maritime locations. The Turkish rumor seems to have cooled; the disturbances in Calabria are now thought to be almost settled, and everything else is peaceful and quiet in Italy. If anything certain is brought, I will write to you diligently.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, my lord, and may God increase the gifts of His spirit to you, so that you may serve His church more each day. Chiavenna (Clavenna), on the first of March, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Ulisse Martinengo.</p>
