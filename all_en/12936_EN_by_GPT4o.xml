    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Pincier was in Zurich, he has often wondered how more students from his environment could be familiarized with the teachings and lifestyle of the people of Zurich, so that some of them would devote themselves to theology. Perhaps Pincier is still too young to judge this well, but he knows no other place where the truth is taught with such clarity as in Zurich! Moreover, the people of Zurich lead an irreproachable lifestyle and have exemplary good manners. Nowadays, these two qualities are hardly found among theologians, although they are so urgently needed for the instruction of the common people and for the education of the youth!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] These young people [Johannes and Justus Vulteius] come from [Wetter] like Pincier and are also related to him. He has been able to convince them to go to Zurich. In doing so, he has followed his conscience entirely. Since he has initiated the matter, it is also his task to ask the people of Zurich to grant these students a stay in their city and in the Schola Tigurina. They will finance their stay out of their own pockets. Their debts, which the Zurich students incurred in Marburg, have been credited to them, as can be seen from the letter of Wigand Happel [No. 2883]. They hope that they may demand as much in Zurich from the beginning as the [Zurich students in Marburg] spent. Hopefully, this will also be agreeable to the people of Zurich, especially since it spares them a money transfer in these troubled times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Due to the uncertain conditions, the students could not take much money with them. Should they need more money for their education and living expenses during their one-year stay, the people of Zurich may advance it to them with the assurance that they will be reimbursed. It would also be good if Pincier's relatives, Johannes and Justus Vulteius, could live with a scholar and eat with him, so that they can learn something from the daily conversations as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] They are quite good in Latin and Greek. They have studied for a long time in Marburg, then almost two years in Strasbourg, and afterwards in Leipzig and Wittenberg. God willing, they will now come to Zurich, and if they also lay the foundations in theology and Hebrew there, further studies in all subjects will be possible for them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should kindly receive Pincier's candid request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also from Dietmar Fuhrmann, the head of the church in Wetter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings from God. After I once became acquainted with both the doctrine and the way of life of your people, I have not ceased to ponder in my mind how I might join some of our own, who wish to devote themselves to theology, to your discipline. For as much as I can judge matters due to my age and weakness of judgment, I have seen nowhere else the business of truth handled with greater candor than among you. Furthermore, if anyone considers or requires the sanctity of life and integrity of morals, they will indeed find there something to admire and imitate with praise, which indeed are two qualities that are as rare today among theologians as they are necessary, not only for the instruction of the common people but also for the education of the youth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, since I ought to sincerely wish well for these young men, who are joined to me by both country and blood, I have advised, by Hercules, nothing else but what my conscience dictated to me, and I have made them acquiesce to my counsel, led by certain and just reasons. Since I was the author of their journey to you, it is fitting that I carry out the matter I have begun to the best of my ability and, in whatever way I can, obtain from you permission for them to reside in your city and the Schola Tigurina with your good will and peace. They will live on their own money, as is fitting and proper. They have taken on the debt incurred by your students in Marburg, as the letters of Wigand Happel will show, and they have done so in the hope that, as soon as they come to you, they may recover as much as they have spent; in which they also hoped to do you a favor, so that you would not have to send money in these troubles and dangers with any risk. But I have no doubt about this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Moreover, if my cousins need anything within the span of a year, since they could not safely carry much money with them, I earnestly ask that they not be abandoned by you because of this. For we will pay whatever they spend with you on liberal education and living. Therefore, I would very much like, if your circumstances allow, for my cousins, Johannes and Justus Vulteius, to have domestic companionship and also share a common table with some of the scholars, where they could learn something from private conversation daily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The young men themselves are moderately instructed in Latin and Greek. For besides having studied for a long time in Marburg, they have also stayed in Strasbourg for almost two years, then went to Leipzig and Wittenberg, and finally, God willing, they come to you; where, when they have laid the foundations of theology and the Hebrew language, I trust that all their studies will be easier for them thereafter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have dared to make this request of you so freely, relying on your ancient humanity. I therefore ask that you do not take it badly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell in Christ and love us! Decius Agricola, the head of our church, greets you along with the other excellent and learned men. Given from Wetter, 8 days before the Kalends of May in the year 1547. Your entirely, Johannes Pinzinger.</p>
      <p>To the most holy overseer of true piety and religion, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and teacher.</p>
