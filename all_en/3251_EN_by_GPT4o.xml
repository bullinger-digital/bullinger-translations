      <p> Greetings. I send back to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, that confession of our people along with the rest, which you sent together, and I give you great thanks for these. You see that I, not without reason, have little trust in our French; they are deceitful and have absorbed much of Bucer's spirit, who introduced these plays of ambiguous words into the church, leaving behind the sincerity and simplicity of truth. If this matter were known to our senate, I know Beza would be severely punished; for the other one concerns us less. You see, therefore, what we would achieve through those men if it were to come to a conference; they would betray us along with the simplicity of truth, and if we wanted to dissent from them, a greater schism would arise and a more serious wound would be inflicted on the church than before. However, as you advise, I will reveal this to no one. I had a dispute with a certain Lutheran in recent days, although not about doctrine; thus, to the terror of others, he too was banished from the Bernese territory by our magnificent senate. The Genevans continue in their manner; they recently tortured and beheaded one of their citizens, who had taken a meal with their exiles at an inn near their territory, and fixed his head on a pole erected opposite the inn where they had dined, so that it seems to look upon it. </p>
      <p> What will eventually come of this, the wise easily understand. May the Lord avert these evils from us. </p>
      <p> We have no news of new things, other than what you have yourselves. I will have Pfenninger's boy recommended; although it is a great annoyance for me to perform the duty owed to them, especially since they are negligent; for either this must be ignored, which cannot be done piously, or the fathers must be offended along with the sons. However, I will do what I can. Farewell well with yours. Please greet in my name Mr. Martyr, Bibliander, Gualther, and all your noble ones. Our people diligently greet you. </p>
      <p> Bern, July 26, 1557. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather, Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. </p>
