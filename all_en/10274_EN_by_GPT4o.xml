    <p xml:id="regest1">Answers the questions posed by Myconius in No. 237: He, Bullinger, does not reject the Eucharist for the dying, although it is not customary in Zürich for reasons not mentioned here, and he also believes that Oecolampadius introduced this regulation only provisionally. Bullinger's opinion on the question of interest and taxes is stated in his book "On the Shameless Outrage of the Anabaptists" and was approved by Zwingli. The Zürich farmers have not demanded a change in the existing regulation on taxes; no new regulation in this regard has been introduced. The heresies that have arisen in Strasbourg frighten him.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I do not strongly disapprove of the practice of offering the Lord's bread and wine to the dying. However, the reasons why we do not embrace this in Zürich are too lengthy to recount now due to current affairs. I have noted some things in the 2nd chapter of Acts, which you may see at the next Frankfurt fair. I suspect that the holy man Oecolampadius allowed this practice only temporarily. For no other necessity can be demonstrated for it. My judgment on interest and taxes was published long ago while our Zwingli was still alive and is praised in the "Explanation of Jeremiah" chapter 34. It is found in the work I published in the German language against the Anabaptists. Our farmers have never requested the abolition of the tax reform, nor has the senate abolished anything, except that foreigners have long been allowed to collect taxes according to the terms of the records. But no one is henceforth allowed to purchase any taxes in our land except according to the prescribed fairness. I write this based on the common report of all and the opinion of the leaders. If anything contrary has been done, of which you have heard, we are unaware. The heresies that have arisen in Strasbourg have greatly frightened me. May the Lord exalt His holy name.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, and pray for our church.</p>
      <p>July 17, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, chief pastor of the people of Basel, colleague and dearest brother.</p>
