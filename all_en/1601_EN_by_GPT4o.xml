      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father through Christ, our common Lord.</p>
      <p>I confess, most learned Bullinger, that I write to you less frequently than the sense of gratitude and respect I owe you demands, nor do I have anything to excuse either my negligence or my excessive modesty. For although you attribute (as is your kindness) my infrequent writing to scholastic duties, which are indeed immense and require all of me, I cannot defend myself against their impropriety nor satisfy myself. Rather, the esteem of your name and dignity and the multitude of your occupations would deter me, were it not for your kindness and your strong affection towards me that encourages my modesty. Therefore, I would strongly accuse my own difficulty, were I not well aware of how much I love and sincerely respect you, and here I would especially wish for our dear Vadianus's rare and learned ability in writing and speaking, so that I might continually, not monthly but daily, testify in writing to the respect I carry for you with utmost sincerity without interruption. But since you are reluctant to be without my letters, I will make an effort to be more frequent in the future. I have embraced the booklet for the evangelical churches with the greatest pleasure, and I am held by the most ardent desire to read it; for it has just now been returned to me, truly worthy to be read at this time, when calumnies have become so prevalent that finally the haters of truth may learn how falsely they slander us. Therefore, I give thanks in my name and in the name of the churches, whose patronage you have undertaken; from Christ the head, you will finally receive the crown of eternal happiness. You can hardly believe how sweetly your hand-signed dedication, a clear testimony of your memory of me, has affected me. But what can I offer in return? Your piety, as I suppose, has understood from Frisius how much the church of Altstätten misses a good pastor, and since the ecclesiastics of Augsburg have suffered rejection due to proscription, it seems that no more suitable overseer and judge can be provided for this church in sacred matters than from the renowned city of Zürich, to which the administration of this region also looks. But we await Alexius Knobloch, from whom we hope to learn what we have achieved by writing. We have understood more clearly about the French and the German princes from your writing, which otherwise circulates obscurely among us. May God temper these calamities in His goodness, so that miserable Germany, which has hitherto been harassed by the most cruel hands of the Spaniards, may not finally also be open to the plunder of the French.</p>
      <p>The undertaking of the German princes is indeed auspicious, provided that piety, faith, and not excessive reliance on human protection, which corrupts everything, are present. Farewell, most esteemed Bullinger, and kindly consider my modesty, as you do.</p>
      <p>You have our Samuel with you, whom we wish to be such that he can be appointed to some church in the homeland, which we ask for your assistance to be done promptly, and for his own diligence. St. Gallen, March 19, 1552.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the most ample church of the city of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
