      <p>Worthy, well-learned and especially gracious, dear sir, I have received your recent letter along with the enclosed copies of the partial, envious edict and missive of the Emperor at the right time and very well, and I express my great and high thanks to you, my gracious lord, for them. I find therein your inclined Christian goodwill towards me, and I will strive to deserve it as much as I can. I am sending herewith a response to the two points, which I am accused of by the Emperor and some Confederates, to the honorable council in Zürich and also to Lord Bernhard von Cham a copy of my general response with a request that he, along with other lords, advise me whether I should combine all these 2 points and the other together and send them to all places before the next day or if it is enough to respond to the first two points alone. And I hope I will be accompanied and heard in person, etc. To this end, I ask you to help and advise what is necessary for me, and to act and show according to my trust in you. I do not know when the day will be set, but it seemed good to me that the response should occur shortly before the day. Count Jörg von Württemberg sends you grace and all good things. All matters are quiet; only intentions are to be considered. Constance must be advised to the House of Austria; this will mean unrest for us; then one would see the benefit that arises from the lack of rescue. May God arrange everything to His praise. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 12th of October, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>S[ebastian] Schertlin, knight.</p>
      <p>I am sending you herewith an interpretation of the Interim in Latin and German; let the treasurer also see this.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, etc., my gracious, dear lord.</p>
