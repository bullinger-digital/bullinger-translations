    <p xml:id="regest1">[Mathias] Limberger wrote to Gast: [At the Schmalkaldic League meeting in Frankfurt] princes and imperial estates have achieved a great deal in the past two months. Count Palatine [Friedrich II], Duke Ottheinrich, and the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] have turned to the Gospel. France and England are ready to help [the Schmalkaldic League in case of an attack by the Emperor]. The Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] has the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] as a guest in nearby Höchst, which gives hope. The [Schmalkaldic League] has sent a delegation to Emperor [Charles V], which was deputed by Elector [Joachim II] of Brandenburg, the Count Palatine [Friedrich II], the Landgrave, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, Duke Moritz [of Saxony], and the [Frankfurt] Senior Mayor Oger von Melem. We will see what [Charles V] will respond. This was written by Limberger. Perhaps more will come from him with the messenger [...], to whom Gast gave a letter for Limberger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Recently [in Basel], many have been promoted to Master. Except for one, they all come from the city. They were beautifully dressed. Honors not only nourish the arts; they also bestow dignity on worthless people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Rudolf] Gwalther will deliver the [„Disputatio adversus gentes“] by Arnobius [the Elder]. Gast will also send [the works] of Cyril [of Alexandria] as soon as they are printed, and, if Bullinger wishes, also the works of Boethius. Bullinger should not worry about the price.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Nothing is heard from Gilbert [Cousin]. He left Nozeroy because of the plague. Hopefully, his brother [Antoine?] will soon come to [Basel], undoubtedly with letters to friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Gast has not yet described the [life] story of Niklaus [Petri], but he will send it with the next letter. - With the carter [...], Gast sent the commentary on Exodus by [Johannes] Brenz for Bullinger and the commentary on the entire Virgil for [Johannes] Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Charles V] is laid low with gout in Maastricht.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- On March 1 [1546], Gast was invited to a wedding where the Zurich innkeeper [Ludwig] Stapfer was also present, a shameless man who indulged in slanders against the Zurich pastors and teachers. He also claimed that [Rudolf] Collin earned more than 1100 guilders in the year [1545] through wine and grain trade. Furthermore, he said he attends mass whenever he wants. He should be stripped of his citizenship! There were also some Zurichers present who might tell the whole story.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Gast is very pleased that the Zurich [pastors and teachers] are getting along well again. Quarrelsomeness is a terrible evil; Luther is also afflicted by it. Nevertheless, he continues to rage, even though his conscience and the Holy Scriptures impose otherwise on him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, his wife [Elisabeth, née Kalb], and their children [Samuel and Elisabeth].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Limberger wrote to me: "What has transpired here in the past two months through the princes and estates of the empire, I cannot express in words, for it is too much. Yet, out of Christian love, I cannot withhold from you what the Lord has shown us of love and goodness at this imperial diet, namely that many high-ranking people have turned to the Gospel, namely the Count Palatine Elector, Duke Ottheinrich, the Archbishop of Cologne. France and England offer to do much. The Archbishop of Mainz hosted the Landgrave at Höchst, a mile from us. They stayed together overnight, and there is good hope that things will soon improve. Our people have sent an excellent delegation to the Emperor. They are appointed by the electors: Brandenburg, Count Palatine, Landgrave, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, Duke Moritz; and in the name of the cities: Our senior mayor Hoier von Melem, etc. But what response will come from the Emperor, time will tell." This is what Limberger wrote to me. I will write more shortly through the messenger, with whom I sent letters to him, who has not yet returned.</p>

      <p>Farewell and rejoice with us for the many masters recently created among us. All are from Basel except one. They begin to wear golden rings and receive the title of knight. Honor nourishes the arts and adds dignity to people of no worth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and pray for our church. Basel, March 4, 1546. I send through our Gwalther the books of Arnobius against the pagans. I will also send Cyril when it is completed. Then, if you wish, I will add the works of Boethius; do not worry about the price.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I hear nothing of Gilbert; he has gone abroad due to the plague, which had begun to spread slightly in Nozeroy. I do not know if he has returned or is still on his journey. However, I hope his brother will soon come to us, who will undoubtedly bring letters to all friends with him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have not yet described the history of Nikolaus, but I will send it with the next letters. I entrusted Brenz's commentary on Exodus to the carter, who will faithfully deliver the book. Likewise, I sent our Fries the commentary on Virgil. All are collected in one bundle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Emperor is in Maastricht with gout, so much so that he cannot move. The Lord sufficiently reminds him of his duty, if he would be wise.</p>

      <p>On March 1, I dined at a wedding, where a guest from Zurich named Stapfer was also invited, a shameless man surpassing all pimps in foul language. Never in my life have I heard anyone speak more obscenely among so many guests, even when admonished, than that man. He hates all preachers of the Zurich church and readers alike. He had started a conversation about Collin's wealth: That he surpasses 1100 guilders this year, selling so much wine and grain. Then he freely and openly said he attends papal mass whenever he wants, and other things I do not wish to say in his hatred. Certainly worthy, in my judgment, to be eradicated from the number of citizens. Some Zurichers were at this feast, who might perhaps tell the whole tragedy.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Moreover, I am very pleased that God has again glued your somewhat embittered minds into their former harmony. I know from experience what evil envy once conceived brings with it and how tenacious we are of those things we have once undertaken to defend. For who doubts that Luther suffers from this kind of disease? Nevertheless, he continues to rage, even though his conscience and the divine scripture suggest otherwise to him.</p>

      <p>Greet in my name Mr. Pellican with his wife and children. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
