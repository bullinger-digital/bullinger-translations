    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After the departure of Johannes Oporinus, it was learned that the people of Augsburg have come to an understanding with Emperor Charles V, and he has granted them the practice of their religion until a free council is held in Germany. However, it may take a long time before such a council takes place! Furthermore, there is a fear that this council will not prove to be free, but rather tyrannical, and will become the starting point of a sad servitude. The Emperor is also said to have promised the people of Augsburg that their privileges would remain untouched. However, they could not achieve that he would not station troops in Augsburg. Presumably, he is trying with his flattering words to completely take over the city, in order to then exploit it or prepare there for an attack by the Turks and French, who frighten him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bernardino Ochino will describe everything in more detail. During the negotiations with Augsburg, the Emperor explicitly demanded the arrest of Ochino. However, the city did not abandon him, bid him farewell, and even provided him with a bodyguard for the journey. He is now setting off for Basel. The people of St. Gallen are having him accompanied to Zurich by a city official [...]. From there, the people of Zurich are to provide him with a bodyguard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hieronymus Sailer sends his regards and asks Bullinger to inform him of any news, especially regarding Rudolf Gwalther's matter, as such a notification can hardly worsen the situation.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After the departure of Johannes Oporinus, we have learned that the people of Augsburg have made peace with Emperor Charles V, if it can indeed be called peace, as it seems to have been arranged under rather unequal conditions. The Emperor promised not to change anything in matters of religion until the next national council, free and just, which he intends to hold in Germany. However, I fear that this may happen too late and, if it does occur, that it may be unjust or oppressed by a sad servitude. He also promised to preserve the city's privileges intact. However, it could not be obtained from him that he would not introduce troops into the city. If I can judge anything about these conditions, I believe he wishes to gain possession of the city with flattering words, so that, once he becomes more powerful, he may exploit it at his pleasure, or certainly, fearing the power of the Turks and the French, who seem to be pressing closely, he has decided to prepare for defense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>But you will understand all these things much more clearly from Bernardino Ochino, who was explicitly demanded by the Emperor among other conditions. However, the city, wishing to ensure his safety, sent him off with an honorable escort. He is now setting off for Basel, accompanied by a public official of this city. We believe it pertains to the man's security that he be escorted to Basel by some public official of your city, and we all beseech you to provide him with such companionship as you judge necessary for his safety, which we think can easily be obtained from all the brothers and your magistrate.</p>

      <p>Hieronymus Sailer sends you his respectful greetings and earnestly asks you to share with him any news you may have received from anywhere. He particularly wishes to know what has been done in the case of Rudolf Gwalther, about whom he is very concerned; you will, however, communicate according to your kindness what you think can be shared without harm to anyone.</p>

      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, January 31, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Theodor Bibliander and the other brothers, whom, God willing, I will see shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
