      <p>Greetings. Alas, you write too truly, my dearest brother, that it would have been better to have been extinguished long ago than to be preserved for so many evils, which now accumulate more and more, although some fruit of these dreadful evils seems not to be regretted among the pious, while they are thus more effectively mortified in the flesh, but live far more happily in the spirit and pray more ardently, having seriously turned to the Lord, both of which things plainly languish and grow cold when the cross ceases, although I would prefer (if given the choice) any other cross than this one, which brings with it such an occasion of impiety for us, and no less for our descendants, if we are to have any. For the matter has come to such a point that it is now clear to no one that the head of our religion is being attacked; so much so that there is haste against all who have not yet sufficiently submitted to the decree of the Emperor. Although a few remain whose consent has not yet been obtained, yet those who still stand seem almost all to waver. Regensburg and many others initially responded strongly and sincerely; but upon hearing such horrendous threats, almost all withdraw. The Saxon cities have not yet resolved to return so disgracefully to their vomit; but it is not known, however, what constancy of mind they will maintain in the face of the Emperor's more severe threats. A response is expected daily from the Duke of Württemberg, likewise from the people of Strasbourg, and there are those who place little hope in either, although yesterday I was with a man not given to vain talk, a nobleman from Anwil, prefect of Balingen, who affirmed that the prince was clearly resolved not to make a loss of his soul and morals by such an enormous defection after so many and such great evils suffered in body and fortune. What the people of Strasbourg are contemplating, I hope to receive certain news within four days.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Pelatinus of Zweibrücken, having been summoned again to Augsburg, is asked for a different response than he gave before; for he had previously refused. They think, however, that the Duke of Württemberg will also be called there. Although Hesse is a captive and abominable to all, they report that he has said he will never redeem himself from perpetual chains by consenting to that decree. Furthermore, our people write that on July 5th, the preacher of John Frederick was first banned from the court by the Spaniards, but by the Emperor's authority, and then soon also from the city, and afterwards the Emperor's envoys tried to extort the good prince's consent to the decree, to which he freely said: he has now lost everything and has nothing left to him but this vile body; but he considers the loss of this to be of less importance than to contaminate the chastity of his religion for its preservation. Thus there are still some traces of sanctity among those princes whose power is the least, so that the Lord's virtue shines much more clearly to all in their weakness. The Emperor has already remonstrated with the Augsburg Senate for being slow in shaping the church to the letter of the decree; therefore, it is now being dealt with the ministers, so that they too may answer for themselves; but they think that some of them will conform to the decree, while the rest will either be thrown into chains or proscribed; for this is certain and resolved for the Emperor, to uproot and utterly overthrow this, which they call a schism, to the very roots, while so many thought that the preaching of the gospel would be free.</p>
      <p>I send here the formula, according to which those who defect from the gospel swear with composed words. O Savior Christ, see our humility and redeem us, look upon us for your name's sake.</p>
      <p>I am very eager to know if Schöner is there. If he is, I earnestly beseech you to ensure that with the letters addressed to him, you also deliver 10 gold coins to him in cash; for I have already received the same amount from his sister and would have sent it if I had been certain of his return to us; but I will send it with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received letters from Bucer dated July 10th, in which among other things he says: "Between hope and fear, everything; today, however, hope seems to prevail."</p>
      <p>I received yours through Paul and we give you the greatest thanks for your human kindness shown to Musculus; we expect the exile and arrival of many other ministers at any moment.</p>
      <p>Concerning our bishop, know for certain that this very Metzler has been elected and inaugurated, that is, placed on the altar with those pure ceremonies you know. Those who know the man more intimately affirm that he is not entirely bad, especially when compared with others.</p>
      <p>The king takes over Reichenau. What belongs to the Abbey, Wolmatingen, Alenspach, etc., they have not wanted to swear to the bishop. The king does not want to leave the Abbey to the bishop anymore, but to keep it himself and appoint a bailiff there. The Swiss will also see.</p>
      <p>Prominent people consider that something big is planned for this summer with the Confederates, based on many conjectures. There are troops around Feldkirch, also in Württemberg, and they have sent Felchern and Eckle from Zell, it is thought, to discuss these matters, although they give the child another name, as if it were to be on behalf of the duke. It is also thought that there is an agreement with the one from Landau and that there has been no displeasure against him. In Innsbruck, the king has in a short time ordered 6000 rations to be slaughtered in haste, and another 4000 are to be slaughtered; they were all so tired that they could not do more. This is certain and comes from a well-informed person who was present. It is also thought that Maximilian, the king's son, has something else in mind with his journey to Spain and that he will raise troops in Milan and hinder the French in Piedmont, etc.; everything is being arranged so that the Confederates are surrounded in such a way that neither they can help the French nor he them. But everything is in the hands of the dear God; let us fear and keep him before our eyes; then no bogeyman will frighten us.</p>
      <p>My lords have again sent one of their soldiers to our envoys in Augsburg on Friday with a letter to the imperial majesty, in which both small and large councils, as well as all guilds, have agreed; they offer everything possible except for the restitution of religion and priests, 8000 florins in money and a few small pieces of artillery. What will be achieved, time will reveal.</p>
      <p>The people of Lindau, despite the great and varied loyalty, have also given a negative answer for the third time. May the almighty, strong God preserve them forever!</p>
      <p>If they stand firm, I have no doubt they will be preserved. Among us, I am also still of hopeful confidence that the Lord God will not let us be put to shame for his name's sake, etc.</p>
      <p>That John from Ulm also wrote to us with plausible and most favorable things, trying to persuade others to go to England. The kingdom of God will be taken away from the Germans, I fear much, and given to a nation... etc. But the Lord will still preserve for himself remnants among us as well.</p>
      <p>Bucer also writes this: "Thanks to the Lord! However other things may fall, this has fallen well: our Wittenbergers have responded to their elector about the Interim both piously and manfully; therefore, there is hope that he too, relying on so many promises made to him, has rejected that most unfortunate contrivance." Furthermore, Schnepf wrote to me yesterday: "I hope that our princes will be firm and constant by the grace of God; but as to whether they can prevent the Interim from being imposed on the duchy even against their will, I hardly see." Thus he. It is miserable in Württemberg for the sake of the foreign people; such great wantonness prevails. It is said that in about 20 places not a single preacher or mass priest will remain. Since they do not want to pay, they would like to force the poor people to quit as if they had paid; therefore, they are now sending from all the places where they are located and still are, to the Emperor's embassy, so that he may intervene; for it is not in their endurance.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beseech you by the Lord, for breaking off in such haste; for nothing more diligent or copious was possible; I thought I would have enough time at the beginning of this letter to complete everything better. But now, unexpectedly, Conrad Zwick is going to Marcellus for the sake of duty, as he is very ill, through whom I wanted to send these rough and unpolished rather than many things. Pray for us with all those who care for the churches of Christ and the most serious dangers of our entire Germany. May your household be well. Ours greet you. July 15, 1548.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
