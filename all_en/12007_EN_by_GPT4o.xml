    <p xml:id="regest1">[Johannes] Stumpf has reached the Valais via Lucerne, Unterwalden, and Uri; in search of antiquities, he continues his journey to Lake Geneva, to Lausanne, and from there through the Jura into the Üechtland. [Johannes] Kessler is to examine what Stumpf wrote about Thurgau, and [Vadian] himself should also review the book [the Swiss Chronicle in progress] before returning it. Only uncertain rumors are heard about the French [King Francis I] and Emperor [Charles V]; danger threatens from both in the event of a victory. Bullinger wants to advocate for the concerns of Pelagius [Amstein] before the council; however, 50 students are already being supported by alms and around 40 by church scholarships. [Johannes] Gast has sent Bullinger and Bibliander [Andreas] Osiander's [the Elder] "Conjectures [on the Last Times and] on the End of the World" as well as a biting poem [about Osiander, the "Mirror of Andreas Osiander"]; Bullinger includes the poem as a loan and suspects the deceased Vincentius Opsopoeus as the author; through such slanderers, God punishes those who slander the innocent, as Osiander does in his "Conjectures" with Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and [Christoph] Schappeler. His book testifies to his lack of understanding; he draws untenable conclusions from the Talmud and the "[Tradition] of the House of Elijah," makes unqualified statements about angelic and jubilee years as well as passages from the Book of Daniel and [the Revelation of] John, and attributes the destruction of Rome - against Orosius and Procopius - to Alaric instead of Totila, but Bullinger must break off here, as the bell calls to the council meeting, where he wants to speak on behalf of Pelagius. Vadian should write more often than last summer. Bullinger sends greetings to Kessler; he has not reread the letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Our Stumpf has recently traveled through Lucerne, Unterwalden, and Uri, crossing the Alps into the Valais, where he intends to explore. From there, he will descend again to Lake Geneva, proceed to Lausanne, and pass through the Jura to reach the Üechtland, seeking out whatever antiquities may be found and inspecting the places with his own eyes. May the Lord grant that he accomplishes this successfully. I also ask your Kessler, indeed mine as well, to carefully read what that man has written about Thurgau. I also ask your Humanity not to return the book to me unless it has been reviewed by you. You owe this to the homeland and to all good people. I am well aware of the great burden of affairs that oppresses you; but we must also serve our dearest friends. I have nothing new to write about. There are indeed various rumors, but uncertain, about the Emperor and the French King, to which I give no credence, and I did not want to burden or disturb you with them. If the Emperor wins, he will try to oppress not only the freedom of Switzerland but of all Germany, not to mention true religion; if the French King wins, impiety will rejoice again and the forces of Satan will grow. We are therefore in great danger. May the Lord preserve His church and truth, which both the Emperor and the French King persecute cruelly enough. I will soon plead the cause of Pelagius, an excellent man, before the council. May the Lord grant success! Otherwise, 50 and more young students are supported by alms, and around 40 by church stipends, so the church is quite burdened, especially in these difficult times. However, I do not entirely despair; for Pelagius' benefits are not obscure, etc. Our singular friend D. Johannes Gast recently sent to me and Bibliander the "Conjectures on the End of the World" by D. Andreas Osiander. He also sent a rather free, indeed biting, poem, which I share with you on the condition that you return it with the next messenger. I cannot write anything certain about the author of the poem, indeed I cannot even suspect, unless Vincentius Opsopoeus wrote it before he passed away. It appears to be the work of a learned man of refined and witty intellect. Although I wish that brilliant minds would be exercised on other subjects, I nevertheless think again that it is by divine providence and justice that, since those men do not cease, despite being so often warned, to slander well-deserving men, the just Lord stirs up against them men most skilled in slander, who measure to them with the same measure they have measured to others. If you have read the man's "Conjectures," you have seen what he wrote about our Zwingli and Oecolampadius, and add the most innocent Schappeler, and to whom he compared them: to Theudas and Judas the Galilean, impious and most seditious men. But what necessity drove him? None, but mere madness for slander. Add that in that whole book he astonishingly reveals his ignorance and rashness to the whole world. I certainly thought the man was of more solid learning and sharper judgment. Now I understand, the wretched man boasts of many things and has some things prepared for show, but in reality, nothing. The conjecture he draws from the Talmud and the "Tradition of the House of Elijah" is most vain. How foolish he is about the angelic years, about the jubilees! Furthermore, he plainly betrays his ignorance when he takes upon himself to interpret some passages of Daniel and John. In these, too, it appears that the man is not sufficiently skilled in history, although he promises chronology. Alaric, according to him, overthrew and burned Rome, in which he also sets the end of the first Rome, when it should be referred to Totila, if Orosius, Procopius, etc., are to be believed. But I desist; for the bell now calls the council, so I must seek the senatorial court on behalf of Pelagius. Farewell and love me, and write more frequently than you have this summer. Zurich, August 28, 1544. Greet the most loving brother D. Johannes Kessler. - I have not reread. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
