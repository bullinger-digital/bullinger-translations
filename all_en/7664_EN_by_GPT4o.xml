      <p>Greetings. Upon receiving your letters, most illustrious man, similar reports were being spread everywhere. Also present are the magnificent envoys, who invited me to lunch. I did not want to appear difficult, both because they had invited the entire council and because they promised to inform us of some new matters.</p>
      <p>We were treated splendidly. However, in the middle of the meal, he began to speak in both Latin and Italian words: it is certain that the Prince of Uri has entered Brussels, the city willingly offered its keys, and the most significant part of the nobility now adheres to him. Therefore, the most abundant resources for war will not be lacking; for Brussels is the royal seat and is very rich in money and other resources for war. The Queen of Spain has also exchanged life for death, but before she expired, she burst into a very serious conversation with the king, namely: [O my king, now I am convinced, indeed I have discovered that you are the author of the country's dismemberment. With you as the instigator and helper, my dearest brother, the King of France, is in danger of losing the crown, the kingdom is being trampled, the pious are most miserably tormented, and all bounds of humanity are exceeded. Cease, I beg you, cease. For God is God,] etc. He also mentioned the death of her son and her own impending death, whose grief conceived here and there is not the least occasion and cause. She also predicted the king's destruction and most miserable end. But he responded to all this by saying she was Lutheran. The envoy also hinted that the queen was poisoned. He denied that Toulouse was captured or that any battle was fought, but said it would happen soon. From Italy, I have nothing noteworthy now, and, as he knows, neither does Lentulus. It is certain that two alliances, namely the Jurisdictions and the House of God, have agreed that the monks should be summoned to the assembly and that such a bold act should not go unpunished; but I fear certain artificers, etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more; for I have begun to have a fever. May the Lord Jesus bless us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given most quickly at Chur, 1568, November 9. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the highest pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
