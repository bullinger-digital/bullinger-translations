      <p>Greetings. The courier is leaving here suddenly; although I am busy, I had to write this to you on behalf of the lord orator, who also wishes you well, reverend father in Christ. Those who had gathered to negotiate peace departed from each other upon hearing of the death of the Queen of England, with the agreement that they would meet again on February 13th to finalize the peace; in the meantime, there is a truce. However, a firm and stable peace is entirely hoped for.</p>
      <p>May God grant that this is accompanied by the benefit of the church.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I cannot refrain from mentioning the words our bishop recently uttered. When our senate invited both to a meal in the council chamber and the bishop inquired if I had any news, I should not hesitate to share, and I deliberately acted more reservedly, and finally, when he pressed, I mentioned what had been reported about Reginald Pole and added other matters about the state of England, he, somewhat agitated, replied: "Let peace be made between these two kings, and you Lutherans, who are now triumphing, will see wonders; for certain things are also written to me from Switzerland," etc.</p>
      <p>Thus he broke off; shortly after, he added: "Indeed, I hear your consul has insulted the Lucerne bailiff more boldly, and therefore now pays the penalty; for I hear he has not been well since that time. God shows signs every day, if one would only notice them." This from the bishop; which I wish you to keep to yourself; for it is not safe to make public what is said at feasts. But from these words, it is easy to see what your people are plotting.</p>
      <p>It is also written to Mr. Coignet about Reginald Pole, that he feigned illness; finally, a rumor spread that he had died and that funeral rites were performed for him for that reason. On this occasion, he escaped from England with a great amount of gold and is now in Rome.</p>
      <p>These things, I say, are thus written to Mr. Coignet, to which, since it is consistently reported from elsewhere that he is in chains, not much faith is given. This hastily.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 16, 1558.</p>
      <p>I ask and beg you not to hide from us the outcome of the Baden assembly.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and much-respected patron.</p>
