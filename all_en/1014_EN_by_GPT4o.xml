      <p>Strasbourg, September 1, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace. I was very glad, dear friend and esteemed master Bullinger, that you wrote you had received letters from Hooper, through which you were informed about the books and the royal goodwill. I will gratefully accept and return your gift of gratitude to Froschauer, if the opportunity arises. When I send letters by post, I have to pay ten cruciates for each ounce, which consists of two German lots, in addition to the transport from here to Speyer, which costs at least one and a half batz for each package, if they are larger. We have heard nothing at all about the turmoil that has arisen in the French Netherlands. May the Lord grant grace, so that in whatever way Christ and his kingdom may be increased, and the Antichrist diminished.</p>
      <p>What you have entrusted to me regarding the books and letters, both to be received from Froschauer and to be delivered in England, I gladly accept; it will not be burdensome, but most welcome to me.</p>
      <p>For I wish to serve you and all the people of Zurich; for I consider myself a Zurich-Englishman. Therefore, I will most faithfully either deliver the books and letters myself or send them to those you have recommended. However, I am surprised that you have not sent any copy to the bishop. But it matters little; for I will present to him in your name what you have given me. I sent your letters to Doctor Montius in Augsburg; for he is there with the English envoy, but he is to return here at the end of this month. Business calls him away and does not allow him to stay longer; I therefore pray that you will excuse the brevity of my writing. We have no news; if there is any, I will share it in Frankfurt. Farewell with your whole family. My wife sends her respectful greetings to you and yours. All the brothers are well.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher.</p>
      <p>I cannot find the book from Leuven; but it will have to be sent from Frankfurt. Please ensure that this letter is delivered to Winterthur to the pious, wise Mr. Bullinger, preacher at the Minster, my kind master.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
