    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller was unable to write for a while due to the lack of reliable messengers. Now, however, he can convey some current news through [..., the servant of Hans Wyss], although Bullinger probably already knows them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Due to the undoubtedly severe cold that has also hit Zurich, so many soldiers have died on both sides that both armies considered retreating. However, out of fear of the enemy at their backs, neither wanted to make the first move. Thus, they endured an unheard-of long time in the freezing cold outdoors. Emperor [Charles V] moved to a nearby hill for better protection but did not retreat. The [Schmalkaldic League] split up: The troops of the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony] moved towards [Schwäbisch] Gmünd; Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] turned with [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg towards Stuttgart; [Sebastian] Schertlin's soldiers headed towards Heidenheim. The Landgrave led the rearguard. Knowing what would happen, he closed the march with artillery and arranged the troops and cavalry to be prepared for an attack from behind. The retreat began on November 22.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The next day, the retreating [Schmalkaldic League] were indeed pursued by thousands of riders from the imperial army. When they threatened the Landgrave's rearguard, the latter turned around, fired their artillery with great force, and charged against the imperial forces with their cavalry. The imperial forces were quickly put to flight, even pursued as far as Lauingen. More than 2000 of them are said to have perished, while only a few [Schmalkaldic League] members did. The Emperor managed to flee with eight horses and is said to have reached Lauingen half-dead with fear. This was reported by a [Schmalkaldic League spy] who had been sending credible reports from there since the Emperor's arrival in Lauingen and fled during the skirmish described above in the entourage of the Bishop [of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg]. Had the [Schmalkaldic League] been able to pursue him, or rather, wanted to pursue him, the war would now be over. It is certain that for eight days there has been increasing talk of the Emperor's death. If only that were true! The Augsburg authorities doubt it. Perhaps this rumor is a ruse. But if the Emperor is not dead, then at least the thought is comforting that he will die one day. If only he would turn to the Gospel and not to the Antichrist [Pope Paul III]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Elector had to take [Schwäbisch] Gmünd because of the anti-Christian and violent attitude of the inhabitants towards him. How the population was treated in the process is not yet known.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The imperial forces are said to have occupied Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl. It is also said that the army of [Maximilian Egmont, Count of] Buren is pursuing the Landgrave towards the Rhine to attack him as soon as possible. In the small towns of Gundelfingen, Lauingen, and Dillingen, the Emperor is said to have left only small garrisons. In Donauwörth, there are 300 imperial cavalrymen and a few infantry units. During the last two weeks, 1500 riders joined the Emperor (including barely 400 from Naples). However, they are said to be returning to Italy through Bavaria!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In short: Both armies have withdrawn, and nothing is known about the Emperor's whereabouts. Sometimes he is dead, then alive again, once in Nördlingen, then in Regensburg or Munich! The [Schmalkaldic] imperial cities [of southern Germany] are also dismissing their mercenaries and keeping only a few companies for their protection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Yesterday, [Hans Wilpert] Zoller arrived. He was granted leave. His employer [Schertlin] is looking for another position for him, as his financial resources have become scarce after he incurred significant expenses for the Zurichers and Confederates he took in.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger will have already heard that the insolent [Jakob] Reinhart was captured by his soldiers and taken to Frauenfeld.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [Pankraz] Mötteli [vom Rappenstein], thanks to whom Reinhart became captain, was in Munich these days. On his way back to Augsburg, he attacked two peasants who had brought provisions to the imperial camp and robbed them of all their money. He concealed his deed from the Augsburg authorities. When Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria heard about it, he accused Mötteli of life and limb (for he had forbidden both warring parties to rob persons of the opposing side). Consequently, the Augsburg authorities put Mötteli in chains. It is still unclear what will happen to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Yesterday, [Hieronymus] Sailer wrote to [Hans] Vogler [d.J.] that the Confederates will discuss peace between the Emperor and the imperial estates in Baden on December 5. They want to decide that if one warring party should reject the reasonable peace terms offered by the other, they will help the latter party with all their might. Is this true? A dishonorable peace is more to be feared than the continuation of an honorable war! Although Haller wishes for a just peace, he cannot see how such a peace could be achieved on acceptable terms for both sides in this case. May the Lord help that we do not receive such peace terms as the Zurichers once did with their opponents [in the 2nd Kappel Landfrieden]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Now to the [Zurich] colleagues and church matters. Haller recently reported on [Georg] Caesar [with No. 2677 and No. 2685]. As the Augsburg councilors are very busy, the matter dragged on. But although Caesar and his companions had several influential supporters, he eventually left. Although Haller's colleagues are annoyed that Lorenz [Meyer] and Rudolf [Schwyzer] were not punished by the authorities, Haller believes that this matter, regulated by the advice of [Michael] Keller and [Georg] Frölich, was handled quite prudently by the authorities! For it would certainly have been unwise to expel all others from the city who harbor ill will towards the Zurichers. It is enough that the latter are allowed to hope for more purity [in church practices]. However, in a city like Augsburg, where so many people from different nations and so many merchants live, it will probably be impossible for everyone to be of the same opinion one day. It would suffice if the majority were sincere. [This is not the attitude of Schwyzer and Meyer], with whom Haller has the greatest difficulty. For as soon as they hear that the Lutherans are planning something [against the Zurichers], they want to give up their position; and their imprudent remarks are reported to malicious people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Recently, it became known that private communion celebrations are taking place. Haller knew nothing about it until now and secretly investigated the matter. From Keller, he learned that this practice dates back to the time of the contentious [Wittenberg] Concord. At that time, such celebrations were allowed for the long-term bedridden sick. However, a pastor must officiate at the celebration, and a proper table must be prepared as in the church. Furthermore, other believers or family members must participate in the communion. Additionally, the pastor is free to refuse such a request (Keller, for example, has never engaged in it and does not intend to in the future). When Haller spoke to the others [Schwyzer and Meyer] about it, they immediately saw a reason to return to Zurich. Since he did not share this opinion, they accused him of tolerating everything, and they even mistrust him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Haller asks for Bullinger's opinion, as he intends to adhere to it in the future. In his view, it is better to try to eliminate the evil with patience and kindness rather than immediately fleeing! In this way, he has achieved quite a lot in a year. He even managed to make the Augsburgers friendly towards the Zurichers. He would have had even more reason than [Schwyzer and Meyer] to retreat to Zurich. He will not celebrate private communions! However, he will tolerate colleagues doing so until a suitable opportunity arises to abolish this practice. And as Haller wrote earlier, there is already a noticeable improvement in Augsburg. But if one intervenes prematurely, it only makes things worse!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Finally, Haller has learned in Augsburg what church means and what it means to be a bishop. In Augsburg, one must proceed quite differently than in rural Zurich. Furthermore, Haller aims not only to win the city of Augsburg for the Zurich (i.e., Christian) opinion but also the other Swabian cities by establishing relationships with their pastors. And most of them are easy to win over, as it only remains to convince them to express themselves in accordance with their already correct views. With those who are reserved, one must proceed with wisdom, following the rule of the Apostle [Paul]: "A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be kind to everyone; he must be a skilled teacher who endures evil and gently corrects those who oppose him. So God may perhaps lead them to repentance, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth" [2Tim 2, 24-26].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Bullinger should please openly express whether he likes this approach. The peasant, uncouth manner [of Meyer and Schwyzer] displeases Haller greatly. It also troubles him. [Meyer and Schwyzer] envy him because he has such a large following for his sermons, because the mayors appreciate him and attend all his sermons unless they are prevented by official duties. They also envy him for his tension-free relationship with the pastoral colleagues. And this, despite his efforts to curb their envy! They use his books, his apartment, his clothes, and his money and benefit from his good reputation. But it probably pains them that he, the younger of them, is preferred. Meyer even clearly lamented: He is nothing; he is not honored; his speech pleases no one! This situation is all the more dangerous as the opponents try everything to play the Zurichers against each other. Haller has already warned them about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Bullinger should keep all this to himself. Haller is close to tears. He knows that Schwyzer claimed on the journey [to Zurich] that he does not teach the truth (he last heard it from [Thoman] Ruman). That the Lutherans speak like this leaves him cold. But how could it not hurt him when his own compatriots claim such a thing? Is that the reward for his efforts, namely for paving the way for them so faithfully? Despite everything, he did not take revenge on Schwyzer. He hid his pain. He made all his self-written sermons available to him. After Schwyzer had read them, Haller asked him if he taught the truth or not? Whether he did not sufficiently rebuke vices and errors? Schwyzer replied that he liked the sermons. Then Haller admonished him to be more cautious in his criticism in the future. He forgave him because he knew that the Zurich councilors (who wrote to him about it) had already reprimanded him. Schwyzer only replied: Another [Meyer] should also be admonished! Since then, Schwyzer has had little contact with the other Zurichers. This pains Haller more than the war itself! He was looking forward to friends. Now he must fear that the Zurich colleagues will be more hostile to him than strangers. Haller has not said a word about all this, neither to Frölich nor to Keller nor to [Wolfgang] Musculus. He still hopes to win over the Zurichers with kindness and gentleness. Bullinger should not tell anyone about this, not even Haller's brother [Wolfgang]. As soon as the unrest has subsided a little, some of the Zurich pastors will probably be transferred to the surrounding villages. Then they will be able to do what they want. It is said about them that they probably do not love their wives because they left them at home...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] About [Hans] Vogler [d.J.] only this: Due to the lack of space, Haller cannot keep him with him. As long as Ruman is with him, Vogler sleeps with one of his friends or with his brother [Leodegar], who is now also in Augsburg. Haller has kept his promise to the father [Hans Vogler d.Ä.] and will continue to do so by having his son with him for two to three months. But longer is not possible! Because he must keep the room free for daily visitors. Moreover, many young people would also like to have him as a tutor. But he cannot accommodate them at the moment because the apartment is far too small. Bullinger might inquire with Frölich whether a larger living space could be made available to Haller? In this difficult time, where many clerics' residences are unoccupied, this could easily be arranged.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] That's all for now. The messenger [...] wants to depart. Bullinger should kindly receive the present letter; he can infer from Haller's openness how much he values him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Greetings to the councilors and colleagues. Ruman, who still lives with Haller, also sends his regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Enclosed is a very entertaining pasquinade, unfortunately poorly printed!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>S. The reason I have not written to you for several days, venerable father, is not due to my negligence, but rather the lack of reliable messengers. Now, however, since I have found a suitable messenger, I will provide a few details about the current state of affairs, although I do not doubt that you have already learned all of this. Nevertheless, so that I do not appear to have neglected my duty, I will share what I know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>After the great cold, which I do not doubt also affected you, subsided by divine providence, neither army could endure it any longer and considered retreating. A large number of soldiers, exposed to the intense cold, perished in both camps. However, fearing that, as often happens when armies retreat, they might suffer great losses from the other side, both sides held their ground for an unprecedented time in such cold weather. Finally, the Emperor withdrew to a nearby hill, as I hear, not to retreat, but to occupy a more fortified position. Our forces, on the other hand, arranged their affairs and divided the army: the Elector's troops moved towards Gmünd, the Landgrave with the Württemberg forces towards Stuttgart, and Schertlin's soldiers headed to Heidenheim (which is also under Württemberg's control), with the Landgrave holding the rearguard. He, aware of what was to come, led the army as if preparing for a battle with the enemy at his back. He closed the line with artillery, arranged the cavalry in order, and began to move, so that if each soldier turned, they would already be standing in a line ready to face the enemy. This happened on November 22.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The next day, the imperial forces pursued them with many thousands of cavalry, threatening the rearguard. They turned and opened their line, firing their artillery with such force that they quickly put the imperial forces to flight and pursued them to Lauingen. As I hear, no less than 2000 imperial soldiers were lost, with few of ours. Such fear arose in the entire imperial army that the Emperor himself fled with only eight horses and took refuge in the town. According to all testimonies, they would have been completely crushed and the whole affair concluded if our forces had been able to pursue or, in my opinion, if they had wanted to. When the Emperor reached the gate of Lauingen, he was so pressed in the narrow space (as one of our men reported, who, being with the Bishop in the imperial camp, was forced to flee with them and seek his own safety - he came to Lauingen with Charles and reported everything faithfully) that he almost expired. Hence, for eight days now, the rumor has spread among us that he is dead, and many are making great claims. If this were certain, oh, what thanks we would give to our God! What greater miracle could happen at this time? This comforts me, for although I do not firmly believe he is dead, I certainly know he is mortal. Our lords also doubt; all cities write so. It is not incredible that there is deceit involved. If he still lives, may he finally learn to live for the Lord, not for his Antichrist!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Meanwhile, the Elector took Gmünd (a thoroughly anti-Christian and bloodthirsty city, as it denied him passage and resisted by force) by storm. How he treated them, I do not yet know for certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>These days, there was a rumor that Nördlingen was captured by the imperial forces; likewise, Dinkelsbühl. But this is not certain. They also say that the Buren army is advancing towards the Rhine and is already following the Landgrave, trying to engage them before they cross the Rhine. In those small towns, Gundelfingen, Lauingen, Dillingen, etc., there are still a few imperial forces; in Donauwörth, 300 cavalry and some infantry companies. Within 14 days, 1500 horses (but barely 400 Neapolitan cavalry) came to the Emperor, who are now certainly reported to be returning through Bavaria towards Italy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In summary: Like the snow, both armies are dissolving and dispersing. And where the Emperor is (whether among the living or the dead, in Nördlingen, Regensburg, or Munich), as there are various opinions, we are completely ignorant. The cities are also dismissing their soldiers, keeping only a few banners for their defense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Yesterday, Zoller finally returned, who also has leave; but now his master will look for another position for him. He does not have much money. He complains about the immense expense he incurred with the Zurichers and all the Swiss who visited him. I easily believe him, as it also happened to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You know what happened with Reinhard, the notorious scoundrel. His soldiers have already taken him captive to Frauenfeld (as I hear).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Metellin, through whose help he obtained the captaincy, was in Munich these days and on his way to Augsburg in Bavarian territory, found two peasants coming from the imperial camp with carts, with which they had brought provisions, and robbed them of all their money without informing our lords. This was reported to the Prince of Bavaria (who, whatever he may have been in these troubles, did not allow either side to rob the other within his borders, which has been praised for a long time), and he gravely complained to the Augsburg captain about this injury done within his borders and accused him severely. Our lords therefore put him in chains. What will happen, I do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Yesterday, Mr. Seiler wrote to Mr. Vogler that on December 5, they will meet at the Baths to discuss making peace between the Emperor and the imperial estates, with the condition that if any party refuses the fair terms of peace, they will assist the other party with all their might. Whether this is true or not, I expect from you. I fear a dishonorable peace more than the honorable progress of war! I sincerely desire a fair peace. Hence, with the poet, I say: "There is no salvation in war. We all demand peace!" But I do not see how peace can be made on terms that both sides can accept. Only the Lord knows. May He guard us from accepting such terms as the Zurichers once did with their adversaries. These are the new developments.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Now a few words about the brothers and church matters. Regarding the matter we had with Caesar, that Lutheran, I wrote recently. This case has been delayed by our very busy lords. He himself had many supporters, both numerous and influential; nevertheless, he left against everyone's wishes. The brothers abhor Lorenz and Rudolf because they were not punished by the lords. In my opinion, following the advice of Cellarius and Mr. Laetus, it seems that the lords acted quite prudently in this matter. For the lords do not willingly stir up great disturbances among the ministers of the word now, to immediately expel all those who are ill-disposed towards us; nor would it be advisable. We thank the Lord, who has given us such a favorable wind, that we may finally have the hope of reaching true purity when the opportunity arises; although it is impossible for all people from all nations and merchants to be united in one stable, to have the same opinion. It suffices if the majority is sincere. Therefore, I have much business with them. For whenever they hear that the Lutherans are powerful and plotting something, they immediately think and speak of abandoning their calling, and imprudently reveal it to those who report every word of theirs to the ill-disposed without ambiguity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Something else happened to us recently. We learned from some that private communion celebrations are being held; which, by Hercules, I was unaware of until now. I therefore secretly inquired where this came from, who introduced this practice, etc. Cellarius replied that from the beginning of this discordant concord, it was also allowed that if there were any bedridden sick who could not leave their homes day and night, they were allowed to have private communions, provided that the pastor officiated at the table as is customary in the church, and that not only the bedridden person but also the family and others present, as many as are members of the body of Christ, participated - but it was up to the pastor, if anyone asked him, to dissuade the bedridden person with reasonable arguments, if he could (and Cellarius said he never did this and never would). When I began to share this with the brothers, they immediately thought they had found an opportunity to return, and almost dragged me, who resisted and did not think churches should be deserted for such reasons, into some bad suspicion, as if I could tolerate everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Therefore, venerable father, I ask for your advice in this matter (without which I have done nothing so far, nor will I in the future). I find this in myself, and the Lord has given me such a spirit, that I think it more prudent to undermine and overthrow many evils with constant gentleness than to flee immediately with the matter unresolved. And I call the whole church to witness what I have accomplished in this city in just one year. I certainly had a greater reason to return, when all were turned against me with the most embittered minds, both ministers and other citizens, whom I have made, through integrity and simple prudence, the most friendly and benevolent to all Zurichers. I will not allow private communion to be imposed on me. I tolerate others doing this for a while, until a suitable opportunity arises to change this custom. And indeed, as I recently indicated, the ulcer has already softened. We hope that all the pus will soon flow out; but to try to squeeze it out before its time is more harmful than beneficial.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I have finally learned in Augsburg what a church is and what it means to be a bishop. Here, a very different approach and method must be followed than what we previously followed with our peasants. I strive not only to attract our city to our opinion (not ours, but Christian), but also to make myself familiar with the ministers of other Swabian cities, if by any means they may be united. And I see that not much effort is needed with many, in whom I only desire that they openly express what they rightly understand. With others, who are more severe, there is a need for skills, and such skills as the apostle places in his canon, when he says: "A servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, patient with evil, instructing those who oppose with gentleness, if God may perhaps grant them repentance to acknowledge the truth and escape from the snare of the devil," etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I pray that you will openly respond to how you like my plan, and do not conceal if you find anything lacking in it. For that rustic and uncivil importunity (I say nothing more severe) greatly vexes and torments me. They envy me for the crowd that gathers for my sermons; they envy the magistrates' favor towards me, for all the consuls attend my sermons unless public business prevents them. They envy that I can live in harmony with the brothers and fellow ministers (which I strive to remove from them!). They use my books, my house, my clothes, all my money, my advocacy with the lords. In short, I share myself entirely with them. But perhaps it pains them that I, a young man, am preferred to them. For Laurentius openly complained: he is worth nothing here, no honor is shown to him, no one likes his voice, etc. This dangerous situation is exacerbated by the fact that our adversaries will try to draw us into different factions and sow pernicious discord among us. As far as it depends on me, I will not allow this to happen. And I will also exhort them, as I have diligently warned them so far, to be on their guard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>These things, my dearest father, I pour out into your bosom almost weeping! Let these remain with you, I pray. I am yours, as you know, entirely. You know (which I only heard from Romanus upon his return), what Rodolphus said about me on the journey, that I do not teach the truth. Oh, these things would not bring tears to my eyes (I already hear this from the Lutherans - for which I do not grieve). But when I am forced to hear this from our own, why should I not grieve from the heart? Are these the rewards of my labors, and that I have prepared the way for them so faithfully as a precursor? For this impudent and malicious voice of Rodolphus, I did not return such as he deserved, but with pain I suppressed and dissimulated, and among others, I shared my sermons, which I write word for word. When he read them, I asked him in the presence of Laurentius and Romanus, how he liked them. Did I speak the truth, or not? Did I rebuke vices, or not, and that with the gravity of an old man, though young? Did I criticize and refute errors, or not? He replied that he liked them very much. Then I said: "Remember to be more sparing in your reproaches to men, but I forgive you," I said, "because I know what the lords of Zurich have said to you, who wrote to me." He only threw this back at me, that it should also be said to others sometimes, etc. From that hour, he has had little familiarity with us. This causes me more pain than the war itself. I hoped to have friends, but I fear they will be more hostile to strangers. I have not said a word to anyone, not to Laetus, nor to Cellarius, nor to Musculus. I hope to bring them back to the right path with gentleness and moderation. I wanted to say this only to you, not even to my own brother. Let it remain with you. I do not doubt that soon some of them will be sent to the villages, if only the turmoil is somewhat settled. They themselves wish this to happen, so they can live as they please. Frequent jests are made about them: One sees well that their wives are not dear to them, because they left them at home, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>About Vogler, I write only this: It is impossible for me to have him in my house due to its small size. While Romanus is with me, he is forced to sleep outside the house with one of his friends or with his brother, who is also here now. I promised his father, as he asked me in letters, to keep him with me for only two or three months. I have fulfilled and will fulfill this; he should not impose him on me further. For I am compelled by honesty to keep that room (the only one I have vacant) for the daily visitors who come to me. In me, there would be no other delay. Many young men offer themselves to me, who would like to be under my discipline. But for this reason alone, I cannot receive them, because my lodging is too narrow. I wish you would hint this to Mr. Laetus, if by any means he could provide me with larger accommodations; which would be easy to obtain at this time with the clerics' houses unoccupied.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>These are the matters at present. The messenger is in a hurry to leave. I commend myself to you as a son. Consider these things kindly. You see how much you mean to me, to whom I so candidly open my heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Farewell happily with all yours. Greet the lords, fathers, and all the brothers. Romanus, who is still with me with his family, sends his greetings. Augsburg, December 4, 1546.</p>
