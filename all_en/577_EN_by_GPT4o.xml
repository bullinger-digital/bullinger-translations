      <p> Greetings. I wrote to you through our Curio on June 23, and given his reliability and diligence, I have no doubt that he delivered those letters to you. At present, there is nothing specific for me to write; indeed, for several days now, no news has been sent to me by anyone. I am waiting to see what your assembly, which is greatly anticipated, will bring us. We hear that the Ten Cantons have agreed to that French alliance, which I will be very surprised to learn is true from your letters. Recently, we had the scribe from Memmingen with us, whom I believe was also with you; he firmly asserted that some very dangerous wars are threatening the Emperor, but you know this. </p>
      <p> If you hear anything about us preachers in Thurgau not being tolerated, warn me in time so that we can prepare ourselves. </p>
      <p> My dear brother's and cousin's matter, as well as others, still hangs in the balance; the post from the king is not coming back. I do not know what to suspect. The colonel has been sent to the king these days, and there is great hope in the city that he will bring good news; indeed, those who are in favor are hopeful. </p>
      <p> Duke Ulrich has ordered the bailiff, as well as the mayor and court in Stuttgart, to conduct an inquisition in Stuttgart among the innkeepers, neighbors, and others who have been around me, regarding the accusation that Doctor Velte has made against me, as I have previously written to you. They have sent me a good letter in the best form, etc. But I will see how I catch the doctor red-handed in due time; I have not brought this up because of him, but because of other people, and I do not know if I wrote to you about this last time or not. </p>
      <p> Herewith I send you an admonition about how those in WÃ¼rttemberg are constantly dealing with the mass priests in their office of the mass, so that the matter has some appearance. Oh God, the miserable blindness. I ask you to send this admonition back to me through Mr. Hieronymus. Farewell with your entire household and all brothers and friends, with whom commend me and mine to the Lord with pious prayers. Farewell again, my venerable and dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Griesenberg, July 4, 1549. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich. </p>
