      <p>Grace from God, our Savior, beforehand. Dear godfather, I have much to write to you and to answer, but this time I cannot do so at length, as I should and would like to. I just arrived today with my brother from Thun and Interlaken, I am tired and holy, have guests and other business. Therefore, do not mind my brevity, I will write more next time. First of all, I wish you, your wife, and especially Zwingli and your daughter Anna much health and blessings from the Lord God, who has blessed them from their parents, may He also bless them in body and soul. As for the declaration and your last letter on it, you have understood my mind in Musculus's next letter, and I understood the same from the present common letter. I am thus minded that, as I have always disliked the gross intolerable errors, so I also dislike and am not a little troubled by the great coarseness of some, etc. That I have something to criticize or improve in it, I do not; but that I can bring it to my lords, I cannot; I recognize and thank God and you that you have worked so faithfully and brought this to pass, I am not only well pleased, but exceedingly glad. But since Calvin and Farel have been known and suspect to all my lords, it would bring more unrest and suspicion among them if something were brought to them than otherwise; besides, we are not all of the same mind here, as you know, and if some disagreement should now be found among us, we would not only be deprived of this peace and unity, but also of all hope of the same. It also moves me that we have many strange heads in the country, who must be dealt with strangely, from whom we are equally calumniated and slandered. I send you herewith what Zebedee and also Nicholas have written to me; showing how we must deal with such people. And their matter is great with many. Therefore, even if it should go out, though I am still of the opinion that it would not be better, yet if it pleases you, I can and will not oppose it, but I cannot see how fruitful it would be in our churches, which I must especially consider because of my office. I have conferred on this with many faithful, honest brothers from the country, who are greatly pleased; but the majority are of the opinion that it would be better to keep it among us at this time than to publish it. Our country is also not the least part of the churches in the Confederation. Therefore, one should also take some account of it. The wounds that our church suffered are not yet completely healed; it is no wonder that one already flinches when one now thinks a little that another blow might come to us, although indeed all brothers would gladly hold to unity, so I will not bring anything of it to my lords this time, nor sign that it should be printed. Otherwise, one is well satisfied. So much for this in haste.</p>
      <p>About Balthasar Alterio, I do not know that I have written to you now. He has requested a recommendation to the government of Venice as in Zurich; I think he has been with you since then. I was with him before the council; but it could not be that he could be accepted as much as a procurator or secretary of the city of Bern; yet he does not have a poor recommendation. I have sent him many copies of various works of Calvin from Geneva, so that they may be prepared in Zurich at Froschauer's; I do not know if they have arrived or not. In this matter, I have worked as much as possible because of your and Dr. Gessner's commendation. That you desire that I insist that my lords from Zurich be written to and thanked for the extension of my office, I will gladly do per occupationem, where I can; so far it has not been possible, as no one (as before) has approached me with words, no one of my lords has spoken to me, not even asked: "How are you, how is it going." In short, they mean well for you; but I know well what it is, therefore I do not resist in vain. What my lords from Zurich have written to Josen surprises me; he has kept it very quiet; if you know now, inform me of it. I send you herewith a copy of the Gallic uprising that happened in Bordeaux last year, as you desire (I will send this with the next dispatch, I could not have it this evening because of business).</p>
      <p>And concerning the boys, it is as follows: we have good prospects here; for besides the common school, which is now well provided and brought into order, we have these public lectures: Musculus reads in the Psalter very excellently and well, with such a method that it is impossible for one not to soon acquire the most convenient method of handling the scriptures; Eberhard reads in the New Testament, now the Epistle to the Hebrews, and at another hour some profane author, whether Greek or Latin; Nicholas Artopoeus still reads Lucian's Timon, will soon begin Isocrates' orations in Greek, as I think, for the public Greek lecture, and at another hour Hebrew grammar of Munster and Isaiah with it, in which profession he is as diligent as he is experienced, so that he can be heard with great profit; Telamon reads the dialectical questions of Philip Melanchthon with great progress of the boys, and also on Tuesdays and Saturdays, when other lectures are free, he reads the sphere of John of Sacrobosco, so far he has read arithmetic, in which he has made the students very proficient.</p>
      <p>These are the public lectures; in the meantime, every Tuesday there are German declamations for all present, on Saturdays Latin ones; for each declamation I distribute 3 shillings according to the constitution of the princes. Therefore, I can affirm that studies are not badly organized with us. As for the costs and board, my lords give Nicholas 20 guilders for a stipend, for some 18, but they give him bed and clothes, also wood with it, and every month a measure of spelt, although he notes 40.30 batzen of currency, for 10 batzen. Otherwise, one buys board for 16 crowns, for 18, for 20. I believe well, so big boys could not be maintained for less than 26 guilders. What I can do for them on behalf of my lords, I will not neglect, whether with others or with me. In Lausanne, they also have such good lectures, excellent professors and capable ones, otherwise as well arranged, the board almost like here. What you now decide on this, you may conclude. So much in haste; as soon as I have further news, I will write more, this time I cannot write better or more because of business. Therefore, forgive me. God be with you and all yours; they greet you most kindly from my wife and myself.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern on the 27th of June in the year etc. 1549. Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his venerable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
