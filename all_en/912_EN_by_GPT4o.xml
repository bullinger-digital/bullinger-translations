      <p>To the Consuls, I wrote diligently in the name of the young Uriel, and I am fully convinced that neither our city nor certainly in my name will fail in his benefit. Indeed, I have also referred part of the knowledge to you and have advised that the rest will be understood from you. Therefore, I implore you, my dear Bullinger, by our mutual trust, that you also deign to interpose yourself with your strength, so that we are not frustrated by any rejection of our wishes. However, I would not want to be a nuisance to the leaders of your city in this kind of petition in the future, unless I were moved by some very just cause.</p>
      <p>As for those degrees of kinship and our not insignificant disagreement with the ministers, we do not wish the matter to be settled by a gathering of scholars in your city, as if you and yours could not sufficiently remind us from the scriptures and hand over the truth as if by hand, but more because we have ascertained the disposition of some towards yours and the passions with which they are troubled.</p>
      <p>However, it would certainly be better for other reasons to meet at least once in a friendly manner, so that we may suffer less from the audacity of adversaries. For you yourself know that everything is full of evil arts and treacheries, to whose keen judgment I submit everything. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the 25th day of May in the year 1550. I wish the college well. Yours, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the City of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
