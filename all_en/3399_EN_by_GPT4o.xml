      <p>Grace, peace, and strength from the Lord always beforehand, beloved lord and brother. My rare and sparse writing is caused by the difficult and evil times, in which no one, especially the pious, can live securely. The present Laux Miller urgently asks me for a recommendation to you, which I could not refuse him as a troubled and unjustly afflicted member. He can write and read German fairly well, is otherwise a cloth shearer by trade, where he might find his livelihood with the same or by holding a German school, whether in the city or in the countryside, I ask brotherly to support him in this. I consider him pious.</p>
      <p>He has a wife and children, but cannot come to honorable residence beyond his means of request and petition.</p>
      <p>However, the fault is not his.</p>
      <p>The authorities, behind whom are his wife, children, and goods, are papist and nothing can be obtained from them. As for the war cries, as well as the colloquium, you know more than I do.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that the pope finds that the jesting is now enough, and will soon arrange the matter for a treaty, so that no part becomes too strong for him. If he can then direct the weather over us, his trouble and crash will not be lacking. Through the childish, harmful colloquium, it has happened just as I have thought many times before, namely the severe and grievous separation of the confessional allies, which the papists rejoice and comfort themselves with; for now not only the church servants are separated, but the lords and princes will also become divided among themselves, as each intends to defend his theologians. Oh, would God that the future misfortune, misery, and distress flowing from this were over. The Illivicists pour out deadly poison against the Majoritas and others.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon along with his part are despised and persecuted, being called Zwinglian, God grant with truth.</p>
      <p>Osiandrists and Schwenckfeldians are increasing again, and instead of the holy gospel, there is more mocking, condemning, and cursing from the pulpits than Christian, friendly, and brotherly exhortation or edification. The almighty, good, merciful God be gracious to us. Amen.</p>
      <p>This is most necessary; especially because the authorities still at this hour take little concern for the understanding of divine scripture, but command the church affairs to proud, arrogant, unknown, and unpeaceful, honor- and money-greedy people, therefore the matters of faith are in the same old, indeed even worse state than ever before. I sit among our preachers as among enemies, being sought and devised against every hour, by what means I might be disgraced and mocked. At the request of my strict lord, I have publicly and particularly made my confession of faith, also explained myself orally and in writing in such a way that the three theologians and jurists appointed for this are heartily satisfied, and as often as I confer with the dicants or preachers, they agree with me and add.</p>
      <p>This does not last long until they step onto the pulpit; then it is immediately something else, and no sermon happens without gross, public slander, curse, and condemnation. Thus I sit in daily battle and war.</p>
      <p>Now I would not like to spend my remaining days in such envy and hatred; if I can sell (even if it goes with great loss), I will still move away from there. Now I have my household in Neuburg and help administer the government of the principality. My son Jonas, without my knowledge this year, has taken a wife of noble, honest birth, namely a Pullingerin, well-behaved in honor and discipline, each being 20 years old. I let them live and dwell in Schlachtegkh, have shown and practiced fatherly goodness and mildness instead of the punishment that the law allows me, on him. God has visited me with a significant loss, namely over 4000 florins in cash, which the priests have taken from me.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I would like to provide my son with the lying goods and further beneficially devote the remaining time to my peers, but according to the state of the times and course, I must still wait longer with patience for improvement. I should not have failed to brotherly report to you the state of my being as a reminder of my thoughts. Please convey my willing, diligent service to my gracious lord, the lord headmen, Habio, Mayero, prothoscribe, Gualtero, Petro Martiri, Phrisio, Geßner, Gvolfio, Simlero, and others of both regiments without burden. Dated Neuburg, the 7th of November, in the year etc. 57.</p>
