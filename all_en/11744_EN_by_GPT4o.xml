    <p xml:id="regest1">The reasons given by Bullinger for not sending him his [Commentary on Matthew] are not convincing; however, this should not be understood as a request. Together with [Ludwig] von Reischach, who was pleased with the greeting, he welcomes the dismissive attitude of the Zurichers towards the French [King Francis I]; the people of Basel pay too little attention to the mandate [against the mercenary service]. After the devastation of the Jülich region, about which he was written from Wittenberg, Saxony intends to send troops against [the Dutch regent] Maria; Myconius fears the involvement of more powers in this war. Of the four Teutonic Order commanders who went to Hungary, only one returned safely; he reported to Reischach about the siege [of Pest] and the treachery of several military leaders, four of whom were executed and one [Peter Perényi] is to be handed over to the Nuremberg Reichstag, as he conspired with the monk [Georg Martinuzzi] and the Turks against the Germans. Rumors about an attack on the Confederation, postponed only because of the war in Hungary, and about Emperor [Charles V's] plans to occupy Milan; those who trust in God are well provided for. [Martin] Bucer was again summoned by the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] and may travel to Minden, Osnabrück, and Paderborn, where there is readiness to accept the Gospel - and hopefully more readiness for repentance than [in Basel]. Luther and the people of Strasbourg have written to the Basel council about the release of the Quran; Bullinger will hear about it. Myconius will respond to the latest letter later. Greetings. The previous messenger came too early.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is surprising what you write: "I did not want to burden you with a large book" etc. Do you not know that books are compared to gold? The larger it is, the more appreciated it is.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there must be another reason why you have sent nothing, even though you have sent everything you have written so far. For the other reasons you add are completely invalid. As if I would accept and consider fair whatever you bring forward in your defense.</p>
      <p>Nor do I wish you to interpret this as if I am asking for something, but I wanted to respond to your words in a friendly and straightforward manner.</p>
      <p>I have greeted Lord von Reischach in your name and explained what you mentioned about your people and the French. As he gratefully accepted the greeting, he is increasingly pleased with your people for not wanting him and prays for steadfastness in the Lord. And indeed, they seem to me to have acted wisely because they did not respond, so as not to come into conversation; for that devil is so cunning that he would misuse such a conversation. Let them persist, and the Lord will be with them. Here, we certainly do not stand so firmly in the French matter, as after such a severe mandate, a penalty is imposed, so that all the more sensible people say it will be a spur for many to rush out in groups at the beginning of spring.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Duchy of Jülich has been completely devastated and occupied by the Brabantians; neither sex nor age was spared; this was written to me from Wittenberg. Because of this, the Saxon has drafted an army against Maria. What do you think will happen if peace is not made? We know the relatives and friends of the Saxon, to whom the French will also join because of the Jülich relative. The Dane is also an adversary of the emperor and a friend of the French. Consider the disturbances of Mars for the coming year!</p>
      <p>Of the commanders of the Teutonic Order, four went to Hungary, two were killed, the third fell ill on the journey, and the fourth came here these days, dined with Reischach, and after speaking enough about the siege, began to talk about the treachery of some leaders, asserting that four were beheaded, and the fifth, a most wicked Hungarian traitor, is held in chains to be sent to the Nuremberg Reichstag. He had planned, in agreement with a monk, to attack the Germans from behind when they began the battle with the Turks, and after victory, to create a king according to his wish, rejecting Ferdinand. He refused to go against the Turks again after finding that they also have friends among us.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a merchant from St. Gallen openly said in recent days that he heard in the Palatinate's domain: "If the Hungarian disaster had not hindered, war would certainly have been waged against the Swiss." And something is truly to be feared, especially if the rumor flying about the emperor, that he is to occupy Milan temporarily, is confirmed by truth.</p>
      <p>Well for those who can say from the heart: "I am the Lord's." Bucer has been recalled by the Archbishop of Cologne and may also go to Minden, Osnabrück, and Paderborn. It has been agreed by all of them that they want to receive the Gospel. May the Lord grant that they receive the whole Gospel, that is, repentance and forgiveness of sins, not - as we do - only the latter!</p>
      <p>Luther wrote to our people about the release of the Quran, and also to the people of Strasbourg; you will hear what it is about later.</p>
      <p>About what you have now sent, another time. Farewell through the Lord Jesus with your people and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 6, 1542.</p>
      <p>The previous messenger came too early etc.</p>
      <p>Your Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most pious theologian, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
