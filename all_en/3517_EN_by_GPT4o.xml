      <p>Greetings. The courier from Zürich has just arrived at my place, at a rather inconvenient time, as I must ascend the pulpit within the hour. Therefore, forgive me if I am brief.</p>
      <p>I did not receive the letters you mentioned, which were given to a certain Englishman, as you wrote. I do not know where he went: I will inquire in Lausanne and Geneva, if by chance I can find out where he went or where he left the letters. Although, if he is a scoundrel, as it seems, it can easily be thought that he took them with him. This greatly pains me.</p>
      <p>But what can we do? We will be more cautious with such men in the future. I thank you no less for the gift sent in those letters to my wife, than if we had received it. Beza and Budaeus, who were here yesterday on their way to Frankfurt to seek intercession from the princes for them, affirm to us that the Parisian captives have not yet been released, but a more serious investigation has been entrusted to three cardinals. Beza asked the senate for permission to leave, which was granted to him, on the condition that he does nothing else but the business of the captives. For they seem to want to do something else entirely again.</p>
      <p>We have incidentally reminded the senate of this.</p>
      <p>Therefore, serious threats have been added (and they will not be empty) if it is discovered for the third time that he is doing or planning something else. We ourselves have also severely reprimanded him for past actions and warned him not to commit anything like this in the future: otherwise, we will not be able to overlook it any longer. He promised to do this.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the Sunday of Invocavit 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
