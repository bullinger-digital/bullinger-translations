      <p>My greetings and willing service beforehand, faithful, dear godfather. On today's date of this letter, a writing comes from the ambassadors of Solothurn through a messenger, the content of which, as the governor Häßi informs me, is that peace has been established and made in France, especially between La Rochelle, Montauban, and another city, which he could not name for me. However, he would not tell me what articles of peace were established; he only indicated that the writing contained that it had caused the king to accept peace, as His Majesty saw that this war had served to the great disadvantage of both religions. Perhaps you have a better report and earlier, better understood than I can indicate here. Still, I wanted to let you know this with the best of intentions. I have received your news from France and the Netherlands along with your friendly writing, and today I wrote to your dear son Mr. Heinrich, to inform you of this and to thank you kindly. I also thank you again and ask you to always keep us faithfully in mind. My wife and all my people send their greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Given in Yl at night on the 12th of August in the year 1573. Johannes Hugo, yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
