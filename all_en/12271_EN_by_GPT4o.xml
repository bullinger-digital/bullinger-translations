    <p xml:id="regest1">The St. Gallen Synod mourns Kaspar Megander. The loss of such men can only be regretted in these uncertain times. - Not too long ago, the people of St. Gallen also lost Mathias Kessler, pastor in Hundwil (Appenzell), who was significant to them, and whose death prompted Bullinger and his colleagues to write a letter [not received]. During his lifetime, Kessler dedicated his son Samuel, the bearer of this letter, to the study of the Holy Scriptures. Generously, the people of Schaffhausen allowed him to study with them. When the father, after some time, endeavored to enable his son to continue his studies elsewhere, he suddenly died of the plague, leaving behind a needy widow and unfortunate orphans. However, thanks to recommendations from the people of Schaffhausen and the Appenzell council, Samuel became a royal scholar [of France], but after studying in Paris for a year and a half, he had to return home due to the famine that struck France, as the two royal scholarships were only sufficient to support one scholar and initially benefited the older of the two scholars. Thus, Samuel appeared before the assembled Synod and confidently asked them to recommend him to the people of Zurich for a scholarship in Zurich. - The St. Gallen Synod is aware that the people of Zurich already take care of many children of deceased pastors and that some students only waste their time. Yet, in view of the father's merits for the Gospel and not least due to Samuel's special talent, they strongly recommend this future pastor. - Request for mutual intercession.</p>

      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father through our common Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We have learned, not without great sorrow, that Kaspar Megander, a man of utmost integrity and steadfastness in truth, has passed away. We, therefore, esteemed brothers, consider this fate of the church worthy of being mourned with bitter tears, as we see the best among us perish, whose authority combined with gravity we can hardly do without in such times of turmoil.</p>
      <p>We have also recently lost from our congregation, among others, a man not to be despised for our modesty, Mathias Kessler, the most vigilant pastor of the Hundwil church in the Appenzell region, whose untimely death has prompted you, most humane Heinrich, and your other excellent colleagues to write letters. For while he lived, he dedicated his son Samuel, whom you see as the bearer of this letter, to the sacred studies of the Scriptures; who, after his initial education, went to Schaffhausen and was educated there with the consent of the authorities. However, when the most gracious father had decided that his son should be sent elsewhere to relieve the people of Schaffhausen of this burden, so as not to seem to abuse their benevolence, which he had enjoyed for several years, alas, as fate would have it, a cruel and inexorable plague took him from us, leaving nothing to his heirs but a poor widow mother, and to the poor mother, orphaned and miserable children.</p>
      <p>For some time now, religion has ceased to be profitable, and true piety has been reduced to the narrowest limits, as you know, brothers, so that in these times, the children of churchmen seem twice miserable, as they are deprived of the hope of fortunes and patrimony, barely able to support their father, and whose fathers, by their office, have incurred the hatred of all, having the world little favorable to them.</p>
      <p>But it happened, by the counsel of good men and especially by the recommendation of the people of Schaffhausen, that by the decision of the Appenzell council, Samuel was admitted into the number of Swiss scholars, who are allowed to study in Paris by royal munificence; where he spent more or less a year and a half. However, after the royal grant, however liberal, could not meet the necessity in such a time of famine, which still miserably afflicts France, it seemed to the Appenzell council that two stipends should serve only one, and now from the beginning, the elder was restored, after two years the younger. Therefore, Samuel, yielding his place, returned home, not knowing where to turn in the meantime, where he might support both his body and his muses (which he cherishes and venerates from the heart), except that he has conceived the sweetest hope, which promises him much from the city of Zurich, the most liberal nurturer of studies and solid piety. Therefore, he appeared before us, gathered as usual, in the presence of the brothers of our synod, with a supplicant speech, asking to be commended to your humanity, so that, relying on your work and authority, he might be granted that porridge (which he understood to be instituted by the most pious liberality of the magistrate for fostering certain talents), to attend your sacred lectures and sermons (by which he does not doubt he will be made not only more learned but also better), adding moreover that he hopes our recommendation will be of great help to him.</p>
      <p>We, who are not ignorant of the many public and private occupations, especially in such a great calamity of bishops, that overwhelm your greatness, and moreover, that you are daily appealed to by the recommendations of many others, and sometimes removed by the negligence of some ill-behaved youths, wasting oil and effort, so that we would not rashly impose anyone on your dignity by our recommendation, but when the magnitude of the indefatigable study and labors of Mathias the father comes to mind (which he endured with a strong spirit from the beginning of the rebirth of the Gospel for asserting the truth) and with what solicitude and charity he pursued his own, committed to him by Christ (so that he preferred to experience the danger of his life - which is the mark of a good shepherd - rather than fail his duty), we all wish the son to be most commended to your humanity and authority, especially since the young man himself seems to exhibit a certain severe gravity and the example of a young man of the best hope, and altogether, what he hears, he seems to carry before him. Which, most learned Heinrich, you will judge more easily and accurately by your singular prudence. But lest we delay you, hastening to more important matters, with more words, we ardently pray to the most good and great God that he may be commended to you with his gifts and ornaments, so that he may be deemed worthy of your work and counsel, and moreover, when he returns to us someday, he may render this senate of our congregation (which he has seen) more august and commendable by his pious erudition and integrity of morals. Thus it will happen that you will not only never regret the recommendation, but will have the greatest thanks to your dignity, to whom we bring a pastor, worthy and acceptable to the Christian flock. We commend ourselves and our churches to your prayers to God. May God, in his mercy, preserve the strength and health of your mind and body for us, and for all the churches acknowledging Christ. The peace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, August 25, 1545. The brothers, ministers of the churches of the St. Gallen synod, most observant of your greatness.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Heinrich Bullinger and the other colleagues of the most famous church of Zurich, their most esteemed lords and brothers in the Lord.</p>
