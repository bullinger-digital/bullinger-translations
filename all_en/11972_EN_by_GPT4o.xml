      <p>G[reetings] I [say]. The reason I write to you at this time is partly because of the one who delivers this to you, Johannes Fabricius, a man of true letters and learning, to inform you how grateful I am that you received my son Jakob von Berckheim so kindly and treated him, once received, so benevolently and generously according to your singular goodness of heart. For this benefit of yours, it is fitting that I declare myself grateful and mindful, by which you have obliged me so that I understand that new obligations have been added to the old ones, for the payment of which I need to make arrangements. But indeed, since he who gratefully receives a benefit is considered to have paid the first installment, I, so as not to appear ungrateful, willingly acknowledge that I owe you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and love me as you are accustomed to, and hold me in your esteem. I wish all the good men who are with you the very best. June 14.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his friend and brother in the Lord to be respected. In Zurich.</p>
