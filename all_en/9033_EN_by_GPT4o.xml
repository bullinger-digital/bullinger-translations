      <p>Greetings. I do not cease, most reverend father, to be a bother to you by writing and interrupting. Recently, amidst the chaos and six hundred tasks, with which I was entirely occupied in the grain market after lunch, I could not return to you; even before, I was so harassed that I was not at all able to extract what I wanted from the letters you granted me; therefore, I entrusted it to Lucius, so that he might prove his service to me in this matter as soon as possible. Since this has proceeded more slowly and perhaps I have gravely offended your mind with this delay, I humbly ask for your forgiveness, whom I certainly both honor and observe with reverence in my heart, so that no one else is before you.</p>
      <p>You know, most esteemed father, what business the market brings, especially to us, who rarely make our way to Zürich. Therefore, kindly forgive me if in any way I have not satisfied you, as I will be more observant of you daily and more cautious for myself. Among the immortal thanks, I give to all of you, who have treated me with such honors and benefits, received as a friend and honorably dismissed. However, by what means I can or should reciprocate your particular benevolence and paternal effort in adopting me, seems very difficult for me to see. I will continually ask the Lord to act on my behalf, etc. Our French here, and especially the interpreter from Solothurn, spread the rumor that the admiral of the king conspired against his life and honor, therefore he was preempted and suffered the punishment of treachery. But from the beginning, it was far otherwise, from which it begins to be clear to everyone that they are dealing with lies. But soon I will be more verbose.</p>
      <p>Please do not let me slip from your mind. May the Lord keep you and strengthen His church.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from our Chur, September 23, 1572. Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and foremost doctor or bishop of the church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
