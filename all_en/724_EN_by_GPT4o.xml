      <p>I received your letter written on October 3rd on the fifteenth of the same month, most honorable Mr. Bullinger; for they lingered a little longer on the journey than I would have liked, and I believe they were finally sent here to Hedio through Münster. I heard with great applause and congratulations that your city and Bern have persisted in their generosity, so that there may be a refuge and asylum for the exiles somewhere.</p>
      <p>For I have it from a most certain and serious source that it has been decreed between the king and the Swiss envoys that the Swiss should not harbor any French exile among them, nor should the king host a Swiss deserter in his kingdom; this article is not expressed in the treaty formula (as I believe) and will cause trouble for many good men.</p>
      <p>I was very surprised by the report about the king's victory near Boulogne; for it is most vain and false. But it is the custom of the French to sell such boastfully stuffed patchworks to the ignorant.</p>
      <p>He took two garrisons located between Calais and Boulogne by the sea not by force, but by surrender, and as I hear, the commanders of both garrisons were corrupted by gold. And what is told about the city of Hamethon is a most vain fabrication; for there is no village, let alone a small town, situated on that sea coast; a station for ships was begun there by Henry VIII of pious memory, where some fishermen's huts were built, in which they could store their nets. This is the fortified city for which such a great effort was made by the French to capture. The king of France, relying on the most wicked sedition stirred up in England, rushed to besiege Boulogne; but God rightfully restrained it according to law and justice, and thus will avenge French violence with just retribution. Would that these two kings inclined their minds to an honorable union and peace; but anger impedes their minds, so that they cannot see what is right. In England, by the grace of God, everything is now peaceful and as far as arms allow, the duties of religion are being attended to. Rumors of the emperor's arrival are spreading among us, and it is written from the court that he will come to Speyer in the month of December, may God make his arrival fortunate and auspicious for the true religion.</p>
      <p>Here, a colloquium is currently being held between the chosen arbitrators from the most reverend bishop of Strasbourg and our senate concerning the moderation of religious controversy; but there is great fear that the last things may be worse than the first; for Christian simplicity does not tolerate degenerate and cowardly dissimulations, and as much as we concede to our adversaries from our right, we betray and prostitute our most excellent cause. Many letters were brought to me yesterday, written in Antwerp by our mutual friend Florian the Pole; but they are so old (as I believe) that they have lost all the grace of novelty; nevertheless, I was forced to redeem them from the post at great cost.</p>
      <p>I am now sending those addressed to your lordship (along with a bundle of French smoke); I sent the rest to Münster in Basel and asked him to ensure they are delivered to those to whom they are addressed. As for what you wish to know about the status of John Hooper, he is living quite comfortably in England with his wife; the bishop of London has been removed from his bishopric and handed over to prison called the Marshalsea in Southwark. Lord Hales and John Butler, Englishmen residing in your city, can easily explain to your lordship the indignity of his imprisonment.</p>
      <p>I hear this is the reason: he was ordered by the king's council to refute the doctrines of the seditious from the sacred scriptures in a sermon; having disregarded this mandate, he spent the entire sermon proving transubstantiation and the presence of Christ's essence in the sacrament of the altar. What will be the end of the affected and voluntary malice of these men? From the letters brought yesterday, we learned that the bishop of Norwich has also been bound over for a crime committed against religion. I have entrusted your letters addressed to Birkman to a faithful messenger to be delivered. I offer all my services to your lordship. I ask you to greet in my name the Englishmen John Hales and Butler residing with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Strasbourg on October 26th, 1549. Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend.</p>
