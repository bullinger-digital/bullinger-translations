    <p xml:id="regest1">Because he knows that Bullinger has heard about his fate through Konrad [Lüthard], and because Grynäus has encouraged him to do so, he writes to him. He regrets his false confession forced by torture; hopes for help in finding a position and includes a sample of his skills. Bedrot or Grynäus knows where he is staying.</p>

      <p>Although I did not intend to write anything to you, most learned Bullinger, yet, when I learned that Konrad N., the preacher of Seburg, had spoken to you about my case, and encouraged by Simon Grynäus, a man most learned of all, I could not refrain from sending you this brief letter, especially since I had such a convenient messenger.</p>
      <p>About my case, you may perhaps hear more in the future; it is not permitted for me to write what I would like about it. However, I believe it is understood by no one as an insult when I say that I am innocent in this case and that the crime was not admitted out of fear of torture (since before the confession I had been tortured in prison for the fifth time), when I hoped I would no longer have to endure them. Furthermore, I did not think the matter was of such importance that the duke would be so enraged against me, despite so many learned and dear men pleading for me. I also thought it would be more advisable for my wife and my two children to live with me with my limbs still intact rather than completely shattered. But I was greatly mistaken, and indeed it would have been better to die for the truth. But why should I complain? It is good that the Lord has humbled me, so that I may learn His statutes. I write this at the behest of Grynäus, so that if by chance there is any position available with you, to which I could be suitably appointed, you too, endowed with such benevolence towards scholars, might assist. I send you some sample of my little talent, from which you can infer what my shoulders can bear; for I would not wish to undertake anything beyond my strength.</p>
      <p>Farewell and kindly overlook my barbarism. You will find out where I am staying in Strasbourg with Bedrot or in Basel with Grynäus.</p>
      <p>In Basel, hastily, because I was in a hurry to leave, in the year 1540, on the fourth day before the calends of September (August 29).</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness,</p>
      <p>Michael Toxites Rheticus, formerly a schoolmaster in Urach, miserable and unfortunate.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the people of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
