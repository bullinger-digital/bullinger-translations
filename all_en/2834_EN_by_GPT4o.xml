      <p>S. I received no letters from you today, nor any response regarding the schoolmaster. I believe perhaps you have sent them, but not all of our messengers have returned from there; however, you will write in the next eight days. We have this news: peace or rather a truce has been made between Emperor Charles and the King of France for the next five years; this is certain to us from the king's letters sent here.</p>
      <p>Would that it lasts as long as it is made! Then, an Italian preacher in our Confederation wrote to me about your Five Cantons, what happened in Milan immediately after their arrival and what they are thought to be seeking. It seemed wise to send these letters, written in Italian, to you so that you might be forewarned, even if the good brother might perhaps be believed to be deceived and for that reason they should not be easily believed, much less widely spread among the public. You should ensure that the latter part of the letter is translated for you by a faithful and discreet brother, but not from Locarno, even though I do not fear Bernardino. If nothing else seems appropriate, take a little time and trouble. Otherwise, we are all well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve you all and us with you. Farewell again in the Lord, most humane man, and do not cease to love your Philippus.</p>
      <p>Our consuls and Father Comander always send their regards to your humanity.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 17th of February, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>If I knew that Mr. Vergerius was still there, I would have sent him letters, as I have sent my eldest son Alexander to Stuttgart, along with my other two sons, whom I have there under the care of the same Mr. Vergerius. It is said that there are fifty Swiss heading to Rome, all mounted on the most exquisite horses.</p>
      <p>Truly to the great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by the good. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
