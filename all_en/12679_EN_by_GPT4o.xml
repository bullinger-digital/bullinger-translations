    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius hopes and prays further that God will severely punish the cruelty [of the Imperial forces], which is neither human nor Turkish, but entirely Spanish and antichristian. Others reported about the [alleged betrayal of Sebastian] Schertlin, not Bullinger. Myconius has already correctly understood Bullinger's letter [No. 2607]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Emperor [Charles V] has requested from the [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate to be allowed to winter in his territory. However, according to experienced people, the Emperor always does the opposite of what he says.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As Myconius hears, what Ambrosius [Blarer] recently wrote about [King Henry VIII of] England is unfounded, for he wishes to remain loyal to the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A nobleman [...] wrote from the camp that the Spaniards had first cut off the fingers and then the breasts of a heavily pregnant woman [...] who refused them, and thus killed her.</p>

      <p>S. I do not yet lose hope. The Lord will put a stop to the cruelty that is not human, not Turkish, but entirely Spanish and antichristian, and will indeed severely punish it! This we will also pray for. It was not you who wrote about Schertlin, but others have said it. Indeed, I have clearly understood your letter.</p>

      <p>The Emperor has requested from the Palatinate to winter in his territory. Experienced people say: Therefore, his intention is entirely different; for such is the Emperor, that when he says this, he means the opposite.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the English, I hear there is nothing, as was recently indicated by Ambrosius; for he wishes to keep the faith given to the Emperor.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A nobleman wrote from the camp that the Spaniards came to a pregnant woman who was near childbirth. And because she did not want to comply with their wishes, they first cut off her fingers, then her breasts, and thus killed her. O God! This because I cannot say more.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus. We will pray to the Lord to protect His word. Basel, 18th of October, 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the venerable Heinrich Bullinger, in the Lord.</p>
