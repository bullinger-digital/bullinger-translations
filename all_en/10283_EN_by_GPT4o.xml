    <p xml:id="regest1">Zurich's response to No. 242 has arrived in Kempten with a delay. Disappointment over its unexpected content. Benedikt Euander is the suitable man for the teaching position in Kempten. He has already declared before the council his willingness to take it on. Urgent request to release him to prevent harm. Otherwise, a Lutheran might receive the position. Reminder for assistance.</p>

      <p>We pray for an increase in the knowledge of God.</p>
      <p>Your letter, written to us on July 25th, esteemed lords and beloved brothers in Christ, we have understood its content. However, it seems strange to us that we have only now, so close to the quarter days, on August 20th, received the response, which we did not expect at all, hoping that you, our dear lords and brothers, would have considered the great danger to our church, which, as we have partly indicated in the last letter, has been severely affected by Lutheran teachings and actions, not only among the old but also among the youth. It is truly of great necessity for us to appoint a leader for the youth who is in agreement with us, for which we have found this Benedict Euander, who had already expressed his willingness to me before I came to Kempten. And since he has personally presented himself here, appeared before our lords, and declared himself willing to them, as he must confess himself, we are concerned that our lords, even if we remain silent, will not release him from his promise. Therefore, esteemed dear lords, we humbly and earnestly beseech and admonish you: For the sake of God's honor, which you are truly hindering greatly, consider what harm and disadvantage would first arise for us preachers, whom we have appointed to our lords, and also for the church and youth. We must be called liars by our lords and the entire community. We must endure that now the ill-willed in the council will attach a Lutheran schoolmaster to us, who will destroy on that side what we have built on this side. We can no longer obtain the desired result; we have miraculously maintained the sea with him. Further, if you and he withhold from us, you diminish our, who would gladly advance further in languages, the benefit of the youth and the entire city's community. Therefore, we humbly request and desire: Do not withhold our dear brother Benedict Euander, but show love towards him, whom you would make a promise-breaker, and towards us, who must stand last before our superiors and the entire community, since you have others to appoint to the position. Consider what disadvantage it would bring to the word of the Lord if we fall away from the community and authority. He knows well what he promised and spoke in the parish house in Kempten. In summary, we no longer have the power to release him. He has promised not us, but our lords; we have not accepted him, but our lords have. Therefore, dear lords, see better into the matter; it is more important to us, him, and you than to suddenly throw the matter away. If he had not first declared himself to us, it would have been of little effort. We might have found something else. But now the matter has sunk too deep. Act towards us as good lords and friends. If we can, we will truly recognize it in another way. We rely on your loyalty and his future. If we had understood before that it would have caused harm to you, our dear lords, and the youth in Zurich, and that you would not have given the change, we would truly have spared you in all loyalty. Now it stands as it is. Do the best for the visible things, promoting our church. You are also obliged to loyalty; we are your brothers and sisters like those from Zurich.</p>
      <p>We commend ourselves to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Kempten, August 20th, 1533.</p>
      <p>Jacob Haistung, Vitus Kappeller, Paulus Rasdorffer.</p>
      <p>To the esteemed lord M. Heinrich Bullinger and all those from the college in Zurich, their beloved and special brothers, to their hands, etc.</p>
