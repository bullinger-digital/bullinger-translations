      <p>S. D. I have received at least three letters from you, all of which were sufficiently detailed, and for these I give you, my brother and most faithful colleague, the greatest thanks. I experience in these your faith and diligence. Continue thus; may the Lord bless you and increase His spirit in you. However, I respond to you briefly, because my circumstances are such. I had hoped to go out to fulfill my duty; but it has not yet pleased the Lord, although today marks the completion of the 12th week. For I am compelled to submit myself again to the surgeon, who on the 4th of this month incised an ulcer, which they call a bubo, contracted from the plague; when the wound might heal again, I do not know; may the Lord turn it for the good. We know nothing here about the Fribourg assembly; therefore, I can write nothing. You will have more certain information sooner from the envoy; for ours sent no envoy there. I first heard from you that a new war is being prepared in France; perhaps these things are spread by the arts of the Spaniards, so that they may accomplish their affairs. Three days ago, I received recent letters from Geneva written by Mr. Beza; he mentions nothing of this, but says that all is peaceful in France, and the king is in Marseille. Therefore, I report to you what I received from him; I do not know whether he perhaps dissimulates, which I do not think.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Carlinus for me.</p>
      <p>If I learn anything more certain or unfortunate, I will make sure you know in time.</p>
      <p>I eagerly read your booklet, and since it expresses and defends my opinion, how could I disapprove? The opponent's opinion is barbaric. He is mistaken if he thinks I was infected by the contagion of a woman, namely my wife; for she began to be ill after me. Indeed, when I approached everyone during two plagues some years ago, now only a few; for it was not as rampant as it is now. Yet the Lord granted me this gift; if you heard how I first felt it, you would say it was immediately sent by the Lord. And of those who visited me, not one has died or been seized by the disease, indeed my sons, daughters, sons-in-law, other relatives, neighbors, who did not want to leave me day and night, have suffered no harm. Only my daughter Margarita, Lavater's wife, died; but I often expelled her because she was pregnant, and she was the least with me, she alone died and none of her children. May God continue to be with us. It seems to me that in every way we must resist, lest that bestial custom be introduced into our churches. Let them flee as they please; they will not escape the hand of the Lord, and however they defend themselves and their own, it is and will never be right. - Our Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer passed away to the Lord on the 6th of this month in Winterthur. Now, therefore, none remains whom I know, except one, Farellus, who preceded me in the sacred ministry. What then remains, except that I too now most of all gather my belongings? - I read the note of Pomponius Bellievre, and it displeased me greatly. From it, I gather (although I knew before) what they seek; dominion over us and nothing else. - While I write these things, events occur that compel me to interrupt these and greatly disturb me; about which more another time.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 8, 1564.</p>
      <p>The plague does not relent. On November 23, the council in Bern presented three proposals to the citizens: 1. The union cannot be accepted as it is; yet if something urgent affects the king or the Swiss are besieged in his service, they will keep their hand open. 2. The matter should not be entirely rejected; yet they should consult with other Swiss. 3. They should adhere to the established laws and let the king's matters go idle.</p>
      <p>This was also the decision. On the following Friday, a letter came from the learned men of Lyon, Peter Viret, etc., to the council in Bern and the preachers, where they earnestly begged that the agreement be accepted; for it would further the faith. This was read on Saturday before the council and on Sunday before the citizens. Then envoys were elected, Junker Gladi Mey and secretary Graafenriet, to go to Fribourg to tell the king's envoys that the union cannot be accepted as it is, etc. Yet they should consult with the Evangelical cities to see if another articulation can be reached, etc. This is in vain.</p>
      <p>The king will not allow anything to be prescribed to him, and where God does not intervene, there will be another confusion.</p>
      <p>But if it is to begin with us, it must have a beginning. May God have mercy on us and direct our affairs in the way of peace, etc. Today, someone comes from Aarau, informing me that the queen of England has retaken Calais. I show you this as a flying rumor; I do not believe it. The day is indeed short; but much can be lied about. Yet be it as it is: I would be sorry for the sake of the war that would arise from it. To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother of mine.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
