      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>It is not unknown to me, most learned Heinrich, that your name (as you write) is despised by the world, for I know that a disciple is not above his master, who, instructing his own, said: "If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you."</p>
      <p>But what wonder is it if the world pursues you with hatred, when that eternal word of the eternal Father, made flesh, through whom the world was made, coming into the world, was not received by his own? For the servant is not greater than his master. "If they persecuted me," he says, "they will also persecute you; if they called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call his household?" But in this you are blessed; for if we suffer together, we shall also reign together; for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. As for what you write about my letters sent under the protection of an unwelcome name out of fear, you rightly admonish and I give thanks; in the future, after the sinning sin against us stands, I will be silent and will not be a burden to the good and to my most learned Bullinger, oppressed by the weight of studies, to whom, along with the other pastors of Christ and the God-taught men gathered in the city of Zürich, I pray with all my heart and soul for that peace which the world cannot give. Amen.</p>
      <p>Here from Italy (to respond to yours) nothing new has been reported, except that the French on the 12th day past finally took possession of Volpiano in Piedmont, having dismissed the Spanish with armed staves, and the Italians with swords and daggers for the sake of honor. That fourth Vergerius gathers armed troops, it is not yet known whether for his own or another's favor; however, the rumor is that he is sending them to the Kingdom of Naples. He has exacted money from the Marranos, who inhabit the city of Ancona, not much, with the provision granted to them that they may live safely in their impiety, which is denied to us who live piously. He has also similarly exacted money from the Jews in Rome, granting something, I know not what, to illustrate the passion of Christ, which sum amounts to four hundred thousand crowns. Cardinal S. Flore, a creature of the Pope, is held in custody in the Castle of St. Angelo along with some from the Colonna family, who, as the rumor goes, wanted to divide the fourth part with poison, so that a part of the most holy skin would be given to each. But what else is to be hoped for, except that from that workshop of Venus and Vulcan a cover worthy of the dish will emerge? But in the meantime: oh, wretched me, who was given to say hello and goodbye to the city of Zürich in one day. Farewell, most humane Bullinger, and since it has a double meaning, consider it said to you in a good sense. Chur, the first of October 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Magius.</p>
