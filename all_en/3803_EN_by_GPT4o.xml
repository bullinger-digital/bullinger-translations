      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>I write to you somewhat late, most esteemed man; but now for the first time, something certain has occurred that I can write about. The other day we received letters from England, confirming the death of Maria, the inauguration of Elisabeth, and the death of Cardinal Pole. That good cardinal, so as not to stir up trouble or impede the course of the gospel, departed from life the day after his Maria died. For such was the love and unity of spirit between them, that not even death could separate them. Therefore, we have nothing to fear from Pole; for the dead do not bite.</p>
      <p>Maria, shortly before her death, sent two of her counselors to her sister Elisabeth, with instructions to first signify that she wished to give her the royal crown and all that dignity, which by hereditary right she then possessed. And for this great benefit conferred upon her, she asked three things: first, that she would not change the counselors, second, that she would not change the religion, and third, that she would pay her debts and satisfy her creditors. Elisabeth replied and said: I am indeed very sorry that the queen is very ill. But as for her wanting to give me the diadem of the kingdom, there is no reason for me to give thanks; for neither could she give this to me, nor should this dignity be taken from me by any right, as it is my own and hereditary. As for the counselors, I think it equally free for me, she said, to choose mine, as it was for her to choose hers. Regarding religion, I truly affirm that I will not change it, provided it can be proven from the word of God, which will be the only foundation and rule of my religion.</p>
      <p>Finally, as for her request to pay her debts, it seems to me a fair request: I will, as much as it is in my power, ensure they are paid. And with this response, the messengers were dismissed.</p>
      <p>On the Sunday following her inauguration, Queen Elisabeth had the gospel preached at the famous cross of St. Paul; which indeed was done with the greatest applause of the people. But on the following Sunday, the Bishop of Chichester, named Christopherson (who once greeted you in your house on his way to Italy, for he is an excellent papist), occupied the same place, and in his sermon, he vigorously and with great freedom (as papists are always bold enough) refuted all that was previously said, loudly proclaiming, do not believe this new doctrine; it is not the gospel, but a new invention of new men and heretics, etc. In this manner, that good papist tried to confirm his own and to take away the truth of the gospel. When the queen first heard of this, she had that good bishop summoned to her, and after examining him about the sermon, ordered him to be thrown into prison. The queen has almost entirely changed her counselors, and instead of papists, she has taken good Christians for herself. And there is indeed great hope that she will promote the gospel with all her might and expand the kingdom of Christ. To this end, God must be entreated by all the pious.</p>
      <p>Philipp has sent a famous and magnificent embassy to her; but what it is that he wants, we do not know. But if he is considering what your prudence feared, he will waste his effort and not succeed at all. Mr. Wroth, Mr. Cook, and other nobles have today begun their journey.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, with the Lord's favor, I will follow.</p>
      <p>When I arrive in England, I will diligently write to you about how things are conducted there.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, pray to God for the state of the English church, and for us miserable ministers of the word, upon whom a grave and difficult burden rests. We, in turn, will fervently pray to God for your church and for you.</p>
      <p>It is now midnight, and tomorrow morning I must depart. Therefore, farewell, most esteemed man.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, December 20, or if you prefer, 21, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Edwin Sandys, Englishman. To the most esteemed man, Lord Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his most respected lord. In Zürich.</p>
