      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord Friedrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Bavaria, Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, our gracious lord. Most illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord, your electoral grace, we offer our humble and ready services beforehand.</p>
      <p>We understand that some discord is about to arise between some of your electoral grace's servants and scholars regarding the ban or discipline, which some deem necessary, asserting that without it no church can be a true church: while others believe that it should not be imposed on any church. If there is any truth to this, we would be sorry, as we are concerned that it might eventually lead to worse things and grow into open discord and division: therefore, we are of good mind and heart that discord in the churches should be eliminated, and we write this brief opinion to your electoral grace, without the knowledge of the parties and everyone else, in silence and secrecy, knowing without doubt that no one better than your electoral grace, if something arises or would arise, could and might prevent it in good time and manner, so that it does not break out into greater displeasure, as your electoral grace might direct those involved not to cause quarrels or division over the ban or discipline, but rather to be content with punishing vices in other ways and maintaining the churches in love and unity; especially at this time, when the churches are otherwise in great danger and must endure much adversity, whereby our adversaries rejoice more than is good: we now remain silent about the offense to the simple; may God Almighty improve this and everything else with His grace and calm restless and contentious minds.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we have had long-standing work here with the Anabaptists in our churches, who can bring forth no other significant reason for their separation from our churches than that our churches are not yet true churches, since we have no ban or discipline, that is, that we do not make a separation in the Lord's Supper through the ban, by which we do not cut off drunkards, fornicators, and others burdened with similar vices, with whom, if one partakes of the Lord's Supper, one defiles oneself: this they cannot and will not do, and therefore separate themselves from our churches.</p>
      <p>But when we have always pointed out to them that even in earlier times the Donatists accused the churches of Christ in the same way, yet without reason, and that the ban and discipline, as they speak of it, is not the sign without which a church is not a true church and remains so; the true signs are the preaching of the evangelical and apostolic doctrine, the Christian prayer, the proper use of the holy sacraments, and the common good deeds and sharing in love, and the Lord has commanded the congregation or churches to gather and keep together in and for these things and not to scatter and divide. - The church in Corinth and other apostolic churches did not have the exclusion from the Lord's Supper and were still true churches, for Paul indeed calls the church in Corinth a holy church, and he wrote about the Lord's Supper in 1 Corinthians 11, as it was commonly held by the whole congregation, in which he well knew and also complained vehemently in the same epistle that there were many boastful and vicious people in the congregation, whom he did not exclude from the Lord's Supper, but clearly left the access free to each one upon their own examination and said, let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup, etc., etc.</p>
      <p>And it is not surprising in the apostle, since the Lord Himself, in the institution of the Supper, made no separation or division among His disciples, who sat at the table with Him, even though He knew who they were, that they were sinners, as it was also openly revealed in the same Supper. Yes, He even tolerated Judas at His Supper, for one cannot be concerned that some of the old and new teachers say: Judas went out before the Supper; for if that should count for something, why should it not also count that others of the old and new teachers here say, Judas stayed at the Supper and received the Lord's bread but not the bread - the Lord Himself, and the Lord Himself gave him the holy sacrament, after which he went out after some further conversation.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is expressly stated in Matthew and especially in Luke that the Lord sat at the table with the twelve; it is also learned from the evangelists that He warned and rebuked Judas before and after the given sacrament, and as is evident, tolerated him at the Passover or Easter lamb meal, and yet the Lord knew and knew well before and after that he was a thief and a traitor; He also openly told him this to his face, and previously called him a devil; should we now be wiser than He, who is also the examiner of hearts and kidneys and could have separated if He had wanted to, that one should separate those in His Supper who present themselves as believers and yet are stained with vices?</p>
      <p>The Supper is ordained for all those who wish to commemorate the death of Christ and confess that there is no food and drink of life except He who was sacrificed on the cross: Jesus Christ; that they wish to partake of it, confess their sins, commit to improvement, testify to this with their access, give praise and thanks to God, and thus reveal themselves as Christians who wish to remain with Christ and His church. - Or can and may it not happen that poor sinful and vicious people come into the churches where preaching, prayer, and the Lord's Supper are held, and when they hear preaching, they are converted by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, are sorry for their sins, believe in Christ, and desire to eat of the Lord's Supper and thank Him? Or has not Paul taught here: when you preach and an uninstructed, unbeliever comes in, he is convicted and judged, and the secrets of his heart are revealed; then he will fall on his face, worship God, and confess that God is truly among you? 1 Corinthians 14. If such a thing happens, who can or will then rightly refuse such a desiring person the Lord's Supper, which is prepared for all repentant and those who have examined themselves according to Paul's word, as these have done?</p>
      <p>Or do we want to reject those whom the Lord has accepted, and who have testified to this with their conversion? Let us be careful here not to take more power and authority than the Lord has given. - With the separation from the Lord's Supper, in our opinion, there is more danger that people will be admitted who are not yet truly converted within themselves and are hypocrites, that indeed some will be considered and held worthy, and the publican who stands behind in the church and says: God be merciful to me a sinner! will be unwillingly torn away and considered unworthy against God's judgment, and the Pharisee will be brought forward. It is also to be feared that soon again years and certain times will be determined and the satisfactions or atonements of the old will be sought again, how long one must wait and do penance before being admitted again to the Lord's Supper; thereby we will again be entangled in many errors. - For all these reasons, we have not wanted to allow the Anabaptists to undertake the separation and ban with the Lord's Supper and to compel us to do the same, or else to be no churches; for we cannot find or learn from the order of Christ and the word of God otherwise than that the Lord's Supper should be free and unprohibited to all who recognize their sins and wish to commemorate the suffering of Christ and thank Him for their redemption. - Now there are few or many who do not approach with true repentance and faith, sinners, hypocrites, or vicious people, whose wickedness and deceit do not stain the true believers any more than Judas' presence stained Peter and others. The holy prophets stood behind the sacrifices, which they accused of great vices, and were not defiled by them. The Lord Himself was baptized in the baptism where those were baptized whom John calls a brood of vipers and was not defiled; therefore Paul speaks distinctly (Ephesians 5) we should not have fellowship with the unfruitful works (note here: with the unfruitful works) of darkness, for if we should have no fellowship with the unfruitful persons, so that we are not defiled by them, we would have to take on another flesh and seek another world.</p>
      <p>And here we also know well that Paul has spoken that we should not eat with one who calls himself a brother and yet is vicious; from this the Anabaptists conclude: much less should we partake of the Lord's Supper with them, where we still always show them that Paul does not speak here of the Lord's Supper, to which there is also a great difference between the common eating and drinking, of which Paul speaks here, with gluttonous people, without which conversation and prayer, as Paul also shows elsewhere from Menander, we are corrupted [?], and between partaking of the holy Supper, in which nothing gluttonous or evil, but only holy and good is heard, seen, and done; therefore it does not follow that if one should not do evil with them, one may not do the good, which is not corrupted by the evil.</p>
      <p>When they then also cry out against us, we profane and desecrate the holy sacraments, as if we were offering and scattering them to dogs and swine, - we have often informed them that we invite not dogs and swine to the Lord's Supper, but all believers who recognize their sins, seek forgiveness of them by Christ, wish to thank Him, and commemorate His suffering, - there everyone should examine themselves according to Paul's word and prevent themselves from eating unworthily to their judgment. Thus we testify that we do not invite dogs and swine to this holy Supper, nor do we profane it, but if one comes unworthily and not rightly, as we invite him, but as Judas came, he profanes it, and not we, who are servants and give it, as we have taught in the first example, who also gave it to Judas; - are those dogs and swine who testify with their access that they are Christians and hold so much to the word of God and the holy sacraments that they earnestly desire them? Dogs and swine are much more those, as Christ Himself explains in Matthew 7, who are enemies of God's word, trampling it underfoot and biting and tearing the servants; such are not those who obediently partake of the sacrament, and even if they are sinners, yet now testify that they are repentant. If they do not persist in improvement, one cannot and should not withhold the Lord's Supper from them for future matters, which are unknown to us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, let the vicious, if they come into the congregation of God, remain with the prayer of the believers, also with the proclamation of the divine word, and no one drives them away from it. What is now more and greater, the word of God or the sacraments? Paul says: Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the Gospel. - Therefore, we have not been able to and still cannot allow the Anabaptists among us to nullify the Lord's Supper with discipline, chastisement, and punishment, since it was not instituted by the Lord as a punishment -, and even less to allow that those are not true churches that do not have or practice their ban, with and through the separation from the Lord's Supper: for we have always believed that the holy Supper should, as also mentioned above, not be a painful external punishment, but a spiritual, joyful thanksgiving and therefore be free to all believers and poor sinners who recognize themselves and the goodness of Christ, as the divine word is also free and as the Lord originally instituted the Supper. But the vices and the vicious should be chastised and punished in other ways and led and guided to improvement and the offenses eliminated. - Now we also know well that among the old administrators of the churches the ban was used with the exclusion from the Lord's Supper, so that they had a discipline and punishment of the vicious in the church, where indeed no one can blame them for having had diligence and consideration, how in their times and circumstances a discipline could be maintained and the vices prevented; but that they drew the Lord's Supper into it, we consider it to be a matter like the satisfactions, atonements for sins, and other similar things, which they also used with good intention, and yet should be otherwise, - but they did as they could and as it seemed good to them; since the church did not have Christian authorities who burdened themselves with the church's affairs or considered and punished the vices as vices, the ban was taken up and used by the old in the aforementioned way and with good intention. If they had had superiors who took on the church's affairs and punished the vices, they would certainly not have used the holy Supper for separation, nor thus banned and entangled. And when later kings and emperors became Christians and burdened themselves with all good church affairs, yet the aforementioned ban with the exclusion from the holy Supper was so deeply rooted and in use that Ambrose, bishop of Milan, also used it on the glorious Emperor Theodosius, a good Christian, yet with what justification, we leave now in its worth and remain. - Philipp Melanchthon in his Chronicle shows thoroughly from the histories that the deed of Theodosius, for which he was excluded by Ambrose, is not to be drawn among the tyrannical deeds. We leave this also in its worth at this time, and we know well that some things used by the most holy church servants do not therefore make a divine right and law for us, which one must follow and obey in all things. - For although in ancient times the aforementioned ban was practiced in the church, it was not practiced uniformly in all places and at all times, as Augustine testifies, who writes in the third book against Parmenian in the 2nd chapter: when the danger of corruption, discord, or division in the church is to be feared because of the use of the ban, it is wiser to refrain from the ban than to proceed with it, to the detriment of the church, for that would be according to the common proverb: wash one sheep and drown ten.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we have written about the discipline and chastisement of the churches in the Confession of the servants in the Confederation issued in 1566 in the 18th chapter as follows: The servants should strive for such chastisement, which is to be used for improvement, according to the circumstances of the times, places, common welfare, and necessity, in which, however, the rule of the holy apostle should always be observed, that everything should be done decently, orderly, and honorably, without tyranny, compulsion, and rebellion, since he also testifies in another place that he has received power from God, only for edification and not for destruction, so our Lord Himself has forbidden to uproot the weeds from God's field, when there is a danger that the grain will also be uprooted. - We have always driven this against the Anabaptists so consistently that we have also seen well through experience and with time what has followed and become of their separation; for in some of their churches, where they have undertaken and practiced the ban with separation, the evil has not only not been eliminated, and the people have not been kept in some and good will towards the divine word, but rather displeasure, discord, and division of the churches have been caused and increased. - Those who were banned have either despised everything or have resisted properly, attached parties to themselves, and have not been improved but rather worsened, and the churches have been despised, plagued, and confused; and what else can one expect in this our last time where everything is so completely corrupted, dangerous, and contentious everywhere? It is still not forgotten what happened in a short turbulent time with the banning and separation in the kingdom of Scotland in a very dangerous and burdensome way; therefore, it seems better to us to refrain from separation than to introduce it in our churches and congregations. If there are churches that now have a discipline with good peace and want to maintain it steadfastly in the future, we gladly and willingly grant them their peace, and do not want to disturb them; we also consider them to be of moderation, that they do not condemn our churches and the like as the Anabaptists do, as if they were not true churches because they do not have the separation as they do, where we have all the signs of the true churches and also the punishment of vices and the vicious. - It is clearly true that not every matter is therefore suitable in all places, with all persons, and at all times, because it is suitable in some places, therefore here the edification and peace of the churches are to be considered much more than special and other church examples, and here it is especially to be preserved that the Lord demands of His steward that he be faithful and prudent and give the household their portion of food at the proper time.</p>
      <p>And let us not be disturbed here by the fact that we are accused of opening the way and the doors to all vices and the vicious, free passage to the devil, - for we earnestly and persistently exhort and urge all heads of households and especially the authorities from the pulpits and otherwise, that they hold on to their own with warning, chastisement, and punishment. So we have good disciplinary regulations among us, which we hereby send to your electoral grace, not that we thereby prescribe anything to your electoral grace, but that it appears that although we do not use such separation, we still intend to prevent vices and the vicious, and that this may well be done where an authority otherwise wants to do the best without the aforementioned separation, and that where vices and the vicious are prevented, we can rightly allow ourselves, since the separation has no other end than to prevent evil and maintain discipline. - Moreover, we are not yet informed with pure sufficient ground from the divine word that our holy Christ has commanded such a ban, as they speak of it, nor have the holy apostles used it in such a manner, as if all the salvation of the churches depended on this exclusion, as some let it be noted. God grant that in this no power, domination, or other sought-after things are sought. - Besides, we have also seen some writings from the highly and well-learned Mr. Thomas Erastus, doctor, our beloved lord and brother, on this matter of the ban, which have pleased us very much, as they are in accordance with the truth and, in our opinion, especially useful for the good and maintenance of the churches. May God increase his gifts and grace.</p>
      <p>Hereupon, just as at the beginning of this our writing - our very humble and friendly as well as urgent request and desire is, if there is anything present concerning this delusion of the ban and separation, that your electoral grace, to great danger and unrest, also division, does not introduce much-discussed separation and (?) the churches and establish new court and law. There is still some resistance among many under the people, yes among noble and common, learned and unlearned, due to the necessary and wholesome change in religious matters, which was recently introduced by your electoral grace in the principality, which should not be increased or strengthened with unnecessary things, - yes with such things that embitter the most sharply.</p>
      <p>Moreover, that otherwise for a long time there has been tension and discord in the church, unfortunately because of the holy Supper, where the Lord has given it to us for union and connection in love, therefore we should not now first and with new quarrel use it for separation and division.</p>
      <p>Your electoral grace should strive much more with the invocation of God's grace and assistance to promote and maintain unity in the use of the holy sacraments without hesitation, but also to punish vices and the vicious as appropriate, but above all to spread the preaching of the divine word widely to the glory of God and the salvation of men.</p>
      <p>We humbly ask your electoral grace to understand and accept this our writing from us in grace, for we have done it from a very good heart and favor towards your electoral grace, whom we are always inclined to serve from the heart. Commending ourselves to your electoral grace's kindness, along with the entire principality in His divine blessing, protection, and shield. Dated Zurich, October 28, 1568.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, Rodolff Walther, Johann. Wolff.</p>
