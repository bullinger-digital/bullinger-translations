      <p>S. D. It would indeed be surprising, most distinguished sir, if our confederates continue to wage war against us, who have done nothing wrong, and I do not hear that our people have changed their plans and responses.</p>
      <p>They wish to maintain the principles of treaties and peace intact, provided they are not corrupted by adulterated meaning. But if there is a dispute over the decision, they wish it to be settled not by war, but either by friendly negotiation or by law, and they also allow votes to have influence. Therefore, I do not know where the disagreement remains, except in the fact that our people refuse to agree to any penalty that threatens the people of Locarno. For it seems unjust and worthy of God's wrath to penalize in others the very religion that you yourself acknowledge to be sincere and which you profess as most certain. Meanwhile, if they continue to impose penalties, our people indeed commend it to the Lord, but they do not wish to participate. But will this truly seem a just cause for waging war, that we persist in refusing to persecute our religion? Where, then, are the principles of peace, which command that everyone should peacefully enjoy and practice their own religion? Moreover, if the penalty does not seem to be migration, let it be called by its rightful name and be called exile. All jurists call exile a civil death, and if someone is better endowed with resources, he would certainly prefer to compensate with a thousand crowns than to leave his native soil. The magistrate is instituted by God to protect the good and restrain the wicked; yet the material for restraint abounds everywhere most abundantly. Why are blasphemers, violent men, those lost in luxury, and violators of virgins and matrons not restrained? These are generally spared, while the sword is drawn against the innocent for no other reason than that they have departed from the common error and dedicate themselves to the word of God by invoking and worshiping God alone through Christ. Meanwhile, God is true and just, threatening His wrath upon those who afflict the innocent and has always inflicted the greatest punishments on those who sin against their conscience.</p>
      <p>Now all agree on the expulsion of the people of Locarno, nevertheless the Lord's counsel remains certain, by which not only those doing wrong but also those consenting are subject to punishment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by such deeds, peace is not solidly established, but God's wrath is provoked, which turns peace into war, as we read happened in the book of Judges between the Shechemites and Abimelech.</p>
      <p>Peace is solidified and prolonged by the fear of God, piety, and justice. Therefore, I, who love true peace and desire its promotion, would wish for our confederates to have merciful hearts, and if indeed they wish to take action against some, they should not urge others who are not at fault to consent to the same. And indeed, I am an advisor to the church entrusted to my ministry, that they should concede for the good of peace whatever can be conceded with sound reason, inviolate religion, and intact faith, but they should concede nothing against God and true religion and against their own conscience. Meanwhile, they should act with no force or continue to promote their religion outside their pure dominion or by laws, much less by the sword, in mixed dominions, doing what befits fair and good men and as much as is permitted by peace. And would that our confederates, content with fairness, understood that true religion can neither be diminished by exile nor eradicated by the sword. But there is also a judge outside this world, before whose tribunal we all, individually and collectively, must one day appear, and this judgment should always be before our eyes; whoever does not see this sees nothing. I hope your piety will disapprove of nothing in all these matters. It seems to you that vigilance is necessary, lest spirits be incited from elsewhere; the arrival of bishops from Rome in Switzerland has always been unfortunate for the kings of France and all the confederates. Ennius came and kindled the war that was waged against Louis in the Milanese territory in the year 1512, etc. Antonius Buccius came, and soon after followed the Bishop of Sion, and they stirred up the Tigurinians and some others to send soldiers into Italy. But then the Duchy of Milan was taken from King Francis by the Emperor in the year 1521. Rome is an unfortunate nest, and, as Petrarch sings, the mother and source of wars. Peace is pretended; but under peace, war is prepared. May the Lord Jesus have mercy on us and grant peace in our days, and indeed a stable, not vulnerable, peace. In achieving this, I will gladly expend all my efforts with religion always intact and sincere; all good men will do the same with me. Farewell. Zurich, December 2, 1554.</p>
