      <p>Herewith I send Your Princely Grace this my admonition to all servants of the Christian church, from which Your Princely Grace will clearly understand that we sincerely desire peace and tranquility in the church of God, if only our restless adversaries did not constantly provoke new strife to the great annoyance of all weak believers. We humbly ask Your Princely Grace to take the time to read the aforementioned admonition and to always help ensure that restless people are calmed and that the wholesome gospel is fruitfully preached to the Christian community in these last dangerous times. By doing so, Your Princely Grace will receive blessings and all good things from the Lord. There are two booklets, one for Your Princely Grace, the other for my gracious prince and lord, the most illustrious Elector of Saxony, to whom I did not dare to write myself, but humbly ask Your Princely Grace, if it seems good and fruitful to you, to send the other booklet to their Princely Grace. Whatever I can serve Your Princely Grace with at any time, I am sincerely willing. I commend myself to Your Princely Grace. May Almighty God keep Your Princely Grace along with the entire electorate under His divine protection and care.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 12th of March, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Princely Grace's willing servant, Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the Palatine Elector on the Rhine.</p>
