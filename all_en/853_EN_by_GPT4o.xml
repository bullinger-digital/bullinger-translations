      <p>S. Your letters have reached me safely, and we will be vigilant as much as we can; only be mindful silently of what we have faithfully advised. The spirits of our people are not the same among themselves as they were when they fought for freedom. Now it would almost be necessary to fight so that what was obtained not only with sweat but also with blood is not lost. The causes of this, it seems to me, are the hunger for gold and the hatred of our religion. May the Lord preserve us and grant a sound mind to those who do not recognize His will. - You rightly reminded me about the Pope; he is from Arezzo by birth, by function the Bishop of Palestrina, named Julius III, indeed with the most auspicious name of tyranny. Our Egidius Tschudi told me the day before that he belongs to the French faction, who came to St. Gallen to greet the Abbot of Wettingen. The treasurer of Uri endured a harsh lodging in Bern, who willingly crept into a trap from which he was to be ejected by the miller in those ways. I laughed enough when I read Haller's letters, and meanwhile, I was not moderately grieved that they do not fear to serve such harsh masters, who are accustomed to command others. I thank you greatly, also in the name of the council, for your letters written to me so extensively; if anything has been written or announced to our people that it would be useful for you to know, I will not remain silent. I am sending back Haller's letters and I ask that you ensure those addressed to our Myconius, which I have attached, are delivered to Basel. However, I would like you not to let me be without your second Decades, now panting under the press, for too long. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day before the Nones of March, in the year 1550.</p>

      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, lord and friend to be honored in many ways.</p>
