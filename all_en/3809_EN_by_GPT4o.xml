      <p>Greetings. I have responded to your letter.</p>
      <p>I would only ask you, if you can send the letters I am writing to Vergerius, to send them; for I do not know where he is now. I wish he could be present at the Diet of Augsburg; the king is sending the Archbishop of Vienna to it, who possesses great piety combined with learning and has long served as an ambassador to Emperor Charles. If you have written to Lelio or some friend who will soon be returning from Poland, you will ask him to bring a suitable horse for my wife. I will pay what he asks.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends.</p>
      <p>Yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
