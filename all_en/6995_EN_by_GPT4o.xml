      <p>Dear gracious lord, following my previous letter, another letter also comes to me from Italy, in which there is a secret outcry that the Guise and Spanish Cardinal of Lorraine have an agreement; their military forces are gathering in Flanders and then moving further. It is worth noting where to. Also, a guardsman from Glarus, who serves in France, writes that there is great unrest among them, that no one is safe regarding their faith, and many are concerned about misfortune.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant; in my opinion, there might be a plan as before, when the Guise committed the massacre at Wassy and captured the king and queen. They had also previously sent the Swiss Confederates to France. I did not want to withhold this from you; for I would gladly prevent harm in this world.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>On the 7th of January, in the year 1567. Your willing Joachim BÃ¤ldi.</p>
