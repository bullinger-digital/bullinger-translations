      <p>S. I am truly surprised that you have forgotten, among other things, what you wrote in your last letter:</p>
      <p>"You will soon see into what misery you have thrown me!" Do you then attribute your calling not to God, but to us? Do you judge us as the most unjust and as if we were your enemies, who knowingly and willingly have thrown you into the greatest miseries? You are indeed mistaken and judge both your calling and us differently than you should, unless perhaps all who are ordained by us through ecclesiastical ordination wish to attribute all these evils they endure to us, not due to our fault, but due to causes far different. But this, like other things we experience daily not only from enemies but also from our own or at least those who should have been ours, we commit to the Lord, our savior.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 18th June 1574.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From many places it is written for certain that the King of France died on Pentecost and that the one in Poland is called by post to be made king. The priestly gossip partly holds onto Philip of Spain, whom they would like to have as king. Many of the nobility and Huguenots are said to side with the youngest brother of the deceased king, Alençon, and there is supposed to be such a commotion in France as no man has ever experienced. If this is true, it will soon come to light. On the 5th of June of this month, it is written from Antwerp that on the Thursday before Pentecost, the Spanish Armada set sail from Antwerp to the Gueux; that on Pentecost the Gueux attacked the Armada, which had 21 ships, defeated them, captured 14 ships, and among them Admiral Hornstetten. All the Spaniards on board were hanged and drowned. Four ships came ashore not far from Antwerp; the Gueux pursued, overtook, plundered, and burned them. This could be seen in the city, and while the Gueux lingered there for two days, the Spaniards rose with great noise and sailed against the ships, but were received by the Gueux in such a way that many of them were killed, and the others hurried back to Antwerp. Thus the Gueux sailed away victorious, and only three ships from the entire Spanish Armada barely escaped to Antwerp, where there is great fear and misery. This is supposed to be true. Also, a Spanish lord, Count Philipp of Mansfeld, who brought the cavalry to Albano, was stabbed in a quarrel in recent days, and this is the true reward the Spaniards show their helpers. Who knows what else will happen to others, therefore it is not without reason that it is written: 'Let him perish like Phaeton, who follows the Spanish arms.' - I will inform Dr. Johann Müller of what you wanted. He is ill in the house of my son Heinrich; tomorrow he will set out for the baths at Baden, which I pray will be fortunate and prosperous for him. I will send your letter dated 14th June to Dr. Haller, so that he himself may read what you wish to be indicated through me, and thus have you excused.</p>
      <p>We are awaiting a certain report on how the assembly called by the Elector of Saxony on the 25th of May regarding the sacramental cause, about which I recently sent a complaint to you, has concluded. Some write about the king that he is forgiven, who would have liked the Spaniard; others say he was filled with worms and died like Antiochus, Herod, and Agrippa. In any case, he is supposed to be dead and his murder avenged by God. How much of this is true and what is real will soon be revealed.</p>
      <p>Others write that nothing is wrong with him, and that the news of his death is a malicious fable, etc.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Tobias Egli, beloved brother. Chur.</p>
