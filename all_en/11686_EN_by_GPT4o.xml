    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter, has forwarded news from it to [members of the council]; praises Zurich's steadfastness [in rejecting the mercenary service]. Soldiers from Konstanz and the surrounding area have joined the campaign of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]. Due to the long-standing hostilities of the Duke [Heinrich the Younger] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel] against Goslar, it was decided to support the city; until the introduction of the Reformation, the city had found legal hearing at the Imperial Chamber Court, even though Emperor [Charles V] forbade the execution [of the judgment] against Duke Heinrich before the Imperial Diet in Augsburg; to protect against Heinrich's attacks, the city destroyed a monastery, which led to military confrontations and mutual accusations of breach of the peace, and the Imperial Chamber Court imposed the ban on Goslar; at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, the ban was suspended and lifted at the Imperial Diet in Speyer - since Heinrich did not recognize this, they have now decided on war. Fears the intervention of the [Nuremberg] League and a bloody war in Germany; may God judge Heinrich; Bullinger should pray for the cause. Rumors that the Landgrave wants to lead his troops [to the regent] Maria in the Netherlands; may God assist us! Greetings to [Diethelm] Röist, whom he, like Bullinger, is happy to serve; expects news from Augsburg, which he will forward. Greetings from [Johannes and Konrad] Zwick; Thomas [Blarer] will soon return with news [from the Upper German City Day] from Ulm. The death of Bullinger's son [Diethelm] is no reason for mourning, as he has escaped earthly misery. Bullinger should pray for them and their church; greetings to the servants of the church, especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther, whom he has not yet been able to answer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ from God, along with brotherly loyalty and love with all good things beforehand, especially friendly, faithful, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Your letters have both reached me well, and I thank you earnestly and highly for them, especially for the shared news, which I have also shown to some of my most trusted lords and have delighted them with it. For we all praise the lords that yours are of steadfast courage and honesty and do not let themselves be overcome by excessive money and personal gain, nor be led away from what is right and fair, and also, as much as it is up to them, desire to earnestly and faithfully draw others away from such evil desires. May the rich God of peace daily increase this and all good things in them through the power of His spirit and graciously preserve them in it. Amen.</p>
      <p>There is no special news with us. Our leaders, who have taken service with the Elector and Landgrave, have departed this week, approximately three hundred of them, among whom are about fifty of our city’s citizens with the council’s approval. More would have gladly gone, as the whole world is so warlike; but they were refused and kept at home for greater need, which we are daily concerned about.</p>
      <p>In what military exercise ours stood against the Duke of Brunswick, our lords have recently informed yours.</p>
      <p>It is a matter that had to be taken up for the sake of honor and the allies, so that the excessive outrage and wantonness of the cruel tyrant and oppressor would be countered; for he has long attacked and burdened the pious of Goslar in an intolerable manner, which ours recognize and have taken up as a religious matter, and have therefore thought and undertaken to provide help and to rescue and deliver them from such tyrannical power in a Christian manner.</p>
      <p>For although the matter itself is not a religious matter, it is nevertheless such that the pious of Goslar, because they have come to the Gospel, have fallen into all this injustice and heavy burden. For before and when they accepted our religion, they had their rights against Duke Henry before the Imperial Chamber Court, although the Emperor at that time, namely before the held Diet of Augsburg, had arranged a suspension of execution against the Duke of Brunswick with the consent of those of Goslar from the plenitude of power. Afterwards, when the faithful God also endowed those of Goslar with His word, everything turned against them at the unfortunate Chamber Court, so that they could no longer come to any settlement or legal proceedings; for when they learned that the Duke wanted to attack them, they burned a monastery located in the city and on their land, so that no disadvantage and harm could be inflicted on the city there by the Duke. When the Duke then invaded their mines and smelting works, the citizens also went out; each wanted to save his own; thus they killed some, burned others in the smelting huts, etc. But when the matter grew before the Chamber Court, complaints from both parties were brought in on one day, each party accusing the other of having broken the peace, etc. But the Duke practiced so much intrigue that the Chamber Judges first gave the sentence against those of Goslar and declared them outlawed and thereby made them incapable of action; for the Duke was not obliged to answer them further in law by virtue of the outlawry, and thus the pious of Goslar were wronged and condemned by willful villainy, so that the Duke, as soon as they were declared outlawed, attacked them, took their mines and smelting works, also all rents and revenues, and possession was recognized for him; he thus tormented and oppressed them beyond measure, so that the misery they have suffered from this tyrant for about eight years is unspeakable. At the Diet of Regensburg, the matter of those of Goslar was continuously brought before the Emperor and earnestly dealt with by ours, also obtaining so much that the Emperor issued an inhibition and personally intimated it to the Duke of Brunswick, which, however, could not achieve anything; rather, the tyrant continued. Therefore, ours at the last held Diet now at Speyer have dealt excellently and requested that those of Goslar be absolved and rehabilitated from the outlawry also from the plenitude of power of the Emperor, active and passive, as they say, to proceed against the Duke in law, which, however, could not be obtained. Yet, upon the urgent insistence and intervention of ours, if this matter is not resolved, that ours cannot send troops against the Turks and thus that work would be destroyed, the Emperor has issued a suspension, which has the force of absolution, and intimated it to the Duke through commissioners with the order that the commissioners should inquire exactly what the Duke has extorted from those of Goslar between the two last held Diets and arrange for him to restore it to them. But in summary: The tyrant has stiffened his neck and has only recently started new mischief with them by taking their goods, which he has laid waste, also killing several servants, so that ours, by virtue of the decision at the last held Diet, have undertaken this campaign to help Goslar and also the city of Brunswick.</p>
      <p>May the dear God grant grace and strength for this. For this tyrant has acted so outrageously with the knowledge and will of his own, that is, of our counterparty, that they will now have to help and support him against ours; then we will already have a land war and misery throughout Germany, upon which our death and ruin will stand. But if God has blinded this tyrant so much that he wants to exercise such intolerable outrage without the foreknowledge and consent of his relatives (allies) of the counterparty and to stand his own adventure (battle, war), as one is then completely assured, no pious lover of honor will take it up for him, then he will soon be overcome and have received his deserved reward. Therefore, we should rightly call upon God with heart and faith that He may exercise and show His judgment upon this bloodhound in such a way that he may be a terrifying example to all others of his kind and remain so, so that no one else may undertake to act in such a manner.</p>
      <p>I have gladly drawn this matter to you in haste for a thorough report on the cause of our war, hoping that you will take it to heart and earnestly call upon the Lord God with us for victory. In addition, I cannot withhold from you, though in high confidence, that the Landgrave, after the Duke of Brunswick has been overcome with God's help and the matters between the Emperor and the French are not settled, will from then on lead the entire army, as he will have it together, to Queen Maria in the Netherlands, which undertaking has much to consider why it happens; therefore, do not let it come out anywhere. In summary: The Emperor will put all his power and strength into it so that the French do not become too powerful for him; but besides, what ours have to fear continuously is not hidden. It turns out, whichever way it may, there will be neither peace nor grace for us.</p>
      <p>But still, the dear God is the Almighty; He will and wants to deliver us fatherly from all the power of darkness, as He has done so far; only that we prepare ourselves with improvement and true confession of our faith to Him, we would surely see His great wonders.</p>
      <p>Please convey many services and greetings to my especially gracious, dear lord and friend, Mayor Rösten, with the offering of all good things. If I could show you and him a serviceable will, I am unreserved. I am waiting every day for new news from Augsburg; when it comes to me, I will let you know further. I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>The Zwickauers send you friendly and brotherly greetings. My dear brother Thomas has ridden to Ulm on my lords' business, he should return tonight or tomorrow; he might also bring some news. That you have raised the godson, we should rather congratulate than mourn, because he has early become like the angels, superior to all human troubles and dangers. Oh, how truly blessed are the dead who die in the Lord in this most ulcerated and deplorable state of all things!</p>
      <p>Commend us and our church to Christ the Savior in a Christian and diligent manner and lovingly forgive the unpolished writing, since it was not possible otherwise. Greet all fellow ministers and servants, especially our Gwalther, to whose letters, so may he love me, I could not respond now; but my spirit towards the excellent young man grows more and more in love, as I hear that he advocates the cause of Christ with such faith and diligence, grace, and success even in the pulpit. May the Lord preserve him for us for a very long time in safety. Farewell again and again, my soul in the Lord. July 15, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. B.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
