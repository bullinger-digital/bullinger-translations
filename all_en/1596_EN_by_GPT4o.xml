      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, the zeal for the glory of God burns within me, and for that reason, I am now sending this personal messenger, who will bring to me from Zürich and Basel two books that I have given to be printed, and some others, and also to ensure that new ones are taken care of for printing. I spare neither labor nor expense; God sees. I have nothing new to write. The Pope threatens me, and brothers from Italy warn me to be cautious. The inhabitants, my old enemies and enemies of the Gospel, also threaten. But the Lord my God protects me.</p>
      <p>That Camillus, whom you call a poisoned flask, will finally be forced to leave Graubünden; for the authorities have indeed ordered him to do so, and I am truly glad, although I fear again that he may infect elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Here we have heard much about Maurice, who is said to have defected from the Emperor along with not a few other princes. If you have any certain information, please let me know, which I ask of you. I hear that Sertlin has returned to Switzerland to gather an army; if by chance you write to him, please commend me to him diligently.</p>
      <p>Morusinus, the envoy of the King of England, recently wrote to me and indeed advises that I should proceed to England even if not invited. I hope to do so in the month of May. In the meantime, we will see if your friends write anything else from there. I will return to you after Easter, if God wills. Farewell and greetings to your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord bless your labors. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, March 13, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Bullinger.</p>
