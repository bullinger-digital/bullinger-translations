      <p>Vergerius recently wrote to me, saying that if I had previously sent certain packages or vessels to you, you should take care to have them transported to me when I request it from you. This is why I am now sending you this letter, in which I would like to ask you to arrange this as soon as it is convenient for you, and also to inform me in your letter how much is to be paid for the transport. You will be doing me a great favor, and if there is anything in which I can reciprocate, I will be most willing to do so once I know. The reason I wrote to you with another's hand is simply that I have no ability to write in Latin myself. Farewell in the Lord. Geneva, the day before the calends of March, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Galeatius Caraciolus.</p>
