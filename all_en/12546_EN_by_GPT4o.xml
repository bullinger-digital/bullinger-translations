    <p xml:id="regest1">Even if Bullinger will be well informed about this event, Hans Vogler [the Elder] still wants to transcribe for him the letter written on July 10 by Mayor [Caspar Zeller] and the council of the city of Kempten [to Konstanz]. The writing was communicated to him and his [host Hieronymus] Sailer very early in the morning by the Konstanz [councilman] Ulrich Hochrütiner:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- It was reported from the [Schmalkaldic field] camp that the [Schmalkaldic] army, which wanted to march into Füssen on the morning [of July 9], had sent a letter into the city the night before to explore the situation. It was learned that the imperial army had secretly left Füssen on the evening [of July 8] and had withdrawn to Bavaria. After that, the Schmalkaldic forces took the city and were mostly received in a friendly and submissive manner. From Füssen, the people of Kempten were ordered not to send any more provisions and to inform the people of Konstanz about this, who in turn should write to Lindau regarding this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The messenger [Hochrütiner] left Konstanz yesterday at 10 [o'clock in the evening]. It is believed that [Duke Wilhelm] of Bavaria will not keep peace for long.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Hieronymus Sailer sends his regards and thanks for [Bullinger's] book [...]. Vogler requests news from Zurich.</p>

      <p>God's grace be with us. Although I assume that you are already informed about the news, I nevertheless send you this, which was communicated to me by my dear Ulrich Hochrütiner, the messenger from Konstanz, along with my brother-in-law, the Sailer, who woke me up from bed and let me read it, word for word, as it was sent from Konstanz: "Many greetings.</p>

      <p>We have just received reliable and thorough information from the camp that on the night of this coming Thursday, our army, which intended to march back to Füssen in the morning, had sent a letter into the city the night before to see how it would be received or what they would find out. The imperial army had quietly left the city early in the night, taking the road down into the land of Bavaria, and thus withdrew and left the city of Füssen. Afterwards, our forces took the city, and the citizens generally submitted willingly with bowed and raised hands. We have also been written to, that we should now cease sending any more provisions until further orders, which we likewise inform you, so that you may act accordingly regarding the provisions until further instructions. We also want to inform our dear and good friends in Lindau as quickly as possible. That is what we have, etc. Dated in haste, July 10, 1546. The mayor and council of the city of Kempten." The messenger left Konstanz yesterday at 10. It is believed that the Bavarian will not keep peace for long or wait (preserve).</p>
