      <p>Greetings. Not yet, most reverend father, when I was writing this, had the merchants returned to us; therefore, we could not understand what you had heard from the Swiss assemblies. However, a very serious rumor has spread among us that the Evangelical cities from the Swiss confederation also approve of the king's friendship, which all the best people do not want to be maintained, I think because of a crime most unworthy of royal majesty. I am very sorry that letters have been sent to the Rhaetians in the name of the Thirteen Cantons, in which not only are the innocent involved in false suspicions, but it also benefits the alliance with the French and will be a unique aid in summoning soldiers as soon as this friendship is confirmed. For what purpose the Rhaetian soldier is summoned with the Pagan soldier is now known to everyone. Thus, I fear that the Evangelicals may provide the slightest occasion to destroy themselves, their country, and their church. Never would our friendship with that most savage robber be strengthened unless the letters of the Swiss had intervened, which hardly deserve belief for how much they deceive the simpler ones about the immortal God. Those who disapprove of the French massacre could have protested, in the judgment of good men, that they would have no part in arming the Rhaetians for the treacherous French robber and most ferocious beast.</p>
      <p>On December 20th, our most honorable consul Willius returned from Innsbruck. He told me that after they had stopped there at the Stag, at the same time a certain abbot from the Monastery of the Virgin Mary, of a monastery of this name, used the same lodging, and when he believed our Swiss to be there, he said: 'I ask you, Swiss men, do you know Wegmann from Zurich, whom I cherish and greatly love and respect at my home or in my monastery (Unser Frauenberg), as a most Catholic and very industrious man?'</p>
      <p>He revealed to me the hope that soon the Zurichers, the most wise lords, would reject the gospel and restore papism, to which many are eagerly attentive.'</p>
      <p>I shuddered when I heard this being told, and I easily perceived under what guise that treacherous one was hiding. Would that the joy of the abbot and all hopes be written in water!</p>
      <p>I wonder if you have seen the Latin booklet published under the name of Peter Carpenter, a jurist, in which, in the form of a letter addressed to Francis Porto of Crete, it is taught that the persecutions of the churches of France did not happen because of those who professed religion, but because of those who supported faction and conspiracy (which was called the cause). It is a venomous letter and, as a certain very learned Frenchman (who is hiding here in Chur and barely escaped from the fire and offered me this booklet to read through the hands of A.), judges, it is not the pen of Carpenter, but rather of Baldwin of Andechs, that apostate, who with great effort and indeed singular pleasure tears apart the most learned and pious man, Mr. Theodore Beza, whom that reviler Julian Seba calls seditious, because he once did not want to endure corrections and reproofs and preferred to go over to the papal or pontifical camp rather than be patient with Christian discipline. He wonderfully pretends the profession of religion, from which he wickedly slanders the pope, as he calls him, and the fury Beza as being far removed. It would be desirable that under the same title of the accusers these weapons be turned back as sharply as possible against the robbers themselves. That Frenchman found many falsehoods in that history, which he will soon share with me. He was, however, not the least in the court of the Duchess of Ferrara, etc.</p>
      <p>This is what I have for you now and I have written it as quickly as possible. May your reverence forgive me.</p>
      <p>The consul, Mr. Campellus, Mr. Charles, etc., greet your reverence. January 5, 1573.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Th[obias] Ic[onius]. Please also extend greetings to all yours and to Mr. Haller, my dearest relative, in our name.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious leader of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To Zurich, to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
      <p>Regarding Wegmann, the report of Consul Willius. Regarding Carpenter in the month of January 1573.</p>
