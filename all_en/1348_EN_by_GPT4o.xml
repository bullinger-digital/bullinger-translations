      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. Since you have not withheld any news from us for some time, some have arrived here, which we are sending to you. We ask that, after you have read them, you send them back to us. We have also ventured into the water here; may the dear God grant that we may bathe in it healthily and happily. Be entrusted to God. Dated Urdorf, the 19th of July, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear, special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
