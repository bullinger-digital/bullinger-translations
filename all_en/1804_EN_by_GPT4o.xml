      <p>S. I. D. From the letters of your piety, I understand, most illustrious man, that mine have not yet been delivered, although I do not doubt that Pellicanus, my most esteemed uncle, and your Theodor have received the bundle of books in which the letters were enclosed.</p>
      <p>However, I had written that Christophorus Montius had piously fallen asleep in the Lord, which resulted in me receiving your letters to the same from the same citizen of Basel to whom I had entrusted them, which I hope you have long since received enclosed with mine.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt that your letters have been properly handled by Oporinus in Frankfurt and Strasbourg, as the man tends to be more curious about others' affairs than his own. We have no news at the moment; however, the common rumor is that Emperor Charles has hastened to Brussels, who in these days has recalled his scribes, whom he had left in Strasbourg (while the siege of Metz lasted), to Lower Germany.</p>
      <p>The bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg are said to be gathering an army against Margrave Albert, who is pressing for levies not yet paid with the emperor's permission from the bishops.</p>
      <p>Also, the bishops are said to sing the Passion after the Alleluia, although Christ had long since risen.</p>
      <p>You will understand the rest well from the young man who bears these letters. Farewell with the whole family. February 7th, in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Zürich.</p>
