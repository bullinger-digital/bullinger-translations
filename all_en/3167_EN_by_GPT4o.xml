      <p>Your letter, written on the 11th of this month, was very pleasing to me, as I wished to be informed about your health and wondered why you did not respond to those which my servant had left for you. You inquire from the host in Säckingen, to whom you entrusted the letters, which you write you handed over to him, when they were not delivered to me, as you yourself could have inferred from many arguments. However, as soon as I learn whether your republic's delegation has gone to France and whether you wish me to send the letters you desired to you or directly to the king's court by courier horses, I will accomplish this without any delay, and if I can do anything else for you or your friends, I will most gladly do so and I believe that you and those delegates will recognize that my recommendation was of some importance. I will do as you advised me. So far, we have understood everything about the king's affairs in Italy, Piedmont, and Picardy to be according to the king's wishes and favorable. May the Lord turn everything to the glory of His name. I commend you to His grace and pray again and again that you, as you do, love us.</p>
      <p>Yours, if his own, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>May the consuls and all friends be well.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed pastor and colleague of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
