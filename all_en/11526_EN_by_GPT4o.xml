    <p xml:id="regest1">Transmits to Bullinger Bucer's German letter [BucerDS VIII, No. 9f, cf. No. 1474], along with the request to return it after marking any potentially offensive passages. He is convinced that the papist understanding of the Eucharist, from which even the Lutherans do not seem to have completely freed themselves, is at the root of all errors and actually forms the foundation of the papacy; he cannot imagine, with the best will, that the Apostles understood the Lord's Supper in this way. A merchant from Lindau has offered to advocate for [Rudolf] Schinz.</p>

      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord through Christ. I have thus far delayed sending Bucer's German letter to you, esteemed Bullinger, for no other reason than that I considered this messenger more suitable for this task; for just as the unlearned are ignorant of letters, so they neglect and poorly preserve them. Therefore, use it to your satisfaction, and afterwards, having noted those things which displease you in it, and which you find contrary to the Holy Scriptures and orthodox faith, kindly return it, having illuminated them for my necessity. For I am fully convinced that the papist idolatry of the Eucharist, from which I see the Lutherans are not yet free, is the beginning of all errors and the foundation and head of the entire papacy. Indeed, I cannot sufficiently marvel, if the apostles at the supper believed they were receiving Christ whole in the manner they teach, how it happened that they later doubted the resurrection, when they so easily accepted what is most difficult, and so hesitantly what is easier to believe. Farewell and kindly consider my simplicity, and if you have anything worthy of knowing, write back. From the court of Rhaetia, the fifth day before the Kalends of April, 1541. I hope that Schinz's affairs will finally turn out well; a merchant from Lindau has promised to free him from harm.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent preacher of the word of God among the people of Zurich, his lord and primary friend.</p>
