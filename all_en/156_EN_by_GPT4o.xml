      <p>Grace, peace, and all good from God through Christ. Your letter has reached me well. I thank you heartily for your Christian intentions; I have always been and still am inclined to do so as much as the Lord enlightens and strengthens me, for which you earnestly and faithfully help us pray. There will be no lack of preachers among us, but rather of hearts to follow; we do not know what God will give. Flesh is and remains flesh and weak; when it comes to danger, many look back, desiring to flee the nearest death, regardless of the fact that it would be even worse afterwards and one comes from the rain into the snow. May Almighty God be merciful to us, that we do not bring shame upon our reputation in His gospel through our unbelieving apostasy. When I often consider the minds of the people with me more diligently, I am affected in various ways and can determine nothing certain about the future outcome of our affairs; sometimes I hope, sometimes I fear, yet I do not despair; for Christ alone is the one who can save here and happily resolve these most difficult dangers.</p>
      <p>I assume my letters have been delivered to you and I doubt whether you have written to me after the last ones you sent, especially since you mention the oath. It is well that this matter has been beautifully agreed upon between us in this way.</p>
      <p>Schertel now has ten captains who accept service with the king; they worry badly that he will fall into disaster, especially if it should be against England.</p>
      <p>God have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Bucer is suspected and publicly criticized because of the Interim, especially in St. Gallen, which, however, happens with falsehood. He has given such an honest, Christian counsel to the two electors in Augsburg regarding the Interim that neither you nor anyone else could scold or blame it, and all the pious have taken pleasure in it. He is greatly troubled and distressed on account of Philipp, and also writes that Philipp is greatly burdened by it, that his thoughts have come up so far; for it has happened adventurously and with strange herbs, that the good man was overwhelmed. May God make it good again and restore it! Bucer writes to me so Christianly about the Interim that I could not improve it. Furthermore, there is a wonderful agreement and constancy among the rest. We have also seen Brentius's counsel, which he gave to his people in this cause, and with all our hearts we praised our Father in heaven. The people of Reutlingen, etc., responded to their people with the same dexterity of mind and Christian candor. The consultation of the Württembergers is also considered not to displease any good person; I expect the judgment of Musculus and his people daily and do not doubt that it will be solid and worthy of such Christian hearts.</p>
      <p>Pray for us. Indeed, nowhere else but from the one ruler of heaven and earth does any counsel or help shine upon us, although He rightly ought to be for us in place of many thousands. All of ours greet you; may your household greet you with all brothers and friends. June 13, 1548.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his greatest friend. Zürich.</p>
