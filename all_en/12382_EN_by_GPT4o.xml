    <p xml:id="regest1">The opinion of Luther, Melanchthon, and [Johannes] Bugenhagen contains no new considerations regarding alliances. It merely advocates for the extension of the Schmalkaldic League. If possible, Blarer will forward it to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding the [Second Regensburg Religious Colloquy], it is only heard that none of the opponents, except for the Cologne monk [Eberhard Billick], have arrived yet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Blarer is very pleased that he, too, has received good testimonials about Haller from significant people. He does not doubt that Christ will bless Haller's activities [in Augsburg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Nothing has been heard [in Konstanz] about a writing by Luther [against the Zurichers]. Luther's writing [“Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum”] is characteristic of its author.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger's communications about [Konrad Hofherr and Jakob Metzler] clearly testify to his concern for [Konstanz]. [Bartholomäus] Metzler wrote to his son [Jakob] a few days ago, instructing him to apologize to the schoolmaster [Johann Jakob Ammann] and promise obedience. Bullinger should report when this has happened. Metzler's behavior, whose arrogance was already known [to the people of Konstanz], should not go unrebuked.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Blarer sends back the table of contents of Bullinger's writing “De sacramentis” and hopes to be able to read it soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, Theodor [Bibliander], and [Konrad] Pellikan. [Konrad] Zwick sends his regards. The brother [Thomas Blarer] has not yet returned [from the Schmalkaldic Diet in Frankfurt].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Enclosure:] [Thomas Blarer] reports in a letter to [Ambrosius Blarer] that [Elector Friedrich II.] of the Palatinate has fully aligned himself with the [evangelical] side. He and Philip of Hesse are to meet on January 27 [at the Frankfurt Diet]. The envoys (including Thomas Blarer) will wait for this meeting, especially since the negotiations have not yet progressed sufficiently. - Many things are dragging on. However, regarding [Hermann von Wied] and [Friedrich II.], Thomas Blarer is very pleased; the religious matters were handled with wisdom. Having to wait for [Friedrich II.] and [Philip] of Hesse is not a problem, as the presence of both princes will certainly lead to good decisions. The great piety of [Philip] is also confirmed by Thomas Blarer's friend Mathias Limberger. - Hungarians have arrived in Wittenberg from the territories recently conquered by [Suleiman I.]. They asked for preachers, as the Turks allow them to proclaim the Gospel. - Thomas Blarer has sent the writing by Luther addressed to Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and to Landgrave [Philip], printed in 1545, about the [captured Duke Heinrich] of Brunswick. Bullinger will likely have already seen this.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our solid salvation in Christ, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger. The advice of Philipp [Melanchthon], Luther, and Pomeranus [Johannes Bugenhagen] contains nothing beyond what has already been said and written to you about alliances, and it only speaks of extending the Schmalkaldic League. I will send it, however, if I can in any way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We have received nothing about the colloquy, except that the opponents have not yet arrived in Regensburg, except for the monk from Cologne.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am exceedingly pleased about Haller, as he has brought to me such great testimonials from so many significant people, and I do not doubt that Christ will bless his ministry well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The book by Luther, which you mention, we have not only not received here, but we have not even heard that it was ever written or printed by anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We have seen the propositions against the Louvain theologians, and they are such that no one can easily fail to recognize them as Luther's.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6">
      <p>What you write about our young men is clearly a strong argument for me that you care for our matters in good faith and diligently, as in all other things; for this reason, you bind us to you more and more. Mezler's father wrote to his son a few days ago, sharply rebuking him and ordering him to approach the schoolmaster, ask for forgiveness for his obstinacy, submit to the yoke as soon as possible, and solemnly promise to be obedient in the future. Please write to me diligently whether he has done this. We certainly do not want you to conceal anything for our sake, nor that the example of our people should hinder other wise students. We have also detected the arrogance of this young man here, which we wish to be completely uprooted, and here we earnestly implore your duty, knowing well how even slight indulgence can ruin such manners.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I send back the main chapters of the book "De sacramentis," and I beseech you greatly to send it to us to read when it is convenient. Pray for us, my Bullinger, and for our church, that we may prove ourselves to Christ in these disturbances of all things in every way and consistently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Greet your household. Commend us respectfully to your venerable ministers in the Lord, especially to our Gwalther, Theodor, Pellican, and all other friends and brothers. Our people greet you, especially cousin Zwick. My brother has not yet returned. January 27, 1546.</p>

      <p>Your A. Bl. I have just received a letter from my brother, in which he writes: "The Elector Palatine has fully aligned himself with our side, or rather more with Christ's. He will meet here with Philip, the leader of the Cators, on January 27; we will await this meeting as envoys. They request this, and it is more easily granted because the causes being handled here have not yet matured enough for our departure, so you may rightly wonder what outcome such a lengthy beginning of this argument will produce." Also, after other things: "There are many tediums here. However, the business of the Cologne and the Palatine greatly delights me, as I see it being conducted with divine goodness and wisdom. The expectation of the Palatine and Hesse is now less burdensome, as I trust their presence will be beneficial for sound advice. The piety of Hesse is evident from public arguments, and I confirm it from our Mathias Limberger, whom I have as a friend." Also, after other things: "They affirm that Hungarians have come to Wittenberg from the territory recently conquered by the Turk, who have requested pious and learned men to be appointed to the evangelical function. For they are entirely permitted to do so by the Turk." He also sent a booklet by Luther to the Elector of Saxony and the Cator about not releasing the Duke of Brunswick, which I think you have seen, as it is written to have been printed in 1545.</p>
