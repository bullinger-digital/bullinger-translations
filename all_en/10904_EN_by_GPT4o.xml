    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejects the signing of the Saxon [Augsburg] Confession, as it, like the Apology of the 10th Article proves, defends the doctrine of the Eucharist of the Roman Church in contrast to the Basel [First Helvetic] Confession; however, acknowledges the Confession of the Four Cities, as far as it corresponds entirely to the Basel Confession drawn from Scripture. Greetings. The Basel Confession is sufficient as long as no one proves an error in it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord</p>
      <p>What more is needed, my dear Myconius? No one will force me to make any other confession than the one we confessed in Basel, Christ and the unblemished religion. Furthermore, if there are any others that agree with this, I accept them. Beyond that, there is no reason for anyone to expect my subscription. However, I cannot subscribe to the Saxon Confession, both for other reasons and because of the article on the Eucharist. Read the Apology of the 10th article, and you will see that there is as much difference between their opinion and ours as there is between black and white. We attack the opinion of the Roman Church; they confess it. For they use these words among others: "And we have found that not only the Roman Church affirms the corporal presence of Christ, but that the Greek Church now feels the same and has always felt the same, as the canon of the mass among the Greeks testifies." And shortly after: "The imperial majesty does not disapprove of this article; but so that those who read these things may see more clearly, we defend the opinion received in the whole church, that in the Lord's Supper the body and blood of Christ are truly and substantially present and are truly exhibited with these things that are seen, bread and wine." These are from the Apology of the 10th article. Let anyone subscribe to these if they wish. For I wholeheartedly deny the opinion of the Roman Church on the Eucharist and the presence of Christ.</p>
      <p>You command that I speak freely what I think. I have spoken, I believe, quite freely. I will not subscribe. I have subscribed to the Basel Confession because it is entirely drawn from the scriptures and is supported by the scriptures. I accept the Confession of the Four Cities because it is not opposed to ours, and as far as it agrees with ours, that is, with scripture. I cannot accept the Saxon Confession. Behold, I have reported the same thing to you, if I am not mistaken, for the third time. And I testify before the Lord that I cannot judge, think, or confess otherwise. In the meantime, I do not wish to be obstinate, but I will by no means abandon the simple and pure truth as it is set forth.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with the most beloved and much revered Mr. Grynaeus</p>
      <p>Indeed, if we have consistently asserted that we will profess our confession alone and accept and tolerate whatever is not opposed to it, no one will have anything with which to press us, unless they first prove our confession to be in error. In the meantime, we are prepared to give an account to anyone who asks for the reason for the faith that is in us.</p>
      <p>Farewell again</p>
      <p>July 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of Basel, dearest colleague.</p>
