      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>A certain Ulrich Chelius, a truly pious and learned man, is coming to you, carrying certain responses about religion to the French, which he might perhaps give you to read, from which, however, you will understand well enough what the matter is. He also offered them to me to read, but I did not want to confirm anything with my approval. For I do not approve of these plans, and it is possible that these are being conducted by the cunning of the Pope without the knowledge of the pious. Therefore, it pains me that anything is attributed to the authority of the Pope, whose mind we are not ignorant of. Yes, if God were to use the Pope as a means for the well-being of the Church of Christ, then God would be half changed (altered), not to mention that the plans of Bucer and Philipp [Melanchthon] in this matter seem to me to be very dangerous. If only I could have spoken with you for an hour! But it is not possible to add anything by letters. These plans are not approved by my brother [Konrad] or by Thomas [Blarer]. See to it that you do not say anything to anyone about these my letters. However, I wanted you to know what I have replied to the good man.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
