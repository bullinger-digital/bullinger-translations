    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Bullinger did not send him any news about the fair, he considers reports about what the French [King Francis I] is said to have done to some Swiss Confederates to be mere rumors. He does not dare to write about what happened to Oporin [in connection with the printing of the Quran]; Myconius, through his clear partisanship for Theodor [Bibliander], has harmed both himself and the cause; if the imperial privilege is granted, the [confiscated] Quran should be released. In France, there is fear of the arrival of [Turkish] troops, to whom King [Francis I] is said to have promised a port; given the close alliance of the Swiss Confederates with the pro-Turkish king, knowledge of the Quran might soon be necessary. If the king continues to be so successful, he may have already conquered all of Luxembourg. Myconius, together with Markus [Bertschi], is still striving for alms for those recommended by Bullinger. The Swiss Confederate troops are being treated so poorly by their captains that mutiny is threatening. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander]; he hopes that he will hold back [in the conflict over the Quran].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I expected some news at this fair, especially since rumors are flying that the French have inflicted some great harm on the Swiss Confederates. Indeed, I am not inclined to believe just anything. But since you are silent, I allow the rumors to be what they are.</p>
      <p>You must have learned about Oporin's misfortune from others; for we do not even dare to open our mouths. And there is no doubt, even if you have understood through others what has happened, that after it has been known, some will suspect me, as if I had betrayed it. I had said in a common conversation, indeed a consultation, so that my words might have greater weight or they might order me to leave: "Indeed, I am for Theodor, and Theodor is mine; yet I will speak the truth, however you may judge me." It would be long to tell what harm these words have brought to me and the matter. But whatever it is, I endure and overcome through the Lord as I have many other things until now. We await the imperial privilege, which if granted, the Quran will be released.</p>
      <p>It is announced from Bern that 50,000 Greek soldiers have been granted a port by the king, and the people of Marseille fear that they might come to them as well; if that happens, it will be as if it happened to them as it did to the Hungarians. A noble German who serves in the king's court told this among the Bernese. Since our homeland has absorbed French customs from a long alliance with the French, what do you think will happen if the French alliance with the Turk lasts a little longer? Would there then be a need for knowledge of the Mohammedan law?</p>
      <p>If the French have used fortune up to this point as from the beginning, it is no wonder if now at last they have gained the whole Duchy of Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Up to this day, Markus and I are working on collecting alms for those you recommended. This is our authority among etc.</p>
      <p>The soldiers are so complaining about the captains who lead the Swiss Confederate armies that many threaten mutiny if the opportunity arises. I have never heard it like this, they steal, plunder, deceive, and meanwhile the soldiers are hungry. I wonder what plan our lord has conceived for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Theodor diligently and bid him to be of good spirit. For there are those who fear something about his pen, but we hope for better things.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 4, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger in his Lord.</p>
