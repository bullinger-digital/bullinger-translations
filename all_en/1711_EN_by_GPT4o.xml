      <p>S. Although my gracious lords of the city of Magdeburg have always been inclined and some time ago decided to offer them an honorable support and assistance, Duke Maurice's recent dealings with the Emperor have given them many other thoughts, so that, as you well know, within a few days they, like Zurich, have decided to reject all support.</p>
      <p>However, as this happened, the bearer of this letter, Mr. Johannes Thomas Hausinger, comes again in the name of the city of Magdeburg, once again requesting help and support as before. In response, my lords, despite having previously rejected all requests, have given them 200 crowns.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a handsome contribution has also been made by certain individuals. If the aforementioned matter had not occurred, things would have turned out very differently for them here. In Basel, they have also received a similar amount. I ask that you also help to do your best with a small contribution, so that they do not remain completely dishonored. I hope it will serve much good; for he explicitly promises that the support will be used solely for the poor citizens. I wanted to inform you of this quickly, so that you know how things have gone here. Soon, God willing, I will be with you. My people send their regards to you and yours; likewise, Musculus and his household do the same. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on August 28, 1552. Bern.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
