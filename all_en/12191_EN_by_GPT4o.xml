      <p>Greetings. I give immense thanks for your letters, in which you inform me about the oath of our alliance, as well as for the booklet you gave me as a gift. It delighted me greatly. May the Lord Jesus reward you with heavenly and earthly goods for these things you bestow upon me; for this is what I ask of Him.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new, except about the persecution in the southern Netherlands, not only of the Anabaptists but also of the truly pious. I know of certain learned individuals, who are also very wealthy, who have been exiled for no other reason than that they refused to consent to the shedding of the blood of the pious. They say that Queen Maria of Hungary has now been denied a conversation with her brother for the third time because she supported an evangelical preacher for some time. A certain person from Bonn writes these days that the Emperor is trying to deter the Reformation initiated by Archbishop Hermann von Wied with prayers and threats, and adds that whoever is suspected of any remaining papism is close to danger. Not only are old and young men being burned, but women are also being buried alive.</p>
      <p>I sent through Gast the articles of a certain Schaldenecker - more foolish than they should be feared - who was burned, a seventy-year-old man, poor and the father of many children; once you have read them, please return them. For we have no other copy. A certain Menno Simons, a teacher of the Anabaptists, anxiously contends against the incarnation of the Lord, to which Johannes a Lasco, the Pole, responds. I mention this only so you can see how marvelously Satan exercises himself in his members. The same seems to be seen in that Geneva poison, of which you know. This is as much as I could explain during my leisure.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours to His glory. Basel, April 22, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
