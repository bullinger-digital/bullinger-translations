      <p>S. It was rightly done by you, my Bullinger, that you provided the opportunity to reply through this courier; for I am often forced to delay responses, even unwillingly, due to the lack of an opportunity by which letters may be delivered. It was also very pleasing that you sent us a copy of your response given to the people of Geneva, and we, in turn, gladly share ours, and may it be achieved that this plague, once noticed, is so restrained that it cannot spread to the ruin of many, nor should misguided clemency, or rather hatred towards pastors, loosen the reins on impiety. I privately conferred with a certain leading member of the senatorial order from that republic, whom I observed (unless he is pretending) to be well-disposed, and if the others act similarly, there will be no danger, nor will much effort be required. But as you know, dearest brother, that people often riot and are torn apart by opposing interests, so there is a need, besides the given advice, for serious invocation of the Lord, that He may grant His spirit and break the schemes of Satan.</p>
      <p>I received the mournful news from England with great sorrow, because the efforts of this perverse queen, joined with the endeavors of the emperor and the neighboring and related parties, will give much more severe labor and distress to many. But (as you write) by the hand of God, this statue will also be shattered, at whose touch the earth melts and the mountains smoke. We have nothing new at all; however, if we receive anything, I will not hide it from you. This is written by another's hand, as you see, because due to distillations and headaches, I spare my eyes even unwillingly. Farewell with all the pious and write how Mr. Nikolaus Zender is doing; for I had understood that he was suffering from illness. Basel, 16th October in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
