    <p xml:id="regest1">At the Lausanne Synod on May 14, Claude [d'Aliod] recanted his new Arianism; he has also since made amends before the Zurich pastors. On June 8, [Rudolf Gwalther] and Nicholas Partridge returned from England; with their three companions, there are now six English students in Zurich. They brought good news, as can also be gathered from the enclosed letter from Cranmer [No. 984]. Over 30 [northern English] insurgents, including an abbot in monastic garb, were executed, and about forty prisoners are still awaiting their punishment.</p>

      <p>On May 14th, a synod was held in Lausanne. The leading ministers of Bern and all the priests of the newly occupied territories attended. In this synod, Claude of Savoy recanted and renounced the revived Arianism. He has also come to Zurich in these days, confessed his error before the brothers, and asked for forgiveness. On June 8th, my young man from England arrived together with Mr. Nicholas Partridge, an Englishman, who had left my house in January to visit their homeland. They brought with them three more Englishmen, so there are now six young men of noble birth and wealth in Zurich, dedicated to their studies. They reported many pleasant and joyful things. However, since it was not possible to write about these matters at present, it was decided to share the letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury, from which you can understand the whole affair and how things are conducted in England. The spirit of the adversaries has completely collapsed, and more than 30 authors of sedition have been executed and hanged. Among them perished a venerable abbot, who was hanged in a black, monastic robe. About 40 barons, nobles, and prelates are held in chains, and few will escape. There will be enough blood for them, as they have always thirsted for blood, etc. Farewell.</p>
