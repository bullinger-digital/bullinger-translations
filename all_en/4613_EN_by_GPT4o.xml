      <p>Greetings. For a long time, I have not written to you, most illustrious man, and likewise, I have not received anything from you. I was glad to see your last letter dated December 27th; however, my lord and brother, what influence does my authority have in this matter, where things are so desperate that they reject any remedy? I would gladly prevent civil war with all my heart if I could, and our people do not need any restraint; for they themselves abhor it. But what can you do with those who cannot be tamed? They rage, refuse to give and receive justice, and want to eradicate the Claronese allies who demand nothing but justice and equity.</p>
      <p>Should I instruct the most honorable magistrate of our republic and the people to abandon the allies who are imploring help, or should I instruct our people to violate treaties and be indifferent if the innocent Claronese allies are oppressed? He who commands us to keep the faith we have given is alive and will vindicate. Truly, I tell you before the Lord: I have heard no one so far who does not lament our unfortunate fate and pray against war; again, if justice and fairness cannot be obtained, and they proceed to inflict violence on the good, as they threaten, there is no one who does not bear it with the utmost indignation. And what will be the end of these unprecedented injuries and insolence? But the Lord, who holds everything in His hand, knows what will happen. I teach to pray diligently for peace, I do not incite or provoke to war; but again, I do not instruct to idly watch the slaughter of the innocent. You will see, my Friedrich, this matter was not initiated because of the Claronese; your cause and ours are at stake; some want to extinguish sincere faith.</p>
      <p>May the Lord of hosts turn them to Himself or overthrow them, so that the pious may praise the Lord and live in peace! Would that we have not incited the Lord's wrath with our crimes, so that He inflicts the deserved scourge on both. Therefore, I urge and emphasize nothing more ardently than repentance and prayers.</p>
      <p>You too, pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>It was seen in these regions that the sky was burning in the morning hours of December 28th; the vision was quite horrible, especially over Lake Constance and the mountains. Take this brief writing of mine in good part; for I am weary from writing, having done nothing else all day, and I seek rest.</p>
      <p>The root of the [Pag]an councils is the Roman pontiff, who pours cold water. The Florentine is dead, the pope's right hand is cut off; perhaps he will not allow him to live long, who would gladly burst forth into the seat of pestilence. May the Lord overthrow His enemies!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Doctor Martyr, Gwalther, my sons-in-law and sons, friends and brothers greet you. May the Lord make this year a happy one, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 3, 1561. May our Johannes and your father-in-law be safe. Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Friedrich von Salis, the most honorable commissioner of Chiavenna, his most esteemed lord and dearest friend. [Chiavenna].</p>
