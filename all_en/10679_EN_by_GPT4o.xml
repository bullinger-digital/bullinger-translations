    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the books sent to him and would like to express particular gratitude for Vadian's ["Epitome"]. M端nster has fallen due to betrayal; among the few who escaped is said to be Bernd Rothmann, while Jan van Leiden and Bernd Knipperdolling are now prisoners of the bishop. Due to the war between L端beck and Duke [Christian] of Holstein, many princes and cities are said to have gathered in Copenhagen. In Cologne, the situation remains unchanged. Best wishes from Adolf [...] from Wittenberg.</p>

      <p>My friendly service, dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Know that, praise be to the Lord, I, along with my wife and friends, am in good health. The same always delights me to hear from you and yours.</p>
      <p>The books you recently sent me, I have received according to the instructions in your letter. Regarding Vadian's Compendium, had I known it was available here, I would not have burdened you with it, nor did I know it was so large. I still ask, as before: If you send me such things or similar again, let me know what I might send in return, or what it cost; I will gladly fulfill it.</p>
      <p>Dear Heinrich, I do not know of any news to write this time, except that the M端nster affair is widely spread. It was hoped that something would be published about it, which I would have sent to you. It is certain that the city was conquered through treachery; how and what exactly, I cannot write. Those who were inside have all perished, and some who escaped must keep themselves very hidden. They are tolerated nowhere. It is said that their deceiver, Bernd Rothmann, escaped and is still alive. The bishop has also captured Jan van Leiden, the new king, and Bernd Knipperdolling, the old one. What end they will meet is easy to foresee.</p>
      <p>Also, there is a great conflict now between those of L端beck and the Duke of Holstein. Many princes and cities are said to have gathered in Copenhagen for such negotiations.</p>
      <p>Our people in Cologne still behave as before. May God grant that the German nation may come to unity again in faith and ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Adolf, my related friend, lives in Wittenberg, has a wife, and is doing well. He has asked me to wish you health on his behalf.</p>
      <p>Herewith commended to the Almighty.</p>
      <p>Dated in Cologne, the second of September, year 35.</p>
      <p>Theodericus Bitter of Wipperford.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved friend, to be delivered. In Zurich. Please give this letter to Christoph Froschauer.</p>
