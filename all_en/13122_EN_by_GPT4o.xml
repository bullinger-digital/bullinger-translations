    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick expressed his fear yesterday that Bishop Johann von Weeze might be plotting against Konstanz [by working towards an escalation of the situation of Konstanz with Emperor Charles V]. For when the people of Konstanz were waiting in vain for a response to the petition addressed to Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, [for a reconciliation with the Emperor and King Ferdinand], the mandates [of the Emperor] against the city were proclaimed. Now, as they wait for a response to their reconciliation offer, they hear nothing again!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Spanish mercenaries have now reached Ravensburg. Zwick fears that they could advance to Konstanz overnight and attack the suburb of Petershausen. To thwart these hostile plans, the authorities of Konstanz should recruit auxiliary troops in good time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] However, since such troops could only be obtained from the Confederates, Zwick requests the following: Bullinger should cautiously find out whether the people of Zurich would allow the people of Konstanz to recruit the subjects of the court lords from Konstanz in Thurgau as mercenaries, or whether there might be a possibility for the people of Konstanz to recruit two to three hundred men from the Confederates at their own expense. Zwick inquires as a precaution, on his own initiative, and without the knowledge of others, not even of Ambrosius Blarer's brother Thomas, just as he did once before, when neither Bullinger nor the Zurich councilors wanted to believe him, leading to regrettable misunderstandings! If the Zurich councilors are of the opinion that Zwick's request could be granted, he would, if necessary, encourage the council of Konstanz to make such a request [to the Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] However, if the people of Zurich believe that this request has no chance and it would be better to refrain from it, Zwick would remain silent on this matter until other council members come up with the idea of making such a request [to the Confederates]. Then, in the interest of Zurich and Konstanz, he would advise against it, so that there would not have to be a refusal [from the Confederates], which would have dire consequences for both [the people of Zurich] and the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer sends this letter with his own messenger [...], for the matter is certainly important for both Zurich and Konstanz. The Spanish cavalry could easily reach Konstanz overnight, making any reconnaissance by the city impossible. And if Petershausen is occupied, Konstanz is lost! Blarer had always feared this insidious plan of the bishop. If [the attack on Konstanz] succeeds, it would suit the Emperor well. If not, he would make excuses. The absence of his response is truly very suspicious! God protect the people of Konstanz, and Bullinger should pray for them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Written at ten o'clock in the morning. Blarer has pretended to the messenger that a letter from Augsburg is to be delivered to Bullinger. The latter should decide whether the messenger should wait in Zurich or leave immediately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, my dear cousin Konrad Zwick spoke with me yesterday, expressing great concern that the bishop might be plotting treachery (betrayal) against the city. For previously, when they were waiting for a response from Granvelle, the mandates were issued. Now, as they have finally offered reconciliation and are waiting again for a decision and response, nothing comes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Since the Spaniards have now already reached Ravensburg and could come here overnight, he fears not unreasonably that they are planning an attack on Petershausen, our suburb. Therefore, he thinks it is of great importance that our lords secure reinforcements in time to thwart the enemy's plans.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, since he cannot think of where they could obtain such reinforcements other than from the Confederates, he kindly requests that you make a courteous inquiry to see if it might be possible to obtain permission for my lords to recruit either their court subjects in Thurgau to come to the city, or if they might be able to recruit one, two, or three hundred men at their own expense from you, for no other reason than to protect against an attack. And this my dear cousin does out of loyal concern and for himself, without anyone else's knowledge. This is as true as it was once before, when you or yours did not want to believe it; from which many unfortunate misunderstandings followed in some matters. But, as God lives, neither my own brother nor anyone else knows anything about it, etc. But my dear cousin would like to know, for if he thought it could be achieved or that such a request would not be against your lords' wishes, he would then advise it and bring it to the table.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, if it is thought that it cannot be achieved and that it would be better not to make such a request, he would remain silent, and if such a thing were perhaps suggested by others, he would, as much as possible, prevent it from happening. And that would be for your and our lords, so that such a request would not be made if it were to be rejected, for from the rejection would grow great displeasure, which over time might not be to the benefit of yours or ours, but rather lead to much discord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am sending you this letter with my own messenger, for certainly something is at stake for you and us in this attack. The cavalry could easily come from Ravensburg to us overnight and stop all reconnaissance. If they then take Petershausen, it will be over with us. I have always feared this treachery. I fear now it is foreseen for me that the bishop will carry out this trick. If it succeeds for him, it will be well done for the emperor. If not, the emperor will make excuses. It is truly very suspicious that no response comes to my lords. May God be our watcher, protector, and shield here and forever! To Him, along with yours, I entrust all faithfully and pray unceasingly for us.</p>

      <p>Written on the 9th of November at ten o'clock in the morning. You may hold the messenger or let him go, depending on how the matters appear to you. I have done the same with the messenger as if I had to send you a letter from Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Give my regards to Mr. Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Let me know if the Three Leagues have moved to Bellinzona.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear, trusted lord and brother.</p>
