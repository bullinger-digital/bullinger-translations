      <p> Greetings. Tomorrow morning, your son will depart for Winterthur, accompanied by the most excellent man, Mr. Johann Wolf, and equipped with my letters as well. I have written to Mayor Gysler and the ministers of the church. May what he has undertaken be fortunate and successful! I am very hopeful. But if this does not succeed, the Lord will not abandon him. With God's help, we will strive in every way to assist him, so that he may eventually have a suitable place with us. Farewell, most esteemed man, and please commend my dearest sons-in-law to you. I thank you for the benefits bestowed upon my family. In Zurich, on St. Margaret's Day around the 10th hour of the night. May your wife be safe, and may all your family be safe. 1551. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Konrad Pellikan, my esteemed and dear compatriot and brother. </p>
      <p> Baden. </p>
