      <p>On the day before the Nones of October, your letter unexpectedly reached me, most learned Heinrich, and I kissed it as if it were written by a brother. There, I say, I was able to see that the memory of an old friend has not yet been erased. Since you have greeted me first with your most sweet letter and with a not insignificant gift, and you wish for the old friendship to be restored from the heart on both sides, certainly, I thought it would be not only inhumane but also unjust to deny such a just request. I would sooner withdraw from myself than cease to remember you, my old friend, and Leonhard Wirth, whom you mentioned in your letter, with whom I had much association. Certainly, if I had heeded the advice of both, I would have pursued my studies with better prospects. Finally, the Phrygians are wise too late. That common friend of ours was so closely bound to me that I had him as a protector, but I am not certain whether he is still among the living. He was excelling in learning under Doctor Cesarius, to the point of being considered a marvel. I was continually informed about you, both by my brother Jakob, the Cologne traveler, and by the reports of scholars, while you were still at Kapell. So that the friendship remains unscathed, you command me to greet you with my letters. I am certainly blushing with shame to reveal my ignorance, especially since from an early age I have always seen you as not only complete in all respects in letters but also in the integrity of morals, besides the fact that we were engaged in the same study, namely, it was a common pursuit, we frequently visited the library among the preachers, and reading was so frequent for you that it brought much harm to your eyes, as you often complained to me as an intimate friend. Especially with Chrysostom, that golden mouth and most learned in matters of this kind and of the most orthodox faith, no one else was more diligent. You had already then provided a specimen of a great man, as testified by all. Now the world enjoys the offspring of such great talent. You not only illuminate your homeland, but indeed, without controversy, you leave a celebrated name of the pious to posterity. Your daily studies advocate for you, not to mention that that Frank from Werden recommended you to the world. Therefore, so that our friendship remains closer on both sides, I was not reluctant to write back to you - for I do not promise the writing, but I wish you to recognize the sincerity of my heart in me - I would write to you with a more extensive letter, if I were not pressed by the burden of matters due to the harvest. Moreover, the state and condition of my affairs are revealed through the messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Sebastian Locher.</p>
      <p>To the man of proven learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his old friend.</p>
