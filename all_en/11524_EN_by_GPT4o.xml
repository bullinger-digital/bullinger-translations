      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>The goldsmith, whom you recently mentioned in your letter to me, is ready to send those coins to you, which will happen shortly, as he is also about to send a mass of silver to some friend.</p>
      <p>Recently, a certain Leo from Graubünden, a minister of the Memmingen church, was with you. What he did with you, I do not know; I do know that he left the church deserted and the host unvisited, having contracted not a small amount of debt, not to mention the suspicions of adultery that some report he has fallen into. Charity demands that we admonish each other, and it is most serious to abandon churches with such scandal, especially in this age, where otherwise there is no place for the gospel.</p>
      <p>We have absolutely no news from the Imperial Diet. You know that Fabri has passed away; where he has gone will be revealed on the day of judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most sincere of friends. Greet Pellican and Leo with the other brothers diligently, especially your household.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, March 22, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, his brother.</p>
