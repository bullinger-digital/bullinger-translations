      <p>Greetings in Christ. As I wrote before, I now also acknowledge that I owe much to your fatherly providence, which through letters has ensured that as a passing stranger among many unknowns, I found great kindness. From England, nothing new has reached me except the refutation of those rumors which for several days here said that the queen had been killed; for she still persists in life and grows in impiety.</p>
      <p>I hear that some Englishmen have come to you in Zürich with the very pious man Richard Chamber, and I truly regret that they reached you sooner than my letters reached them. For Richard Chamber is the one who diligently expends himself and all he has to assist the safety of ministers in this persecution. While my pilgrimage should have lessened his labors, the vain expectation of my letters added even more worries and labors to him. But Christ, through whom all things work together for good to those who love God, will turn this also into the honor of God and the consolation of those who sincerely seek the glory of Christ. Therefore, I hope that the opportunity to show your kindness to Christian men, faithful ministers, and miserable exiles has not been unwelcome to God, nor will the contemplation of your church, which worships God most holy and sincerely, be useless to them. Please ensure that the letters addressed to that Richard Chamber, the Englishman, are delivered quickly.</p>
      <p>Please, do not forget me in your prayers to God. As with others, so also Master Calvin has been more inclined towards me for your sake, from which you understand that I now owe many things to many people because of you.</p>
      <p>What I can do, I will always do, namely, I will invoke God to keep you for a long time for the benefit of His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Geneva, April 23.</p>
      <p>Your devoted son in Christ, Thomas Lever.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, faithful and pious pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
