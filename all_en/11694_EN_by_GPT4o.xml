      <p>Greetings. The reason I write to you less frequently is because of Ambrosius' letters; for he now also fulfills the duty of writing on my behalf, and he can satisfy you both abundantly and elegantly. Therefore, interpret my silence favorably, as it arises from neither disdain nor any forgetfulness of you; for in my eyes, you are always as dear as the most beloved.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give my most earnest greetings to your wife and the entire household in my name. I cannot in any way express how much the death of Leo afflicts me. May the Lord comfort us.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 9th of August, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, administrator of the church in Zürich, his most beloved brother in the Lord. In Zürich.</p>
