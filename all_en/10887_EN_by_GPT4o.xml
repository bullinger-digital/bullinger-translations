    <p xml:id="regest1">They are very grateful that the people of Zurich sent them Erasmus Schmid for the renewal of their church, because he not only preached with great success, but also fully met their wishes in terms of scholarship and integrity; since the goal, namely the reform according to the model of the Zurich church, has not yet been achieved and since they can only continue to fend off the numerous opponents of reform with Schmid's help, they urgently request to keep him with them. Blessings.</p>

      <p>To the brothers who proclaim the Gospel of Christ in Z端rich, the ministers of the word in the Duchy of W端rttemberg among the Alsatians wish grace and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>In recent days, indeed, venerable and esteemed brothers, we have written to you humbly and also supplicatingly, asking and imploring that one of these men, who have so far been engaged with you in the ministry of the word of God, be sent to us for some time, whose learning, integrity, and gravity would not only make us more learned and better, but also whose teaching and authority would remove and eradicate offenses, blasphemies, the most corrupt morals of the papists, and anything contrary to the divine word from among us, and that new things conducive to the glory of God and the benefit of our neighbor would succeed in their place and be erected and edified in the minds of the pious. And in this, we have experienced your love and benefit towards us not as something common, but indeed (by the grace of the Most High) we experience it more and more every day, since you have sent us, beyond all merit, Erasmus Schmid, a man most learned in theology and in every other respect (for so he is considered by the votes and opinions of all of us), who not only presents the good things that Jesus Christ delivered with confidence to the people, so that his sermons are attended from all directions with full roads, for he is accustomed to deliver them with admiration and benefit to all, but also beyond this, his innocence of life, integrity of morals, in all things responds in such a way that nothing of virtues and knowledge can be desired in him. Therefore, he is rightly to be revered and esteemed by us as a divine being, and to you, through whose zeal and effort such an Erasmus has come to us, eternal thanks are to be given, and we are giving them now and will never cease to give them, not those, however, which we owe, but those which we can now, meanwhile always promising that you will find us most ready and eager in any of your matters. However, since our situation (we consider it the cause of the Christian religion) has not yet reached the point where we can be deprived of Erasmus's comfort and presence without great detriment to our church, what could be more sorrowful, indeed more pernicious (than to lose him) could ever happen to us, partly because not all are yet reformed with us and restored to the form of your church; and yet there is still hope for reformation. Furthermore, because we still have many adversaries of the word from all sides who do not cease daily to undermine the minds of the simple and to cause us hateful troubles, against whom we can indeed more easily oppose and close their slanderous mouths if Erasmus stands on our side; some have not been unhappily closed so far. For these reasons (dearest brothers), we ask, pray, beseech, and implore you to embrace us with the same benevolence with which you have embraced us so far, by again applying all diligence so that we are not deprived of Erasmus's company and presence. We assure ourselves that you will do this (for it would seem impious to us to refuse such an honorable request), and in this, know for certain that you will be doing the most pleasing thing not only for us as ministers of the word but also for the sheep entrusted to his care.</p>
      <p>May the most good and great God increase His spiritual gifts in you and preserve you safe and flourishing for a long time for the aid of the Christian cause. Farewell, ornaments and pillars of literature and the Christian religion, and pray for our church; we also will pray for yours.</p>
      <p>Given from Riquewihr, on the sixteenth day of June in the thirty-sixth year.</p>
      <p>By us, the ministers of the word in the Duchy of W端rttemberg among</p>
      <p>the Alsatians, most devoted and zealous of your religion.</p>
      <p>To all the faithful and vigilant preachers of the word of God in Christ in Z端rich, most observant.</p>
