      <p> Greetings. I received your letter, reverend father in Christ, dated May 15th, along with the memoranda on Mark on the last day of May, delivered by Mr. Consul Wytembach, returning from Bern, for which I give you my greatest thanks; for I was somewhat afraid that I might be too much of a nuisance to you, who are otherwise occupied with greater matters. Consul Wytembach reported to me that the Bernese, by a public decree of the senate and people, have concluded an agreement with the Savoyard entirely according to the conditions proposed last year by the Swiss envoys at Baden and Basel, and that they will return to him within 10 weeks the four prefectures of Ripaille, Thonon, Terny, and Gee. I hope there is no deceit involved; they seem to be acting well; but trust is rare among princes. </p>
      <p> The Spaniard, in the name of the Savoyard, seals letters with a large authentic seal. However, there is a rumor that the Spaniard has died; if this were true, it would cause a great change and upheaval in all matters, and there is a fear that by imitating his father, he might die more often. But may God, the best and greatest, see to this, to whom in such great dangers of all things, everything must be entrusted. I will make an effort to return your items to you diligently by the appointed time. On May 29th, when the previous matters were confirmed, all the prefects of the provinces were present in Bern along with the envoys of the Savoyard and the city of Geneva; but perhaps others will write to you about these matters with more certainty and at greater length. I had to hurry because of the unexpected departure of the courier. </p>
      <p> May God, the best and greatest, bless you and all yours, and keep you safe for us for a long time to the glory of His name and the benefit of the church. Consul Wytembach, the chief scribe of our city, my fellow ministers, indeed all good people, greet you and all yours very much, and wish you all the best. Please convey my many greetings to Simler, Lavater, Zwingli, your sons, my most esteemed lords. Farewell, most excellent father and reverend lord. </p>
      <p> In Biel/Bienne, June 1st, hastily, in the year 1567. </p>
      <p> Yours entirely, Josua Finsler, of Zurich. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and father. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger at the Grossm√ºnster, Zurich. </p>
