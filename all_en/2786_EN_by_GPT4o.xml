      <p>Greetings. Dearest compater in the Lord, Franciscus Lysmaninus passed through us on his return, as he promised. I pray to the Lord to exterminate the Antichrist from all of Poland; much work still lies ahead for the brothers who serve the kingdom of Christ there, not only from the papists but also from false brothers born to sow discord. Therefore, we must pray for them unceasingly. I gave some note about the oath, written by Haller, without much thought that it would fall into your hands.</p>
      <p>But blessed be the Lord, who, in His providence, has suspended this temptation, to which not a few good men have almost surrendered. In the future, it will be fitting to show more spirit in such temptations. My duties progress slowly; for I read in them only once a week, indeed I am compelled to dictate. I never thought of writing on the Apocalypse; therefore, there is nothing about this matter, from which I do not know where you received it.</p>
      <p>Regarding the peace of the imperial states, it has been written to me: Those who are wise should not give it too much. We are grateful to you for the gift sent to our little Heinrich. May the Lord grant that, when he becomes a groom in good health, you may come to his wedding.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest compater. Today, a greater council was held because of the Genevans regarding the renewal of the alliance; but nothing is accomplished, unless it deceives; for they do not want to yield in the matter, about which our people do not even allow a word to be spoken.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your household in my name and in the name of mine. When you write to Leto, please convey my greetings to him in my name. Bern, December 15, 1555.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
