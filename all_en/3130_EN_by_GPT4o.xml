      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>Revered, highly learned lord, gracious lord and teacher, I inform you that about half a year ago, through Memmingen, your letter along with a small treatise of your Apologetic Exposition reached me. The reason I have not written back to you until now is that I have been waiting for some letters from the Windic lands, from which I hoped to learn various news about religion and the Turks, and I wanted to send and share these with you. However, the mentioned letters, which were sent out in June, July, August, and September, were held up for me in Innsbruck by a chancery clerk until last December. The summary of these letters was that His Roman Imperial Majesty had revoked and annulled the previous orders against the Lutherans, so that Christians in His Majesty's hereditary lands need not fear danger or imprisonment at this time. However, His Majesty does not allow any changes in their churches. Last summer, the Windic and Croatian people defeated the Turks several times, but many good people and nobles perished. They fear that they have angered the Turkish emperor and that he will turn with all his might against the Croatian and Windic lands, and not against Austria, in the coming summer. May God thwart his plans, amen. The envoys of the Lower Austrian lands, among which are also the Windic lands, are now again strongly petitioning His Roman Imperial Majesty in Regensburg to allow them to preach the Gospel purely and to use the sacraments according to Christ's institution; I do not yet know what decision they have received or will receive. Yesterday, the resolution of the current Imperial Diet in Regensburg was supposed to be published and read. May God grant that something good is included in it, etc.</p>
      <p>I thank you most sincerely for humbling yourself to write to me and for sending me the aforementioned booklet, which I have read through and had bound together with Melanchthon's Commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, which he published in the year 1556; I find it pleasing and valuable, and as far as I can judge, I can find nothing wrong or heretical in it. And I cannot conceal from you that since I have been here, it has come to my attention that some in Ravensburg and Memmingen have claimed that I publicly condemned and called all Zwinglians heretics from the pulpit here, and if this rumor has reached you or the other ministers of the Helvetic churches, you should by no means believe it and excuse me. For I have neither in the Windic lands nor in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, much less here, neither from the pulpit nor in private conversations, thought or spoken of such things. No person from Kempten will be able to truthfully say this about me.</p>
      <p>When I first came here four years ago and soon learned from some how the few preachers here were almost all constantly at odds with each other over the sacrament, and when the time came that we had to hold the Lord's Supper, I gave three sermons in succession on the sacraments, and when I had to speak about the substance of the sacrament and explain it to both parties, I made an exclamation against the devil, who had caused such discord and disunity over this article in the Christian churches to the great hindrance of the Gospel's progress, and among other things, I said, what use are such high disputes about the real, corporal, substantial, and spiritual presence of the body of Christ to the godly simple Christians, since both parties, the Zwinglians and the Lutherans, acknowledge that they are not mere signs, but that in the Supper the body of Christ and his blood are truly distributed to the Christians. We should and will leave it at that, and I cited Augustine's dictum that the sacraments should not be subjected to verbal argumentation, but to faith. Christ consecrated the bread in his supper to be his body and the wine to be his blood; we want to believe his words simply and not dispute further about it. It is a mystery. I have spoken on this opinion wherever I have preached for 27 years, and thank God, there has been no displeasure or disagreement with me in my sermons on the sacrament or other articles, as far as I have understood, neither from Zwinglians nor Lutherans. But with the Schwenckfeldians, I have by no means been able to agree, nor they with me. They have my colleague, a neophyte, a young short man, with a stubborn little head, like your Grebel, Denck, Hetzer, Balthasar Hubmaier, that Vadianus writes about them, he cannot be dissuaded from the Schwenckfeldian error. I have given him Vadianus', Specker's, Illyricus', Gallus', Georg Major's, your Zurich preachers' writings against Schwenckfeld and your preface over the book Summa of Christian religion and asked him to read them, but it does not help him at all; he says that Vadianus, when he wanted to die, had a great temptation because of the book; it greatly regretted him that he had written against the man of God, Schwenckfeld. Your Tigurines are only philosophers and not theologians; Luther himself is against him in many matters. In short: since he has been dismissed from service (he will have to leave the service at Easter, but his followers want to keep him and have obtained from a council here that he is allowed to stay, the longer he stays, the more noticeable he becomes at the pulpit). I give him good advice again; but it is all lost on him. Tomorrow I will have to speak against him more clearly. And this man was brought to us here by Mr. Bartholomew from Memmingen, who defends him and justifies his matters. From this, I gather that Bartholomew, the preacher from Memmingen, also hardly lacks that Schwenckfeldian stain. I wanted to complain and write this to you in a hurry at this good Mr. Bonet's place, and I ask you most earnestly to accept and understand this simple letter of mine in good faith.</p>
      <p>I do not willingly write to you and such learned men in Latin unless compelled by necessity, as I am always forced to write in Latin to Mr. Vergerio, since he does not understand the German language; for I fear that in writing in Latin, I might commit some solecism and offend against Priscian. The rest, namely about my situation and how I have translated half of the New Testament into the Slavic language, which I will have printed after the Easter holidays, and other matters, you will learn from the bearer of this letter. Furthermore, I ask your piety to faithfully commend me to your fellow ministers, colleagues, and brothers, especially to Mr. Bernhard of Siena, and tell him that the Italian translation, which was recently made by an Italian in Geneva, pleases me greatly and helps me much in my Slavic version; I understand it as well as the German or Latin; for in Trieste, I was educated from a young age by Bishop Peter Bonomo, a poet and a very pious man. He was a great supporter of Brother Julius, Moncatus, and all the pious preachers in Italy and supported them at his own expense. There in Trieste, I learned the Italian language, although I now speak it with difficulty; yet when I read or hear it, I understand it very easily. With this, I commend myself to your excellence.</p>
      <p>From Kempten, March 13, in the year 1557. Most devoted to your reverend lordship, Primus Truber, pastor there.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, etc., his lord and teacher, always to be reverently observed. In Zurich.</p>
