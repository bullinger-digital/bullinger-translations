    <p xml:id="regest1">The resurrection of Jesus signifies justification and hope for humanity on Judgment Day and is a demonstration of life, which no one has previously presented as concisely and brilliantly as Bullinger in his appendix to the Matthew commentary. Erb could envision a German translation of this from page 267 onwards. This should first be preceded by a partial Latin print in a handy, portable form, with the title indicating that it is an extract from the large commentary. However, Erb would not dare to do all this without Bullinger's consent. Greetings, especially from Nikolaus Regius. [Konrad] Pellikan, whom Erb met in Rouffach, may have already informed Bullinger about the state of the church [in Riquewihr].</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Since the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is not only our justification but also a certain hope and example of the resurrection of all mortals on the last day, and no less the glorious ascension is a certain demonstration of the way by which the elect must go to the stars, and no one, in my judgment, has written about these matters more succinctly and clearly than you, as an appendix in the Commentaries on Matthew, I have often wished that these would be read by all, indeed held in memory. To this end, I thought it would not be unfruitful if they were translated into the German language in a familiar phrase. To achieve this, I often considered committing the Latin to a printer to be printed in a smaller, as they say, format, so that it might more easily serve as a handbook for those truly devoted to piety and awaiting the coming of the Son of God, so that it could be stored in the palm or carried around in purses and bags. Furthermore, it should begin on page 267 and in such or another way: "Since nothing has been handed down by the evangelists, the writers of those things which the eternally kind God the Father promised in the Son, and finally by all the apostles, more laboriously and diligently than the resurrection of Christ, we too will discuss somewhat more extensively about it, with the Spirit of Christ encouraging us" etc. In the title and frontispiece of the booklet, mention should be made that it is not a new booklet, but extracted from the large Commentaries on Matthew etc., so that the buyer is not deceived. But why should a pig teach Minerva? But I do not dare nor is it indeed allowed; for I myself judge it to be the worst kind of thief and forger, who alters or rather mutilates the works of others without the author's consent, especially those which have been achieved with great labor and vigilance. Therefore, it will be yours, if it serves the benefit of the church, to publish it etc. It does not matter what pleases me, but what pleases the learned and holy.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and fellow students by name. All of ours greet you, especially Nikolaus Regius etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, Riquewihr, August 14.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>You may have learned from [Konrad] Pellikan about the state of our church, for I recently met him among his people in Rouffach. Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his patron.</p>
