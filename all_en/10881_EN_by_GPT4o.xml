    <p xml:id="regest1">Mentions as the reason for his silence once again his concern about the threat to the Gospel in connection with the Concord negotiations, the council plans, and the war between the French [King Francis I] and Emperor [Charles V]. Has no news from the [Eisenach or Wittenberg] convent. A French nobleman has learned that the meeting [of the Oberl√§nder] with Luther was moved [to Wittenberg] due to his illness; [Eberhard Rogge], a confidant of Melanchthon, only heard about the meeting in Nuremberg. While the Saxons remain silent, the Swabians publicly polemicize against the fanatics. Kaspar [Megander] has simultaneously complained to Bullinger about the lack of letters; the bearer of his letter reported on the rejection of the Gospel by the Valaisans, their rapprochement with the Duke [of Savoy], and the harsh punishment of a violator of the fast. The Bernese are trying to prevent their subjects from entering French military service and only allow the passage of foreign mercenaries under conditions. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You are and will remain a friend, as far as I am concerned, as long as I live. Let these words serve as an oath. As for why I write less frequently at this time, I explained the reason in my last letter. The memory of that Concord makes me feel a certain way that I cannot quite describe. I sense a change that I am unable to express. The same goes for the thought of the council, which many learned men urge, and all the papists truly desire. What they hope for, I do not see. For even if the Gospel remains, it will not be pure if concord is established in common. Otherwise, there is no need for a council. I remain silent on the fact that I do not see a greater contention (unless a firm and solid concord is made between us and the Lutherans) than among the professors of the Gospel. Therefore, whatever is to come will be a mockery and eradication of the Gospel. For this reason, the war that is now ongoing also troubles me. For wherever I turn my eyes, I see what terrifies. The Frenchman has been bloodthirsty for many years, the Emperor is a poor Christian, bitter and ambitious. So, whichever way victory leans, I foresee future misery. These things render me, I do not say anxious, but rather languid, so that I almost grow weary of living. Yet God meanwhile sustains me strongly, so that in Him I may be of the strongest and most fearless spirit, while the weakness of the flesh is thus troubled.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we hear not a word about the convent. However, in these days, as I was setting out for our synod, I happened to meet a certain French nobleman. He said that it was written to him that Luther had fallen ill with some unknown disease on the eve of the meeting, and therefore the others were compelled to go to him. Then, in these days, there was here a certain disciple of Melanchthon, who had been with him for fourteen years; he says he knows nothing about the convent until he came to Nuremberg. Consider what this Saxon silence means. Although in the meantime it is certain among the Swabians that there is anything but silence; they so impudently proclaim publicly that the fanatics have defected from their opinion.</p>
      <p>At the same moment, miraculously, your letters and those of our Kaspar are delivered. He complains equally about my letters as you do, as I write almost nothing. The young man who brought them, very learned, came straight from Valais. He reports not wonders, but astonishing things: The Valaisans reject the Gospel as much as they desire earthly things. There are good and intelligent men there, but they are overwhelmed by the benefits and offices of the bishop, so that Christ is suffocated. They have agreed among themselves and with the Duke, if he wishes to return the expenses; for they say they have occupied a small piece of land, lest the Bernese be forced to have neighbors. Hear one thing that happened: Three of them ate a capon during Lent.</p>
      <p>And when the matter became public, the murmuring warned two to leave; the third was captured and sent to the bishop. After hearing the case, he punished him with imprisonment and a fine. He finally returned to his people, thinking he had atoned for the crime. And behold, the peasants capture him again, throw him into prison, and on Sunday, half-naked and carrying a light with a rod in one hand and a piece of raw meat in the other, they lead him around before the cross, as is the custom with papists, forcing him to ask for forgiveness from the church. This is the Gospel to be hoped for from them, and the honesty demonstrated by the recent act.</p>
      <p>It remains: The Bernese equally take care that no one goes to the French, and others passing through militarily are forced to carry banners.</p>
      <p>I await the Lord. Farewell with Utinger and Lavater, to whom I always wish the best.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 9, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, brother in his Lord.</p>
