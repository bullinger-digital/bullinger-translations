      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I too wish that this dispute could be removed from the midst of the church. But what can you do with opponents who speak endlessly and without restraint, and who say things that must be refuted for the sake of our churches and those who are misled by the writings of our adversaries, unless you want to appear to abandon the truth and be unmoved by the dangers to the church? I know that good men abhor these contentious writings and that among your people there are those who hate them. But you will excuse me to them. I sent many copies of my booklet for no other reason than that I had previously sent others, fearing that I might not please them enough. I pray to the Lord to give you a successor to Aretios who is pious, piously learned, modest, peace-loving, and who wishes and is able to teach what is useful. I would not think of seeking another after Blasius Marquard. He is known to all of you, he is yours, he is diligent and pious. Dr. Erastus is a great man, and I do not know if today either Germany or France has his equal. But if you call him away from the place where he is now by God's calling, you will cause great sorrow to the good, immense joy to the wicked, and you will pluck out another eye from the school and church of Heidelberg. I would indeed wish him to be with us and I am certain that his presence would be an honor and most useful to all of Switzerland; but much must be considered here. Perhaps he would not be denied to you as Ursinus was. The excommunicators would strive with all their might to have him granted here, indeed even expelled. However, I prescribe nothing to you here. Go where the Lord our God leads you. Farewell forever with your whole household.</p>
