      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Revered and gracious Lord Bullinger, my willing service is always at your disposal. If you and yours are in good health, I would be very glad to hear it. As for myself, I give praise and thanks to God the Lord, who may continue to share His grace with us. The reason I have not written to you for some time is that I have been burdened with several affairs. However, since my good friend Christoph Tretius has come here and visited me, also indicating that he intends to travel to you, I did not want to neglect writing to you.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I have received your letter dated March 14th along with your work on Isaiah with special thanks, hoping it will be read with particular benefit in Christendom.</p>
      <p>Further, you will have already heard that your cousin, the Hedinger, has received his money here; if I could do him any good on your behalf, it shall not lack on my part.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, there are indeed strange practices and conspiracies at hand, of which I am reluctant to write much, but it is well to suspect that it will affect the poor Christians. For as they write from Italy, the Pope is said to be gathering a great treasure, and the King of Spain is said to be in great armament. It is also said that there is a great provision in the Empire by the Emperor. As some suppose, it is to go over Geneva and Swiss lands, therefore a good vigilance cannot harm. You will also undoubtedly have heard by now how the war at Gotha has proceeded. Herewith I send you the castle along with the city engraved in copper, also a list of the real executions. It is to be considered that such wounds will bleed for a long time, and as they say, it will bring discord among the princes; these are all punishments for our sins. May God the Lord have mercy on us and turn His wrath away from us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Herewith I send you a small gift with the request to accept it kindly, to remember me in the best way, and to let me be commended to you and your prayers, and hereby I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated Nuremberg, May 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your willing G. S.</p>
