    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on an agreement intended to end the dispute [over the theological doctorate], and thanks Bullinger for his willingness to mediate, which is more welcome to him than that of the people of Strasbourg. Answers the questions posed by Bullinger [in No. 581] regarding the situation in M端nster, the district assembly in Worms, and the activities of the Anabaptists in Alsace; unrest also prevails in Friesland and Holland as well as among the peasants. Has not heard anything from Strasbourg for a long time.</p>

      <p>S. I would gladly speak to you about the dispute, but not to others, because the story is long and unpleasant, so I refrain, especially since a reconciliation was made by the consul with two tribunes, unknown to the senate and the people, as much as possible, with great effort, believe me, even by the other brothers, among whom I am also. I have conducted myself in such a way that I could not be counted on either side, not even by Karlstadt. I truly thank you for your promise of assistance. I prefer this to that of the people of Strasbourg. Do not doubt, if the matter were to fall through, I would never withdraw my hope from you.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you ask, take it as follows and as you ask: The rumors about the fall of M端nster and the destruction of the blockhouses remain unchanged, whether they are true or not. A day was held in Worms, that is certain. Princes and cities of great number were there. They are of one mind, that they want to help the bishops somewhat bear the war costs. In M端nster, a nobleman told me today, they fear discord, therefore the king, when he sees two or three talking together, immediately separates them. Otherwise, he comforts the people, saying their God will not abandon them.</p>
      <p>There was talk that near Rufach, 6000 gathered on St. George's Day, a day was held in Ensen. I have not heard further about it. Three Anabaptists are captured with us, they were stretched and questioned about the matters. One confessed, they received letters from the camp and from M端nster. What was in them, I do not know. From Colmar, I have never heard a word, except that two citizens suspected they were going to the Anabaptists; they were captured and those with them, who were strangers, were sent away.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it is said that in Friesland, Holland, and around there, there is such unrest that it cannot be described. They take in what they can, and succeed at times. They had occupied a monastery with 300 women and men, a nobleman came and stormed them and overcame them, but with the loss of 600 men, he was moved, and had women, children, and men killed. Moreover, the peasants are stirring everywhere, if they are not Anabaptists, they now draw their argument in an experienced way, but if one speaks against them, they also become angry with indecency. In short, it is a plague.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Strasbourg, I cannot write anything back. For several months now, they have not even greeted me.</p>
      <p>I fear nothing more than that the Anabaptists will again cause harm with their word. May God always protect His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 10, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme head of the church in Zurich. To his esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
