    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer regrets that he was just barely unable to include the letters from Georg Frölich [18009], which Bullinger now receives, in his last letter [18017]. Frölich has written nothing different to Blarer regarding the general situation [of the Protestants] than to Bullinger. Hopefully, God will let His fatherly grace prevail.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The people of Konstanz have not yet received a response [to their request for reconciliation]. Some believe that Emperor Charles V is unaware of the whole matter and that the reconciliation is being postponed by some with deceitful intentions. May God thwart the attempts of the opponents.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Matthäus Zell, who, if Blarer is not mistaken, reliably exercised his preaching office in Strasbourg for more than thirty years, passed away on January 9, 1548. Previously, he had predicted to the people of Strasbourg, among other things, that instead of the Gospel of Christ, they would in the future worship the Roman idol [the Pope] again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Philipp Melanchthon is expected in Augsburg for a [religious] discussion convened by the Emperor, about which he also corresponded with Martin Frecht.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">In many places in the territory of Count Palatine Ottheinrich, Palatinate-Neuburg, the papist mass is being read again because the principality was given as a gift by Charles V to Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria. Nevertheless, there is still hope for Ottheinrich to regain his principality if he would tolerate [compromises] in religious matters. The related consultations with scholars are tormenting the exhausted Count Palatine greatly. Additionally, his principality is indebted with 700,000 guilders. And although the duchy has now changed rulers, the creditors are still supposed to demand their money only from Ottheinrich by imperial decree!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The imperial mandates against the people of Konstanz were proclaimed again in Ravensburg and elsewhere. The future of Konstanz is uncertain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings to all, especially from Blarer's brother Thomas and his cousin Konrad Zwick. Joachim Rheticus is also warmly greeted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bullinger should greet the lovable Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz and his wife [Anna, née Zehntmeier]. The people of Konstanz have no further news for Schankwitz. Bullinger can always report everything from the letters from Konstanz to him. This way, Blarer can kill two birds with one stone. However, he cannot continue writing now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Pray that the people of Konstanz behave correctly in religion and steadfastly, as their name suggests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Blarer would finally like to receive the information about the reliable fever remedy, which he had already requested earlier [with hbbw XX, No. 3082].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">In June 1531, a book titled "Onus ecclesiae" was printed by the Cologne printer Peter Quentel, containing many prophetic sayings and revelations from Merlin, Methodius, Hildegard, and Brigitta. If it is available in Zurich, Bullinger should buy it for Blarer and name the price. Blarer would very much like to have it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">Another greeting.</p>

      <p>The letters from Georg Frölich, which you now receive, venerable and dearest brother, were delivered at the very hour I had just sent mine to you, so that I greatly regret that I was unable to include them by such a short time. Frölich writes nothing different to me than what you receive here, concerning the general matters. May the Lord so govern all things with His mighty hand that we may continue to experience His fatherly kindness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>No response has yet been received to our requests, nor are there lacking those who assert that the Emperor is unaware of all these matters and that our cause is being postponed by some with a most cunning plan for another occasion. However, we hope that the Lord will turn all things contrary to what our adversaries desire.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Matthäus Zell, the preacher in Strasbourg for more than thirty years, if I am not mistaken, with utmost faith and spirited zeal, exchanged death for life on January 9th. He prophesied certain notable things to the people of Strasbourg, among other things, that instead of the Gospel of Christ, they would again worship the Roman idol, etc., and many other things of that kind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon is expected in Augsburg at any moment for the colloquium that the Emperor has convened, about which Philipp himself wrote to our Frecht, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In many places in the territory of Ottheinrich of the Palatinate, the papist mass has re-emerged, since this dominion has now been given by the Emperor to the Duke of Bavaria. However, there is some hope opened for Ottheinrich to recover it, if he would bear the reformation of religious matters differently, etc., for which cause the exhausted prince seeks counsel among the piously learned and is greatly troubled. His land is still mortgaged for 700,000 guilders. But now, as it has come into another hand, the Emperor commands by the plenitude of power that no creditor should demand a single penny from anyone but Duke Ottheinrich himself for the debt, under penalty of losing their claim, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In Ravensburg, the imperial mandates against us have now also been proclaimed, and in several other places, so that we cannot sufficiently wonder where this will lead us. May the Lord God direct it according to His grace!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>All of ours most dutifully bid you farewell, especially my brother Thomas with cousin Konrad Zwick and the others. May all yours be well, along with the venerable brothers in the ministry and all who love us in Christ Jesus, whose perpetual intercessions at the throne of grace we desire with all our hearts. I ask you to greet Joachim Rheticus most lovingly in my words.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>My kind, dear brother-in-law Marcell Dietrich and his dear wife are to be greeted warmly from me and all of mine. We have no news to write to him, other than what you hear from us at all times. Thus, one faithful letter serves two purposes, etc. I must stop writing now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Ah, pray for us as fervently as you can, that we may never do anything unworthy of our Christian profession or our name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Regarding a certain present remedy against fever, I had not long ago reminded you to inform me, if possible. I therefore await your response at some point.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>There is a certain book printed in Cologne at the house of Quentel in the year 31, in the month of June, titled "Onus ecclesiae," containing nothing but a collection of many prophecies and revelations of Merlin, Methodius, Hildegard, Brigitta, etc. I ask you, if it is available for sale there, to purchase it in my name and inform me of the price, for I greatly desire to have it.</p>

      <p>Farewell. January 31, 1548.</p>
