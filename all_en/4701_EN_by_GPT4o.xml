      <p>S. Due to the negligence of the courier, reverend father in Christ, I received your letters later; he forgot the letters in the WÃ¤ggis. Therefore, I was not able to read the royal mandate; for our people have already left or, if any are present, they are nevertheless on the verge of departure. Forgive me, therefore; I will send it in eight days for sure or even bring it myself; if I can, I will make sure that I do not have to be involved in the tiresome legal matters. Both parties are now fighting over us pastors, whom they previously did not even consider.</p>
      <p>Balinggetus came from Kleve the other day, reporting how the Duke of Savoy has begun to burn in his land for the sake of faith, and when the Waldenses (I have forgotten the valley where they have their dwelling) sent their embassy to the Duke with gifts and humble submission, but reserving only their religion, the Duke told them to be well comforted, they must not go to any mass, and immediately had them arrested (the envoys were supposed to be four) and chained and sent to the galleys. If these things are true, the Duke is already breathing threats.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have heard that the Pope has appointed the Bishop of Como to go to Baden on the next appointed day, to offer his will to the Confederates, with an admonition that they should return to the bosom of the church. Ferdinand has sent his embassy to the Pope, and since the legate's credentials only mentioned a reverence, which word was too weak, the Pope did not want to hear the legate. These things I have heard.</p>
      <p>Dietegen, the bailiff in the courts, the Pope's godson, has never returned; meanwhile, they are plotting something.</p>
      <p>After his return, some kind of fire is also to be feared here. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your people.</p>
      <p>I did not meet the legate.</p>
      <p>These things are written in haste.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church in Zurich, his always honorable lord and patron.</p>
