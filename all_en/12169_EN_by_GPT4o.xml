    <p xml:id="regest1">Hardenberg cannot write to each individual (Provost [Felix Frey], Theodor [Bibliander], [Kaspar] Megander, [Johannes] Fries, and [Konrad] Gessner), but he always remembers their kindness. He left the list with the names [of the Zurich pastors] in Strasbourg and therefore cannot name them all individually. However, he honors them all. - They should write to him, for he needs their admonition and instruction. Oh, if only they could see each other again! If not, they will see each other in the Kingdom of God, and hopefully soon! - Hardenberg's [former] host Bullinger will convey greetings to them.</p>

      <p>It is not possible for me to write to you, most distinguished men, Lord Provost, Lord Theodor, Lord Megander, Fries, Gessner, and you others, dearest brothers, yet I always remember your greatest kindnesses.</p>
      <p>I do not have the list of your names now, which is in Strasbourg, and so I cannot name you all now; however, I love, honor, and revere you all with silent affection of thought.</p>
      <p>I beg you, cheer my spirit once with your writings, for I always need your admonitions and instructions. If only it were possible to see those most sacred hearts once more in this life! Oh if, oh if! But if this is not possible, we will see each other on that day in the kingdom of our Father; may it come as soon as possible, so that all flesh may be saved! For there is great misery in these regions. But more on this another time.</p>
      <p>My most deserving host, Mr. Bullinger, I hope, will greet you with my words. Farewell in the Lord. March 25, 1545, Bonn.</p>
      <p>Albert Hardenberg of Friesland.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men, my fathers and brothers, ministers of the church of Zurich, individually and separately.</p>
