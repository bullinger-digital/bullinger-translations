      <p>Greetings through Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Today, that is, June 6th, I received the letter you wrote on June 4th, in which I understand that you have received mine. I have nothing to respond to them now; for yesterday, through your students, whom you recalled from Heidelberg, I wrote about the opinion of the brothers, what was done with yours, whom you sent here through Mr. Hospinian and me.</p>
      <p>Your opinion on refusing the Tridentine council is pleasing in every way, as you will understand from many letters from yesterday. We have heard nothing about the occupied town of Angers.</p>
      <p>It is still consistently reported that Villafranca was taken by the Condé's forces and with much less damage than rumor had spread; for while it was first said that two thousand of Condé's men had perished, now it is said to be only 200. Sultzer has appropriated a copy of the document; as soon as I obtain it from him, I will send it back. I have nothing else to write to you now, except to impart the greetings of all the brothers to you, especially Mr. Marcus Berschius, who does not know how to sufficiently express his gratitude for your kindness in receiving his greetings. In the meantime, farewell and farewell a thousand times.</p>
      <p>In Basel.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my name and that of the brothers, especially Lavater. Given in Basel, June 6th, in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours more than you believe, Wissenburg.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and adorned with every kind of virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his old master and friend. Zurich.</p>
