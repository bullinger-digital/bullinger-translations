      <p>Greetings. Since your merchants are now returning from the fair, a man distinguished both in piety and learning, and to be honored by me for many reasons, I did not want them to leave without my letters to you, even though I have nothing new that you, who are closer to Italy than we are, have not already heard.</p>
      <p>However, I can report this about our affairs: our French church here is now moderately afflicted. I know you have heard so far that certain men, to say nothing more severe about them, have initiated a serious dispute or accusation against Garnier, who has served as pastor in that church for many years. The action was long suspended and somewhat suppressed in silence, but finally, a certain sentence was pronounced, which, when recited in the church before the magistrate and the people, Garnier judged himself to be too severely burdened. He began to complain publicly to the magistrate and, in his actions, became heated, and some words, as happens in the heat of contention, slipped out, and he crossed the limits of just and decent moderation. Hence, the magistrate was not lightly offended, and the danger he incurred was barely avoided through the intercession of some powerful individuals. However, he did not escape so completely that he is still suspended from his ministry. The magistrate does not want him to perform his duties until it is permitted by their order. Meanwhile, his deacon ministers to the church. Therefore, I ask you to assist this afflicted cause with your prayers. Similarly, the English in Frankfurt have not agreed much among themselves in establishing the church, which was very distressing for me to hear. Nevertheless, I hope the matter will be settled or is already settled. Lord a Lasco from Friesland has been ordered to leave, as I hear, at the instigation of the imperialists; they say he will come to Frankfurt. May God deign to console him. The widow of Hopper, who was killed for the cause of Christ and the gospel, our mutual friend, sent me some of his writings, which she wanted to be printed immediately; but they were returned to me late, namely when the Frankfurt fair was already at the door. Hopper himself wrote to me about this, and also to you (if I am not mistaken); I have read them, and as far as the substance of the matter is concerned, they are approved by me; but because they were composed hastily, that is, in prison, where he lacked books and was, as is likely, very distracted in mind, therefore, in my judgment, some things should be cut out and some things should be somewhat polished. You, according to your judgment and candor, will weigh this whole matter with yourself; for he wanted it so, and the widow requests that your counsel also be employed. Therefore, having maturely and amicably deliberated on the matter, I do not doubt that you will gratify his pious hands and his wife as much as the business will allow. I would not dare to impose this burden on you or yours through myself, unless both he and his widow had wanted it to be done so. Farewell, most holy man, and commend my ministry to Christ in your prayers and convey my greetings to all your fellow ministers in my name. Strasbourg, April 16, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>I ask you again, my most esteemed lord and father, that in publishing these writings of Hopper, no ordinary diligence be applied, so that what is too severe is cut out, what is good, firm, and solid is polished, and nothing from the fathers is included that has not been drawn and transcribed from the very source. For if this diligence is not expended, the enemies who burned him will insult both the church and the deceased fiercely and contemptuously. A few words to the wise. In this matter, the public doctrine of religion must be both defended and adorned, and the reputation of a friend who risked his life for the truth must be protected. In amending and polishing the work, there must be no hesitation, as if we were lying or fabricating anything deceitfully.</p>
      <p>He, while he saw it, wanted this to be done, as he wrote to me before his death, and I do not doubt that he wrote to you repeatedly. I pray again that you pray most earnestly for our French church. I thought these letters would be given to the merchants; but an Englishman has now come, who will be a more welcome messenger, as through him I know you will hear more clearly about the Frankfurt church.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and to be respected for many reasons, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
