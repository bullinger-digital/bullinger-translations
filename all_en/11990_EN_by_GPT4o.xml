    <p xml:id="regest1">Has only now received Bullinger's letter from July 1st through [Ambrosius] Blarer and is pleased about the friendship that has begun; he wants to hold on to their connection, which is founded in Christ, as do his colleagues. He wishes that the other Confederates were united with the people of Zurich and Bern, as this would weaken the enemies of the truth in Germany; however, in the matter of military service, opposition [to the inner Swiss regions] is necessary; unity can only be achieved in Christ. Joseph Macarius, who came to Augsburg on July 5th and praised the friendliness of the people of Zurich, was received with honor and stayed with Musculus for four days; may he one day be of use to his homeland! Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letters you sent on the first of this month, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I only received yesterday, which, as our Blaurer wrote to me, was not due to any negligence, but due to a lack of couriers. I read them with a certain singular joy. For I was wonderfully affected by the sweetness of the friendship begun between us, which, I pray, may lead to the glory of the name of Christ, our Savior, to which all our actions should be directed, since all His actions, even when we were enemies, were destined for our salvation. Let us live for Christ alone, our head, and let us not doubt that in Him we have true and eternal love, peace, concord, friendship, and the closest unity in all things. He is our peace, who makes us most united in Himself, to the Father, to Himself, and to us. In this peace, my Bullinger, by His grace, I will remain indivisibly connected to you and to all the pious members of His body. Nor can I understand that my fellow ministers have any other mind. For there is no one among them at present whom I feel harbors any bitterness in his heart.</p>
      <p>I have long wished that the discord among your Confederates would be removed, but in such a way that what you and the people of Bern do, all the others would do as well, and that you would be unanimous in the truth of Christ. For it pains me greatly that this discord among you, that is, the evasion of the allies against the gospel of Christ, lasts so long. If you were united in this matter, something could soon be done in Germany that would greatly terrify the enemies of the truth and the tyranny of the Antichrist. Now our miserable Germany, torn apart and exposed partly to the deceit and partly to the violence of foreign nations, in these dangers has nowhere to flee nor anything else to expect but utter destruction.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, as you truly write, this discord among you is holy and salutary, as far as it concerns you, who adhere to the truth, detest that mercenary military service, and acknowledge that you are enlisted for military service to Christ in baptism.</p>
      <p>How I wish, however, that what has been given to you, with this discord removed, would be divinely granted to your other allies, so that this whole league would be more completely and firmly restored in Christ. Nor do I doubt that you wish the same from your heart. But the voice of the Lord is: "No one comes to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" [John 6:44]. Let us pray to the heavenly Father that He may also draw the others to His Son, so that we may be united in this with firm bonds.</p>
      <p>On the 5th of this month, a certain Hungarian named Joseph Macarius came here, a learned, pious young man endowed with a very moderate disposition, who could not praise enough your kindness and humanity towards him. Our people received him quite lovingly, some with their banquets, and even the senate with ten honorary wine cups, by which, according to our custom, distinguished guests are received. He stayed with me for four days. May the Lord grant that he may one day benefit his afflicted homeland!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most distinguished Bullinger. Greet all the brothers there. Your fellow ministers greet you in return, and our elder Mr. Peutinger sends his most dutiful regards to your humanity.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, July 17, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the outstanding theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, most dear lord and brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
