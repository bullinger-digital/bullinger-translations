      <p>S. At the very moment I wanted to engage in the duty of writing letters, our Kobler brought yours, most reverend father. I see from them that new disturbances are arising in France, which may God, the best and greatest, allow to burst forth into the most fortunate outcomes by His singular grace. Here, both French and Belgian affairs are persistently silent, and perhaps many uncertainties are also reported among you. However, it is reported, not from an uncertain source, that out of 6000 Swiss, fifteen hundred of them, and those in poor condition, are on their way back. May they feel the avenging hand of God if they do not wish to see and believe it.</p>
      <p>We are working hard here so that the royal beneficiaries can receive their stipends freely and with impunity. The pastors of Lower Engadine, who are accusing this, are poorly heard by some nobles, whose efforts are solely directed towards enjoying these corruptions securely with our mouths shut. However, since those private pensions of the king have been distributed in darkness and with fear until now, I think no good person will justly be indignant with us if we oppose them, lest they seem to have completely rubbed their foreheads if they receive them publicly, shedding their fear and all shame, and erect and open a freedom, indeed a right and asylum, for this evil and as if a school. Today, however, this and other matters were discussed in the tribes; but the opinions of each are still unknown to me. I hear, however, that some have finally said farewell to this gunpowder. But it is difficult not to covet goods unless we also renounce the merchants.</p>
      <p>In the matter of my wife's case, nothing has been done yet; for at this time the election of magistrates was held, and now our fairs are at the door; add to this that I have not yet received any testimonies from my wife's brother. They will barely touch this rascal with the tip of their finger, unless my mind has deceived me, etc.</p>
      <p>Gantner, who involved himself in these disturbances and the new alliance and opposed himself as a leader and speaker to his legitimate magistrate, was fined only 4 pounds. However, he was so exasperated here and there that, if he had been allowed, he would have gladly appealed to others; hence he has incurred not a little envy and anger from those whose favor he has used too much until now. Meanwhile, he is entirely an atheist and has not attended sacred assemblies or communion within the span of a year.</p>
      <p>Mr. Willius was re-elected as consul the day before yesterday. Yesterday, when an honorary snack was received in place of the bishop, we had his provost, who did not want to reveal anything about Turkish affairs. The bishop, however, is confined to bed, suffering greatly from arthritis and gout. This week we received nothing from Mr. Lentus; for the mountains have begun to whiten with new snow, and the journey is more troublesome in rainy weather.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from our Chur, November 9, 1573. All those greeted by you send their most dutiful regards back.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished and eminent man in every kind of virtue and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord with perpetual observance.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Grossm√ºnster.</p>
