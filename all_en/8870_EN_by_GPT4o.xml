      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, I have received your letter from the 12th of this month along with letters to Grienenbach; I have dispatched them to date via a certain messenger. I thank you sincerely for your writing. I have also sent you a package from Augsburg via Mr. Caspar von Sallis, hoping it has reached you, as the good young gentleman faithfully promised me. I hear that some enemies are gathering again near Chur; it seems as if it might spread further. May God the Lord arrange everything according to His holy will. Amen. We also hear that things are going well in France, with good hope that Almighty God will have mercy. I am displeased that you were not informed that our people in St. Gallen did not command it; for they knew well that I would not ride there this time; Heinrich was supposed to do it. I hope, if it pleases God, to be with you shortly; for I have been waiting for the Lord of Roll since mid-Lent. With a request to graciously remember my honor, dear sir, along with your devoted greetings. May Almighty God preserve you with His grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner. To the venerable, well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the faithful servant of the Church of Christ, my honorable, beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
