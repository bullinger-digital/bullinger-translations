    <p xml:id="regest1">On September 9, a messenger brought [...] Bullinger's commentary on Luke. Almost simultaneously, the six Swiss banners arrived, which moved on to Füssen the next day.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Hans] Welser was very pleased with Bullinger's commentary on Luke. He will write himself [No. 2588]. It's good that Bullinger dedicated the commentary to him after all! Haller translated the dedication preface [intended for Welser] into German, but did not make a copy of it to send to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller has nothing further to report about [Hans Wilpert] Zoller. It is certain that he rejoined his banner three weeks ago [after his recovery]. Thanks to Schertlin's mediation, the one [...], [who had wounded him], is said to have reconciled with him. Moreover, Zoller is appreciated by all the Swiss. It is no wonder that he writes so rarely to Bullinger and his relatives. Anyone who knows the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and [Sebastian] Schertlin knows that there is no time for idleness in their troops. Therefore, Haller has not yet sent [Rudolf Gwalther's work] "The Antichrist" to Zoller, especially since he wants to read this writing himself first. Only then will he bind it and send it to Zoller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Haller knows nothing about the whereabouts of Wolfgang Lavater. Perhaps he is among the two banners coming from Donauwörth, which are spending the night in a village [...] near Augsburg and will move to the carelessly lost Klause Ehrenberg tomorrow. Haller will keep an eye out for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He does not doubt that Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater is well-disposed towards the [Schmalkaldic League]. May he remain so, for now is the opportunity to show gratitude for the Gospel!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller has not seen Fridolin Hospinian. One of the two banners staying here overnight is said to consist exclusively of Zurichers. He will inquire tomorrow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He has also not seen the [Zurichers] studying [in Marburg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Dutch army is moving through Franconia to Regensburg. It received reinforcements of about 2000 cavalrymen, namely from the treacherous bishops of Trier [Johann IV Ludwig von Hagen], Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm], Würzburg [Melchior Zobel], and Bamberg [Weigand von Redwitz]. Since the [Schmalkaldic League] could not achieve anything [against the Imperial forces] near Ingolstadt, they moved to confront this army, either to fight it or to lure the Emperor [Charles V] out of his entrenchment. The [Schmalkaldic League] thus set out towards Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl. When [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren heard of this, he led his army past Nuremberg. The Nurembergers even admitted some prominent personalities of this army and provided provisions! Subsequently, the [Schmalkaldic] army returned to Donauwörth. Allegedly, it is supposed to be in Augsburg in two or three days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Schertlin is supposed to come to Augsburg [tomorrow] for secret consultations. Today, French captains from the [Schmalkaldic] camp arrived. The reason is unknown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- People are acting in a rather childish manner. Haller admonishes the people to entrust everything to God, to repent wholeheartedly, and to wait for divine help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Ammann [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] has been in Augsburg for 14 days. When he returns [to Zurich], Haller will write more. Haller sends back the leather [a leather sack?] as requested. [Michael] Keller wants to write to [Utz] Eckstein and Bullinger. Haller is impatiently waiting for the return of the messenger [...], who presented the request of the Augsburgers [for a pastor] in Zurich. [Thomas] Naogeorg, about whom Haller has already written, is truly a sincere person. Haller has received the [two crowns]. Gwalther should know that he also received [the portrait] of Zwingli along with the other money. Haller will write to Gwalther soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The [Schmalkaldic] army is being joined [from Hesse] by 20,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen. They followed the army led by [Martin von] Rossem [intended for the Emperor], but did not dare to attack the latter. These [Schmalkaldic] troops are also supposed to come to Augsburg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, Otto [Werdmüller], [Johannes] Fries, Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli], and to Bullinger's family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- It is ten o'clock in the evening. Tomorrow the messenger [...] will set out at the crack of dawn.</p>

      <p>Mercy and peace from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ. On the 9th of this month, a messenger came to us bringing copies of your commentaries on Luke. On the same day and almost at the same hour, six Swiss banners also arrived, which moved towards Füssen the next day.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We offered a copy to Mr. Welser, who received it with great joy. And you would have done wrong if you had not satisfied his expectation, to whom you had promised to dedicate it. He will write himself, unless I am mistaken, or unless business disturbs him. From this, you will know how much he values your gift. I have already translated your preface into German, but I have not copied it, so I cannot send you a copy to judge the translation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You say I write strictly about Zoller; but I wrote what I knew. For I am still uncertain about the matter of this misfortune. I know that he is alive and well and that he rejoined his banner three weeks ago. Therefore, I bid everyone to be of good cheer! That he writes rarely to you or his family is not without reason. For you know what the nature of the Landgrave and Schertlin is like. They are never given an hour to rest, let alone to write. Therefore, you will have him excused here with the best right. I have not yet sent "The Antichrist" to him. I kept it with me to read, because I know he does not have time to read it. I will ensure it is bound and sent to him unless he returns first. I do not think, if he wanted to write, he would be given the opportunity in such a crowd and frequency of people. He reconciled with his adversary through Schertlin's mediation and arrangement of the matter. He is dear and pleasing to all our citizens because of his modesty, with which he served Schertlin. Do not doubt, if I knew anything else about him, I would write.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have neither seen nor been able to inquire about Wolfgang Lavater, unless perhaps he is among these two banners, which are spending the night in a village near our city; they will pass through tomorrow. These signs came from Donauwörth, also seeking the Clauses lost through our negligence and infidelity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I do not doubt that Mayor Lavater himself favors our cause. Encourage him to continue, and be of good courage. For now, we have the most abundant opportunity to declare what we have learned from the Gospel so far. May the Lord strengthen us with His Spirit!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have also not seen Fridolin Hospinian. They say one of the two cohorts staying here overnight consists entirely of Zurichers. I will see tomorrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have also not seen the students you mention.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Belgian army is moving through Franconia directly towards Regensburg. It was reinforced by about 2000 cavalrymen sent by the treacherous bishops of Trier, Mainz, Würzburg, and Bamberg. Since our forces achieved nothing at Ingolstadt, they left the Emperor's camp to meet this army, either to engage with it or to lure the Emperor out of his entrenchment. They thus set out towards Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl. Upon learning of this, Buren's army hastily went towards Nuremberg, past which city they passed, and many prominent figures were admitted, while the rest were magnificently treated with provisions. This is the faith of the placentis. Our forces, having labored in vain for a long time in this part, returned to Donauwörth, and it is rumored that the entire army will come to us within two or three days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Indeed, Schertlin came to the city today. Stables are being prepared, etc. Consultations are being held in secret, so I do not know what will happen. Some French captains from our camp also arrived today. However, I do not know what they want.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>When I see that everything is being conducted rather childishly in my judgment, and since I cannot advise on these matters, I urge the people to faithfully commit themselves and the whole matter to the Lord, whose power is all-encompassing. Meanwhile, let them repent wholeheartedly and turn to God, and expect His unexpected help, which He has often shown us so far, even now. I think I cannot advise better. I commit the rest to the Lord and to those in whose hands the sum of affairs rests, for whom we pray faithfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Ammann Vogler has been here for 14 days. When he returns, I will write more. I am sending back your leather as you ordered. Cellarius will write to Eggstein and you. I am expecting the return of our messenger and your response to our petitions any day now. Naogeorgus is entirely sincere, about whom I recently wrote something. I have received the money. And since there is no time now to write to other brothers, tell Gwalther that I received Zwingli along with the other money. I will write to him in a few days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>To our army come 20,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen, who followed the Rochovense army but did not dare to engage it alone. I hear all the troops are coming to us. Then they will devour us like locusts!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell. Diligently greet Lord Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Gessner, Otto, Frisius, my father-in-law, along with your family and other brothers. Farewell again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>From Augsburg, September 14, at night, while it struck 10. Tomorrow at the break of dawn, the messenger will depart.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father. Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
