      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord God our Savior. Since the most honorable and honest man, D. Haller, writes to you abundantly about what is happening here, I did not consider it very necessary to trouble you, my most esteemed and upright man and my most desired patron, who is already overwhelmed by the gravest storms of so many disturbances at this time. But so that you may understand whom among our churchmen I blame under the name of all, you should know that Weber has become troublesome, which we regret having promoted, and I especially, who opposes the learned and does not know how to concede a lapse and recognize human weakness. Because of one blemish, however, to be washed away, he easily disturbs us, thinking that we ought to remain silent because our reconciliation is still tender, which needs nurturing rather than provocation. He rightly infers from his own mind, knowing our leniency and that we are more ready and prompt to soothe what might offend than to exacerbate. Hence, he becomes more obstinate, for which reason he will need time. The excellent man D. Haller acts prudently, who carries himself in the middle, so that he cannot be blamed by anyone; for otherwise, we are inclined to take sides, and also tenacious of them if they have taken root, therefore I believe that silence concerning the excellent man D. Musculus is now necessary and that we should wait for the Lord's opportunity, which he will surely grant in due time. We will not neglect him. I would have something in Winterthur that could be a comfort to him for support; I would not want such a pious man to be neglected, let alone rejected, and indeed, my venerable father Bullinger, be assured that not only my things but I myself am under your jurisdiction; my heart, words, and pen agree; I am not a deceitful man by divine grace, nor is there a need for me to write much that might seem ambiguous in its explanation, if he knew where we had been wrong (which I believe) he would have abundantly anticipated, which I will explain in full before God willing on the day of the Lord's birth.</p>
      <p>If we agree among ourselves, then with your testimony and D. Haller's approval, I will strive to break through and will not fear anyone's offense (if they dare to speak). Therefore, I consider it better to remain silent now than to continually urge, lest we seem to want to impose ourselves, etc. I ask you to commend our students and deign to greet all your colleagues in my name. To you, your most honorable wife, your children, and the entire family, and also to D. Wolfgang Musculus, I wish all the best. Forgive the poor handwriting, I wrote hastily late into the night, as our students know, with dimming eyes. October 30, 1548.</p>
      <p>Entirely your little client Eberhard von Rümlang. Silius Italicus:... the place for duty, when prosperous things cease and harsh fortune calls for help, for to support joyful things is by no means the mark of a great spirit, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant, most faithful, and in every way most honorable man D. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary churchman of Zürich, his most reverend lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
