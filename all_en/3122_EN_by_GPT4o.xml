      <p>Greetings. An outstanding man, excelling in both authority and unique experience, has come to us some time ago, whom we recognized as having arrived in the city later due to the negligence of others. Certainly, we awaited him with great desire, unexpectedly, along with your letters. It is evident from all his tastes and manners how much humanity he possesses beyond his otherwise immense grace, so that I can hardly bear to offer him my service, which is very modest, nor could it have been of use to my father, whose authority has now become widespread. Indeed, even if no excellent virtue had called me there, nevertheless, your most loving recommendation should certainly have such an effect on me that I should demonstrate to even the lowest person how much I love you, let alone declare it to the most worthy of admirable prudence. Therefore, be fully persuaded of this: that whatever diligence or effort I would confer upon myself or my brother, I will by no means neglect in your affairs as long as I live. Now to our personal matters.</p>
      <p>I sent your letters to Mr. Laetus, who lifted me from the sacred font twenty-one years ago, only after five days, because I was unaware whether he was at home, seven miles from here, or at court with the prince-elector. For I feared, before I had ascertained this, that if I sent them to his wife, she might care less for your concern than I would, as nothing of your advice could escape me, and you hastened my response with the testimony of your letters to me. Therefore, I took care to have them delivered to him safely, and I expect what he will send to us at any moment. Just know this: at almost the same hour that letters are brought to us by Mr. Gesner, those who carry letters to you almost immediately set out again, indeed desirable men, but departing from here too quickly, so that they might at least have witnessed the magnificent wedding of a certain Fugger, which is imminent the day after tomorrow, with me as their guide. For I think it will be such a display that I myself have never seen, which I am very glad to be able to disdain with the support of philosophy and the aid of sacred letters.</p>
      <p>You will receive the history of the marquis's death along with letters from our Hugo.</p>
      <p>There is also a long bundle of images of some fish addressed to Mr. Gesner, almost my father, which Mr. Julius sent to us these days. Before I knew that he, a most refined man in all kinds of learning and piety, was also meditating on fish, I saw during my travels the image of a fish that bore a human face in every way and was said to have been caught in the lakes of the Etsch River. I am inquiring very diligently now and will send it soon. I beg you to deliver these letters to Collinus, to whom I write my most dutiful greetings, which our Mr. Wolfius wrote to him in my presence when it was announced to us about the departure of your people. From these, you will understand with what pomp the cardinal of Bologna was received by the pope.</p>
      <p>What was accomplished at the diet and what other troubles threaten us, my father's hand will indicate, who prays for immense and prosperous happiness for you all from the heart. What about your son? Finally, be fully persuaded that there is nothing we would refuse to undertake for your sake. Farewell, most excellent man and father. My most dutiful greetings to Mr. Gesner and the rest of our friends.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, February 26, 1557. Entirely yours in mind and effort, Raphael Seiler.</p>
      <p>Forgive me; I was not able to reread.</p>
