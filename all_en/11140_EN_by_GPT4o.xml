    <p xml:id="regest1">Shows understanding for the complaints [of the Zurichers] about the Strasbourg [Bucer and Capito]; however, Luther is said to have given a satisfactory answer to the Swiss churches in the meantime. As Joachim [Maler] has heard from the people of Strasbourg, they want to establish church fellowship through agreements among the theologians, although such fellowship can only be founded in God's word, and Bucer therefore also seeks dialogue with Zwick; Zwick is ready for this but wants to counter with his own conviction. Sends a letter from Capito [No. 1092] and inquires about its content. Advises against publishing a defense writing in view of Luther's response; since Basel and Bern support the efforts of the Strasbourg people, one should, for the sake of unity, engage with it as much as possible. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I have your complaints, dearest Bullinger, which I wish our Lord Jesus Christ would put an end to someday. Oh, how miserable we are, how much time we lose in these disputes and verbal questions! On the other hand, the people of Strasbourg devote themselves entirely to curses unless they act according to the word of the Lord, whatever they do.</p>
      <p>This cannot be persuaded to many others, what remains but that the Lord intervenes? By what means, He knows. But now I hear that Luther has responded to the Swiss churches, and not only amicably, but in a way that could suffice for concord. This indeed would restore the spirit, if only new occasions for dispute were not always sought.</p>
      <p>Our Joachim, the syndic, recently discussed many things with the people of Strasbourg. But the sum of all efforts is this: First, that concord among all ministers be established and strengthened, then, once this is firm, the face of all churches be brought into some order. For they continually proclaim that there is no communion and hence no discipline. Now indeed there is no one who approves of a church devoid of communion and discipline; only the methods of initiating communion and establishing discipline are contested. May Christ teach us these. I am not persuaded that true concord can arise from verbal questions, and God will testify that it cannot stand in these. They are attempting to build ecclesiastical discipline through conspiracy, which, however, can only be born from the very word of God itself. Was there not communion among the brethren until now and discipline in the church? Let us see that we do not, through some new inventions, reject the communion and discipline born long ago from holy reasons, and let it not happen to us as it did to the dog in Aesop's fable chasing a shadow. Bucer, sensing my mind, tries to call me to some kind of dialogue. I will obey him, unless the church prevents it, and although he is quite shrewd and, so to speak, invincible, I will still use my simplicity and conscience.</p>
      <p>You have here letters from Capito; if there is anything in them that you can share without offense, I beg you, do not hesitate to give me at least the gist. For I wish to gather the mind of the best men from various and many sources.</p>
      <p>You wrote recently that you are consulting on what to do, whether to expose to all churches through public writings what has been done with you. We do not approve of this consultation. Restrain yourselves, I beg you, especially since we hear that Luther has written very fair letters to you. Let others begin new controversies. You wrote to Luther and sent your confession; he now responds amicably and approves the confession. What remains but to overlook all causes of controversy and, if there is anything more to be done with Luther, to do it in the most friendly and united spirit. Only avoid division among yourselves, and when you hear that both the people of Basel and Bern not only do not abhor but also love the efforts of the people of Strasbourg (or concord, as they say), it is your duty to pass over all these things with a deaf ear, which are not openly evil, and to observe the concord of the Swiss churches rather than that of the people of Strasbourg. This will happen if you always respond to inquiries unanimously and as one man, and that from the mouth of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, with Pellican, Theodor, and Leo. Indeed, call upon the Lord with the deepest sighs, that we may finally rest from all contentious matters and turn to those things which are simple and make for the certain and solid glory of the gospel. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, the last day of January 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>All your fellow ministers greet you most diligently, as does our consul and brother Konrad.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, holy pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
