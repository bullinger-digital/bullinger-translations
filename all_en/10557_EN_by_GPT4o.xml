    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains about challenges [in the dispute over the theological doctorate]. Capito has primarily negotiated about the Lord's Supper in Basel and communicated the formula on which Bucer has agreed with the Augsburgers [and with Melanchthon]. The concept of exhibition should be clarified. Bucer regrets Bullinger's absence from the meeting in Konstanz. The people of Basel have verbally approved Bucer's writing "Ad Monasterienses." Luther has demanded agreement to harsh formulations, but Bucer and Melanchthon have avoided these expressions. Luther's approval is still pending; Melanchthon intends to pursue it. Luther has not succeeded in dividing the people of Strasbourg and Switzerland. Myconius has negotiated with Chelius and agrees with Bullinger's opinion [No. 514]; his own is only meant as a supplement. The other opinions raise concerns. Bullinger should prevent Konrad Geßner's return to Zurich in his own interest.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If you know how secure and idle we are here, it pains me; if you don't know, I won't say a word about it. My soul is full of the gravest temptations, but through God, I will indeed try to overcome all that troubles me. "God, make haste to help me" [Ps 70, 2]. Amen.</p>
      <p>Besides this, Capito was with us for quite a few days. He negotiated with the lords, he negotiated with us on many matters, especially on the issue of the Eucharist. The essence of which is almost this: Body etc. - I will write it in German as it came to us: "that the body of Christ is received essentially and truly when we receive the sacrament, and that the bread and wine are signs, signa exhibitiva, which, when given and received, are at the same time given and received as the body of Christ, and thus hold that the body and the bread are together, not by mixing their essence, but as a sacrament, and that which is given together with the sacrament, quo posito aliud ponitur, then they want to hold on both parts, the bread and wine remain, they hold such a sacramental union". This is how the Augsburgers confessed, Bucer composed it.</p>
      <p>In Switzerland, they say, this issue stumbled because of the exhibition. Here I wonder, Bullinger, what has been done, that is, whether you have given anything to Bucer about the exhibition and what you still think. For my opinion is quite different: Not that I deny the exhibition, but I interpret it differently than they do. In the meantime, it has not escaped me what someone wrote in the margin of Bucer's letters to you: "We have no exhibition except the sacramental sign and in spirit: reminder of the given body of Christ". Therefore, if there is anything else, let me know, even with one word.</p>
      <p>Bucer regrets, I noticed, that you did not come to Konstanz. I don't know how he interprets it, although I also understood that you provided a very reasonable excuse.</p>
      <p>Capito asked nothing from us except that we verbally approve the booklet, I mean Bucer's "Ad Monasterienses". There is nothing about the mentioned exhibition, so we complied without reluctance.</p>
      <p>Luther seems to be stiff-necked. For after many concessions, yet preserving the truth, it is not enough unless we all completely subscribe to his words. When he had nothing to complain about, he added: "the body of the Lord is also given into hand and mouth, and whatever movement and physical action happens to the bread, such as carrying, eating, etc., that this happens in the body of Christ".</p>
      <p>To which Melanchthon and Bucer responded: there is no union between the bread and the body of Christ except a sacramental one, namely: "when the bread is given and received, then the true body of the Lord is also given and received, yet without any natural mixing of the body of Christ and the bread." "But these words, 'in hand and mouth' and the like, we have avoided and emphasized the natural distinction between the bread and the body of Christ" etc. How Luther received this is not yet clear. Melanchthon is said to have received it, wanting to persuade Luther to accept these statements as sufficient for true concord. I don't know what will happen. Initially, Luther only wanted to enter into a civil friendship and thereafter write nothing about this sacrament, not admitting the Swiss. See the monk! Finally, he acted as said, after the people of Strasbourg did not want to separate from us. We will wait to see what the Lord has decided to do.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Chelius also negotiated with me. I wrote advice, not articles of faith. I was content with yours as purely simple and simply pure. The others, however, instill some horror at first glance. We almost all proclaimed the Pope as the antichrist; now we suffer in ecclesiastical order with dominions, etc. But enough about this matter.</p>
      <p>Beware, my Bullinger, do not let Konrad Geßner leave Zurich, wherever you may send him. He came here so that the course of his studies is not interrupted in foreign places and under foreign teachers. I know what harm this can do to his homeland.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours and all brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, the fourth of February in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most pious brother in the Lord, to be honored. To Zurich.</p>
