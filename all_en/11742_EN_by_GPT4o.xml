Perhaps the [confiscated] Quran will be released in the new year. The graduates achieve little at the university; there is a lack of listeners, theological teaching is in decline, and almost everything that was customary under the papacy has been reintroduced. The defeat against the Turks [near Pest] was unavoidable, as God himself fights against us, as Oecolampadius predicted in his interpretation of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending you here a thaler and a half, although I wish everything were more clearly depicted, but I could not obtain any others; for this reason, accept my effort and diligence with gratitude. I also received 14 batzen for the books. I fear that you may have sent more than I accounted for; for I have forgotten what I had expended.</p>
      <p>Do not be concerned about the Quran; perhaps the Lord will grant more favorable times in the coming year, so that the Quran may be released despite the unwilling gates of the underworld.</p>
      <p>Our graduates now reign, although they achieve nothing. Our schools suffer daily losses; there are few listeners, but a multitude of scholars. Whoever asks for alms is immediately urged to enroll in the university, so they can boast of having at least some listeners. The theological lecture is entirely cold, alas. Our people have almost entirely reinstated everything that existed under the papacy, but I see no benefit arising from it. May the Lord grant them better judgment.</p>
      <p>Our people could not avoid the Turkish defeat, because the Lord fights against us. For this was long ago predicted by Oecolampadius, when he interpreted the Lamentations of Jeremiah. I see the prophecy was true.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet Master Theodor in my name and Pellican. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
