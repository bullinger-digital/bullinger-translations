    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's communication [No. 2464] about the bishop [Johann von Weeze] sent by the Pope [Paul III] to the five [Swiss Catholic] places, as well as the steps to be undertaken with the Confederates, could be well used by Frölich for the benefit of the fatherland.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Around Augsburg, the enemies have at most 4000 or 5000 soldiers, and Frölich hopes that their plans will fail!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The brave Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has 2000 horses and 20 companies. The cities will soon have 20 companies as well. Augsburg already has six companies; soon there will be ten.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Frölich has also received the [other] letters from Bullinger [not received], including the last one from June 29, well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The Augsburg council is not fearful but unanimously determined to sacrifice even their lives for this divine cause. Hopefully, it will soon go against the enemy, whose war fervor has somewhat diminished! Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] will himself move with his troops into the [Swabian Upper Land] and put his territory (in which only his fortresses are occupied) at risk. The people of Augsburg will join the Duke [Ulrich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The people of Zurich should continue to pray for the people of Augsburg, which also applies vice versa.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- A timid man [...] without faith has instilled fear in many people in Augsburg, so that up to 16 wealthy citizens have fled Augsburg with their possessions. Thus, through the cross, it becomes apparent who belongs to Christ and who to Belial.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich hopes that the envoys [of the Schmalkaldic League], namely the representative of the Duke of Württemberg [Hans Herter von Hertneck], Jakob Sturm from Strasbourg, and [Ulrich Hochrütiner] from Constance, will soon appear [at the Diet] in Baden and submit their proposal, as advised by [the people of Zurich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Unfortunately, the people of Graubünden are not sending [war] men because they need them for their own protection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the brothers and scholars.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- There was hope in Mayor [Hans] Welser, but he has caused more harm through his faint-heartedness and imprudence than the enemies outside the walls [of Augsburg]. Now the hypocrites are revealed! Hopefully, the brave [Jakob] Herbrot and Georg Herwart will endure to the end.</p>

      <p>Dearest, faithful lord and brother, I have received your recent letter and report with the utmost gratitude, detailing what the envoy from Lund and the Pope's message to the five places has accomplished, as well as what is to be handled and hoped for with the honorable Confederation. I have used this information for the benefit of our fatherland. It will also bear much fruit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The enemies are not particularly strong yet. They have not gathered more than 4000 or 5000 soldiers around this city. I am hopeful that their plans will fail significantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is holding firm (brave, valiant). He has 2000 horses and 20 companies of good soldiers. The cities will soon also form 20 companies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In particular, Augsburg alone will have ten companies. Six have already been mustered and incorporated with the remaining people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have received all your letters well, especially the last one given on the day of Peter and Paul.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Here, thank God, there is no fear, but rather a unanimous council that we will sacrifice life and limb for this divine cause. I hope we will soon act against the enemy. May God grant grace and victory! The situation has become somewhat cooler and milder with the opposition. The Landgrave will come to us in the Upper Land with all his equipment (troops, army), only occupying his fortresses and putting the rest into the trenches; for we intend, with God's help, to support the Duke.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Help God, our Father, faithfully pray for us, as you are already doing, that He may help us. We are in such distress and labor, more weary than devout; yet we do not forget God. I know that you and your lords, as pious true people, will act towards us. The same shall happen to you; of this, be certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>A timid, faithless man has, at the beginning of this uprising, instilled fear and panic among some cowardly people in our city, so that up to 16 wealthy citizens have fled and taken their possessions with them; those who were more secure and honorable remained here. But it must be so, so that through the cross it becomes apparent what belongs to Christ and what to Belial, although I wish to excuse the weak womenfolk. I hope our envoys, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg's representative, Herr Jakob Sturm of Strasbourg, and Constance, will soon be in Baden and submit their proposal, as advised by your council. We would have liked to have had men from Graubünden. However, they believe they will need them themselves to protect against foreign people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Convey my diligent thanks to my commanding lords, the mayors, for their faithful greetings and assure them of my willing service at all times. Greet the brothers, scholars, and encourage them to pray to our God for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Consul Welser, in whom we had good hope, is entirely faint-hearted and foolish. He has done more harm to our cause than a thousand enemies outside the walls. Oh, how excellently the hypocrites now reveal themselves! Herprotus and Georg Herwart act like men, and I hope they will persevere to the end.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell, my soul. July 3, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant observer of the Church of Christ and the common fatherland, Lord Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, friend and brother forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
