      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters, most beloved father, have been delivered to me, which I received with great joy, read with even greater joy, and reread with the utmost joy. For what else could bring such joy, if not this: that you are all well, that religion is being observed religiously, that the republic is at peace, that you have been freed from the terror of physical plague, and that you have returned to grace and right agreement with the brothers who have been suspected for a long time? I pray to the most good and great God that He grants you all these things perpetually, amen. You are not unaware that the people of Biel, along with you and the people of Bern, consistently reject the gifts of corruption. Thank Biel, which remains unyielding. Half of the promised gold, which is given to each canton, was not accepted, neither half nor whole. May God strengthen us in every good purpose and graciously protect us, so that the greed of a few and the hypocrisy of many do not destroy, pollute, and dissipate the whole body. I am expecting your and the French confession through this messenger. We are all well except for Mr. Jacob, who languishes and is consumed by perpetual infirmity. My wife sends her greetings to you in return; the brothers, whom you also instructed to be greeted, send their greetings. Convey my greetings to all yours and to Mr. Gualther. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel, 14th day before the Kalends of November 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zurich, his most revered father.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
