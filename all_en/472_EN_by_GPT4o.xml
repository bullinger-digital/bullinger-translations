      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear friend. We have received your letter along with the attached document, which those from Konstanz are supposed to have submitted and committed to, but we have found and seen here at the beginning of the document a different introduction upon our arrival. However, regarding the introduction and title, it brings the good people as little as the small relief that you have sent us. It is the third sheet for us, which has been delayed and not yet delivered, etc.</p>
      <p>That those from Zürich have resolved in councils and citizens, regarding the union as their ancestors did, etc., is incomprehensible to us; for more than one union they resolved and committed to many years ago. As for our recent news, we have nothing to report to you, except that the emperor's son has been in Heidelberg and in the land of Württemberg, etc., and has moved to Speyer, where it is expected that he will take the route down the Rhine.</p>
      <p>We did not want to withhold this from you in our well-meaning haste. May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 20th of March, in the year 1549. G[eorg], C[ount] of W[ürttemberg].</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
