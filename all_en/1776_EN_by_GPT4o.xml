      <p>Most illustrious man, I barely received your letters yesterday, which you wrote on November 8th and sent to Chur in the Grisons; indeed, messengers are often not reliable. But they were welcome nonetheless, even if old. I was glad to hear that the vessels have been halted; for I think it will be necessary to send them back, for our heart is in the hand of God.</p>
      <p>But I will write about those later. You wisely advise about the Valtellina, when you say that care must be taken to prevent it from becoming a den of corrupt-minded men. I confess I fear the same and have written to you about this matter more than once. The evil is growing, believe me, Heinrich Bullinger, I know what I am writing, and in the meantime, those who wish to be watchmen do not come up with any remedy. I wish it were not for the reason I suspect! You will hear from me in person. But in the meantime, to prevent the plague from spreading, you can achieve much with your authority, and I implore you by the immortal God to do so.</p>
      <p>Thus far I had written two days ago (for some guests were an obstacle to me, and I could not finish the letters). Now I will continue and write something new about Camillo, which I learned yesterday.</p>
      <p>Sondrio is a famous city of the Valtellina, indeed more famous than all the others; in it, therefore, Camillo has begun to court and solicit this one and that one, to be appointed to the school, which could bring nothing worse to that city and valley.</p>
      <p>Our lords in the last assembly provided by a very serious decree that no one can preside over the school there who has not been approved by our synod. Camillo knows this; he despises the synod and dares to court against the decree. With what supports do you think he dares so much? Not with light ones (believe me) and he will prevail unless God helps us. But enough about him. I am returning the letter you wrote to the pastors of the churches in Chur; for since the opportunity of the synod has passed and it can now be of little use, I also feared that your authority might be held in less regard by them in the future if they suspected you were writing at my urging. Such are the times, such are the minds. Farewell and be well, my Bullinger. Pray to the Lord for me with the whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, December 11, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
