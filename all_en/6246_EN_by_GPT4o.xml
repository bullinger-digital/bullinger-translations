      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Although I am not accustomed to sending you letters from here, because I consider it wrong to distract you, who are entangled in many and very serious affairs, with my trivial matters, yet on this occasion of this newly printed booklet, I could not restrain myself from respectfully greeting you with these few lines and sending the book. Indeed, I suspected it would be more pleasing to you for the reason that it is the last work of Mr. Calvin and in the preface, it explains the transition of that most excellent man, who was very closely connected to you, to a better life, and also adds a catalog of all his books.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell, most illustrious man, we will pray to God that He may preserve you for a long time for His glory and the benefit of the church. Geneva, 7th day before the calends of September 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Ulisse Martinengo, Count of Bari.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most upright pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
