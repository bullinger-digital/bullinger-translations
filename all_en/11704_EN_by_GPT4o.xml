      <p>Pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Mr. Mayor and gracious, dear gentlemen, my friendly greetings, willing service, and whatever I can offer you in honor, love, and goodness, are prepared for you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear gentlemen, I have received your letter concerning a schoolmaster and have well understood its contents; I have immediately turned to the appointed authorities of our gracious lords and, to your satisfaction and also for the benefit of the young man, have earnestly sought a willing leave. This has also been willingly granted to him, to your honor and pleasure, and he has been earnestly instructed to serve you faithfully, uprightly, honestly, obediently, and willingly, as he is well trusted, having been obedient, well-studied, and conducted himself honorably thus far. However, he is allowed with this condition, since he was raised at the expense of our gracious lords and is obligated to them, that if our lords find it necessary, they may recall him and he should be obedient to them in this; they are confident that such will not be a burden to you. They also request you most friendly to receive the good young man faithfully. I have wanted to answer you simply and humbly to your friendly letter. I ask you to take it in the best way from me and to treat Christoph, your new schoolmaster, in a friendly and fatherly manner.</p>
      <p>Where I can serve you, do you good and please you, you shall always find me willing. The grace of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 17th of September, in the year 1542. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise mayor and council of Winterthur, his gracious, dear lords.</p>
