      <p>Greetings in Jesus Christ, who is the true and only salvation, most illustrious men. The fact that you have not received any letters from me since my departure from your excellencies should not be thought to have happened because I did not love or respect you greatly, but because in these calamitous times I still had nothing certain about my situation, I did not want to bring you anxiety from my doubt nor false hope from my affirmation. Indeed, I have been appointed by the most illustrious Prince Duke Ottheinrich, Elector Palatine of the Rhine, etc., to the highest presidency (προεδρία) or, as they call it, superintendency of all the churches in the entire duchy, in which I will exert all the strength of my age, so that I may display what befits a good and faithful minister.</p>
      <p>I have indeed undertaken a great burden, and it is not as pleasing as it is laborious to me, even though I have a sufficiently kind prince who supports me with a sufficiently liberal stipend, namely three hundred florins with enough grain for my family. Nevertheless, for me, an old man, it is quite troublesome in these times to endure such great labors, let alone courtly intrigues. As for the religion of this region, Osiander of Nuremberg had previously prescribed, before the most unjust expulsion of my prince from the principality by the emperor, an almost papistic and worthless order for our churches, which was not very acceptable to either the prince or the people. This order, before my arrival, was renewed by a certain furious Lutheran and, despite many protests, has been observed to this day.</p>
      <p>However, I have not wanted to submit to this order to this day, nor will I ever submit. But because this year, having left my parish, I have acted as a preacher at the court and thus kept myself untainted by such papistic practices, that is, without any papistic vestments, relying on the hope that my most illustrious prince promised to adopt another order, namely the Württemberg order, which is very pure and newly issued. If the prince does this in the name of the Lord, it is well; if not, I would rather leave, as I do not want to put on the beggar's sack and see the spectacle mass, which has given birth to the metaxistic mass, any longer. But I hope for much better things with the accession of some good men who will also subscribe to my opinion. May the Lord God grant a happy return to my prince, so that he may soon establish a pious and Christian visitation throughout his entire dominion, so that apostates may be expelled and good and learned men may be substituted in their place. For the most illustrious prince wrote to me that within a few weeks he wishes to establish the long-expected visitation.</p>
      <p>These are the things, most illustrious men, that I wanted to briefly convey to your gentleness this time. Farewell in Christ Jesus most happily. Greet for me the wives, children, sons-in-law, and the entire family of each of you most vehemently, to whom I dedicate myself entirely and wish well from the heart; for I have been kindly received and treated by all and each of you.</p>
      <p>In haste, very quickly from Neuburg, June 13, 1553. Your devoted and humble brother Johannes Ehinger of Augsburg, chief superintendent in the entire Duchy of Neuburg.</p>
      <p>Do not disdain to greet the good and venerable old man, Lord Konrad Pellikan, my old host, in my name, I earnestly ask.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned men, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger and Dr. Theodor Bibliander, professors of sacred theology, most worthy overseers of the Church of Zurich, their most esteemed lords and patrons, to be honored with eternal veneration.</p>
