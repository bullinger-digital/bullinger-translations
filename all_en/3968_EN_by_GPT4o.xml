      <p>S. P. Your letters were most welcome to me and my dear Parkhurst, most distinguished man, either because they were from you, to whom we can never forget how much we owe, or because they retained the deepest traces of your kindness and humanity towards us, which we experienced to the fullest during our entire time of exile. And if only we could somehow repay a part of your piety! Whatever happens, we will certainly never lack the spirit. Your encouragement for us to conduct ourselves vigorously and bravely was not only not unwelcome to us, but almost necessary.</p>
      <p>For at this time, we have to struggle not only with adversaries but also with our friends (who in recent years have defected from us and conspired with the enemies, and now resist much more fiercely and stubbornly than any enemies), and what is most troublesome, with the remnants of the Spaniards, that is, with the most vile vices, pride, luxury, and lust. We indeed do, and have done, what we could.</p>
      <p>May God grant success and give increase! But so far we live in such a way that we scarcely seem to have been restored from exile.</p>
      <p>For I will say nothing else, not even that any of us has yet been restored to his own: although this long expectation is troublesome to us, yet we do not doubt that it will be well shortly. For we have a queen who is both prudent and pious, and favorable and gracious to us.</p>
      <p>Religion has been restored to the place it was under King Edward: I do not doubt that your letters and exhortations to your republic have brought much weight to this matter. The queen does not wish to be called or written as the head of the Church of England: for she gravely responded that this dignity is attributed only to Christ, and is not suitable for any mortal; furthermore, those titles have been so foully contaminated by the antichrist that they can no longer be piously used by anyone. Our academies are so afflicted and ruined that at Oxford there are scarcely two who agree with us, and they themselves are so dejected and broken that they can do nothing. Thus, Brother Sotto and another, I know not who, a Spanish monk, have completely uprooted all those things which Dr. Martyr had most beautifully planted, and have reduced the Lord's vineyard to desolation. You would scarcely believe that such devastation could have been brought about in so short a time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, although I would otherwise derive great pleasure if I could see even a dog from Zürich in England, yet I cannot advise at this time that you send your young men to us for the sake of letters or religion, unless you wish them to be returned to you impious and barbarous. Recently, Mr. Russell asked me by what means he could make himself pleasing to you and your brothers and fellow students. He evidently felt that he wished to send something to you as a gift for the sake of your humanity, which he always praises, and hospitality. I truly believe that nothing would be more pleasing to you and yours than if he diligently and bravely propagated the religion of Christ and diminished the insolence of the papists.</p>
      <p>He both promised to do this and certainly does as much as he can. Today, the ambassadors of the King of France arrived in London to congratulate on the peace: the leader of the delegation is a young Memorancius. As for the queen's marriage, nothing yet.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the son of Johann Friedrich and the second brother of Maximilian are vying for it. However, public suspicion leans towards Pickering, an Englishman, a man both prudent and pious, and endowed with royal dignity of body. May God turn it to good, whatever it will be!</p>
      <p>These are the first letters I have written to you separately since I returned to England: but since I know that what I wrote to Dr. Martyr, he had in common with you because of that great connection between you, I do not doubt that whatever I wrote to him, I can say was also written to you. Farewell, my father, and most esteemed lord in Christ.</p>
      <p>Greet that excellent woman, your wife; Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Simler, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Zwingli.</p>
      <p>If ever there is anything in which I can be of pleasure or use to you or yours, I promise you not only my effort, zeal, diligence, but also my mind and body. May 22, London, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, John Jewel.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ in the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
