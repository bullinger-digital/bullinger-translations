      <p>S. I received letters from your kindness, the first through those who were returning from the wedding, the latter through those who came here for the fair. As for your inquiry about dances, they are allowed at weddings; but now, for some time, they have not even been permitted at weddings and are generally prohibited in this dangerous and calamitous time.</p>
      <p>However, there are those who dance against the laws, and during these past carnival days, dancing took place in more than one location; whether a fine should be imposed on the dancers, I do not know.</p>
      <p>It would be required if it were pursued officially. I see that the frivolity of the times invites us to dance enough, to be ensnared by those who lead us captive or otherwise leap from house and home; then we have enough of our own dance. Beware not to involve yourself in the episcopal cause by defending or opposing these or those parties; you should always encourage peace and caution them not to become entangled in a war, from which the damage is not repaired, but rather increased and doubled; indeed, all the damages of war are irreparable, etc. In this most restless time, I would not expose Daniel to the church, but rather Isaiah or from the minor prophets Jonah or Zechariah or Malachi, then Isaiah. You will be able to understand from the shorter ones whether it is beneficial and acceptable to the church to add a more extensive one like Isaiah or Jeremiah.</p>
      <p>You will have the assistance of those who have written on them, and I will gladly share my notes with you for a while, until you have copied them, which could be done shortly, during which time mine would be returned to me. I believe Flavius has been sent to Constantinople to deliver some royal letters there and to ascertain what is to be expected from the Turks in the coming summer.</p>
      <p>I hear from everyone coming from Italy that the persecutions of the faithful are increasing, from which I gather that God will soon attempt and accomplish something with them. I pray the Lord to strengthen and comfort His own. Count Petilianus, a truly excellent man, is well known to me; I pity his fate; I pray the Lord to restore him. From France, we have nothing more than what I last wrote. The prince with his followers reached Orléans, invited by the king; what he is doing now, we do not know.</p>
      <p>The wedding in Munich was completed in Bavaria between the Bavarian and the Lorraine on February 22. Many princes gathered there, not so much to celebrate the wedding as to weave plots against us. Some whisper that Emperor Maximilian is considering attacking the Palatinate as a rebel through Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, a relative, with added circles, etc., and that the Palatinate recently intercepted some balls transported via the Rhine and sent from Italy, in which a great amount of gold was being carried; and when the carriers denied this was the case, they say all the goods along with the main carrier were taken to Heidelberg. But also that Johann Wilhelm of Saxony came to Metz with his cavalry, where many left him. I do not affirm these as certain, but I report to you as the rumor reached us. I will write more when I am better.</p>
      <p>For 8 days now, I have been suffering from a severe flow from the head to the chest and lungs, which cuts off my voice and furthermore enervates me completely, so that I can do nothing. May the Lord's will be done. May the Lord keep you! Greet the friends, the three consuls, Gantner, Pontasella, etc. I pray, my dear Tobias, that you write to Mr. Campello that I have just now received his letters written on January 2 along with the book "On the Authority of Scripture" and that I will examine and respond to him when I have recovered and have leisure.</p>
      <p>Greet him, our excellent brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 5, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
