      <p>The most humane letter dated the 10th of November was delivered to me, most illustrious man and most esteemed Antistes, which I immediately took care to deliver to the church of Locarno, so that they may know your diligence and readiness of spirit towards them, about which they have never doubted nor can they doubt. But regarding what you write, that I am angry with you and spew out dire things, I thought it worthwhile to excuse myself to you with this letter. Therefore, let anyone who has called you a frivolous man or one who thinks poorly of religion be well; for I call God as a witness upon my soul, that what I wrote was not intended to be transferred to your person nor to any other honest and Christian man. The same spirit, which has united us in one bond of peace, bears witness to my spirit of your sincerity, modesty, purity, and non-hypocritical holiness, and how you are a vigorous soldier in defending the religion of Christ, not only the pious but also the impious know all.</p>
      <p>However, I would wish that among my illustrious lords of Zürich and the supporters of the Christian religion in the other cities, the lies of the impious would have no effect, but that the truth would be brought to light and the glory of God and Christ would be held in such high regard.</p>
      <p>I would also wish that the seven republics would respond, since they say that scarcely 20 honest men can be found who have embraced the true religion and that these same men are tainted with Anabaptist depravity, unless in Locarno there are more than one hundred and twenty honest men and women who have wholeheartedly and with clear oral confession accepted the orthodox religion with the people of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, and that they would absolutely not want to abandon their cause. Which would certainly be fair and just, since the Locarnese themselves have listed one hundred and forty people on a schedule. And now if the seven cities wish to withdraw from threats, I do not doubt that two hundred and fifty Christians can be found. Now I think these things should be omitted, since they are very true, and we should come to the articles or chapters that you wrote to me; for you write many things that seem very likely to me, and although it is not my place to teach my most prudent lords, nevertheless, what I feel in this matter, I have decided to make manifest to you with my letters.</p>
      <p>In the first place, this is my argument. What could the Swiss peace have derogated from the subjects? Or, because the people of Zürich were defeated, should the other cities or republics exercise tyranny over Locarno? They will say: "Because we were superior with the Locarnese, who were with us in the field, and we overcame the people of Zürich, therefore the Locarnese and other subjects are bound to follow our religion." What kind of argument is this? Indeed, even if in the letters of peace this had been decreed by the people of Zürich, that the Locarnese for the sake of peace or reconciliation should be bound to follow the religion of the Seven Cantons, it would be unjust and could not be defended by law. But this is (as they say) a stronger argument: the Locarnese four or five years ago bound themselves to this with their own handwriting voluntarily and not being called. I respond: Whoever among the Locarnese promised this to the republics are rebels and worthy of death, since they did this without the knowledge of the other cities. But I hold an even stronger response: firstly, I affirm that such a promise is not valid unless it was made with the consent of all, at least by the heads of the households; secondly, because it was not made with the twelve principalities; thirdly, because it was made under coercion, as is evident from the threatening letters of the seven republics themselves; and lastly, because it was not made in the proper ways and with certain ceremonies, as is the custom everywhere. All these things I write are very true, and they will be evident, if necessary, my lord Heinrich. What will the seven republics dare to respond to these things? But so as not to detain you with many words, most illustrious man, the Christian Locarnese have decided, with the Lord providing strength, namely to submit their own necks to punishment for the glory of God and the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, even if the four Christian cities themselves have deserted them. May the Lord grant them constancy of spirit and confession of faith and have mercy on them and on us. Amen. Farewell, and may you deign to remember me in your prayers to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, 12th of November, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and most prudent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>From Zürich.</p>
