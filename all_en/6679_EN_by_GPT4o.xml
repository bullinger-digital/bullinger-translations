      <p> To the honorable lord and father, I have recently informed you in a brief summary about how our dealings have proceeded. Since I have seen and found in the separation that the two Leagues have given the Godshouse a rightful recognition and have placed Ylantz in the Upper League, yet they have also consented to write to the communities about their concerns; for the envoys of the legal decree had no command from their communities. If God does not protect us out of special grace, the matter will not proceed without difficulty, and if the remaining two Leagues bring the Godshouse to help for its freedom, it would be next to them as well. However, religion is more important to me than the temporal; for if the priests, after their manifold mistreatment, uphold this matter against a common Godshouse with force, what will be too much for them in the future? For so far they have maintained nothing else in mastery than that they have dared to take nothing into their hands without the foreknowledge and counsel of the common Godshouse, which they have so far recognized as their protectors and superiors. They would have long since established a Jesuit school at court; thus, the supreme authority has been in their way. Nevertheless, they have secretly introduced two young Jesuits under the pretense that they are chaplains, who, however, secretly hold school; it has been almost a year since they have been present. There is no need for much disputing: if the priests succeed, the bell is already cast. Now the poor common man does not understand everywhere what is at stake, and out of hatred for the Salic law, they do many things that are connected with their own ruin. Those in the courts would be good; but the Landammann's daughter in Davos is the brother of Lord Batten; it confuses the common people. Whatever it is, I am no more anxious than a Christian should be; I know I must watch, but also pray. Our many sins make me fear; I predicted this long ago in such a republic. It all depends on whether the communities of the remaining two Leagues can be thoroughly informed. If they remain silent, Lord Batt will take what is possible; for some of his own see where it leads and that neither they nor Lord Batten are helped. They see what the Five Cantons are plotting, etc. The communities would be easily informed if one were to negotiate with ministers. But it is so bad that they cannot believe it. In Davos is the son of the mayor of St. Gallen, Ulrich Schlumpff, who, when I passed through St. Gallen on my way home, did not say a word to me about his calling, nor has he written a letter since, yet he has given the nearest ministers reason to believe that I promoted him there. The matter is very suspicious to me; he is a most devoted disciple of Sulzer, etc. Elsewhere, it is just as bad; but no one wants to take it to heart. Dr. Gallitius would like to do the best in this matter; for he clearly sees what is being sought; but he has lost much authority, etc. - I am sending you a copy of the letter that a Godshouse has sent to the city of Zurich and other places. And as I have understood from young Hansen von Castelmur, young Nicolaus Pellizär, who has taken up the letters to answer, has failed; for he is advised that he must deliver the letters to Baden next, where I told young Hansen it would be more appropriate to present the matters to a mayor in Zurich, etc. If the letter had come to Baden, you could share this copy with Mayor Müller. However, my request is that you let it come back to me in 8 days; for I have no copy, etc. If it were possible for the city of Zurich to take on this matter, it would be very beneficial. This would have to proceed in such a way that the city of Zurich or also the other cities write to the 10 Courts in particular, then to the Upper League in particular with this opinion: how they have understood the adversity of these lands; it would be truly regrettable for them (in the 10 Courts, as it is evangelical, one could do so much more good), and since a Godshouse is replaced, also highly complaining about the legal decree and fearing that through internal war, which may arise from it, foreign lords might laugh through their fingers, and the pope might use some division to his advantage and our ruin, therefore they would first kindly deal with a Godshouse and help take other measures, through which the matter would be settled in such a way that both sides could remain in peace and each part by its freedoms, etc. These and other things. Thus, our gracious lords of Zurich have also written to the 10 Courts in the French matter, as they were restless, and have achieved much good with it, and I do not doubt that through a friendly letter much could be improved. If then the 10 Courts do not take on the matter, the Batten would gladly accept a settlement, through which the priests could be kept in check. You say the Zurichers do not involve themselves in these matters. I respond: on the serious writing of a Godshouse, they have many reasons. If the other places stand by them, it is all the better. One would have to write to each League in particular. - Now hear these secrets, by which you see whether it is necessary for the city of Zurich and all of us; these you should tell to no one except the consul. Now it would still be possible to prevent; afterwards, it is too late. It must happen promptly. Besides, Joß Tschudi has uttered very defiant words here against our religion and is said to have called our faith a woman's faith, and in Hans Willi's house, when young Peter Travers came to speak with him, he let many words fall; for when he said that the Seven Places wanted to keep it that way and no other, and Peter Travers answered that there are other places in the Confederation more than the 7, where one has confidence in them, they would not allow anyone to be overpowered, and when Zurich and Bern were named hereupon, he said: 'That then God's wounds shame us that we have not long since smeared each other; for it must be so.' Thereupon young Peter Travers answered: '[How smear?] [You have] perhaps long had it in mind, but did not have the heart' etc. These and many things. - When young Lucy Ringg was here for his business (who is otherwise now under the abbot of St. Gallen and was also recently at Feldkirch at the Batten council) and had gone to bed somewhat tipsy and lay in young Nicolaus Pellizär's chamber and young Nicolaus asked him during the descent what he thought of this episcopal matter, he answered that Lord Batt must be bishop, and no other. And when Pellizär answered that thereby the articles would not be held together, he said that these articles were established by the peasants, neither confirmed by the emperor nor the pope. When this one spoke further, in this way a bishop in Constance would also have much to say to the Zurichers, who have belonged to his diocese from ancient times, whereupon Ringg said: 'He also has and will speak to them, and now is the time; for it must finally come into effect, with which one has long dealt. If the 7 Places are not strong enough, the papal holiness will also provide its help along with other more potentates, etc.' Otherwise, Lord Bellievre has spoken with me and also hinted at how the pope will take one after the other with the help of the 5 Places, and if he had the Leagues, he would reach further, etc. Therefore, it is well to be vigilant. God protect us from all evil. Amen. - On Ash Wednesday, a common Godshouse day is set here in Chur. I suspect that on the same day, people will be appointed to ride to the communities. </p>
      <p> If God had not fixed me to this republic like a rock, I would have long since thought of fleeing with Jonah. For you know that when Bishop Thomas died, I wrote to you then that I foresaw great disturbances as if from a watchtower, which nevertheless could not be avoided or evaded in any way. Thus, since I have been here, one movement always follows another, and there is no end. What if fatal necessity urges us, with our sins thus demanding? </p>
      <p> Chur, February 11, 1566. </p>
