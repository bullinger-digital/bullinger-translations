      <p>Greetings. I have received both the letters and that admirable and astonishing picture. I have now handed it over to Froschauer, who, I believe, will print it. The added German verses please me very much. If he does not print it, I will certainly return it.</p>
      <p>But listen, my dear Tobias: I hear that the royal envoy, who is with you, has blamed all the disturbances in the Rhaetian territories on us, the preachers of Zurich, before the Swiss envoys in Baden, although you know very well how much injustice he does to us in this matter. We cannot ignore this slander and undeserved and utterly false accusation. You know best what kind of letters I have written to you and how much I have urged concord, how much I have grieved that Rhaetia is in such turmoil. I thought he was our friend, as he pretended to be; but now we find him to be an enemy, although we have never offended him in any matter, not even in word, etc.</p>
      <p>Our merchants have not yet returned from Strasbourg; they will bring letters, I believe, about the affairs in the Netherlands; we expect them any hour. If I receive anything worth mentioning, I will share it. I have read the proceedings with Mr. Conradin Planta. But Kererus tells me that the people of Breval are again in turmoil against him. I pray the Lord to settle these matters. The danger will increase if they rush into arms again. I have nothing to add to this now.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 11.</p>
      <p>If my cousin Josue Bullinger, a furrier, who is now with his wife at the baths in Pf√§ffers, should send you a letter or offer something, let me know, etc. 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my gracious lord and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Your letters, most reverend father, would have wounded me deeply, had I not hoped that our innocence, soon to be established, would expose the injustice of others.</p>
      <p>I could bring forth cartloads of letters into the open, if necessary, in which, without any bitterness, you have always sympathized with our misfortunes and been ready to arm us for peace and concord, not for quarrels and seditions. Indeed, those fatherly admonitions of yours, which we have entrusted to no unfaithful person, have had such weight with us that, as far as the word of God and our duty allowed, we have so moderated our tongues and actions, whatever the impudent mouth may slander, that we have given no occasion for any dissensions nor any reason for anyone to think ill of us. All good people will testify to this, and anyone who has not yet descended to such madness as to sell their voices and support disgracefully, inflicting the most cruel wounds of turmoil and dismemberment on their sweetest homeland. You will marvel from the preface of this matter, which I write more slowly because of the business, at our modesty in such an impudent case, and conversely at the almost unparalleled ferocity of our adversaries. I cannot omit to anticipate my composition with some instructions once sent to my brother Victor Fabricius and to send you those which we have consulted, so that you may judge whether I am the author and instigator of that murder of Planta. At the same time, I also send the most false accusation of the same, which I sent to you before, if I am not mistaken, along with the most vigorous and true response or apology of our most honorable senate, which was not only sent to the Upper League but also openly recited in that judgment and theater of reformation, so that it was abundantly clear to all about our innocence, and even the judges themselves said: 'Now it is clear who is at fault.' Add to this that from the intimate friends and counselors of the Rhaetian himself, when he was in extreme fortune, a certain distinguished man and dear to me secretly reported to me that the Rhaetian himself, when the capital sentence was being decided, exonerated us from all blame in the secret councils held among his friends; of which testimony and exoneration we will have a reliable witness, if necessary. Let that excellent ambassador now go and falsely claim that we are the authors of this murder, whom the murdered man himself affirmed to be blameless. However, I would like that document and two copies to be kept with you until both the preceding and subsequent matters are joined, and all doubt about our doctrine and instructions is removed from you. - As for the matter of the tithes, which is now being handled rather unhappily (as you will gather from the letters given to me by Mr. Ruinelli), I do not doubt that another accusation will be derived from that very matter. For nothing is denied to our bishop of Chur, as far as we know, nor even to the bishop of Como concerning those things that pertain to him. The people of Sondrio only ask to be freed from their burdens like the other churches of the Valtellina, so that they are not treated more harshly, who provide the loyalty of subjects no less than others, as was stipulated at the time of the reformation by a certain diploma, as some prudent men still well remember. However, whatever this business is, it is utterly false that it is being conducted or urged by us. For whatever that adulterer has spewed against his Cantons, I call God and the whole world to witness that I have never mentioned it even with a single word from the pulpit, although both my duty and the cause itself could have advised it. But since the old wound has not yet healed and we are attacked from all sides by our adversaries, I have deliberately and intentionally abstained from that cause so far, lest it happen to us as it once did to the rash man who, desiring to lift a stone too heavy for his strength, earned disgrace. Therefore, hold this firm: a greater and more impudent lie has never been spread since the beginning of the world than what he has disseminated no less impudently than imprudently. My whole church will testify that I have never, never touched that cause of reforming the tithes. However, we cannot in any way abstain from the private conversation of the oppressed, without, like scribes, translating the decrees of the lords or those brought to us in Italian or Latin to help the afflicted people with our little assistance. If this is turned into a fault against us, let it also be turned against the public scribes, who are in the same boat with us and of whom very few can translate those intricate documents into our language, in which Mr. Campellus is very experienced. From here, those accusations are drawn by those who wish to oppress the poor people and are very indignant with us if we have even deemed them worthy of our conversation, whom they would like to see wandering destitute of all favor and help, provided that the truth does not emerge along with the lies and tricks of some. Therefore, I cannot sufficiently marvel at the brazen face of that detractor of ours, who slanders me as inciting the people against the senators in the manner of a tribune and directing my sermons to undermine the obedience due to our magistrate and foreign ones, which would certainly be a seditious act, as is evident from the adversaries of Christ, who, accusing him of sedition, slandered him to Caesar for not paying the tribute or denying that it should be paid. I wonder again what drove the man to bear such an honorable testimony about me among such a kind of people, whose favor we have all long since lost. I do not remember ever having offended him in any matter; but this is the reward that is paid by the children of this world for faithful labors. Immortal God, what have I not done in the midst of these most dangerous turmoils, so that the king's affairs might remain intact! The mercenaries urged me, and among them especially the one most closely connected to the orator, to counter the Hispanizing with a written composition (which I sent to you long ago among other acts) among our fellow ministers, lest the artifice and deceit of the treaties prevail and those who are paid by the nobles be deprived of their honors and ranks with no small danger to the friendship and renewed alliance between the king and the Rhaetians. These and many other things I have always executed with a certain religiousness and the utmost fidelity, and I have consulted not so much for my own reputation, which easily suffers in this matter among the rustics, as for the public peace, and now the most ungrateful of all mortals returns this gratitude to me. But why do I bring these things to light? Rather, a plan should be taken to bind this wound, which the man's treachery has inflicted on us.</p>
      <p>We will eagerly hear how you wish to conduct yourselves. It seems to us worthwhile to summon the man as soon as the senate of the Three Leagues has convened; if, due to his arrogance and the virtue with which he is endowed, he refuses to appear, we will nevertheless complain to our fathers about everything, although we have dealt with the same matter more than once, and we will seek a testimony of our innocence, which we will send to the Swiss along with our apology, filled with just acrimony to cover the man with shame, whom, if he wishes, he may redeem by legal action.</p>
      <p>I am sure he will not impose any on us, knowing that he is unequal to Alexander in keeping the other ear. It is strange that such a brain, if it is a brain, remains in such a great man. I remember what happened to my predecessor, F[abricius] M[ontanus], when the faith and rashness of the Italians were so great that there was a danger that, for their sake, against whom he had sharpened his pen during the council, he would be expelled from the territories of Rhaetia and Switzerland by the impulse of the Cantons. Perhaps those who so easily allow themselves to be persuaded that we are those incendiaries to whom that conflagration should be attributed are also nurturing that monster. This will be more easily obtained, the more difficult they are for us, who have hitherto borne with great difficulty that we have skimmed off the dregs of the Anabaptists and Svencfeldians along with the most wicked Arians.</p>
      <p>We ask you, however, not to fail us with your counsel and assistance, especially me, who would offend your senate more gravely if we did not blunt those rumors with the most effective apology, since something similar has begun to arise among us, but has been prudently buried again, of which your people would say that I was the occasion and source, for which they would be most angry with me.</p>
      <p>But who could obstruct all the courses and conduits of water? The only consolation of a good conscience comforts me, which always lives happily in righteousness. - You rightly warn that the venomous cause of the bull is not yet properly settled. The rustics of the Rhaetian Valley are murmuring, the people of Pregallia and many others are murmuring because Conradin has escaped unpunished. Many blame us two witnesses, as if we had testified more modestly, who knew more atrocious things. Immortal God, why do we deal with such a distorted kind of people? Now we are milder than we should be, whom they previously condemned for Stoic rigor.</p>
      <p>Does not the time suggest that we should finally cultivate peace? We could have brought forward some rather harsh things, from which no small danger could have arisen for Conradin; but what other consequence would there have been than that we are bloodthirsty priests who remit nothing, observe no modesty, and attribute nothing to these afflicted times, etc.? Now that we have been more moderate, the rustics shout that we are inconsistent and the authors of not removing the evil from the midst. Thus, the hatred of all people converges on us; thus, we can never satisfy some seditious people, who I greatly fear will have a master who is not very peaceful, who can hardly remain hidden any longer. Let our detractor take from here and there the danger that we are accused by the rustics not of sedition, but of clemency. However, they are still so furious that in recent days Conradin was forced (as many confidently report) to take refuge in the port. For at night, through the paths of the excellent mountain in rainy weather, he went to Chur, where he is nevertheless tolerated with great annoyance and envy. For the citizens fear that, for his sake, the rustics will again take up arms and besiege the city, weary of which they now feel the increased prices of all things.</p>
      <p>The Lord must be earnestly prayed to bind this wound solidly. But to finally end my writing, I will not hesitate to say that everything the envoy has poured out on the Five Cantons originates from Conradin, who seeks to avenge his brother's death on us, although we have spared him in many ways, lest he stand more harshly and dangerously in his cause. This is the gratitude he now returns to us, who otherwise abhors our meetings and sermons like asps. - Please tell Mr. Froschauer, the illustrious man, in my name, to renew his case against our Frellus, who is now leading the matter and not relenting in his treachery.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was interrupted by the goodness and favor of the Lord himself, who did not want to press the children of the exile, especially for the reason that the dispute, which I had with Gantner, a stubborn man, had called me elsewhere. Now, since Frellus himself is present and his wife, a truly pagan woman and more of a beast than a human, has meanwhile profited so much from her arts and tricks that she has made a large sum of money from every matter and can help others by lending, it seems timely to me that the long-interrupted case should be reopened, which will be conveniently done if Mr. F[roschauer] first demands from Frellus in brief letters and informs me again of the remaining sum owed, which I will present to Mr. Consul if I know it, as Frellus's own hand sufficiently testifies; nor would it be necessary to sign again, except for the lords, to whom that new case will seem. Immediately afterward, I will smell what delays they are going to introduce, and I will always advise what is in the interest of Mr. Froschauer, whether I should settle the matter myself or send a messenger to impose an end. It has certainly pained me so far that I could not serve the well-deserving as I intended, due to the malignity of people and the injustice of the times, which, although they are not yet sufficiently settled among us, nevertheless have nothing to do with this cause of his, etc. I sincerely ask you, most esteemed lord, to kindly forgive my loquacity and always consider me committed to you and your fatherhood.</p>
      <p>Above all, we will expect your advice soon, whether it is more advisable to take the path I mentioned or another. For I cannot be at peace, since the tongue of that adversary of ours is so virulent that he did not want to spare even you, who are most alien to all blame, but burdens your most peace-loving minds with such crimes that the children of this world, without any regard for equity and justice, indulging in avarice and pleasures, commit. But another thing occurs: namely, that he finds it difficult to do without Flavio and Helena, whom he suspects were expelled by our fault, therefore now contemplating revenge.</p>
      <p>For Herod could no longer bear John the Baptist, etc. But I cease to divine, lest I touch the matter with a needle.</p>
      <p>Finally, greet your reverence and your entire most distinguished choir most dutifully in the name of all of us, which Mr. Consuls, Mr. Campellus, Mr. Pontisella, and Carolus and Victor, etc., also do.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, 1572, July 14.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief and most illustrious pastor of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
