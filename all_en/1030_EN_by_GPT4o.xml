      <p> S. I am convinced, most learned Bullinger, that it is by divine providence that those masters of Leuven, with a certain remarkable impudence, have once again wanted to make their madness of inertia known to the world. I am so far from being grieved that they have condemned me, that I even congratulate myself on this very fact, that they have deemed me worthy to be numbered among such an illustrious group of the condemned. For I see that they condemn as heretics only the most pious men and the most knowledgeable in the old ecclesiastical and apostolic doctrine, and among these very men, all the old and orthodox teachers, indeed even Christ himself and his apostles, while they consider themselves and their own, in so many ways barbarous and lazy and advocates of extreme audacity, to be Catholics and orthodox in their newly born and so charmingly adorned church. </p>
      <p> What need will there be for the Council of Trent, if the Sorbonne of Leuven is so highly esteemed by the Emperor, that it can inspect the truth with lynx eyes and pronounce on it separately, without consulting the churches of so many kingdoms and provinces, and condemn a part, which is not taught even a single iota of why it is worthy of condemnation. </p>
      <p> The Emperor promises a free and impartial examination of the doctrine of faith at Augsburg and does not consider anyone to be condemned before they are heard; Leuven condemns and proscribes all those who in any way oppose their vernacular religion. Who does not see that these Pallas cannot be born from the same brain of the earthly Jupiter, but that the papal crowd is truly a beast of many heads, which nevertheless disguises and displays the treachery of its arts in the name and authority of the supreme monarch, and does not strive for anything more than to make themselves unworthy of trust, whatever they may promise to the world. </p>
      <p> It will therefore be easy for us to reject their councils and to preserve ourselves for more favorable circumstances, until we see that Charles will consult the glory of his name and office in this whole matter, so that it is most carefully deliberated about seeking the truth of the scriptures, and finally sees that neither divine nor natural equity can bear that those who are accused in this controversy of religion by the whole world should arrogate or assume any faculty of pronouncing judgment. </p>
      <p> We must see where all the disloyalty wants to turn and must insist that we in the Confederation do not allow any means for these knaves, through which a commendable common freedom of all of us might be in any way divided and brought to fall. Let them quarrel among themselves and be assured that we will come to the matter soon enough. However, we want to resolve. If I receive anything, I will inform you promptly. In Magdeburg, they have translated the Leuven edict and let it go out in print; it will soon arrive here. Master Hans Fries has ridden off in haste; he never came to me. He needed something from me; but I think well, he did not do it with bad intention. What you sent, I return and I am grateful for your remarkable loyalty. </p>
      <p> Farewell. St. Gallen, 28th of September, in the year 1550. Joachim Vadian. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his very esteemed lord. </p>
