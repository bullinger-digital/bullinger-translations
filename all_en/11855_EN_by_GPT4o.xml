    <p xml:id="regest1">Has been suffering from constant headaches for over a month and a half, so he couldn't read everything [from Stumpf] - which undoubtedly finds his recognition. Sends copies from an old book of the St. Gallen Monastery, along with the annotations on Caesar by [Johannes] Rhellikan, who contradicts [Heinrich] Glarean and [Aegidius] Tschudi in many ways; asks for their return along with Glarean's annotations. Stumpf's request, due to the difficult circumstances in the Grüningen office, for an experienced and capable preacher for the Rüti Monastery is not easy to fulfill because of the lack of suitable pastors; [Johannes] Wolf preaches in Höngg, [Johannes] Haller in Eglisau, and Georg Stäheli was sent to Stein [am Rhein], from where he had to return due to illness; Erasmus [Schmid] remains the last hope. Greetings. [Johann Jakob] Ammann has already read Stumpf's books.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>I have been suffering from a constant headache for over a month and a half, and I am still tormented by it, so I have not yet been able to read everything you sent. However, I have no doubt that everything will be pleasing, because the first parts are very much approved by me. I am sending here some things that were transcribed from an old book in the library of the St. Gallen Monastery. I have added the commentaries of Rhellikan on Caesar, so that you may read them with judgment. I see that he opposes many things of Glarean and Tschudi; how successfully, I will not say. But when you have read them, return them along with Glarean's annotations, if it is convenient. Your letters have disturbed me, already troubled and overwhelmed with business, even more, not because I expected anything from the Rüti Monastery, but because I understand from your letters that everything throughout the whole region of Grüningen is very corrupt. I am grieved that the preaching of the gospel is rejected with such contempt and bears no worthy fruit. Meanwhile, I advise and recommend that we attend to our duty, so that it is not our fault. In this matter, you need no exhortation from me. You ask for an elderly, prudent, and learned minister to preach in the monastery these days. And if only we had such an abundance, that we could make the selection you imagine. I am grieved that we can hardly provide for our own churches; it is far from having prudent, experienced, and elderly ones left to send away. Those we had, we have sent away. For several brothers are ill. Wolf preaches in Höngg, Haller in Eglisau; Georg Stäheli was sent to Stein am Rhein with two senators added to him, but he returned unsuccessful and in poor health. Others have gone to other churches. Therefore, unless Erasmus comes, there is no one you can expect. We can hardly do without him, nor do I promise anything. Therefore, understand it as you can. We can do no better, we would gladly do so. In all my sermons, I have dealt with this unrest at the most inconvenient time and do as much as I can; I can do no more, therefore take it as good.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Ammann has already read your books.</p>
