      <p>Greetings. I received from Celio, my father-in-law, your booklet on the Lord's Supper, given to me as a gift by your generosity. I cannot express how grateful I am for it; for all your books, which I have been able to see so far (I have seen many now, not only diligently but also gladly), have always been pleasing and useful to me because of your exceptional and Christian learning in them. However, this booklet is now especially so, not only because, like all your other works, it contains excellent and truly pious doctrine, but also because it served as a token to me and a testimony to others of your goodwill towards me, as you openly declared your remembrance of me by sending this booklet to me. What could be more pleasing to me than to see myself loved by such a great man and counted among the number of his other friends? Therefore, I give great thanks for the booklet, but even greater thanks for your love and effort, and I beseech you to continue to pursue me with your goodwill, since you are in turn greatly respected by me as a father by a son.</p>
      <p>Your son is in good health, excelling (as I hear) in good letters [...] and is greatly loved by all good people (as he should be), both because of his virtues and excellent character and because of you. I (to say nothing of others) will not be lacking in any way, as far as I am concerned, in regard to him.</p>
      <p>As for the hope of obtaining the true opinion on the Lord's Supper from that friend (about whom I spoke with you when I was there), although it has not been entirely taken from me, I found it somehow weakened after my return. For as long as I was away (as you rightly predicted), Satan did not fail [...]. Therefore, the Lord must be asked by you to remove all obstacles to the promotion of His doctrine. Farewell and love me, and greet those learned and pious men there. My wife is in good health and sincerely wishes you much health.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 16th October 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Hieronymus Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and worthy pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered and esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
