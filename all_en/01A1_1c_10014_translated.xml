  <input>ChristophorusStiltzIoanni Enslino presbytero suo salutem in Christo Iesu domino nostro.

Litteras tuas una cum alteris aliena manu descriptas accepi legique. In quibus animum in me tuum sentio quidem et amplector, verum institutum tuum non undiquaque probo, vel quod tu tuique similes vobis ipsis plus satis tribuitis, vel quod ceteros prę vobis quasi umbellas contemnatis; illos, inquam, qui pulmentum a vobis intritum exedere nolunt. Omnibus modis contemnis M. Ioannem Hagnoverum Tigurinum, id quod Paulus, imo Christus vester non docuit. Quid autem? Nempe ut humilitate, tollerantia [!], familiaritate, atque (ne omnia prosequar) christiana mansuetudine et exemplo eos, qui mali sunt aut certe Christum non noverunt, meliores reddamus et Iesum vindicem nostrum etiam moribus illo dignis, nedum ore exprimamus. Multa scribis de verbo dei, quod si tu tuique similes tantam gratiam a deo patre nacti estis, ut etiam Divus Hieronymus, Augustinus ceterique id genus homines et eruditi et pii prae vobis nihil sint. Unde, queso tibi, haec superstitio? An non credam Hieronymo, et vobis credam? Ille Christum etiam factis expressit et suam doctrinam confirmavit, vos vero non facta Christo digna, sed fidem (nescio qualem) etiam sine operibus praefigitis. Sed audi, mi fili, non me, imo Christum in evangelio loquentem: «Ex operibus eorum cognoscetis eos» [Mt 7,16], et iterum: «Luceat», inquit, «lux vestra coram hominibus, ut videant vestra bona opera glorificentque patrem vestrum, qui est i coelis» [Mt 5,16]. An nescis, si fisi fuerimus deo, opera bona ultro consequi? - quae quidem non a nobis, imo a deo patre proficiscuntur per Iesum Christum. Sed quid ego talia, vel sexcentis negotiis distractus!

Conquereris de me, quod non scripserim; at ego conqueror et expostulo, quod tu non rescripseris. Ceterum nihil est quod Ioanni Hagnover scripserim, quam quod institutum tuum displiceat; non inquam, quod uxorem duxeris, quod quidem Christus non prohibuit, sed quod sic dixeris, ut ipsi adhereas, Christum vero dimittas. Qui sic inquies? Nempe quid eo dementiae delapsus es, ut cum ceteris non sacrifices, hoc est missam, ut dicitur, aut legas aut decantes. Hui, iam plenis lateribus paratus es et iam quasi exurgis in me, scio; sed ausculta per Christum Iesum, mi fili. Christum in missa non offerimus aut sacrificamus, qui semel pro peccatis nostris oblatus est, sed preces nostras, quiad extra consecrationem effunduntur ad patrem, etiam ipso Luthero teste; ipsum lege de sacramento altaris. Quod si Lutherus non suffitiat (id quod tamen apud nos increbuit), ecce iam tuo te iugulo gladio, necquicquam est, quod possis praetexere, quam fidem tuam, nescio quam, non secus ac Rütlingius quidam coriarius, qui in Tagerscheim cum rusticis inter pocula disputans de fide, ut fit, coram me et ceteris adseruit non esse infernum nec infernum ex scriptura posse probari, cumque ego adsererem ex scriptura, eo perversitatis delapsus, ut etiam negaret regnum coelorum. Vide, mi fili, quam facile credimus ac a vero recedimus. Verum est quod refero, etiam 20 testibus aut plus probabile.

Porro suboriuntur quidam rumores apud nos, quod Lutherus, Pomeranus, Zuinglius, Matheus Alber Rütlingensis et fortassis quidam alii digladientur inter sese mutuo etiam pessimis convitiis. Lutherus adserit missam, ceteri contemnunt, confessionem atiam auricularem ille admitit, hi consternunt. Cui credam? Ubi scriptura illa facilis, quam vel idiotae intelligere debent, ut homines illi doctissimi non intelligant aut certe non consentiant? Sed quid effecerunt suis illis temere scriptis? Nonne plus quam 10000 virorum in exitium promoverunt? Quod viduas, quot orphanos fecerunt? O bone Iesu, succurre imbecillitati humanae! Non tamen eam culpam in ipsos reiicio [!], sed pro maiori parte in perperam intelligentes. In summa tamen hoc unum prae ceteris displicet in Lutheranis universis, quod convitiis lacessunt singulos; quasi in hoc uno certamen susceperint.

Sed quid ago? Tute me compulisti talia scribere illa tua eleganti satisque pia epistola, quam tuo nomine quidam eruditus homo conscripsit, cui et meo nonmine salutem dicas, rogo, in Christo, atque hortare, ut stilum illum suum exerceat in gloriam Christi, non hominum. Familiariter scripsit, sed in hoc uno duriusculus videtur, quod mihi tribuit me Divo Hieronymo aut «patribus spiritum ita tribuere, ut nihil fere reliqui faciam deploratissimi nostri aeci hominibus». Non ita sane stat mea sententia, imo nulli hominum quicquam tribuo, ni sua probarit ex scriptura. At Hieronymum et Augustinum reliquosque patres, qui scripta sua etiam exemplo et vita homine christiano dignis confirmaverunt, praefero iis, qui fidem etiam sine operibus bonis astruunt, quasi homini christiano sufficiat credidisse sine consequentibus operibus. Verum hoc Christus non docuit, ut supra patuit. Ceterum, quod scribit, vos propterea non cantaturos palinodiam, nec ego propter vos palinodiam canam, nisi probaveritis vestra scripturis, sed non adseretis, opinor, omnia.</input>
  <output>Greetings to John Enslin, priest, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

I have received and read your letters, written in another hand, together with the others. I feel your affection for me and I accept it, but I do not completely approve of your principles, either because you and those like you give yourselves too much credit or because you despise the others as if they were mere umbrellas in comparison to you; I mean those who do not want to eat the crumbs that have fallen from your table. In any case, you despise John Hagnover of Zurich, something that Paul, or even your own Christ, did not teach. What is more? We should use humilty, tolerance, familiarity, and, not to mention all, Christian gentleness and example to make those who are evil or who do not know Christ better, and express our Lord Jesus in deeds as worthy of Him as in words. You write a lot about the Word of God, and suppose that you and those like you have received such grace from God the Father that even Saint Jerome, Augustine and all the other learned and pious people are nothing in comparison to you. Where, I ask you, does this superstition come from? Should I not believe Jerome and believe you instead? He expressed Christ in his deeds as well as in his doctrine and confirmed it, whereas you only set up a faith (I do not know what kind) without works. But listen to me, my son, not to me, but to Christ speaking in the Gospel: “By their works you shall know them” [Mt 7:16], and again: “Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven” [Mt 5:16]. Do you not know that, if we trust in God, good works will follow of their own accord - which, however, do not come from us, but from God the Father through Jesus Christ. But what am I saying, I who am distracted by six hundred matters!

You complain of me for not writing, but I complain and demand that you should not have answered me. However, I have nothing to write to John Hagnover except that I do not approve of your principles; not that you should have married, for Christ did not forbid it, but that you have spoken as if you should cling only to him and leave Christ aside. What kind of madness has made you do such a thing, that you do not sacrifice, that is, say mass, or read or sing, as others do? Ah, now you are ready to fight me with all your might, I know; but listen to Christ Jesus, my son. We do not offer or sacrifice Christ in the mass, who was once offered for our sins, but our prayers, which, outside of the consecration, are poured out to the Father, even according to Luther; read what he says about the sacrament of the altar. If Luther does not mislead us (which, however, is much practised among us), you have already drawn the sword against your own throat, and you have nothing to plead, but your own faith, whatever that may be, in the same way as a certain leather-dresser of Zürich, who, when drinking with some peasants in Tagerscheim, argued about faith, as it happens, and asserted in my presence and that of others that there is no hell and that it cannot be proved from Scripture; and when I maintained that it could be proved from Scripture, he was so perverse as to deny even the kingdom of heaven. See, my son, how easily we believe and depart from the truth. What I say is true, and it can be proved by at least twenty witnesses.

Moreover, there is a rumour among us that Luther, Pomeranus, Zuinglius, Matthew Alber of Zürich, and possibly some others, are quarrelling with one another, even using the severest insults. Luther maintains the mass, the others despise it; he admits the private confession, they reject it. To whom should I believe? Where is that easy Scripture which even idiots ought to understand, so that these most learned men do not understand it or at least do not agree? But what have they done with their rash writings? Have they not caused the ruin of more than 10,000 men? How many widows and orphans have they made? O good Jesus, come to the aid of human weakness! Nevertheless, I do not blame them for it, but I lay the blame for the most part on those who understand it wrongly. In short, what displeases me most of all in all the Lutherans is that they insult each individual with insults; as if they had undertaken this one thing as the subject of their contest.

But what am I doing? It was your elegant and pious letter, written in the name of a certain learned man, that forced me to write such things; give him my greetings in my name, I pray you, and exhort him, in the name of Christ, to use his pen for the glory of Christ and not for that of people. He has written familiarly, but he seems to be a bit hard in this point, that he gives me the credit of giving to the Fathers the spirit so that I do nothing for the deplorable people of our age. My opinion does not stand thus, but I give nothing to any man unless he proves it from Scripture. But I prefer Jerome, Augustine and the other Fathers, who confirmed their writings and also their lives with deeds worthy of a Christian man, to those who maintain faith even without good works, as if it were enough for a Christian man to have believed without the consequent deeds. But Christ did not teach this, as has been said above. However, what he writes, that you will not make a palinode, nor will I make one for your sake, unless you prove yours from Scripture, but I do not think you will maintain all of it.</output>

  <input>Et haec quidem de Erasmo nortro, cuius opusculum «De libero arbitrio» mirum est quam contemnat, non tamen eiusmodi nervis, ut mihi persuadere possit, ut Erasmum aut culpem aut contemnam. Adserit libellum hunc «nedum impium sed blasphemum», non autem addit rationem; hoc est, quod sibi plus tribuit quam Erasmo. At ego nulli quicquam impudentius tribuo, Christo omnia tribuo. Verum Erasmus noster illis verbis fucatis nondum cecinit palinodiam, quamvis ille dicat eum plus curare de numero quam de energia, hoc est efficatia. Quod si hoc verbo aliquid probavit: «Ubi vero Gordii aliquis se offert nodus, deus bone, quam misere se misellus torquet Erasmiolus» - iam plane convictus est meus Erasmus. Pollicetur quidem scripturas, nullas autem profert, quasi sibi etiam sine scriptura credendum sit. Erasmum non defendo, qui hominem non novi, nec eum culpo, qui par efficere nequeam. Porro de libero arbitrio illis relinquo questionem, qui pulmentum intriverunt, atque nihil omnino est, quod non boni consulam, quam si convitiis incesseris optime de nobis meritos. Quod si Erasmum adeo in theologia spernit, cur non spernit et alios, qui novos ritus re arduissima etiam sine scripuris inducunt? Veluti Zuinglius tuus, cuius libellum seu epistolam de eucharistia vel praecursu videre licuit, et casu incidi in locum, ubi de cardine rei disserit et adducit duos, ut opinor, locos, ubi «est» ponitur pro «significat», ac continuo infert «est» in hac propositione «Hoc est corpus meum» [Mt 26,26; 1 Korr 11,24] poni pro «significat». Ceterum pari ratione consequetur, quod «est» in hac oratione «Ioannes Enslin est homo niger» etiam poneretur pro «significat» sensuusque esset: «Ioannes Enslin bedeut ein schwartzen menschen». Ex hoc consequeretur te non esse nigrum, et tamen es niger, ni cutem novam una cum fide nova indueris. Simili consequentia sequerentur sex mille propositiones, et in summa sequeretur, quod «est» non significaret «est» et iam deesset vocabulum, quo mentis adfectum exprimeremus, nisi malis «existit» aut «forem». Et, ut sophistam interim agam, ex singularibus non consequitur universale. Quod si sacramentum solumodo significat corpus Christi, cur non etia sequeretur quemvis panem significare corpus Christi, si in nomine Ieso sumatur, quando utrumque iuxta non sit corpus Christi.

In hunc fervorem adigit me irreverentia sacramenti, nec tamen negotia, quibus in diversum distrahor, sinunt me prosequi quod incoepi, nec iam quicquam est, quod praetexam, quam Christum Iesum in evangelio Paulumque Corinthiis in 1. cap. 11, [23 ff] scribentem. Quod si non adsumunt, sinant me credere meo more, et credant ipsi suo more.

Vale et resipisce.

  <output>This is indeed about our Erasmus, whose work "On Free Will" is amazingly despised, yet not with such force as to convince me to accuse or despise Erasmus. He claims that this pamphlet is "not only impious but blasphemous", yet he does not provide an explanation; that is, he gives himself more credence than Erasmus. But I do not give anyone anything more insolently than I give to Christ. But our Erasmus has not yet sung a recantation with these deceptive words, even though he says that he cares more about the number than about the force, that is, efficacy. If he proved something with this word: "Where a knot like the Gordian is offered, good Lord, how wretchedly the poor Erasmiolus twists himself!" - then my Erasmus is already fully convicted. He promises the scriptures, but does not produce any, as if he should be believed even without scripture. I do not defend Erasmus, who I do not know, nor do I blame him, whom I am unable to make equal. As for free will, I leave that question to those who have tasted the dish, and nothing at all is good advice, than if you attack with insults those who have deserved well of us. If Erasmus so despises theology, why does he not also despise others, who introduce new rites even without scriptures? Like your Zwingli, whose pamphlet or letter on the eucharist or preface it was possible to see, and I chanced upon a place where he discusses the key of the subject and brings two, as I think, places, where "is" is put for "means", and immediately infers that "is" is put in this proposition "This is my body" [Mt 26,26; 1 Cor 11,24] for "means". However, by the same reasoning it would follow that "is" in this sentence "John Enslin is a black man" would also be put for "means", and the sense would be: "John Enslin bedeut ein schwarzen menschen". From this it would follow that you are not black, and yet you are black, unless you don a new skin along with a new faith. By the same consequence there would follow six thousand propositions, and, in short, it would follow that "is" would not mean "is", and there would already be no word with which to express the affections of the mind, unless one were to use "exists" or "were". And, to play the sophist for the moment, the particular does not follow from the universal. If the sacrament only means the body of Christ, why would it not also follow that any bread means the body of Christ, if taken in the name of Jesus, when neither is the body of Christ?

It is this fervor that drives me to irreverence for the sacrament, and yet the business I am distracted with does not allow me to pursue what I have begun, nor do I have anything to resort to, except Christ Jesus in the gospel and Paul writing to the Corinthians in the first chapter, 11 [23 ff]. If they do not accept this, let them let me believe in my own way, and they may believe in their own way.

Farewell and repent.

From the village of Ferimontano, last of January in the Year of the Virgin's Birth 1526.</output>
