      <p>Greetings. The letter, which your kindness has once again deigned to write to me after several months, was mentioned to me by Mr. Friedrich von Salis before I received it. He, returning from there, told us many things about all the learned men there, and especially about your kindness and cheerfulness. I received that letter, written on the fifth of February, on the 17th of the same month, so you should not be surprised if I am writing back somewhat late. However, you might wonder why I have not written for a long time; but there would be no reason for surprise if you knew what has deterred me from writing: the words of some people here, voices from your side coming to us, your long and persistent silence, not to mention the letters you sent to Basel against me; for I have nothing certain, only hearsay. From all of this, I easily perceived that I and my matters are no longer pleasing to you, and therefore I should not trouble an offended mind. Yet, I could not help but always love you, nor will I cease to do so as long as life governs these limbs, whether you write to me or not. However, since I see that my suspicion is unfounded and that your kindness wishes to have my trifles, I will write henceforth whatever seems not so unworthy of your ears.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you have abundantly learned what you wish to know from Mr. Friedrich. For who could have narrated it more accurately or clearly? Although there is nothing now to write, I will write at another time. I will add this: our Confederates beheaded a certain captain of Ilanz, not so much because he led soldiers from the Confederates to Milan against the edict, but because he committed several thefts. I previously sent you a printed book, which our schoolmaster played with, and we are expecting it. Meanwhile, farewell, most esteemed man in every way, and do not cease to love your Philippus in return.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 20th of February, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours no less than always, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother, most esteemed by all good people. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
