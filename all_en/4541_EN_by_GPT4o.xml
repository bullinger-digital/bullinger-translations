      <p>S. We share the same opinion as you, most kind Mr. Bullinger, regarding the French orator; the further he lives from us, the better it is, and we would not fear any danger from his person, but from the rabble and dregs of people who usually accompany such envoys, through whom many are offended, led astray, etc. You surely remember how pious and a supporter of the gospel Męgerath was, who would have been burned for the gospel in France, but he no longer wanted to go to France; he died and was buried among the Swiss; however, when he lived in Solothurn, the gospel was overthrown, the tavern restored, and other disgraceful things brought back. That good man undoubtedly neither sought nor wanted this; nevertheless, it happened; for the household did not reflect the master. You also know that wherever such men live, new guests arrive daily, and strange things happen; where the carcass is, there the eagles gather. So let this man be good; as long as he does not migrate to us.</p>
      <p>The military situation with us is different than with you because of our neighboring counts of Sulz, etc., and others who think less well of us, and because we are located at the borders of the Swiss, indeed outside of Switzerland. Hence, while you are very safe, we must be vigilantly on guard, the most efficient armor is required from us, and there are more men with us who have more frequently practiced military service than with you. Therefore, if it should be necessary (which the Lord may mercifully avert), we will be quite swift and ready. But it would not hurt if some enemy incursion were to be feared and matters at Baden are not properly settled, because ours are somewhat more secure, to be advised by the most honorable council of Zurich in a friendly manner, so that they may be more cautious, to prepare everything and renew it again, if force were to be inflicted on you or others, so that they may be more ready; for you would do the same and will do so if danger from the enemy is to be feared for us. I believe they would accept this with a fair mind and arrange and inspect everything more diligently, so that if perhaps some have died or fallen ill, others may be substituted, and also what is lacking in cannons or other weapons may be remedied; for it is better to be prepared in vain than to be overwhelmed unprepared. May the Lord turn everything for the better, to whom we will cry: Grant peace, Lord, in our days, etc. A rumor has reached us from Lucerne that all, both men and women, and also children, wish for peace amicably, and that the people of Lucerne are not so severe against the people of Glarus, likewise the people of Uri and Zug, but the people of Schwyz and the allied Unterwalden are raging. Another rumor flies that the 5 Cantons simply intend for the Duke of Savoy to recover his duchy and will achieve this even by arms; for they have promised him this. All these things are plausible, yet uncertain with us.</p>
      <p>All these things are more certain to you than to us. Shouldn't the public assemblies of the Cantons be attended and all dangers and injuries be admonished? The simpler ones are undoubtedly being misled by their leaders. I return the judgment of Mr. Philipp and thank you for sharing it; for I collect and write down all such things.</p>
      <p>It is reported among us by merchants how many good men in Lyon, Paris, and elsewhere are hanged, who are less favorable to the Guises. May the Lord be with the faithful.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Our Simpertus greets you.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in our name.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, November 12, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Jakob Rüeger. To the most illustrious, learned, and excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed and beloved brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
