      <p>Greetings. Since I will soon, God willing, come to you, most esteemed lord, I am writing less prolixly and less frequently now. Through this present messenger, I want to propose to you that you relieve me of the greatest anxiety with your response. Lord Imm Hag reported to me that in recent days, our adversaries met in Lucerne and the Swiss Cantons decided, among other things, that unless we swear an oath to confirm the treaties according to the form used until now, they also want the treaty with us to be dissolved. And among other things, he added that it was reported to him that the people of Zurich also agreed to this plan. I, however, cannot believe it at all, nor can I confirm it for certain; he ordered me to write to you in the name of both of us, so that if you have any certainty in this matter, you may inform us. My sorrow grows daily, as I wrote recently, as I understand more and more each day how destructive the discord between our cities is, and how they delight in each other's disgrace. What my lords of Zurich have written through this messenger, I have not yet learned. I advised Hag and others to write back frequently, so that concord may be more nourished. I do not know what I will accomplish; I suspect they will not write back even now. I urge you again to write to Treasurer Haller; for he is very influential and also appears to be candid. Greet D. Musculus and your entire family and each of the brothers diligently from me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Bern, 17th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compatriot. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
