Bullinger should share with him everything that is important for Haller to know, including his own commentaries on Paul and those by Theodor Bibliander on the prophets. Sulzer will report on the situation in Bern. Haller's remarks about the carnival activities in Zurich were unfavorably received by one of the Zurich delegates in Bern, Rudolf? Stoll. Guillaume Farel is preaching successfully in Geneva. Reformation unrest in Geneva: During the arrest of a murderer, namely the episcopal official Claude Pennet, letters were found in the episcopal administration in which the appointment of a governor by the bishop and the destruction of the Evangelicals in Geneva were being prepared. An accomplice, Jean Portier, has probably already been executed. A monk from Paris, Guy Furbity, who preached vehemently against the followers of the Reformation, was accused by the Bernese deputies present in Geneva and is now, after being defeated in a disputation by Farel and Pierre Viret, to be forced by the Geneva council to publicly retract his errors. However, since he refuses, he is being held in strict custody. Since many powerful people, including clerics, have left Geneva, the city is in danger. Their war debts to Bern are still unpaid. Haller requests Bullinger's commentaries on the letters of Peter and the 2nd letter to the Corinthians.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here you have Simon Sulzer, my dearest, most distinguished Heinrich, whom I wanted to visit you all the more willingly, as I was certain that he would not be an unwelcome guest to you on my account. He can readily satisfy your wishes regarding whatever you desire to know about our affairs. He is a young man, but pious and endowed with commendable intelligence and learning. He wishes to hear you, who teach and lecture in Zurich and whose studies are praised everywhere, to be connected in friendship and familiarity, and to become more learned. Whatever you communicate to him will also be shared with me, who am always compelled to mutter in my corners at home. You will show him the method of reading the prophets, which you have drawn from Theodor. And now I will see when I will finally obtain from you what you have promised again, either your annotations on Paul or Theodor's on the prophets. I certainly owe it to you, after God, that in one year I have made more progress in many things than in the previous three or four. For I had no method of reading and studying. Therefore, do not fail me, dearest brother, who can be of the greatest help. Then see to it that he is enrolled in the number of familiar friends of Pellican, Theodor, Leo, Carolstadt, and Binder. He will report in person how it happened that he came to you at this time. I have written much to you so far, but you have not yet responded in a word. However, I will not be wearied or easily moved by your silence, as I know your mind is always whole and sincere towards me, and you have so many public and private matters, which rightly take precedence over my trifles. If you ever want anything from me, command and enjoin it, so that you may at least once experience your smallest coin. In summary: He will easily explain to you both my private and public matters, both civil and Christian, as he is familiar with all of us.</p>
      <p>Your Stollius displeased me greatly. He was almost indignant, unless I judge wrongly, because I was speaking in the public tavern's hypocaust about the bishopric of Klotz Äscher and other ghostly plays, with which the untamed populace among you would celebrate the carnival days. I have not met any of those delegates again.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, Farel preached freely for almost two months in a certain hall, and now he teaches publicly in the Minorite church. Indeed, a great betrayal was uncovered among them, which greatly overthrew the papists.</p>
      <p>For when a murderer, the steward of the bishop of Geneva, was captured, letters were found in the episcopal administration, in which - and indeed in very lengthy letters - he had subordinated a senator of Freiburg as a spiritual vicar, who would have the power to expel and kill all the pious by edicts, and also to oppress the people so that the name of Christ would not be heard among them. Moreover, that scoundrel named certain pious citizens to be soon punished with death, as soon as he was inaugurated in his office. With this one killed, another traitor of the same kind remains, whom I believe has already paid his penalties. Meanwhile, a certain Parisian monk, a notable braggart, a doctor, a complete theologaster, was summoned to court by the deputies of our city for vehemently slandering our religion and all who taught and observed it in his sermons. When he delayed for a long time, because he lacked an ordinary judge, namely the bishop, he was finally compelled by the industry of Farel and his colleague Pierre Viret, a most learned young man, a minister of the Neuchâtel church, to give an account of his doctrine and faith, if not before the whole church of Geneva, then at least before the senate and deacons. They first argued about the authority of the pope, whether it is permissible for him to establish anything outside, within, or without scripture and impose it on the church of God to be observed. When the monk attempted to assert and prove this with many arguments, especially with those of Eck, he was finally convicted by these two on the third day, so that he confessed with his own mouth before the senate and deacons that he could not prove by scriptures the selection of foods, days, garments, times, and persons, and other things, whatever had been introduced into the church by the decrees of popes and councils. Hence, the deputies, seeking justice to be pronounced - it was decreed by the senate and deacons that, since he confessed his error openly with his own mouth, he should sing a recantation at the sound of the bell in the main church from the pulpit. The monk, when he reluctantly agreed and was now to recant in the church with a prescribed sheet, began to complain greatly about the injury done to him. Whereupon the Bernese deputies, indignant, demanded the recantation publicly before the people according to the sentence of the senate. When the people understood this, they rushed upon the monk with great force and clamor, so that unless the Bernese deputies had defended the wretched man, he would have been cut to pieces by them. Therefore, he was thrown into a most foul prison until he willingly does what the senate decreed. I have nothing else new. I omitted this above: Many of the more powerful, including canons, have deserted the city after the betrayal was uncovered. Thus, the Genevans are exposed to great danger. They have not yet paid our city 9000 crowns from the past war. For the payment of which the deputies have labored so far, but in vain. The rest Sulzer will tell you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich, and love me uniquely commended to you.</p>
      <p>I hear your commentaries on Peter's epistles are printed, but I was expecting them on the Corinthians. Whatever it is, as long as I have it. Again, farewell with your companions and spouses.</p>
      <p>March 14, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned churchman of Zurich, his brother, by far the dearest of all.</p>
