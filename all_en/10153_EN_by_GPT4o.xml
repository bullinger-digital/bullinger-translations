      <p>My friendly greetings, and whatever I can do to honor, love, and benefit you, dear brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>Your letter, which reached my cousin the city clerk on my behalf, I have understood well in its entirety, and first of all, I have recognized your friendly disposition towards me. Such and more obliges me to serve you in return.</p>
      <p>Regarding the proposal mentioned therein, I am very pleased, as I am concerned that I may not be able to match such good people.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brother-in-law, I want to have shown you my ability here, waiting for your further decision, so that the matter, before it is made public, is well considered on both sides and not taken up fruitlessly later; for I am not inclined to offer more than my income to anyone, which might later be disadvantageous to you, a faithful guarantor of the truth, my subordinate, and also to me.</p>
      <p>My mother will provide me with five hundred or perhaps more guilders at this time, and after her passing (which God may delay), I will receive 800 or 900 guilders along with other small items and household goods, etc. I wanted to show you this in confidence as my trusted friend, to ask you whether I should pursue the matter further or consider securing myself elsewhere, and also to write to me about the father's intentions regarding the daughter, how many children there are, and whether it would not be against their wishes for me to use some honest trade to better our livelihood. For if you advise me to pursue this further, I would come to you without delay, as this is the entire content of my thoughts, as if I were personally with you. Otherwise, I am of good hope that the daughter will not fail in any way, for we are an honest, cheerful, and complete being (as you well know) among us. My mother would also share her motherly loyalty with us, and I would conduct myself as a pious, honest person; therefore, there is no lack, except that I am concerned that such honorable people might perhaps need to be drawn to my proposal. Therefore, I have written this opinion to you personally, so that you may know my heart, hereby diligently asking you to have me entrusted in all loyalty. It is also my desire that you do not take offense that my response did not immediately follow your letter; for my aforementioned cousin was not at home.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I desire to be informed of what prevented you from attending our wedding, where we awaited you with special eagerness, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on the 13th of August in the year of our Lord 1532.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Zehender, your well-wisher.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the divine word in Zurich, my dear brother-in-law.</p>
