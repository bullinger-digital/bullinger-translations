      <p>About Philipp, I wrote to your kindness and to Mr. Gwalter, most illustrious man, what the faith owed to you rightfully expressed and extorted from me unwillingly. How I wish the matter were otherwise and better than I wrote and more and more I experience.</p>
      <p>He left us as if never to return, and for that reason, I was filled with uncommon joy for reasons which I have explained in letters to be delivered or already delivered through Froschauer. But contrary to our expectation, he returned not without my secret displeasure; for I bore his fickleness indignantly, that he had boasted everywhere he was going to Leuven and had made great expenses in farewell to his drunken comrades, and now returned to the laughter and mockery of many. I inquired about the settlement of creditors, how matters stood. He replied that Froschauer had provided 44 florins for the settlement to be made to me, the bookseller, and the host, but that he still owed about 12 or 13 florins to three other creditors and that my parent had satisfied them in his name with the hope made to him that I would restore it to him here. What vanity and imposture this is! Why, I ask, did I, not Froschauer, satisfy them, and why is this necessity imposed on me, as if indeed, what he refused, I am compelled to bear the burden? To what end this impudence, I added, that they had persuaded the parent with some false pretext to pay them. I further asked how much money he had received at the autumn fair from Froschauer, he said 25 florins, and how much from his parents when he first left them; he did not deny having received 10 florins. I summed it up and found that he had squandered 91 florins in these three quarters of the year and began, as often before, to be vexed and reproach him for such great extravagance. But he affirmed that his parents were of such fortune and will that they could and would easily pay. But I said, "No, I would not believe it," for I knew that they had apprenticed two other brothers to the lowest manual trade to be learned and practiced abroad without paternal expenses, and since the father himself preserves and practices it, it became clear to me that his parent was not so fortunate and liberal as he had boasted, and I ordered him to leave my house and refrain from my company. For how could I bear it, who turns away from good advice, who slanders and attempts to defraud or at least delay longer the one who helps with money. For this morning I also asked the bookseller, to whom I had given this business, to present Philipp's promissory note and demand payment in my name. He replied that Philipp did not want Froschauer to satisfy me, but that he would pay himself in person. What reason, unless that other present creditors in Frankfurt were pressing him, whom he would have preferred to satisfy. What that at the previous fair he claimed to have received only 5 florins, which he gave me in the name of payment, but concealed the rest received and secretly squandered, nevertheless also binding himself in debt to me and others. Alas, the impudence. Should I conceal and remain silent about these things? Let the earth swallow me rather than I betray the trust, with which you have most assuredly endowed me. Therefore, I write again and advise you to recall... the lost one, yet under the pretext, lest he suspect the true cause. For I fear, lest... he goes into the military than stays here longer, I fear as much as before lest he accumulates debt. For he will hardly embrace frugality, who has hitherto wanted to appear so liberal, so rich, so abundant. How so? Lest he be a laughingstock to his comrades... and lest other creditors accuse him to me as the rector for the name of suspended and unfulfilled payment, I fear that if it happens, either I will have to stand surety for him or throw him into prison by their petitions, which I am not going to do... he sold all his books; he will hardly be able or willing to buy new ones. What indeed will an unarmed soldier accomplish? I am ashamed and regret that I have seen such an impostor and have been deceived with you by your recommendation. Indeed, where he was confined by stricter and more severe discipline, he kept himself in check unwillingly and forced like a little fox, but when he was freed, he could not help but return to his nature and exercise his innate nature according to the saying: "You may drive out nature with a pitchfork, yet it will always return." Therefore, see what you advise his parents. I truly have little or almost no hope in him and am so disturbed by his impudence, vanity, and imposture that I wish I had never known him.</p>
      <p>I was pleased to write these things, so that if the previous letters sent to you for the same reason had not been delivered, you would be no less warned by these in time. Farewell. I received all your letters and the Consensus on the sacramental matter with Calvin... with a cheerful face because from it I understood that the offense and envy of many against you could be calmed and mitigated... by rage.</p>
      <p>Given at Marburg, March 28, 1551. You will inform Mr. Pellicanus to send my grammar to me.</p>
      <p>Yours, Happelius.</p>
