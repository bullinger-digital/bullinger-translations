      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You rightly perceive that the ecclesiastical censure attempted by some ministers of our land on the soldiers, without our counsel and will, is inappropriate. For I am not of such unjust and foolish judgment, even if I were the most foolish, that I could not easily grasp that this boldness, especially in this perplexing and dangerous time, will not only bring no fruit to the Lord, but indeed, unless God prevents it, will overshadow what has been built with great labor and effort so far. Therefore, we will diligently ensure that the minds of some are not only appeased but also diverted from their purpose.</p>
      <p>The effort of your lords to keep their people at home during times of war pleases everyone. It is certainly a deed worthy of the highest commendation. Do not doubt, my dearest Bullinger, that we will see and hear astonishing things in the spring. May God grant that all things turn to His glory!</p>
      <p>I received the most welcome gift you sent, undoubtedly, and I will also receive what remains in the Acts.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 3, 1537.</p>
      <p>With your wife and all brothers safe.</p>
      <p>Your Megander from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich, preacher of sacred sermons, his most esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
