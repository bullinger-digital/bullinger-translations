    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the successful outcome of the Basel Convention. An illness, but also the lack of approval from the council, prevented his participation to Capito's displeasure. The articles [of the First Helvetic Confession] presented to him by the latter do not cause him any offense, but since his defense of the [Stuttgart Concord], he has become more suspicious of convoluted formulations, where the Scripture speaks so simply and clearly, and therefore raises some questions. Is too much weight being given to the office, which is undisputed as such? The office must not be attributed what belongs to Christ; however, if it is said that in baptism and the Lord's Supper, rebirth or forgiveness is offered, this could be interpreted in an Anabaptist sense and also fits poorly with Bucer's earlier statements. The talk of mysteries, of which the sacraments are symbols, must not serve to justify the doctrine of ubiquity. The unclear expression "offer" could easily be understood as if even the unbelievers receive Christ in the meal. Why is the complete depravity of human nature not assumed? The recognition of church ban could favor the re-establishment of ecclesiastical autocracy. Zwick cannot reject the articles, but fears that the ambiguities could have serious consequences, and asks for a quick response. Greetings. Thanks for Zwingli's ["Fidei expositio"]. Asks for an explanation of the deviations between the German and the Latin version [of the confession].</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The fact that the Basel Convention turned out so well, esteemed gentlemen, filled me with incredible joy, and I will not cease to congratulate and pray to the Lord that these beginnings of unity may grow as happily as possible and be brought to completion by the increase of the Holy Spirit's work of God.</p>
      <p>If only I had been able to attend the colloquy! But it was not possible, partly because the council was unwilling, and partly because my poor health did not allow it. For during this whole time, I have been so confined at home that I was not even able to perform my ecclesiastical duties. Capito is somewhat annoyed with me for my absence. But good God, even if I had been in perfect health, it would not have been appropriate to move anywhere against the will of the council. But I will excuse myself as diligently as I can to the excellent man. Then he encourages me to read carefully the articles written by you and them; there is nothing in them that could offend my spirit.</p>
      <p>Which is indeed true when I consider them with a simple mind. However, because simplicity is somewhat fading in our age and a remarkable obscurity arises from various ways of speaking, I would think that some things should have been explained more clearly. You know how I tried to excuse Ambrose's confession with Schnepf to you, when you repeatedly cried out that the truth was being obscured, and that freedom of speech should be admitted only as far as it does not harm the truth. Hence, I myself gradually began to think less well of intricate expressions. Then, observing to what extent any statements could be interpreted and what kind of church reformation the most holy men, brothers Capito and Bucer, seemed to be planning, I thought there were not a few reasons to confess everything as openly and clearly as possible, so that one explanation would not push out another until the simple truth was obscured by endless explanations and interpretations. Do we not see, dearest brothers, how great darkness has arisen from the expressions of the sophists? Furthermore, are not the scriptures about baptism and the Lord's Supper clearer and more straightforward than all these ways of speaking, which human prudence has invented today and for several years now? How simply did Christ say: "He who believes and is baptized" [Mk 16, 16] etc. These words, to make them clearer and easier to understand, some interpret as saying that the water of baptism can be deified. This is now the gloss (explanation) through which one interprets the words of Christ. How very simply did Christ say that the bread is to be taken and eaten; for this is his body [Mt 26, 26]. To understand these words, good God, there are hardly enough words to explain, not to mention entangle, so that it is much more difficult to understand the scholia and the voices of the interpreters than the words of Christ himself. Now, although your minds are well known to me in such matters and no one could easily persuade me that you have given even a little that is alien to the truth, the articles are sufficiently approved by me, from which I nevertheless feel that you have accommodated unity and concord. However, it will be permissible to ask you one or two things:</p>
      <p>First, as far as the ministry is concerned, we do not deny that Christ uses externals to understand internals. However, since the mind of the people of Strasbourg is that the church cannot be reformed and the gospel cannot be spread throughout the world unless the authority of the ministry is established, it seems to me more dangerous in this respect to always attach these words to Christ's institutions: to be given, exhibited, distributed through the ministry of the church. And yet the ministry does not offend; for we know that it is such in the church and cannot be denied. But that such a ministry must now be applied to all acts of God does not seem entirely safe to me, first, because in the end people admire those external elements more than the creator himself; then it appears that the people of Strasbourg are preparing that new reformation of the church with such clauses, as I may say, about which they are excessively concerned.</p>
      <p>Hence, we confess that we are co-workers as far as the external function is concerned. If they demand nothing more than that, we sufficiently approve whatever is said about the ministry. For we are not ignorant that we are co-workers in all things to which the Lord has ordained us. He has ordained us to teach about the works of God, to pour water, to give bread and wine. By this ministry, the works and benefits of Christ are represented. Therefore, if nothing is attributed to the minister that belongs to Christ, then if what Christ does and works is not necessarily connected with the external ministry of man, that it must be there and with another, we are less offended even in this respect. But what is it, most beloved brothers, that you confess that the matter of baptism is regeneration and that it is exhibited in baptism through the ministry? If regeneration itself is so bound to baptism, the Anabaptists are not so wrong, who wanted to make themselves certain of regeneration through repeated baptism. The same, I would say, if the Holy Spirit is given in baptism. Thus, the matter of the Eucharist is the remission of sins, and this very thing is exhibited in the supper; now it is not far off that the supper is not a memory of remission, but a work of remission. And what is it that Bucer sometimes felt that faith is not even confirmed by the use of the sacraments? I would therefore like you to answer me briefly, as I am quite perplexed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you confess that baptism and the supper are symbols of mysterious things, which is true, but not so mysterious as some dream, especially asserting some unknown presence of Christ, which you believe, but do not understand. Hence, they use that argument about the omnipotence of God, which is not needed for this matter. For as far as the spirit of Christ is concerned, no one is unaware that it can be everywhere; as far as the truth of the body is concerned, we know it is in a place. Now indeed, some seem to establish a certain third presence of the glorified body, which unless you believe, you seem to have denied the omnipotence of God.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, is not the word "exhibiting" sufficiently suspect even in this respect, that it is said to the most impious that Christ exhibits himself in such a way that they partake of his body, when to me the impious seem to be of the matter of the body because they do not partake of the body? But if they interpret that exhibition in the supper as in the preaching of the word - for it is preached as a testimony to the faithful and the unfaithful - there is nothing that burdens me. But we know that the Lord has nothing in common with the impious and that it is nothing less true than that he exhibits himself to them. And although nothing is explicitly stated about this in your articles, yet the article about the ministry will urge this very thing if it is not received with a grain of salt. And hence it happens that I am more and more offended by obscure ways of speaking, just as the adversaries, sometimes more prudent than us, did not want to admit that we interpret the words of Christ by "signifies," by which word light was added to the matter of the supper; but we admit it, by which darkness is added.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what does it mean that you openly profess that after sin something of good fruit remains in man? Perhaps you have given something in favor of those who assert that there is something most excellent in the philosophers, namely that sin is not. However, in my judgment, it is one thing for the Holy Spirit to be in them, than that they are naturally inclined to honesty. It seems dangerous to me not to subject the whole nature of man to sin, and no trace of the spirit appears unless it is newly granted divinely after sin - not to mention that many things in the nations may seem honest, which are most dishonorable before God.</p>
      <p>Regarding the authority of the church over those who roam more widely, you assert that they can be expelled from the entire dominion. Here, indeed, you think the church consists of ministers and the council, by whose pious consent this can be done. But to expel from the dominion always seems unwise to me, even if I only consider the civil republic. If I were the council, I would prefer to heal these diseases with another remedy. Now indeed, if you consider the church alone, it has no dominion, and I do not know what those words in sacred and most holy matters of Christ's institutions, namely that the apostles expel by dominion, that they proscribe and that by the conspiracy of the confederates of Christ, taste of papal authority. However, for establishing a new ecclesiastical monarchy, these and words of this kind are sufficiently applied. If only the simple mind of Christ were always described with simple words!</p>
      <p>In summary: I cannot condemn the articles, because your faith is known to me, nor are they very obscure in themselves. They would be much less obscure if the times were not dangerous, and certain efforts make me more anxious than exotic words and expressions more entangled than any Gordian knots. Finally, I somewhat fear that on occasion some things may be carried far elsewhere, and that many other points and new articles will be forced out of them, which are not mentioned with a word now.</p>
      <p>But I pray to the Lord, our common savior, that he may teach us by his spirit to think as one according to his will. Amen. I do not insist, but only indicate my fears, which I wish, I wish are most vain. If indeed there is anyone who wishes the church to be well, the gospel to be promoted, I indeed wish this and will give my present life for this reason; so far am I from not thinking holy of the unity of the brothers.</p>
      <p>But I write to you, my dearest brothers and lords, more freely, because I have your benevolence towards me more explored. But answer me as quickly as you can. Farewell, and may Christ keep you. Also, forgive the blots, for the messenger hurried, and it was not possible to review. It is enough for you to have my mind. Thomas, Conrad, and all good people ordered me to greet you with the greatest zeal.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we thank you, Bullinger, for Zwingli's booklet. There one finds truly good, understandable things.</p>
      <p>Given in Constance, February 23, 1536.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>This almost slipped my mind: In one word, indicate why the German version differs from the Latin.</p>
      <p>Farewell a thousand times with the dearest brothers, especially my Pellican.</p>
      <p>To the most learned men, Lords Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, dearest brothers in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
