      <p>God protect us from all evil. Amen.</p>
      <p>Our messengers did not arrive late at the inn here. However, I am writing this before daybreak.</p>
      <p>I do not want to inquire about any business more or less and, as much as I am able, inform you of your honor and necessity, etc.</p>
      <p>In the Upper League, where we are currently in doubt, because a large part of the community is papist, it is widely known that the sea is on our side; it is only mentioned in two courts (I do not know otherwise yet; however, it is widely known that the sea is there, I know that), namely Lougnitz and Disitis; but they are not asked much about it. However, a few have increased it; it is not all the fault of the communities.</p>
      <p>Much depends on the presentation.</p>
      <p>In Lougnitz sits the land judge Cabalsar, a pillar of the papist religion in the Upper League; in Disitis is Master Captain Florin, who has recently been in the lands with the Bishop of Chur. The lord of Rozins, Doctor Planta, a messenger, is entirely against religion, and in his own dominions, he could not oppose the sea; for his own people are also on our side, namely that the messengers should apply all possible diligence to amicably reconcile and guide our oath and league brothers, who have grown together in tension, and if their good intentions cannot prevail, to stand with the other arbitrators and promise to always help those who lack justice; and for this, they are willing to risk life and property. I write this so extensively because the two envoys of the Upper League, who are being sent, are papists, so that if they hesitate, you know how to urge them. The answers from the Godshouse have not all arrived by yesterday; I have not yet been with the messengers. However, my lord mayor has allowed me to read as much as has arrived, that is: in Chur, as you know, there is a unanimous majority, willing to stand with life and property, likewise in Pergäl. In Fürstnau and Ortenstein - there are two communities, but one high court - likewise. From the Münster Valley comes a very comforting promise with special clarification, they are willing to help justly and put everything into it. From another high court, from the Engadin, comes also good news, but with the addition: one should speak earnestly about the matter, and if the others want to exercise something against justice, they want to stand with the common 3 Leagues and always follow the majority. From the Upper Engadin, from the court where the old lord Travers sits, comes the worst answer; for they have not clarified themselves. The answer was brought by Peter Planta, the bishop's cousin; but he is not asked much about it. I hope to God that the bishop's practice will soon be broken; for if it were to become serious, the pious in that community would be well informed, so that they would stand faithfully.</p>
      <p>From Burgundy comes such an answer (there are papists, but not bad ones): one should help those from Glarus to justice, and if they cannot achieve this, they should be informed; they want to do everything that belongs to the matter. I do not doubt that there is a unanimous majority in Burgundy as here; for Balinketus tells me that everyone is willing, even before one has ever convened. That is all I know.</p>
      <p>I have nothing yet from the courts.</p>
      <p>What the majority will be in the 2 Leagues, the 3rd must follow; but I have no doubt about the courts, only that it is presented correctly. In the Godshouse, there are 11 high courts in total.</p>
      <p>From Chur, Pergäl, Fürstnau, Münster Valley, the Lower Engadin, Burgundy, the 6 high courts, you have understood. In summary: we will have the majority widely, and even if some do not clarify themselves completely, it is because they have not understood it fundamentally, and if it becomes serious, it will not be necessary.</p>
      <p>However, since the communities are so widely dispersed, this requires the men of the people, and I think it would do much if a city like Zurich or the other arbitration places (if it were to take the worse path) earnestly admonished ours to prepare further; for no one is preparing. This is because people in the wilderness do not know that it has come to a critical point. You too, dear godfather, can at any time, if necessary, inform me, even before the day ends; for you will soon hear where the matter stands.</p>
      <p>I want to bring it to a point where people prepare further. I lack nothing but that I am poor and cannot afford the messengers [... afford!], otherwise, I would fill the whole land in 2 days. You must not be surprised that we are dealing with the matter in this way.</p>
      <p>In our lands, preachers and envoys must help each other; indeed, the preachers can inform the common people the most.</p>
      <p>If, however, such a path should be taken again, do not spare so long and send two well-spoken men who themselves turn to the communities; for in war matters, one must not spare effort, labor, or costs. There are also 6 others appointed, 2 men from each League, for secret war councils, some of whom are secret to me. These should, if something further happens, come to Chur and always handle it with advice. Therefore, if you think the matter would not take the right path in Baden, you can inform me of the same; I will ensure that for the good and advancement of the matter, the war council will be written and a timely beginning of the matter will be made in the name of God. Today, advice will also be taken on what to do with the bishop; for I cannot withhold from you that a merchant from Ulm, well known here, has come from Genoa (this merchant has his factor here), and when asked about the Turk, he replied that he had made an attempt and trial at Ancona as well as elsewhere, but could not achieve anything special. Then he was further asked by our housemaster: if there was not some war people in Italy. To which he is said to have replied: yes.</p>
      <p>Further, the housemaster asked: to whom it belonged, if there was not a rumor in Italy that it belonged to Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To which he replied: he had not heard of it; but the common saying is that it belongs to the Bishop of Como and partly also to the Bishop of Chur. To which the housemaster replied: "Sir, that would be too close to us, and this talk belongs further." To which the merchant: "It belongs where it will; that is the common saying in Italy!" etc. So far.</p>
      <p>Those from the 4 villages, Zizers, Drimmüß, etc., have also clarified themselves and are on our side, so that now we also have the majority in the Godshouse. Now they are in the senate.</p>
      <p>If anything is done that is of interest to you, you will know. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I wish to know if my latest letters have been delivered to you. Please ensure that this booklet is given to Mr. Lavater, my son-in-law; I have enclosed letters in this booklet on purpose, so they are not lost or fall into the wrong hands. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 25.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>This should also be added: I fear the 5 places will give an attached answer and thus blind our messengers, so that, while papists are being sent from the Upper League, they may come home and fill the land: there is no one so evil; the 5 places still want to be shown, - but the matter is not to be trusted on behalf of the 5 places, and thus the last would be worse than the first, since now all the people are willing and the Leagues in this case can harm the 5 places much, also if a foreign people came, they could best prevent it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for God's sake, ensure that a clear, straightforward answer is given and not an attached answer, so that the malevolent do not have an opportunity to hesitate and one waits until it suits them well [... suits them well].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
