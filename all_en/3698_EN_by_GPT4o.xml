      <p>Greetings. I am sending back to you your letters from the letters written in the army. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, I received that the constable, admiral, and marshal of St. Andrew are captives at Atrebates, which we call Arras, where they are negotiating peace with the Bishop of Atrebates, the chancellor of Philipp Domp Rigomet, and the mother of the Duke of Lorraine, so that peace is hoped for. On the last day of August, the king and the dauphin took the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>The two armies are separated by two or three miles and are not divided by any river or city, so that, unless peace is concluded shortly, they will have to come to blows. There is no leisure to write to the most honorable council; you will excuse this and convey these most certain things. Farewell and greet the friends with my words.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 10th of September.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
