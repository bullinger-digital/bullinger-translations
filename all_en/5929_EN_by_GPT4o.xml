      <p>I was very concerned about sending back the letters you recently sent, but no convenient opportunity presented itself by which I could send them to you; finally, by chance, three days ago, Johannes von Ulm, my relative, arrived, who solemnly promised to ensure that they would be delivered to you in good faith.</p>
      <p>On that very day, Albert, my nephew from my brother, wrote to his father among other things: "The Queen of Swabia will be brought to us in Zweibrücken at the end of this month (understand September), whom George John of the Palatinate, our most illustrious Wolfgang's cousin, will take as his wife.</p>
      <p>Between our people here and the Elector Palatine, except for the matter of religion, things are not going badly; for the controversy about the administration of the Lord's Supper, which I mentioned above, still persists, and George John shares the same opinion as the Elector."</p>
      <p>So much from my nephew.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, most esteemed Bullinger, love me and commend me to Christ Jesus. October 27, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>You will know how the one from Grünbach took Würzburg with 500 horses and 3 companies on foot, and the bishop took flight to the castle, likewise that Duke Eric of Brunswick took Bomberg, also Nuremberg, Augsburg, Ulm, etc., taking on soldiers, and the Saxon princes are supposed to march out with a large force; no one knows against whom it is.</p>
      <p>Some say it is against the Elector Palatine because of his faith.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
