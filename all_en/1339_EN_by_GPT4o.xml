      <p>Greetings. I am very glad to hear that you are doing well, most esteemed Bullinger. Today, I will ensure that your letters are faithfully delivered to Appenzell at the first opportunity. However, our Hector has not yet returned, and therefore we have no certain news from his letters or his brothers about when he will be with us; for if I had any other information, out of my respect for you, I would have immediately reported it to you, especially if it were joyful news. Therefore, as soon as he arrives or if I learn anything in the meantime, I will undoubtedly inform you of this matter and will not cease to remind his brothers, etc. There is nothing new to write to you about, except that things are reported more obscurely here than they are clearly and certainly mentioned by you. Our Germany is becoming more and more a miserable spectacle and all the more cruel, as we see it not only exposed to the arms of foreigners but also raging against its own entrails. It is also to be feared that the avengers of greater calamities themselves may be the cause, even if it succeeds according to their wishes. You know that line from the poet, which goes: "But after the violent victor departed from the enemy, the horse, pressed, did not indeed remove the bit from its mouth nor the saddle from its back." If we desire a more peaceful and freer Germany, the Lord of Hosts must be entreated with sincere repentance and fervent prayers. Farewell, most humane Bullinger, and as you have begun, I ask you to continue to love me.</p>
      <p>I wish all the doctors of the Zürich church, the best of men, to be well. St. Gallen, July 13.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Kessler.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the renowned Zürich church, my esteemed lord.</p>
