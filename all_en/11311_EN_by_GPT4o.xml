    <p xml:id="regest1">Encourages him to defend the pastoral office against the claims of the university; otherwise, similar intrusions into church matters threaten, as the [Schmalkaldic League] have just enabled in Frankfurt by accepting religious negotiations with imperial mediators. Urges vigilance in the face of enemies beyond the Rhine; the people of Zurich reject the planned mediation and anticipate coming persecution. Cannot write in more detail due to the synod; disapproves of what was negotiated in Frankfurt. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, venerable brother, I would not easily give up my place. You are a pastor. The sheep have been entrusted to you. Now it is a question of the nourishment of the sheep, and who has the authority to dispense this nourishment. The university wishes to claim all authority for itself over the pastors subject to it. As soon as they freely and openly administer the nourishment, it calls and harasses them, saying that they should preach differently, etc.</p>
      <p>Although it is not proposed in this way now, it will indeed go this way over time. Who knows what kind of presidents the university will have in the future? That power belongs to the church. The university is not the church, but a member, unless it is impious.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it should be subject to the teachers. The teachers are the pastors of the churches, who nevertheless recognize themselves as ministers, not lords of the church. What are they doing here and far away (always) with their arrogant nonsense? Strongly oppose them. Threaten to bring the matter before the whole church. For believe me, what has happened to our church in Frankfurt today will happen to the church in Basel someday, which I regret. For they agreed that six men, and those with calm minds, that is, flexible ones, should settle the entire controversial matter of religion. Augustus and the emperor will join them as arbitrators. Will there not someday be four men from the university who will take upon themselves the judgment of doctrines and morals and pronounce against the free truth at their pleasure? For then it must be so, as it has been willed. Would it not have been wiser for them to respond in Frankfurt: "We rely on canonical truth; we will die for this; if we seem to you to be in error, convince us with the scriptures or cease."? What was the need to admit a colloquium with those from whom we do not ignore what to expect? If Eve's colloquium with the serpent ended well, our colloquiums with the papists about the composition of Christ and Belial, that is, the gospel and papism, will also end well. But this was the aim of some people's anxious desire for concord.</p>
      <p>They introduce some composition even with monks and priests. But I pour this out to you as a faithful friend into your heart and bosom. You, my Myconius, be strong, strive for simple truth, and always remember me.</p>
      <p>The adversaries (enemies) beyond the Rhine and the papists are many. Be vigilant in joy. Our people, highly troubled, fear that from the composition will come many tears, which were once few. In short, no composition will be accepted. The truth is too clear. Therefore, there will be great persecution. May God grant victory to simple truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>I could not write more now. For we have scarcely finished the business of the synod. Love me. Live and farewell and write soon. The Frankfurt negotiations do not please my heart, to freely tell you the secret of my mind.</p>
      <p>Theodor, Pellicanus, and the rest send you greetings. May 7, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, Antistes of Basel, most esteemed brother.</p>
