      <p>Greetings. Most distinguished man and most revered father in Christ, I give you the greatest thanks I can, in my name and in the name of my brothers, for having generously and kindly shared those things which deservedly were to be imparted to the faithful servants of God who love sincere doctrine, so that, if not by labor, at least by their prayers, they may be able to promote the best cause.</p>
      <p>There is no reason for you to fear that those secrets, which you wish to remain hidden and kept in our bosom, will be divulged. For what I judge should be communicated to the brothers, I do not hand over to them in writing, but impart by reading aloud. Therefore, so that we may know the whole story, if anything further is offered or done, I humbly ask that, as much as is permissible, you also deign to communicate it to us. However, I regret that you use such an excuse with me, that you have exceeded the time for responding (as you indeed think, but I do not acknowledge); I do not want you to cause yourself even a moment's trouble on my account.</p>
      <p>Your serious, prudent, and learned response to the writing of the ecclesiastical senate at Heidelberg is approved by us, especially in that you also advised the people of Bern, where you do not reject the entire synod altogether, but freely and Christianly offer yourselves. The rest must be commended to the Lord, who, as the most just judge, will finally resolve our conflicts with his best reasons and will defend his cause as the most righteous patron. I daily expect the examples of Theodoret as well as the examples of your Apology, Mr. Beza's, and those of the people of Heidelberg. You truly write about the embassy to be sent to France, that a settlement is to be expected from both the whole and the corrupt. I would care less about the arts of the papists; more so, the levity and Epicureanism of our own, who seek the embassy, torment me, who indeed hunt for golden chains rather than Christian peace in France and the exaltation of our religion, lest I write anything more serious and troublesome to your ears.</p>
      <p>I return everything you shared, without blemish, praying for your kindness, that you deign to greet all colleagues by name in my name and in the name of my brothers. March 4, 1575.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and most revered father in Christ.</p>
