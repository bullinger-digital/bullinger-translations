    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] From the enclosed letter [by Konrad Zwick], Bullinger will be able to gather that Marcel Dietrich von Schankwitz and his wife Anna, née Zehntmeir, intended to take a cure at the baths of Baden. On their way there, they arrived the evening before at Wellenberg Castle to visit their good friend Gregor von Ulm. There, Schankwitz (perhaps through God's providence) was made aware of the existing danger by Konrad Zwick's letter and was urged to seek advice from Bullinger and Mayor Johannes Haab: should he continue the journey or rather postpone it? Bullinger is requested to respond with Schankwitz’s servant [...]. Schankwitz will be grateful for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should not take it amiss that, as an unknown stranger, Schankwitz bothers him and Mayor Haab with this request. He does so in trust and on the advice of mutual good friends. Bullinger is asked to return Zwick's letter and to keep the matter confidential.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Schankwitz entrusts Bullinger to God's protection and assures him of his willingness to serve.</p>

      <p>My friendly good[will] service is always sent to you first. Especially dear sir, you will have gathered from the enclosed letter how I intended to spend a week and a half with my dear wife attending to our needs at the baths in Baden, Switzerland. Therefore, I arrived last night at Wellenberg to visit my brother-in-law Gregor von Ulm. However, since I perhaps took this warning from the foresight of our faithful God, I wanted to hear your advice and opinion on this matter. Therefore, I earnestly request your esteemed self to make an effort and inquire with Mayor Johannes Haab whether it is necessary for me to continue the journey now or to wait longer; and to send your advice to me through my servant, Zaiger. I will willingly earn all this effort for you.</p>

      <p>Kindly asking you not to take it amiss that I, a stranger and unknown to you, trouble and address you with my urgent request. It is done out of trusted sentiment and on the comforting advice of my good friends and your acquaintances. Please send back Zwick's letter to me and keep the matter confidential.</p>
