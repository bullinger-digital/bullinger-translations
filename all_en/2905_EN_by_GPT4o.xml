      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most learned Caelius, and I have commended your son-in-law, my always esteemed brother, along with his wife, your daughter, to my family, who are almost all bathing at Baden; I pray to the Lord that this may be happy and fortunate for him. However, after the publication of your book "On the Amplitude of God's Grace," I have often wished that you had complied with the wishes of your best and most loving brothers and had not published a book that you heard was not entirely approved by pious and not unlearned brothers; now indeed, having been published, I grieve more and more for many reasons, even for this reason, that I understand it displeases many. Recently, a man devoted to you, learned and pious, wrote to me: "I am surprised that the book of our Caelius is being circulated, as if it were printed in Basel, when some certainly affirm it was printed in Pesclavium. What would the most honorable Senate of Basel say if it understood that a book, as if printed by them, was wandering, which learned and pious men among them did not approve of entirely?" I have also learned from elsewhere that the same book was, I don't know by whom, thrust upon the most illustrious Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg, who immediately judged it as evil and rejected it. I also hear that Brentius disapproves, especially for this reason, that you seem to attribute too much to the law of nature outside or beyond Christ. I mention these things so that in the future the admonitions of brothers may have more weight with you.</p>
      <p>It is indeed written to me, why do we not admonish you, lest something adverse happen to you; of course, they are unaware that you have been admonished, but that you preferred to publish. Although I do not doubt that you have received these things also from your other friends, I did not want to conceal what has been brought to me for no other purpose than that in the future you may not prefer to indulge yourself rather than obey your loving brothers. I am sure you will take this in good part; for you see that it comes from a friendly heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the calends of May, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious man, Lord Peter Martyr, is called to the place of the deceased Lord Pellican. May the Lord bless us.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Celio Secondo.</p>
