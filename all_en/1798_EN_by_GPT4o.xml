      <p>Greetings. Your letter addressed to Mr. Christoph Mont, the envoy of the King of England, most illustrious man, I had sent long ago through a citizen of Basel to Strasbourg, who, returning to us on this very day, reported that Mont had already passed away or, when he wanted to take care of the letters. Therefore, I now also return them to you, as I believe others are also enclosed. Today we received news that Hedin, a town of the King of France, which was handed over to the Emperor through treachery a few months ago, has now been recaptured by the French with the help of the Swiss through surrender, to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, who is now said to be hastening back to his homeland, having abandoned the siege of Metz. The King's arrival is expected soon in Paris. Duke Schertlin, who led away eight military banners, is now gravely ill and is said to have barely four banners left, under which about 600 soldiers serve, from which we gather that not so much the Emperor as the French have suffered a great loss of soldiers in such harsh winter conditions, although there has been no open battle anywhere. But whatever the kings do foolishly, the Greeks suffer. Farewell. Basel, the seventh day before the calends of February, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
