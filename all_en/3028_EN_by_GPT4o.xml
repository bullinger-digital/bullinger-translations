      <p> Greetings. We have received the letters written by your kindness to us, most esteemed man. We give thanks for the effort, that you have deemed it worthy to write so diligently about so many matters; we also hear here that it is permissible to hope well about many things in Germany, that they will join our opinion, I think about the sacrament, and that they will allow the sacrament to be a sacrament. From Italy, we hear that the Pope has returned to his region and has realized that the way to the Kingdom of Naples is not as easy for him as he had thought, and it was said that he has an army of forty thousand; nothing else is heard now from Italy. </p>
      <p> I am pleased to dare and delay you with this: my son Alexander, traveling from here to his parish on the public road, was attacked by ten priests or phantoms of that kind, who had come here to the ordones (?) - let it be allowed to speak ill of the wicked - they beat him enough. A certain layman was present/proclaiming peace, which did not move them at all; but they also frightened him with threatened beatings. Some of them are said to be Swiss; I know none, but I expect, if they come here with the next courier. We are all well here. There is indeed a great rumor here that the plague is raging; scarcely one person dies each week; however, in some villages of our Confederation, it is quite severe. </p>
      <p> I sent letters to Tscherner today through his nephew from his daughter; for he himself and his son, our Tscherner, are not now in the city, but outside; they fled the plague, because a young man died in their house, on account of which they left the house and the city, now living in a suburban countryside. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most kind man, and do not cease to love your Philippus. Father Comander greets your kindness; for I have not yet been able to visit the other friends today. </p>
      <p> From Chur, on the 5th of October, 1556. </p>
      <p> Yours in all kindness, Philippus Gallicius. </p>
      <p> To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. ZÃ¼rich. </p>
