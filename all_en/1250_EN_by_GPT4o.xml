      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, here is your little book, which has learned to speak Italian and now flies through the mouths of our people and, as I feel, with great benefit to the gospel and great indignation of the Pharisees. Believe me, in our time there is no subject more necessary than this one, which we have just dealt with. For when the Antichrist prepares a council as a kind of stronghold, within which he can contain himself with his followers and from there attack the gospel and vigorously defend his idolatries and impieties, we certainly overthrow from the foundations whatever he builds daily, as we publish such little books everywhere. You wrote in this genre what you know from the experience of German affairs; I added what I know from the experience of the Roman Curia.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will see that the little book has grown, which you (I am sure) will approve. I am sending several copies. If only you could master our language; but you will understand from me sometime what things I thought should be added. I saw what you wrote in the preface to the fifth Decade, and I liked everything; but I would suggest adding to them what I added to your little book, and soon translating it into your language. The Decade itself also pleased me greatly, and as soon as I am able, overwhelmed as I am by business, I will make an effort so that a large part can be understood by our Italians.</p>
      <p>I write this in the town called Samaden, which is in the Engadine. For I came here to help the cause of Christ; for it is a matter of expelling the mass, and it will succeed, I think. The Anabaptists do not cease to trouble us; the Papists, however, rage more than ever before and leave no stone unturned, if by chance they could expel me and the others who flee from Italy to these Alps.</p>
      <p>The Pope has complained in the strongest terms to the Bishop of Chur (whom I think you understood to have gone to his adoration) that Vergerio was received by Raetia. He asserts that this man is his most bitter enemy and by no means willing to allow him to continue to live and preach in these valleys. But let him rage as much as he wants; your Vergerio, Bullinger, does not care a bit for the Pope. Finally, I will come to you after the synod, which will be convened next month in Chur, and in the meantime, I will not hesitate to write if I hear anything worthy of you. I commend to you this brother, who fled to Geneva, driven out by the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well. I greet all the fellow believers. Pray for me, brothers.</p>
      <p>Samaden, on the very day of St. George 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerio, servant of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
