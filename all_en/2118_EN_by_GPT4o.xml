      <p>Greetings and Peace. Although I have nothing new, I do not want your envoy, a most excellent and good man, intimate with everyone, to leave without my response; he will tell you that everything here is prosperous and with us as well, thanks to the gods. I only fear one thing, what you will say about the marriage of Spain and England, what that beast wants; but the subjects and magnates of the Kingdom of England propose that death is to be preferred, so it is hoped for a great upheaval, unless the plan changes. As for the Emperor and Ferdinand, I hear for certain, as I believed, that there is collusion between them and I fear that our Vergerius may be blind to this. I will be in Solothurn on Saturday; from there, if I have anything new, expect it from me. The Pope has been sick unto death and is still sick; but there is good hope for his recovery.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man. From Freiburg, December 20th. Always yours, Bass[afontaneus].</p>
