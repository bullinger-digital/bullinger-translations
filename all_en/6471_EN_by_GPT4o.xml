      <p>S. D. I give great thanks to your most diligent faithfulness, my brother, and I strongly urge you not to cease to faithfully pursue the matter with me. I have written to both honorable mayors and to Paul Pul, the opinion: Arnold, blessed be his memory, owes me for 2 loads of oats, that is for 14 malters, 36 guilders 16 shillings or 6 good batzen. I desire that they do not let me lose and do not deprive me of my loyalty; for I could have sold it at a higher price and for cash; but I granted it to him as a fellow citizen of Chur. You will also speak with them about this; please, they should do as I trust you. If the oats are still in Ragaz, let them be sold, if he can be released from the pledge, as soon as I have my sum, I am satisfied. If then, some costs are incurred and yet there is hope to gain something, I will reimburse you. If there is no hope, I would rather remain with one loss than suffer two. I write to you briefly; for I am in distress for two reasons. The first: last night a fire broke out at the hospital, where my brother-in-law, the hospital master Jörg Stadler, remained dead; it is believed that the goods hit him, for he fell straight down and a large wound fell into the jugular vein, etc. The second, that I am thoroughly informed that some princes with Württemberg intend to capture or overrun the Count Palatine, etc. For this, I sent a special messenger down to Heidelberg. May God break all foul practices! Let it remain with you for the time being. When the messenger returns, I will provide more and more certain information. Therefore, I cannot answer the rest; nor do I need to particularly. I inform the gentlemen that you trust me. Always pray to God for me; I am almost overwhelmed by many difficulties, but I know the Lord will not fail me until the end. My affairs and troubles and sorrow grow daily, so I need special grace. Farewell excellently with all yours. Strange things are being spread about the Italians and their expedition against the Turks. What if they pretended this, intending something else? But the Lord lives, to whom be glory.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 18, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours always, B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>[Take] care, as much as you can, to provide us with the complete (not extracted) form of the papist alliance with the 7 Cantons.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
