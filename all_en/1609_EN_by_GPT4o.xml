      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Consider my silence excused by this, honorable man: the winter season is very adverse to my sluggish old age, so that I am often forced to be absent from sermons and other duties necessary to my office. Italy is miserably torn apart by the Anabaptists, even our Valtellina. Martinengo, also infected with this plague, has set out for England. Good men must be warned against that poison, our Travers has also advised us to watch Vergerio, from which suspicion has also arisen for us. That Paravicino, who was with Vergerio in Zürich, was rejected by us and sent letters to Pontisella excusing himself: not denying the Holy Trinity, etc., as if there is much difference between denying and not wanting to confess. Vergerio wanted to receive him with such errors into our communion, which troubled us; he even sought to have the power to visit churches and depose one pastor, substitute another. Confusion would have arisen from this. Our magnates otherwise dislike us because of the Italians. For they are contentious and restless; they provoke quarrels from the slightest thing, cannot be taught by anyone, and do not relent from their obstinacy.</p>
      <p>Hence they are a burden to us. Our magnates do not love the gospel very much, for which reason, it is not permitted to write. We expect our bishop from Trento for the Easter feast. The Emperor has been hiding in Innsbruck from the feast of the Nativity until now like a brute; now at last, having regained his wings, he has emerged; he is enlisting an army in Feldkirch and Bregenz. But you can inform us more about these matters; for we hear of great disturbances everywhere. May God Almighty deign to preserve His church and keep you with us for many years. Farewell. From Chur, Rhaetia, on the 5th day of April 1552. Good brothers Philipp, Haim, and the two Tscharner greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
