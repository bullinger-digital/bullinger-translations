      <p>S. You are undoubtedly very surprised and eagerly expect to know what is happening with us, what has been done in Lausanne, and why I have not written. There is only one reason: since I returned home, I have not been able to find anyone who could travel to you. Now Jacob Stapfer offers himself to me. The situation is as follows: I left here on February 16th, hoping to return by the 24th of the same month.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I also advised D. Musculus to hasten his arrival by that day. However, just as we were about to leave, D. Steiger informed us that we also had to travel to Geneva and Thonon. I regretted having set that day for Musculus, as I could not be present. I wrote a line or two, already booted, to postpone his arrival until March 3rd. I sent these letters to him or, in his absence, to you; I assume you have received them in the meantime. Since the family could not immediately find a messenger, Musculus could not be informed through my letters.</p>
      <p>He arrived on February 23rd. I only returned on the first of March. The brothers received him very kindly in my absence; they wanted to offer or present him to the senate, but the senate refused and wanted to defer it until my arrival. After dismissing the rider, he settled in my house, enduring a long wait for me. However, upon my return, I could neither do nor wanted to do anything for his sake, as neither of the consuls was in the city, and we were daily expecting our envoys returning from Baden, Consul Negelinus and Quaestor Hallerus, whose presence will be necessary for this matter, and the lords do not want to do anything in their absence. The procedure will be as follows: we will offer and present him to the senate; they will then want and mandate us to confer with him; this will happen, and, as I hope, the matter will proceed successfully; then a certain and determined condition will be established for him. What you advise about the stipend is fair; such a man should be treated most honorably; but I will not be able to obtain a higher stipend for him than we have; ours, as you know, are so meager that they will not suffice to support his family. Therefore, I am very anxious here. If I did not have a portion from Zurich, I do not know how I would bear such expenses; the family is growing, and so is the influx of the poor and exiles. I have so far borne almost everything alone. What should I do? Should I ask?</p>
      <p>But I have never asked for anything anywhere, and it would have little honor and much offense. Since I am burdened, he will be much more burdened, whose family is far larger. If something is added only for us, the others will bite and envy; if for everyone, the others are content with theirs and do not need greater benefits. Therefore, I see Musculus being heavily burdened in this part, not lightly nor undeservedly.</p>
      <p>I relieve him of anxiety with whatever means I can; I promise better things. So that I can fulfill this, you too will share your advice with me; for there is hardly anything I abhor more than asking, yet I see it will be necessary. And it is unjust, since no city has so stained itself with the plunder of ecclesiastical wealth as ours, and no city treats its ministers more sparingly than it does. Certainly, although I have other reasons for returning to Zurich, I do not deny that this reason also weighs heavily with me and causes me many thoughts.</p>
      <p>Now, on March 2nd, the very next day after my return, my wife gave birth again to a beautiful little son, with the Lord blessing and prospering us, to whom be praise and glory.</p>
      <p>Musculus, my guest, and the daughter of D. Iodocus were witnesses at the baptism. Thus, the number of offspring grows every year; at the same time, the cares of nurturing them grow. Since these are human, I do not intend to be absent from D. Musculus; therefore, I am concerned not so much in my name as in his, and I do not know what to do, on what occasion, with what advice.</p>
      <p>You suggest, if you have anything, but for his sake; for I am well off, as long as the condition in Zurich is secure. But since he has nothing from elsewhere and is almost forced to save on the land, I see a heavy burden threatening him, which will urge him to think about changing his place. As for moving his family and belongings, I will make sure it is done conveniently. He already feels the irritability of our people; however, he is not offended but endures it modestly. You will understand everything more fully from him. The synod is approaching; therefore, I am so overwhelmed with cares and business that I can hardly even attend to Musculus during lunch and dinner hours. Ecclesiastical doctrines are being printed; as many copies as you wish will be sent. I have mutilated the preface in the first part, which seemed quite harsh at this time; the latter part will suit the work and will not harm the author. I thank you for your sermons; they will be most useful to me.</p>
      <p>The messenger to whom you entrusted them brought everything to me as far as Lausanne; there I received them and read a large part on the journey; the convenient order and familiar expression are very pleasing, and the work will certainly be most useful to all ministers.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, we accomplished the following: We settled the matter of Corbelius with the others. However, we could not resolve the controversy of Zebedee with others, except that they both promised to maintain mutual peace. In the meantime, however, they slander each other.</p>
      <p>They complain about endless, enormous things. I have never seen more contentious people, who strive to pursue every tiny matter with the strictest law. Viretus is learned, but quarrelsome and talkative. Zebedee is very quick-tempered, cannot restrain himself. However, we have done this, so we hope that with the passage of time, the heat of these contentions can subside. I fear the synod will go badly with them, although all other French chapters are well united and satisfied with us. Only that episcopal seat seeks some priority and prerogative. There are certainly many very learned and zealous men there, who promote well.</p>
      <p>Everything else was pleasing. If only these parts and hatreds would cease. It is the Lord's to reconcile minds; we will invoke Him. A public examination of classes and public lectures was also held. The examination was followed by a review. Some were dismissed and deprived of stipends. This visitation was not useless. The library was equipped, and a certain annual sum of money was allocated for its maintenance and augmentation. An inquiry into the buildings was also made, so that the dilapidated ones would be restored, etc. And what is most important and extremely necessary, we learned to know their characters more properly, and how to deal with them, which was previously unknown to all of us. After everything was settled in Lausanne, we set out for Geneva. Calvin received me very kindly in hospitality, at the same time calling together all the brothers and ministers. I discussed many things with him very freely. He would have come to the synod. But I indicated what had been decided by the Lords. He was indeed grieved: yet I could not entirely disapprove of the Lords' decision. He is a pious and learned man, and one who has great influence in France, but of a very restless nature. He seems to be retained in office in such a way that he freely understands what pleases us in him, what displeases us, to what extent we can approach him, to what extent we cannot.</p>
      <p>He presents himself as humane and easygoing, etc. From there, we ascended from the other side of Lake Geneva, so that I almost saw the entire new province.</p>
      <p>I am sending you letters from Ludwig Lavater, which he handed to me in Lausanne. He spent almost an entire month there in public hospitality, not without expenses; Vulteius Hessus, known to you, was with him; but he has now left, having obtained some position.</p>
      <p>Lavater is contemplating traveling to Italy; he says he is waiting for letters from his parent. He seems not unlearned, but to require more serious manners. I tell you this because I greatly love and revere his father; you can write back to him and advise him; I also advised him to be frugal. But these seem to be common manners of students; I remember being like that once myself.</p>
      <p>For your copy against the Interim, I give you the greatest thanks; I will act cautiously and prudently. I will transfer it after the synod; for this entire month, I will not be able to attend to my studies. I return the abundance of your letters for Musculus to us; everything is well and right. I cannot say more, as I am very busy. Today we will have a pre-synod; therefore, consider these hastily written things kindly and continue to favor and love me as you do. May the Lord keep you and bless you and all yours perpetually. Give my regards from me, my wife, to Lord Musculus, etc., to your wife, to his and both of your children, and finally to all the most esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 7, 1549. Everything so hastily that I cannot reread it; I do not know if anything has been omitted. If there is anything, I will be more diligent next time.</p>
      <p>Your [friend], whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
