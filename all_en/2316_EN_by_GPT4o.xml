      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, etc. I have recovered enough to be able to attend to my most welcome duty, albeit with difficulty; otherwise, the headache has not completely ceased; but I am compelled to bear such bodily discomforts for my age until the Lord sees fit otherwise. That you think I am consumed by domestic sorrows, dearest brother, is a remarkable sign of your concern for me, as you so diligently consider the cause of my illness. It is true, I was gravely ill while you were with us in Lenzburg; but my love for you was such that I seemed to be almost freed from my pains. However, you are mistaken, my brother, in thinking that the cause of my illness is the unfortunate marriage of my daughter. Indeed, the unfortunate event tormented me at first; but after reconciliation, I entrusted the whole matter to the heavenly Father, so that up to this time nothing less torments me. You know, my Bullinger, how sincere I am in my feelings towards you, that I wish nothing that could make me anxious to be hidden from you. I prayed to the Lord to take up my and my daughter's cause and to free me from vain anxiety; by the grace of God, I have been granted my wish, so that I can never give thanks to the Lord enough for this gift. The care of domestic matters torments me more, which compels me in this old age to live on a meager diet, which this age can bear; for I am either forced to live frugally or to be bound by debt, which I abhor so much that I would rather choose the former, albeit not without great danger to life. I have resolved, once I have recovered more fully with the Lord's help, to approach the Bernese council (which I attempt not without the advice of good men) and ask them to have a more generous regard for me. May the Lord grant a successful outcome.</p>
      <p>Everything else with me is in good condition, and I am cheerful in my duty and with an indefatigable spirit. I am well with Christ our Savior; He alone refreshes my spirit, calms my conscience, and with His help and grace, I strive and am prepared to bear anything patiently for the glory of His name. Not I, but Christ, who is stronger in me, lest I attribute anything to my own strength. The booklet you sent, I handed over to the lord prefect, who received it with the greatest pleasure; you are, believe me, most highly recommended to him; my intervention is not needed; the Lord has commended you to him. That you returned home safely is very pleasing to me, that you are compelled to repay the joy you had with greater care and concern is the fate of the children of God; thus the Lord is accustomed to mix sorrows with joys for the salvation of His elect, lest, becoming accustomed to fleeting things, they be deprived of heavenly goods. Have patience, my dear brother; there is no dish so well cooked that it lacks a fly in it.</p>
      <p>God alone is the never-ending joy of the soul. The prefect greets you very much... Johannes Delsperger, our Hamman. That I have shown you no courtesy, I beg you to attribute to my illness. God may perhaps grant a way to make up for this error.</p>
      <p>Farewell, incomparable friend, my dearest Bullinger. Greet on my behalf Mr. Gwalter, Frisius, your wife along with the whole family; continue to love your old friend. Given at Lenzburg on the very day of Gervasius, which is June 19, in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Your dear and old friend Gervasius, etc. To his old friend and dearest brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, I say friend and incomparable brother, etc.</p>
