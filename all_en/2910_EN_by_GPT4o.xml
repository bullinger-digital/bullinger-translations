      <p>Greetings. I am truly grateful to you, my most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, for your most beneficial instruction, which I realize more and more each day how greatly it has strengthened me.</p>
      <p>Here are letters also to Mr. Gesner, from whom, although I will be separated again tomorrow by some distance as I set out for Padua, I will not fail to frequently send you the desired fish, whatever I can obtain, and to transmit to you whatever is worthy of knowing. But hey, you harsh and vehement men, Westphalus, with the modesty he usually employs, has not yet risen against any man with insults or any monstrous impudence.</p>
      <p>Behold an example of simplicity in him! Alas, how much the old papism, I fear, is being brought back in full by these scoundrels and is spreading so greatly. He tries to attribute your temperance to himself, which he does not even know how to imitate, and he projects his envy onto you.</p>
      <p>However, be seriously cautious not to respond harshly to a trivial man. It was not at all appropriate to send images or something of that sort, which was not your duty by right, as undoubtedly you have incurred not a few expenses there, although not despising them, I certainly hold them dearer with greater esteem, as they have come from a most loving man. Everything else with us is going well, except that travelers are exposed everywhere to the plunder of robbers and the remnants of warlike tumult.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most honorable man. May God grant that I may see you safe and sound again.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, May 2, 1556.</p>
      <p>Commend me to Mr. Gesner and our friends of better note.</p>
      <p>Yours most sincerely, Raphael Seiler wrote.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and faithful minister of the divine proclamation, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
