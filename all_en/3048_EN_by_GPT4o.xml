      <p>To Count Georg of Württemberg 22nd November 1556.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of the Lord's Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ, there has never been a lack on our part to do everything possible, yet not to do anything that would be against the word of the Lord. I have also, in my last letter, where we were treated very indiscreetly, let all love and friendship be known. However, in my and others' opinion, it is much more important to win over our brothers who rise against us; for some do not want to see or hear us or our books, since Dr. Luther, of blessed memory, condemned us as the worst heretics. They proceed with very inappropriate speech, unable to do anything but scold the enthusiasts. With these, nothing helps, etc. Then there are others who give the Augsburg Confession as much weight as the Bible, and what is contained therein, they hold as if it were the word of God. It is indeed not less, for the most part, well-founded, and also the 10th article on the Lord's Supper, if not interpreted so grossly, could be tolerated to some extent. But then they add the Apology of the Confession, which states that the 10th article was accepted by the emperor or his representatives, where it is well known what they accepted, as they condemned us and our churches from that same diet according to the decree. Furthermore, the Apology adds: lovely, substantial, and as it holds the Greek and Roman church, etc. But it is not convenient for us, who have departed from human teachings, especially from the Roman church, and particularly from this article, to consent to such a thing. And yet, it is now mostly demanded that we accept this confession. Also, at this time, Mr. Johann Brenz, a learned man, has published three sermons, where he also holds the substance of this sacrament no differently and thus speaks of the body of Christ as if it were, like the divinity, everywhere, and therefore there is no small disagreement in this matter. However, there are four or five chapters. We say that the words; "This is my body" are figurative; they deny that. We say that in the Supper there is a spiritual presence of Christ; they want a bodily one, yet unspeakable. We say that our Lord Jesus' body is a true body and, by its nature, not everywhere at the same time in all places, but in heaven and not on earth. But they also say, the Lord has a true body, but because of the union of the person, it is everywhere, also on earth, yet invisibly. We say, the body and blood of Christ are spiritual food and drink, only (along with the forms of bread and wine orally) spiritually consumed by the believers through faith. But they say in return, it is also a bodily food, which (not only the forms) is consumed with the mouth, also by Judas and any unbeliever who otherwise receives the sacrament. These are the main chapters in which we disagree, which are also not insignificant in my understanding.</p>
      <p>If one could not reconcile, it would be good not to consign each other so vehemently to the devil and condemn each other. For such strengthens and delights the papists, but also offends many pious hearts. May God allow the servants of my gracious lord in Württemberg, your princely grace's cousins, whether Brenz or others, if not further, at least with friendly writings to reach out to us, presenting their grounds and scripturally accepting our response graciously; perhaps so much could be prepared that one could later come together with fruit and deal with each other. For if one cannot or will not understand each other better over time, it is to be feared that one would come together with little fruit. For if one were to part without reconciliation, it would cause much outcry and offense, as your princely grace can better consider.</p>
      <p>However, the friendly writings, written together in trust in the shortest time, would give a good entrance and slightly mitigate the mistrust. What I and others can do well in this regard, we are inclined and willing. Praying to God that He may grant grace, etc.</p>
