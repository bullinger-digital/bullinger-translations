      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Why my Conrad, a young man not only of great promise but of commendable achievement, is now coming to you, he will explain in person. I ask that you either provide him with a stipend or treat him as emancipated and made his own master. I will then take upon myself the primary care of his character and will strive to ensure that, in addition to the cultivation of his intellect and the fruit of piety, he finds a suitable living condition. He found companions for the journey without my expecting it. Therefore, it was scarcely possible to do otherwise. Otherwise, perhaps you will call the young man's eager plan and my indulgence light, as we have suddenly embarked on the journey. But I believe you will consider what should be allowed to a young man who loves his homeland and is deprived of the comfort of a parent. Farewell, and complete our common offspring - for I also claim a part of it for myself - finally to perfection, that is, make an effort to send him off with an honorable stipend according to his wish, to see various human customs and cities.</p>
      <p>I know the rumor there is against the Emperor, who is said to be wintering in Milan with his Spaniards to intimidate the Swiss Confederates. Many such things are thrown around in the Emperor's councils, I have no doubt, and perhaps the adversaries will threaten terrors in appearance. However, nothing serious will be undertaken against you who strive diligently and piously. There are two things I consider in the Emperor: a mind averse to wars and a zeal for amassing an infinite treasury. He knows war is costly and fertile in new tumults. As for us, we will strive with our own, we will pray to Christ the protector, that he may grant us increased faith in peace, by which we may tranquilly cultivate piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. The rest from our Geßner.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 17th of November, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Greet all the professors and preachers, especially Theodor, from me. You will greet Diethelm the consul and all the best from me.</p>
      <p>W. Köpffel, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and piously learned men, Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, churchmen of Zurich, esteemed lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
