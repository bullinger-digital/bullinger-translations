      <p>Grace from God and His mercy be upon us at all times. Amen.</p>
      <p>I must further inform you of my affairs and others as well. I bought a house in Suhr from my father-in-law for 200 guilders, 100 of which were to remain as a mortgage on the house, and the rest I was to pay by the agreed deadline. For this, I was to build a blacksmith's shop at my own expense and buy blacksmith tools, which I did. I had a year to complete the purchase, and if I did not fulfill the purchase and gave it up, my construction would remain with him, and I would receive nothing for it, which cost me about 12 guilders, and the blacksmith tools also had to be left with him for a nominal fee, which cost me much more, long term. It so happened that my father-in-law reneged on the purchase, claiming he had been deceived about the 100 guilders that were to remain as a mortgage on the house, and they also had to be redeemed, as he had guarantors who no longer wanted to be guarantors. I had a servant who was in his ear, saying that if I were to leave, he would gladly take the 100 guilders from him. Because I could not afford it, I had to give up the purchase and leave with much trouble and waiting, which would be too much to write about. In 2 years, I paid 11 guilders and 3 batzen in interest and spent 6 weeks in military service and 8 weeks sick, and pawned 2 crowns, and my Anna was sick for 6 weeks, and so unexpectedly I had to move to Othmarsingen in winter, praise be to God, in whom I have placed my hope. I bought blacksmith tools again for 31 guilders, half of which is now paid, but otherwise suffer poverty, but the Lord gives patience in the cross and suffering at all times, praise and honor be to God, that He has chosen me for this. Time is short here.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone in your house for me, and have no doubt that you will be paid, even if it should fail with my father-in-law with the letter, of which I have no doubt, I would still pay you now and spare us sooner. Better times will come, God willing. God be with us.</p>
      <p>In the 37th year, in the weeks after the day of St. Bartholomew.</p>
