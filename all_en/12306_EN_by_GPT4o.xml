    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius did not know [Jakob] Held and only knew that Held, who had lived in Basel for a while, occasionally visited someone [...]. Myconius reluctantly accepted an invitation to dinner from Held and his host. At the table, Held revealed himself to be a Schwenckfelder. Myconius was startled but continued to listen until Held explained that there was a good chance of understanding between Schwenckfeld and the [Confederates]; however, he did not know who could propose a joint conversation with Schwenckfeld to [Joachim] Vadian and the people of Zurich. He asked if Myconius would be willing to do so. Myconius agreed but noted that he had little influence with the prominent men, although they would likely be interested in the transmission of this message. He still does not understand why he should have made himself guilty by this, especially since he warned Bullinger in his letter [No. 2243] to be cautious, thinking of past experiences [of the Confederates] with [Hans] Denck, [Andreas] Karlstadt, [Ulrich von] Hutten, and the Dean of Passau [Ruprecht von Mosham]. - The reward he reaped for this is evident from the response of the people of Zurich [No. 2255]. They now suspect him of Schwenckfeldianism! Him, who barely understands the incomprehensible writings of Schwenckfeld! Him, who hates the name of this deceiver of men and never wanted to read his writings because he learned how he deprived the risen Christ of his human nature! Myconius also repeatedly had to deal with the audacity of Schwenckfeld's followers. For example, he had to answer a letter from a noble [Schwenckfelderin, Margareta von Grafeneck], to her sister [Elisabeth Hecklin?]. He also experienced firsthand how little the Schwenckfelders value the preaching, the Lord's Supper, and the faith [of the Protestants]. But now he is suspected of Schwenckfeldianism! He, who built his house on the rock and believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, truly human and truly God, who sits at the right hand of God, the Almighty Father! - The people of Zurich and Bullinger should treat Myconius more decently and not write to him in a commanding tone: "Leave us alone about [Schwenckfeld]!" For if Myconius is bothersome to the people of Zurich just because he reported that Schwenckfeld is seeking a conversation with the Confederates, then he better not write anymore! - To be clear: He is not an advocate of a conversation with Schwenckfeld in Switzerland, where he is obviously seeking refuge. - However, Myconius thanks Bullinger for the news in his letter [No. 2255]. That Bullinger mentions the deceased [Zurich] city clerk [Werner Beyel] and the visit of the city clerk [Georg Frölich] from Augsburg in the same breath allows for speculation about the successor of the deceased... - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace. I had never seen Held before, nor had I heard his name. By chance, he came here to visit someone I know, who is temporarily residing here. What they discussed among themselves, I do not know. They called me to join them as a guest. Reluctantly, I prepared myself. Upon my arrival, Held greeted me quite courteously. I responded in my usual manner and was led to the table. We sat down and conversed, as is customary.</p>
      <p>Then, among other things, he mentioned Schwencfeld and freely confessed to being his disciple. I was horrified, I admit, for I have hated that name for several years now. He continued as he had begun. I listened until he mentioned a colloquy; he spoke as if there was good hope that if you listened to each other in person, it would greatly benefit the concord of the church. "This one thing," he said, "is currently missing, that I have no one to attempt to obtain a colloquy from Vadian and the people of Zurich. What if you, whom I have heard more than once to be a lover of peace and concord, took on this small task?" Here I replied briefly: "I am not the one whose persuasions would move great men; therefore, I do not intercede, but I can willingly inform them of your intention, whatever they may eventually respond. For I am convinced that they will consider my effort here in good faith." Upon hearing this, the man seemed pleased that he had found someone who was so accommodating. "Until now, no one has been found who would undertake even this small task of informing. What sin there would be in informing, while I could not perceive, I proceeded and fulfilled what I had promised, but so tepidly, as my letters, which you have, not I, prove, that from them you can easily discern my mind, if you wish. I added advice on what seemed to me to be considered in consultation before a colloquy was admitted: the matter itself, the erroneous person, and the danger to Switzerland (where indeed, to speak clearly, I referred to Denck the Anabaptist, to Karlstadt, to Hutten, to the Dean of Passau, I believe, not entirely imprudently) - by all of which I meant nothing else than to make known my opinion on not admitting the man to a colloquy (unless you thought otherwise) and to prevent any bad suspicion about me."</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, what I have achieved is evident from your letters. You fear for me, not that I am, but that I might become a Schwencfeldian. Good God! How unfortunate I am in writing, that with all I have written, I could not prevent you from suspecting me of that unheard-of doctrine! I would become a Schwencfeldian, who barely understands what it means! Until now, I have pursued simple and certain things; what he writes, as far as I know, are such that I frankly admit I do not know what they are, and when I reach the end, I doubt whether what he has in mind can be rightly expressed. For so long, I have detested his name because of the disturbances he caused in some churches and among certain simpler men and women of the nobility, that I have often refused to hear or read it in the titles of pamphlets.</p>
      <p>I remain silent about the pamphlets themselves, which I never wanted to inspect, even when asked, after I heard that the doctrine was: In death, Christ shed all humanity and became wholly God. For it was new, absurd, abominable. Moreover, I have heard more than once about the insolence and arrogance in those people; and I finally experienced the same from the very long letters of a certain noblewoman to her sister - which indeed this (sister) offered to me to read and examine, and even to respond to; in which matter I indeed provided my effort. Finally, I also learned from experience their contempt against the ministry of the word, against the Lord's Supper (which they assert is not necessary), against our doctrine and faith (which they plainly proclaim must be avoided). With these and many other things known - and indeed far more serious - you still fear that I might become a disciple of Schwencfeld! But long ago, because I am less learned and less experienced, you began to burden me with suspicions (which I commit to the Lord)! Therefore, while you do the same today, it must be endured and overcome with patience. Meanwhile, I am not moved from my place, because I hope I have built my house on the rock. For I believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, true God and true man, and that he now sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty and intercedes for us. Schwencfeld cannot exalt Christ more, whatever he may babble about absorbed humanity!</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish that you and your brothers would think somewhat more civilly - to say nothing else - of me; for then you would not have written so contemptuously and imperiously: "And let us henceforth be unconcerned about him!" If I was bothersome merely by indicating Schwencfeld's intention (to which I nevertheless added advice not to hear him, indeed not to admit him to Switzerland), it would be better henceforth to indicate nothing, to write nothing, lest I disturb you (for I have heard, thanks to God, that I am not a disturber, but a conciliator), unless your mind is different towards me than your words express. For there is not a single word in that command of yours that is not spoken emphatically. But whatever it is, I indeed bear it, and I say that such a word is not fitting for brothers towards a brother, who has deserved nothing of it. I, so may the Lord love me well, wrote with the most sincere mind. You either did not understand this sincerity or you dissimulated it in the letters given to me.</p>
      <p>To speak clearly, therefore: It does not please my mind that Caspar Schwencfeld should be admitted to a colloquy in Switzerland. For although it is written: "Test everything; hold fast to what is good," yet what he proposes seems so absurd (no matter how much he adduces many things both from the scriptures for himself and from the fathers), that he should by no means be heard, especially in Switzerland, as he seems to seek refuge, almost destined for exile, for reasons perhaps beneficial to him, but not commonly dangerous to them. Meanwhile, I have done my duty both towards you (as I have made you more certain of my duty to see simply and amicably about Schwencfeld's mind) and towards Held (who asked me to do so). Therefore, everything you wrote pleases me up to the command more than reasonably unpleasant and harsh to a friend.</p>
      <p>For the rest in your letter, I thank you. I also like Lęti's humanity in all things, although I only know him from writings. While you join two chief grammarians - one living, the other deceased - something about succession comes to mind; for it is certain that Zurich does not displease Lęti, but the luxury of the Augsburgers does. Now I think I have responded to both of your letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Pellican and Theodor and the others. Basel, October 3, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
