      <p>Greetings. You have not forgotten, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, what I recently asked you about the Sunnemann case when I was there, among other things, which I now also ask you even more, as I seem to have more reason to do so at this time. For last night, the Reverend Johannes Lang, pastor of the church in the Valais, migrated to the heavenly Father, so it is necessary to provide for another as soon as possible. Therefore, remember the excellent Heinrich Lutz, and also my petition, so that the considerable inconvenience of Sunnemann, which he has endured with great trouble for several years in Celle, may be alleviated by this change of place. I have also written about this to our Rudolf Gwalther, so that with your combined votes, what we desire may be achieved. I do not press with many words, as I am convinced that, for your uncommon love towards me, you will attempt everything so that what I so greatly desire for the sake of the good old man may be happily and promptly accomplished for me. I wrote to you yesterday through Wimpfer's son, and there is nothing else now that I need to inform you of, except that it is again written from Augsburg that certain orders of the empire will not be present at the council, either in person or through their delegates, which is about to begin.</p>
      <p>May Christ, the King of Glory, powerfully vindicate His only bride and dove from these eagles, hawks, vultures, and indeed harpies with His mighty arm, and may He once and for all destroy this entire mass of lies with the spirit of His truth. Let us seriously turn to the Lord and with holy perseverance knock on the doors of His grace and supreme mercy, so that we may enter into His rest, eternally happy with all the children of God. Farewell, my soul, with your most chaste wife and sweetest children and the rest of your household, whom we, along with my dear little wife, who dutifully bid them farewell, diligently and earnestly commend to the Lord with pious prayers. Farewell again. The day before the calends of May 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The little letter, which you now receive, is addressed to Rosti's wife, and I earnestly ask you to ensure it is delivered to her as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>But what about our Johannes of Ghent there? To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother and friend. Zurich.</p>
