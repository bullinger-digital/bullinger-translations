    <p xml:id="regest1">The person recommended by Bullinger was sent to Liestal as a schoolmaster and must also preach in the neighboring community [Lausen]; his knowledge of Latin is good, but his suitability as a preacher remains to be tested; the recommendations from Bullinger, [Johannes?] Hospinian, and a citizen who has known him since his youth have helped him. Bucer is expected to return [to Strasbourg] soon and will be represented [in Bonn] by Hedio; [Archbishop Hermann of Wied] is proceeding resolutely, while the situation with the Bishop of Strasbourg [Erasmus Schenk von Limpurg] is getting worse. He is surprised that Bullinger has not reported on the Venetians, who are said to have turned to the people of Zurich for the sake of the Gospel, nor on the fate of the red-bearded monk whom the people of Uri protected from his Italian pursuers; this puts Myconius in a difficult position, as it is assumed that no news from Zurich remains unknown to him. He has only now learned of the suffering of Dr. Christoph [Klauser] after the death of his wife [Margaretha, née Rüttimann] and particularly regrets his paralysis; his successor [as city physician] will probably be [Konrad] Gessner, otherwise Myconius would recommend the letter bearer Philipp [von Hertenstein], who is approaching his doctoral promotion and is already practicing with great success [in Basel]; Myconius has known him for a long time and understands that after his expulsion [from Zofingen] he gave up the [pastoral] office. Greetings; Theodor [Bibliander] should write to him again. Bullinger will have heard how Pierre Caroli challenged [Guillaume] Farel, or he can inquire further with Myconius; is it true that Emperor [Charles V] is in Milan, as Martin Cellarius [Borrhaus] reported?</p>

      <p>Greetings. The person you recommended was sent to Liestal after being examined, along with letters from the deputies, to oversee the school there. There is an adjoining church outside the town where he must preach every Sunday for half an hour. He has committed himself to carry out this task diligently. He reads Latin beautifully and interprets it well; however, he lacks the practice of applying sentences to doctrine, as he has never considered the duty of preaching for such a long time. Nevertheless, he promised to apply himself with such diligence that he can fulfill this duty and prepare himself for something greater in the future. Your recommendation helped him greatly. There was also an intercession from Hospinian and then from a certain citizen, who is very grateful to me, saying that he has known the man almost since childhood and that he has always shown nothing but integrity. I am therefore waiting to see how he will conduct himself.</p>
      <p>Bucer is expected any day; Hedio will temporarily fill his place. The old man is acting resolutely; however, the Bishop of Strasbourg is deteriorating daily. I heard about the Venetians, that they requested something concerning the Gospel from you; it is surprising, if true, that you have not mentioned anything about it, nor about the red-bearded monk with a long beard who was veiled, as the people of Uri dealt with him piously when some persecutors from Italy captured him there. For they say that he eventually came to you and was then sent to a certain place. Indeed, I am questioned about such matters by good men, and when I do not respond, they consider it a tale, as they think I am unaware of nothing that happens there.</p>
      <p>And these days I finally received news about Dr. Christoph, that he has been in a miserable state since the death of his wife. And who would have thought so? I am exceedingly grieved and continue to grieve, especially when I hear that he has become almost useless due to paralysis. If true, you would need another doctor. But Gessner will undoubtedly succeed, and if he were not available, I would recommend Philipp, who delivers this letter, to you. He is regarded as a licentiate by our doctors and will soon receive his doctorate once he has a certain position. There is no doubt about his practice; in the meantime, while he devoted himself to his doctorate here, almost no sick person in the city did not turn to him, and he restored those who were gravely ill.</p>
      <p>He is known to me for many years as a good and learned man and a lover of justice, which indeed led to his removal from the pulpit; for the people of Paris did not want to endure him, and they expelled him. I would very much like to see him well advised, after he has devoted himself entirely to this place and, in my view, not unsuccessfully. I find it difficult to approve of leaving a vocation; but what Philipp did, I would not dare to disapprove; it seems to me that he was not treated amicably, to say the least. Although I do not recommend the man because of our Kunhard, I nevertheless ask that if you can give any good advice, you do not deny it, even in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with your family. Tell Lord Theodor, I ask, to greet me sometime, unless he is completely without leisure.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, June 12, 1543.</p>
      <p>As for Lord Peter Caroli, who was once with us while you were also present, a theologian from the Sorbonne, as I said, he challenged Farel to a contest, you surely know. But if you do not know and wish to know, let me know, etc. Martin Cellarius told me today that the Emperor is in Milan. Please tell me if it is true.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
