      <p>Regarding the Confederates' capitulation, you will find something worm-eaten; for it cannot be that they all speak or write from the same empty pot.</p>
      <p>Now, Balta√üar Heer has told me all the matters orally. So then your man said: [Where is it]; it has been dealt with; but I was not present[, it went on; but now wanting to know nothing of those things is too much. Therefore, as we do it, so it is in all places.</p>
      <p>What our people proposed to the Duke as articles, Mr. Garnerius will say in a summary.</p>
      <p>At first, there was nothing to discuss, that one should have the advice of the Confederates, because our people were quite prepared for it, it had been dealt with in Baden (as it was dealt with there). It happened with dangers, that they were informed neither little nor much of those things. It had previously been advised by the Confederates not to engage in any dealings with Philip, but after given advice, they, the Confederates, entered into the alliance; they had left our people out of it.</p>
      <p>Hercules a Salicibus had pointed out some things to the Lord of Com himself shortly thereafter, but he, the Lord of Com, laid all the blame on the Five Places.</p>
      <p>Therefore, one must now hurry to spite the Five Places, who have already written to the governor of Milan and admonished him to let our people go idle.</p>
      <p>And so that you know the matter, Philipp's messenger, upon his first request from our lords, the Three Leagues, obtained a dismissal (this I did not know): so if he came with reasonable articles, they were willing, in the name of God, to make an attempt with him and to help him with the communities for an alliance; whereupon he would come again with chapters.</p>
      <p>This is what our people do, saying that there is no war in France, etc. And if we equip the points immediately, then the leaders and their party would want to have a part in it.</p>
      <p>I fear unrest; for the brother of the Lord of Rozins has ridden from Valtellina, where he is now captain, to Venice. What he is practicing there is well to be assumed. Si Gallus etiam venit and his mother has already been made, and one should strike it down for him, think you, what disturbances. What peace can there be in such matters?</p>
      <p>I would like to prevent it; but I fear worse things and seditions, internal and external evils.</p>
      <p>- not to be satisfied with the means provided, so one would come out with good success. The legate has refrained from the pass halfway outwards, and our people have unanimously rejected it. Chur, March 5, 1564.</p>
