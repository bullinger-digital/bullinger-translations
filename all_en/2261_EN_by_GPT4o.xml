      <p>Greetings, and all the love and good I can offer, first of all.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and trusted friend, the Bavarian marshal Pangratz von Freiberg has reported, after he entrusted three young boys, his sons, to Mr. Geßner in Zurich not only for the sake of learning, which he does not doubt at all, as they will be well and Christianly instructed, but also placed them in his care for board, for quite some time now, that Mr. Geßner's wife is very frugal and exacting, and supposedly gives the young boys, who are still tender and well-bred, nothing but soup and coarse beef and such things to eat, even though he from Freiberg willingly pays 100 florins annually, etc.</p>
      <p>He has therefore asked me for advice. I have told him that I know no better means or way than to write to you, my trusted sir, and ask you to speak with Mr. Geßner and especially with his wife, so that the boys are kept clean and well with food, drink, and lodging according to their youth and origin. And if it should be the case that the lady, on whom it would most depend, is not willing, which I do not expect, I still ask for help and advice, so that these young ones may be placed in another and better place for food and drink, and nevertheless remain with the honorable and renowned man, Mr. Geßner, for their learning. I, along with the man from Freiberg, who is a God-loving man, would like to earn your friendly favor in this matter.</p>
      <p>As for me, by the grace of the Almighty, all is well. I am once again securely free and well within my old possessions without any loss, and I am also appointed as the commander over cavalry and infantry by the Roman king and the other Roman confederate states. I have also once again appointed a preacher in my market and authority, who publicly proclaims nothing but the pure and clear word of God to me and my subjects, which no one around me does. I have removed the mass priests, sitting right in the midst of the Jews. And although the cardinal in Augsburg, as well as the aforementioned clergy along with their followers, do not like to see this, I proceed in God's name.</p>
      <p>No one dares to attack me, things go as God wills, and I will persist in my Christian endeavor, whatever may come, as God wills. I have informed you of this so that you have a report of my situation, and you may inform Mayor Haab and Labater along with other good friends and my gracious lords, offering my willing services, as they may not want to keep it secret. Otherwise, things are entirely confused with us; we prepare for war every hour and day and yet do not know fundamentally against whom it will be. God protect you. Dated Burtenbach, the 14th of April, in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>S[ebastian] Schertlin von Burtenbach, knight. To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, etc., my dear sir and good friend.</p>
