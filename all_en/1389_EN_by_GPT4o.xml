      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I approached Mr. Valentin Nusb√§um, who said he had sent a package 14 days ago, which was sent to him from Strasbourg by a certain citizen from Baden, perhaps received in those days. He also gave these, which he said he received 6 days ago, and did not fall upon the courier. It is strange what you write about the commentary on the first epistle to the Corinthians by Peter Martyr, as it does not exist.</p>
      <p>Lazius writes to Oporinus from Vienna that the Turk is threatening with great forces and making incursions into the rural population, abducting many. A very serious war threatens the Austrians; soldiers are being conscripted to be sent to Hungary. Farewell. If you have anything from England and Italy, I beg you to share it.</p>
      <p>Our Myconius is ill, and the plague is beginning to spread among the best men. Therefore, pray for us. Farewell again. August 29th. Greet Theodor for me.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Minster in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
