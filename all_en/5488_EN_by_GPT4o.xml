      <p>Greetings. I am expecting the items I sent in recent days through the one who brought letters from you to Dr. Gessner.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, a messenger from the Prince of Hesse came to me, sent regarding some questions; I was only able to dispatch him today. He brought various things, especially those concerning the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>The princes held a meeting in Fulda on September 12, mainly consulting about the council. They concluded that they do not wish to send representatives to the council, but they prepared two documents, the first to the Emperor, in which they urge him to abolish the Council of Trent and to convene a legitimate council in Germany. They are now about to present this to the Emperor at the Frankfurt assembly.</p>
      <p>The second and later document is extensive, in which they explain why they do not wish to submit to or communicate with the Council of Trent. He sent me a copy of both.</p>
      <p>I hope the princes themselves will publish them under their own name, and I believe the Prince of Saxony has been instructed to ensure it is printed in Wittenberg. I am sharing the news I have received in this letter, which you will return to me enclosed with your next letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your dear brothers.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Galli 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Whether I write or not, always greet Dr. Gallicius, both consuls, and Pontasella for me.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and compatriot. Chur.</p>
