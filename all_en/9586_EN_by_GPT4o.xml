      <p>Greetings. Today is the eighth day since I replied to your last letter.</p>
      <p>I had entrusted them to our Mr. Haller for delivery, and since I thought you had received them, he now indicates that he found no one to whom he could safely entrust them. Thus, he returned them to me yesterday. Now I am sending them to you enclosed in this package. I have included a letter from Mr. Campelli with yours, which he requested back from me; I ask you to deliver it to him. I am sending three copies of booklets that I have just published, the first for Mr. Willi, the second for Mr. Campelli, to whom I ask you to deliver these two copies and commend me to them, asking that they kindly accept them from me and remember me in their prayers. The third is yours.</p>
      <p>I have been ill almost since the end of January, and yet, amidst my other affairs and my infirmity, I have produced these few booklets in a few days rather than composed them. My son-in-law Simler and I have divided the work: he writes in Latin and extensively, I in German and popularly for the understanding of the common people, and briefly encompassing much in few words.</p>
      <p>I hope Simler's book, which will reach about 17 pages, will be completed in these days. It will be for you and other good men to judge our work.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend me to the Lord in your prayers. Zurich, March 5, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From the Netherlands, from Antwerp, distressing letters are being written about how, at the end of January, the Spaniards suffered a greater defeat at sea than ever before in this war. The best ships, about 14, were captured by the Gueux, many were sunk, and only 8 people were kept alive; all the others were thrown from the ships into the sea, so that the shores of the sea were full of dead bodies, the likes of which have never been seen before, etc. Now there is a rumor that 12,000 arquebusiers, 3,000 horses, Germans, are rushing into Lorraine to retake the county and perhaps move further, etc.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, honorable lord and my beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
