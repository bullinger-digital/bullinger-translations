      <p>S. I commend to your reverence this Stephanus Canensis from Cividale del Friuli, a man not unfit, and at the same time, we all commend ourselves to your prayers as Davos is about to be sought. Meanwhile, it is not Scipio Calandrinus from Morbegno who was wounded, but another minister, from Mals, named Laurentius, about whom I wrote to you previously when I was explaining the acts of our synod to you. Indeed, everything happened as I wrote. I cannot say more. May God keep you safe for us as a father for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, 1572, February 25.</p>
      <p>The lords have assigned us a certain honorable citizen to serve us.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned doctor of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
