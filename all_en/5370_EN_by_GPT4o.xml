      <p>S. I finally received the letters from Baden that you sent to me on June 9th.</p>
      <p>What I have now received, I have written to my brother; he will share them with you. I am compelled to add one thing to this, which particularly distresses me; for the people of Geneva, in the midst of these dangers, have recently written to our people quite contemptuously about those private controversies they have with them. Among other things, they announce to them to look after their own churches; they will also take care of theirs. For it has happened so far, since Savoy was occupied by our people, that for the convenience of the locations, some ministers from Geneva have preached in places belonging to us and vice versa, ours in their places. They now want to abolish this communion, and what torments me and all of us the most, among other things, they use this mockery: our ministers preach according to our reformation, but theirs according to the word of God. This bites and vexes ours so badly that nothing is above it.</p>
      <p>So there is much to do, and envy and malice do not cease. May God have mercy on us and improve everything!</p>
      <p>Consul Steiger, Diesbach, Haller, Hagius, my father-in-law, and all the Zehenders greet you. May all the brothers, finally the wife and the whole household, be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 21, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
