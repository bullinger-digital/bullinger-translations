    <p xml:id="regest1">Is confident that the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] will join the Reformation, especially since, among others, the chancellor [Bernhard von Hagen] and other scholars are well-disposed towards it; also [Martin] B[ucer] will certainly prove himself. Thanks God for Bullinger's comfort and friendship, Bullinger should pray for them, which he will also do. Has not yet been able to read the "Dialogus [Neobuli]", but others agree with Bullinger's [negative] judgment. Welcomes Vadian's writing ["Pro veritate carnis triumphantis Christi"] as a good refutation of [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld's doctrine; it would be desirable for him and his numerous followers, especially the many in Ulm, to return to the right doctrine, although they may be difficult to convert. Bullinger's commentary on Matthew is very much liked by Blarer as well as [Johannes] Zwick, but they do not want to judge it; they wish Bullinger would comment on all the books of the Bible; thanks for sending Vadian's writing and a part of Bullinger's commentary on Matthew; hopes to be able to show his gratitude in another way soon. [Johannes] Zwick or Blarer will send an excerpt of the speech of the French envoy [Fran√ßois Olivier] [at the Diet], which, according to Konrad Zwick, struck partly evangelical and critical tones towards Emperor [Charles V.], which is why the envoy only allowed a partial transcript; will also send the concerns of the [Electoral] Saxon theologians; at the Diet [in Speyer] neither Philipp [Melanchthon] nor the other theologians are present; disappointment over the unsatisfactory course. Request for information about the recruitment of troops by the French King [Francis I.]. In Metz, the Reformation has allegedly prevailed; may God continue to spread His kingdom! Greetings. Cannot write more in haste, as the messenger does not allow him time.</p>

      <p>Much and indeed more than much greetings, my esteemed and dearly beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Truly, I am led by many conjectures regarding the Archbishop of Cologne to believe that he is now purely and sincerely considering and deciding to embrace the truth more closely, especially because he does not have a Pharisaic nature, and also because he has not exercised tyranny over the professors of the Gospel as many others have. Add to this, that he has a chancellor, whom they call Bernhard von Hagen, and some others who are his advisors, who are learned and particularly favorable to the doctrine of Christ, so that I now fear less about a failure, since I have been able to learn these things from some trustworthy and excellent men. Regarding what you write about the cover, I think there is no danger, at least as far as this is concerned. For I hope that Martin Bucer will fulfill all the good catechist's requirements, which, however, we must also pray and beseech the Lord to make him do. They affirm that the magistrate of Cologne and a good part of the citizens have long been more favorable to the Gospel, so that it is even more to be hoped that the kingdom of Christ will be happily propagated there.</p>
      <p>That you console me in my mourning, you do so in your usual manner and dutifully, and I give thanks to my God through Christ Jesus, who thus continually supports and strengthens me, a man of no account, with the faith and help of those who are of great importance in His house. If He wishes this good to be perpetual for me, there is nothing further that I need to ask of Him, since from this I seem to be able to most certainly conclude that I am loved, held, and tenderly cherished by Him as a most beloved son by a father, whom He will also deem worthy of heaven, once the course of this mortality is completed. You, as you do, constantly intercede with the Lord for us, that we may truly be and always remain humble and displeased with ourselves, as you write us to be. In turn, we will never cease to pray for you, that you, who are great not only in my judgment, may continually grow greater with the increase of the divine spirit.</p>
      <p>I have not yet had the time to read that dialogue, which you call "a most foolish little book" because of its odious title; but some others, who are not endowed with a coarse judgment, have read it, and they also subscribe to your judgment.</p>
      <p>I received Vadian's "Anakephalaiosis" with joy, as it seems to me to refute learnedly and gravely, and even strongly, yet modestly, the pestilent doctrine of that most slippery spirit, which indeed drags with it a train of errors and blasphemies against Christ. May the Lord graciously deliver us from that sweet poison with a fuller taste of His spirit and sanctify us through His truth. Would that Schwenckfeld and those whom he has led astray from the sound doctrine of the Lord would someday return to the way. He has driven many mad, especially in the church of Ulm, for whom it would be most difficult to bring them back to a better mind, so that we too must fear that they may be deceived by Satan transformed into an angel of light.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries on Matthew, like all your works, please us exceedingly, which you have so moderated that they bring neither tedium by prolixity nor obscurity by brevity, but explain with pleasant prolixity and clear brevity, as much as can be sufficient and pleasing, with great grace, so that we rightly proclaim you blessed with such gifts of the Lord, who are such a fruitful olive tree in His house. However, neither Zwick nor I presume to act as critics, who once judged every kind of writing, to pronounce anything about this book of yours, except what our love for you suggests; and you well know what kind of judge that is. Certainly, we are so pleased with these things that we think you have made a great effort with this commentary. May the Lord grant that we may someday see all the volumes of the Bible illustrated in this manner by you.</p>
      <p>We give thanks for the never-perishing grace both for Vadian's little book and indeed for that part of your commentaries. It is our misfortune, not envy, that we cannot in turn repay you with anything of the sort, and would that it were otherwise; nothing is more in our prayers, which the Lord may grant us, when He sees fit. Amen.</p>
      <p>A fragment of the speech that the envoy of the King of the French has already delivered at the Diet will be sent to you either by Zwick or by me. Our Konrad Zwick writes that this orator is a most learned and truly pious man, but that he has mixed in some things more than sufficiently evangelical, and some also against the Emperor, and therefore did not want to allow the entire speech to be transcribed, but only exhibited this part. Another schedule of the deliberation of the Saxon theologians will also be sent to you. Neither Philipp Melanchthon nor any of the theologians are present at the Diet. The same cousin of ours indicates that some things are being conducted there very negligently, some exceedingly astutely, but all with a view to private interest, so that we should expect nothing other than what we have seen so far from this Diet. No one seeks the business of Christ, but all seek their own.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about the French, what they are attempting among your people in recruiting soldiers, please make sure to inform us at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>It is very pleasing that Metz has received the word of God; may the Lord happily extend the boundaries of His kingdom more and more each day to the glory of His great name, so that the prince of this world with all his retinue may be broken.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and eternally in Him, esteemed and more than dearly beloved Bullinger, with your wife and all your household, whom I bid farewell with many words from my little wife and myself. All of ours commend themselves to you. Greet Pellicanus, Theodorus, Megander, Fabritius, and all the friends there most dutifully. We pray with full heart for our Leon, that he may wash well and return to you healthy, and then live long among you. Farewell again and again; forgive. March 17, 1542.</p>
      <p>Forgive the more than hurried writing; the messenger came and went at the same time; he arrived during lunch, and before lunch was taken, he is here again. Take everything in good part, which, I am sure, you will do as such a great friend.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
