    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger was asked by his wife [Anna née Adlischwyler] to also read the letter addressed to her by [Elisabeth Höcklin, née Scher] [not received]. Bullinger was pleased to learn from it how diligently [Elisabeth] seeks the Word of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He is happy to prepare the booklets she ordered and to send them to her as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Some of the requested writings are no longer available, such as the writing [„Ein anwysung“] against the incorporation of Christ in the [Communion] bread. Moreover, it is not Huldrych [Zwingli], but Kaspar Schwenckfeld who is the author of this writing. Zwingli only wrote the preface to it. [By the way], one must be aware that [the Bible] sometimes understands the Son of God, sometimes God's revelation to people through the prophets and apostles under the "Word of God," but never a revelation of God occurring within a person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Furthermore, Bullinger does not know that Zwingli ever wrote a writing "Von der Gnaden Gottes, irem ordentlichen Gang und schnellen Lauff." The title does ring a bell, but he currently does not remember which writing it refers to. It is certain that Zwingli did not believe that God automatically grants the Holy Spirit to those who hear God's Word. It is well known that many hear the Word of God and yet do not receive the Holy Spirit. Zwingli also correctly recognized and taught that God informs and instructs the world through the proclamation of the Gospel, that the [experience of] salvation is only possible through preaching, and that the proclamation of the Gospel is effective in people only through the Holy Spirit and not through the preacher's voice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger will ensure that the requested books are soon prepared and delivered [to Basel] to Konrad [Wolfhart's] house, where the students Josias [Simler] and [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger] reside. At the same time, Bullinger will inform [Elisabeth] about it in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [Elisabeth] should not take offense at this hastily written letter. [Anna] sends her regards. She and Bullinger are happy to continue to be of assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Enclosed is a booklet [with writings] by Zwingli about the sacraments, which could not be bound together with the other ordered books due to [their size or format]. The invoice will follow later.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus, with the offering of my most willing services. Dear lady, I have read your letter addressed to my dear wife, and from her request and desire, I have also read it, and I am pleased to inform you that I am very pleased that you are so eager to inquire about the word and deeds of God. May God grant you grace to live according to His will.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am ready to prepare the booklets for you, which will be found otherwise. At this time, it has not yet been possible.</p>

      <p>Some of those you named are no longer available: the rejection of the incorporation of Christ in the bread, etc., is no longer available. Moreover, it was not written by Huldrych Zwingli, but by Kaspar Schwenckfeld. Zwingli only wrote a preface to it. The distinction of the word of God has a clear understanding. For once the scripture calls the Son of God the "Word" (as in John 1), and thus the "Son of God" and the "word of God" are one thing. Furthermore, the scripture calls the word of God, which goes out of the mouth of God (Isaiah 55): This is the revelation that God makes through the mouth of the prophets and apostles; this is called and is the word of God, because it is inspired by God and not grown in humans, as clearly expressed (2 Peter 1 and 1 Thessalonians 2).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, I do not know that Zwingli ever wrote a book about the grace of God and its orderly course and swift progress. However, I do remember that I have seen and read writings by other people on this subject, which I cannot recall at the moment. Zwingli spoke and taught that those who teach that the Holy Spirit is given through, in, and with the external word are lying about what they teach. And he understood it thus: The Holy Spirit is not bound to the word in such a way that all who hear the word of God also immediately receive the Holy Spirit as they hear the word. For many hear the word who do not receive the Holy Spirit because of it. Otherwise, he rightly acknowledged and taught that God instructs the world through the gospel and that the preaching of the gospel is necessary for salvation, as clearly found in Acts 10. But that the gospel is fruitful in the hearts is the work of the Holy Spirit, not the voice of man through and of itself alone (1 Corinthians 3).</p>

      <p>I will have the booklets prepared for you and soon send them to the house of Konrad, where my boys Josias and Zwingli are, and then write to you further.</p>

      <p>Please, take this my brief and hurried writing in good part. My dear wife sends you her most friendly greetings. We both offer ourselves to serve you (wherever possible). God be with you! Dated Zurich, November 21, 1546. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Here I send you a booklet by Zwingli about the sacraments, which could not be bound with the others due to its large size. I will provide you with an invoice later.</p>
