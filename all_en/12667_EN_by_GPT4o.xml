    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Simler has no objection to Bullinger having his son Heinrich [the Younger] taught in Zurich instead of Kappel in the future, if it is best for Heinrich. However, Bullinger should not do this to relieve Simler and his wife [Verena, n√©e Huser]! Even though they have been strict with Heinrich, he has become very dear to them. Simler's wife thought Heinrich would stay with them in Kappel until Josias [from Basel] returns. Now they have been without a student for 14 days, which is very unusual for them! If Bullinger wishes, he can send Heinrich back to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Heinrich is God-fearing and sincere. He has not bought or exchanged small things behind his [house]mother's back, which was forbidden to him. When he asked for money, he had to state the reason. The small faults he has are typical of youth: carelessness and simple manners at the table and otherwise. This is because he often dreams. He will improve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding the costs for Heinrich's stay in Kappel, for the time beyond Josias' stay with Bullinger, Simler will personally agree with Bullinger in Zurich. There is no rush.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Now one must have compassion for the afflicted [German Protestants] and avert, through prayer and pure living, that God punishes [the Swiss Confederates] through [Emperor Charles V]. Bullinger and his household are commended to the Lord.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. Worthy, beloved lord and godfather, regarding your intention to keep Heinrich with you in Zurich, as you consider the school there to be more suitable for him, I cannot object, as I have always been inclined to promote the benefit of you and all your children. However, if you believe that the school in Kappel is beneficial, you need not take him back just to relieve me and my wife of a burden. He has been dear and valuable to us both, even though we have often treated him strictly - but for his own good. My wife says she thought you would leave him with us until our Josias returned home. Therefore, dear godfather, if you still believe that the school in Kappel is suitable for him, send him back to us, as he is dear to our hearts and welcome in God's name. And what I write is not just words; it comes from the heart! We will do our best for him for a reasonable compensation. It has been very unusual for me these past 14 days not to have a boy, and I would always prefer to have those I am accustomed to, rather than strangers. Do what you believe is in the boy's best interest. And if you find in the boy that you wish he were improved, attribute the deficiency to my age and his youth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I send you a pious, God-fearing, truthful boy, who has not bought or exchanged anything behind my wife's back, as his mother, for even a penny, because she did not allow it, nor has he had hardly a penny in his possession. And when he asked for money, he had to indicate what he intended to use it for. Other faults are childish, namely slow, careless, and simple manners, sometimes at the table and otherwise. These will improve with time. I have observed in him that much of this comes from his dreaming, as he stares and forgets himself. But I hope (the situation was not bad for him), he will adjust himself in such a way (if God grants him life) that we will rejoice in his worth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the expenses for his stay and the table, since he has been with me longer than Josias has been with you, I will amicably and virtuously settle with you when I come to you personally. There is no urgent damage. These matters are always well advised.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It should now be of utmost concern to us all that we let the great misery of the afflicted people touch our hearts and avert the deserved punishment of God with a better life and devout prayer, asking God that He may punish us fatherly and not let us fall into the hands of the cruel tyrant. May God keep you, along with your honorable wife and all your household, constantly in His will. Given at Kappel, on the 12th day of October 1546. Your willing Peter Simler, preacher at Kappel.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-learned lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather.</p>
