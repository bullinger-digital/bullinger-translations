      <p>Greetings. Our Pellicanus will explain everything he heard in person from the people of Strasbourg, as well as about our church and all of us. As for how I feel after seeing the Saxon convention article, I will say briefly. The more they try to explain the matter of the Eucharist, the more I am confused. The more they strive to make clear whatever pertains to this, the more obscure it becomes to me. What, I ask, is Irenaeus doing at the beginning of the confession, an obscure author who has not been judged solid by the ancients everywhere? Then what about the often-discussed statement by everyone:</p>
      <p>"Christ is given and received with the bread and wine"? I honestly confess, I do not know what they mean. This is not transubstantiation, not local inclusion; how then is the body of Christ given with the bread? I do not understand the explanation about the sacramental union from the reason already stated. The distinction between the unfaithful and the unworthy moves me less; however, it does move me, as it is unheard of to me. Nor do I know so far the difference between "eating" the body of the Lord and "receiving" it. In the declaration, what it means for everyone to profess to feel according to the confession and apology of the princes, I am completely ignorant. Therefore, I ask you, do not disdain to open your mind to me here, if perhaps from there I may learn to feel better or find you as companions in confusion.</p>
      <p>Besides these, Capito wrote in these words: "Your confession commonly established in Basel matches the Wittenberg Articles," which I equally do not see. Open your eyes to me, so that I do not remain blind forever. He promises another explanation, which unless it is different, as he calls it, will be in vain. The rest Pellicanus will tell.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first of July in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Greet Utinger very respectfully.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and Lord Theodor Bibliander, most esteemed in the Lord.</p>
