    <p xml:id="regest1">As [Bullinger] can see, Frölich's letter [No. 2264] was written a long time ago. Finally, Frölich was able to read Bullinger's speech ["Quod nullo consilio dissidium religionis componi possit" from September 12, 1545], which he had composed against the negotiators in religious matters. Frölich completely agrees with it. Bullinger has shown him great trust by entrusting him with the only copy. Now that Frölich has a transcript of it, he is sending the original back and asks for permission to translate and publish the speech in German, omitting Bullinger's name. - In the enclosed letter, delivered by a special messenger [...], the [Augsburg] council requests the [Zurich] council for an upright and pious theologian. The [people of Augsburg] would have also written to Bullinger and all [Zurich] church servants if they were not convinced that Frölich had already advocated for them. The church of Kaufbeuren needs consolidation; however, the [people of Augsburg] are more interested in sending a man from Augsburg to Kaufbeuren than the one who will come from Zurich. - Bullinger should reply with this messenger. - [P.S.:] Regarding the war with the Brunswick "Catiline" [Duke Heinrich], it is only known that he has more than 14,000 men, that he has devastated the territory of Duke [Ernst the Confessor] of Lüneburg and areas of other princes as well as Brunswick and Verden, and has almost recaptured his duchy, except for the fortresses of Wolfenbüttel and Schöningen. Duke [Moritz] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] are about to attack him these days. - [Enclosure:] Bernardino [Ochino] from Siena, who fought against the papacy in Geneva for some time, came to Augsburg intending to settle there. The [people of Augsburg] will not send him away, even though he is not proficient in the German language and therefore cannot take on a public church office.</p>

      <p>Greetings. As you can see, my letter was written a long time ago. Today, however, I was finally able to read your speech against the negotiators of religion, which otherwise gave me, standing firmly by your opinion, such strength and support that I rightly avoid those conciliators. I will never cease to thank you for such diligent and prudent work, especially since you entrusted me not only with your unique copy written in your own hand but also with the trust not to publish that very speech. Therefore, I will always keep faith with you in this and in all other matters, as you are as esteemed by me and all good people as no other mortal. I am sending back your copy, which I have transcribed for myself, asking that, with your permission, it may be translated into German by me and published with or without your name. However, I will do nothing without your will, but I wish to understand your mind.</p>
      <p>Our council writes with this special messenger to your magistrate, earnestly requesting that a skilled and pious theologian be sent to us from your church. They would have also written to you and your entire ecclesiastical assembly if they had not been convinced that I had diligently advocated for this cause with you. Therefore, I implore you and the entire Zurich college through Christ not to let our prayers be in vain. The church of Kaufbeuren is well established and does not need much more edification, but only preservation; it would be of great importance to us to appoint a good man to it, although we wish to act according to the person. Indeed, if someone from your college were to come to us, we would prefer to retain him in Augsburg and send someone from our own to Kaufbeuren, rather than delegate a suitable and good man from the Zurich office elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell and reply with this messenger. However, kindly excuse our barbarism. October 20, 1545. In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the war with the Brunswick "Catiline" [Duke Heinrich], we have no certain news, except that he has gathered more than 14,000 armed men, and is widely devastating the land of Duke [Ernst the Confessor] of Lüneburg, the city of Brunswick, Verden, and the territories of other princes. He has almost recovered his duchy, except for the most fortified castles of Wolfenbüttel and Schöningen. Duke [Moritz] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] are about to attack him these days. May the Lord grant victory to those who honor His name.</p>
      <p>Regarding Bernardino [Ochino] from Siena, who preached Christ in Geneva for several years and vigorously opposed the papacy, a man venerable in both doctrine and life, he has now come to Augsburg with the intention of establishing a firm seat here. We will not dismiss this man, although due to his lack of proficiency in the German language, he will not be able to bear public church duties. Farewell.</p>
