      <p>Greetings. On the day before the Ides of October, I returned here safely, finding all my family well. I give you the greatest thanks for your kindness and benevolence shown to me. I will always remember and repay it, if ever I can. I found your letters here, in which you again commend Mr. Gervasius. But since Mr. Metzler has not yet departed from here, although he has little hope of life remaining, I can do nothing now; however, I will remember him and strive to see if in any way provision can finally be made for him. I commend these young men of ours to you again; they are pious, studious, and not unlearned, in whom there would be no small hope if it were allowed that experience of matters not common could be added to their education. Please work on their behalf with Mr. Provost, so that he may also receive them. I trust his wife will be more favorable after I gave her a thaler at your suggestion, and the lords will not hesitate to add more if they understand her goodwill and that this small gift could have some influence with her. I have already sent your letters to Mr. Calvin. I have nothing else at present, nor could I, even if I had, as I am occupied today and tomorrow with continuous sermons. Therefore, farewell and greet your wife and sweetest children for me. My wife also greets you, as does Mr. Musculus with his entire family.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 20, 1549. Our Eberhard also greets you. Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Bullinger, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
