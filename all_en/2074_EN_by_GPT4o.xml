      <p>S. These times are certainly full of sorrowful calamities, and the rod of God's wrath is extended over the Christian world. Although, as you write, there is a real danger from the Turk, yet in the midst of peace, monarchs and lesser princes indulge their passions, setting no end or limit to their mutual destruction and thus betraying their homeland and preparing it as a sacrifice for the Turk. For if, as is to be feared, Transylvania, a region fortified by nature and art, falls into his hands, who will prevent him from attacking or plundering the flat regions, Austria, Bavaria, at will, as if from a fortress? Would that we might finally learn wisdom from so many disasters and turn to the one who strikes us. Regarding the transaction between Johann Friedrich and August, I fear that what rumor has brought is in vain, because the mediators, who labored in this matter at Nuremberg, are greatly sought after for the hardness, not to say anything else, of August, who has declared himself almost more difficult than his brother Maurice, so that no concord seems to have been reached between them, or if it has, it is such that the most pious prince is oppressed by the most unjust conditions. But thus the Lord often exercises and tests his own, not to the end, yet will give a glorious outcome with the trial. Albert easily agrees with August, and this under the auspices of the Danish and Joachim of Brandenburg, who are believed to have secretly and very wisely supplied both soldiers and the sinews of war with Bruten and Johann of Brandenburg. Now Heinrich of Brunswick is pressing him from behind, whom the bishop and the Nurembergers have called away from the siege of the city of Brunswick by paying 80,000 thalers, which the Brunswickers refused to give when demanded by him, although some other cities tried to persuade them to do so to buy peace. The bishop and Nuremberg have taken up two tons of gold at the Leipzig fair from the merchants and for several thousand guilders of cloth and barchent.</p>
      <p>A messenger, who came directly from there, reports that there is no doubt that a battle has either already been fought between Albert and Heinrich or is certainly about to be fought soon. It is also said that the people of Ulm fear Albert somewhat and are therefore preparing for war. This is what I have at present, which I did not want to hide from you. Farewell with your colleagues, wife, and children. Basel, November 17, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Concerning the persecution of the saints by the Cantons in the Insubres, the common dominion of the Swiss, I wish I had known before the departure of our envoys to the diet; for our people could have been reminded of their duty. I hear, and not without sorrow, that the governor of Lucerne, and Schaffhausen himself, are more eager than is proper to lend their efforts against religion, wherefore I would like you to also admonish the brothers of Schaffhausen on this matter.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
