      <p>Grace and peace in the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ and a most blessed life in Him, etc.! I received your letters, most esteemed man, full of love and humanity, as well as true sanctity and piety, in which you describe me as fortunate for two reasons: first, because I have such a disciple whom God has chosen to adorn with so many excellent gifts, and second, because she comes from a family that favors good literature and sincerely cultivates religion from the heart. In this regard, I agree with you, most illustrious man, that in this way I have attained a human happiness; but I consider myself much more blessed because some relationship has intervened between you and me, which God, who searches all hearts, knows how much I value. Indeed, I have always had the disposition to not only cherish all kinds of disciplines but also to uniquely love their professors and practitioners. For I know how beastly our life would be if the best disciplines and liberal arts did not cultivate the minds of men. And while I delight in the sweetness of all these, I am captivated by the love of theology and accustomed to be amazed by its admiration; and I bestow as much honor on its professors as I do on no other mortals. For from them, as from the clearest fountains, all piety, knowledge of religion, and innocence of life flow. All good men rely on their teachings, and they applaud their words as if they were the most sacred oracles of God.</p>
      <p>Hence, next to God, faith is prepared, charity is learned, hope is increased, and finally, all things pertaining to Christianity are born. Since the Lord has so abundantly gathered His riches in you, that you are not only to instruct your own mind but also to be a teacher and leader in the church for others who would otherwise err; we must love, embrace, and respect you for the sake of God, who has been so favorable to you, and for your own sake as well: for Paul thus exhorts with these words, "So let a man consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God," etc.; and elsewhere, "He who rules well in the church is worthy of double honor." From this, we are taught to bestow no less honor and reverence on the ministers of Christ than on those who, having been taught by God Himself, handle, deliver, and explain the most sacred mysteries of faith and salvation.</p>
      <p>It remains, for your humanity, which is well known to us, to inform my disciple in your next letters about what adornment and bodily attire befit virgins who worship Christ: in which matter you can use the example of Lady Elizabeth, the sister of our king: for she walks dressed in every part as befits a virgin; and yet no example of such a distinguished virgin is brought forward, in such great light of the gospel, to lay aside gold, gems, and hair braids, much less to despise them. Preachers are heard to object to these things, but no one corrects their life.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I would like you to write to her about how much time should be devoted to musical instruments: for here too, among us, it is excessively offensive, as all effort and study are undertaken for ostentation. If you discuss these matters more extensively, perhaps some addition to virtue will be made by your authority.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and may God, the best and greatest, grant you many years. From London, from the house of the Duke of Suffolk, who was formerly a marquis. December 23.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, John Aylmer. Let these letters be delivered to the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>"J. Aylmer."</p>
