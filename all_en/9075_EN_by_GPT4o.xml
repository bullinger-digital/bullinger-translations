      <p>S. I am finally sending, most illustrious man, honorable lord and godfather, this dreadful tragedy that has recently taken place in France; others report much more turbulent events than are recorded here. But even if this account contains the entire series of events, it is certainly too horrifying and scarcely could anything more monstrous be imagined.</p>
      <p>I would believe, however, that such dreadful things could not be spoken of, and that these raging Cerberuses have carried them out. If there were someone who described in detail the deaths of all the martyrs who bravely perished for Christ, then it would finally become clear how great a crime has been committed in this kingdom. I have asked this person, who is bringing you these letters, to deign to approach you, partly so that they may be more properly cared for, and partly so that you might be able to ascertain from him the state of our affairs and what is being discussed here and there about the future evil, which we believe is at our doorstep. May God have mercy on us and kindly avert all evil practices. It is reported here for certain about the Swiss, that just as they previously prohibited all dances and games due to the high cost of grain and because of the Venetians, who are being exercised by the Turks, now, due to the glorious victory of the Catholics in France, in which they have now strongly oppressed the Huguenots, they have again been freely granted to all. May the best and greatest God turn their perverse joy into wailing and bitter tears!</p>
      <p>Mr. Amannus Schuler thanks you greatly for the booklet you sent him as a gift; I gave another to our treasurer Thomas Schmid, who also expresses his greatest thanks. Both also send you their most dutiful greetings; even my wife sends you her most abundant greetings. You will greet on our behalf our fellow ministers and all our brothers with your entire family.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on October 22, 1572. Your most loving Johannes Hug in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
