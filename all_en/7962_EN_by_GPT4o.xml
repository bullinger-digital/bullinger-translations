      <p>S. D. I earnestly beg you, Kessler, esteemed sir and dearest brother, to kindly have this letter of mine delivered to Augsburg by one of your known or friendly merchants; for I believe this can be done conveniently.</p>
      <p>Whatever you spend on this matter, I will faithfully reimburse. I am now, by God's grace, somewhat well, from whom I daily expect better things; for in the months of May and June, I was gravely ill; yet now, with God's help, I am again performing my duties.</p>
      <p>The Pope's army in France has been routed by our forces and almost completely destroyed. It is said that the king has also suffered another defeat, and although a good part of France is devastated, suffering from a shortage of grain and a most severe plague, he nevertheless thinks of a new war and gathering the greatest forces. He requests 6000 soldiers from the Swiss and 4000 from the Rhaetians. Therefore, we should no longer be surprised at Pharaoh's insurmountable hardness; Pharaoh-like minds do not know how to rest except at the bottom of the Red Sea. With David, therefore, I cry out to the Lord: "Scatter, O Lord, the nations that delight in war." On the 8th of this month, the people of Claron resolved in public assembly not to send any delegate to Solothurn nor to give any soldier to the king. They must be insane who now go to that place to serve as soldiers, where the plague rages, there is a shortage of grain, and the highest cost of all things, hunger, and destruction, especially now with the harsh winter approaching. These, these are the fitting rewards for those who strike alliances with impious kings and wish to enrich themselves with the friendship and pensions of kings, and would that they perish not only in body but also in soul.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, my lord and brother, that the Lord may deign to extinguish this fire with the dew of His grace; otherwise, I fear we too may be involved in this conflagration. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your son, my esteemed lord, and the ministers, my beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>August 13, 1569, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Kessler, head of the school in St. Gallen, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Schoolmaster Kessler in St. Gallen.</p>
