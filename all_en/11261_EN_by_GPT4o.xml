    <p xml:id="regest1">The two councils have dealt with Luther's [Schmalkaldic Articles]; they distance themselves from his doctrine of the Lord's Supper, express distrust towards the unnamed [Concord] mediators [Bucer and Capito], and adhere to the [Bern] Disputation as well as the response [of the reformed cities] to Luther. Rümlang suggests the publication of a defense writing; the people of Bern are ready to discuss this with the people of Zurich. Sends, on behalf of Sebastian [Meyer], an addition [to his commentary] on the Apocalypse. Greetings. Kunz, Meyer, and Sulzer are angry that he does not share their stance; if necessary, he is ready for a public debate.</p>

      <p>Although I may perhaps be too bold in writing to you so often, who are so busy and burdened with the most serious and difficult matters, and although it would be almost impious to demand letters from you, I did not want to keep from you that a booklet published by Luther has disturbed many here who think soberly, to the extent that the matter was brought before the council and the deacons, and unexpectedly, through the work of the faithful and wise, a healthy and commendable opinion was extracted, namely, that we certainly find that we cannot agree with this article on the sacrament of the altar according to Luther's words, and that those who have intervened as mediators are somewhat suspect, although their names were deliberately suppressed. But whatever has been done about these matters so far, however we have inclined towards concord, and however the matter of concord may proceed in the future, we nevertheless wish to remain with the sense and words of our disputation and the response sent to Luther, and to neither hear nor admit anything else from anyone, and to expect God's grace in this, confident that God will not forsake us, whatever the princes may attempt in the meantime, etc.</p>
      <p>I would gladly write more, but I do not have the leisure now. In my judgment, it would be beneficial to prepare an apology, so that our innocence would be evident to the whole world, and the matter could be settled through the magistrates' envoys and with you. You will find us ready and not lacking in any way, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending some things from Sebastian, which he recommended to be sent and to be printed with the Apocalypse, if it is not yet finished; read and act according to your candor or return them if the Apocalypse is finished, etc.</p>
      <p>Commend me, I pray; greet Pellican, Megander, Theodor, Rhellican, Ammian, Clivan, Binder, in short, everyone, and Steiner, etc.</p>
      <p>Written hastily, in Bern, in the council, January 25, 1539. Kunz, Meyer, and Sulzer would gladly thunder, if only they dared, and they are quite hostile to me because I seem less inclined to defend their position; but a bad cause is not worthy of defense, etc. Let this be said in your bosom; unless they desist, I will not shrink from open hostilities, as I am a hard and rustic man.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and vigilant man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed lord. To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
