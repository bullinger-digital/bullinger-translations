      <p>Postscript. The assembly has been postponed for three months. We all think that the Emperor's business, as it pertains to England, will not succeed according to his wishes, just as it has not in Italy.</p>
      <p>When I arrived here, the prince gave what I wrote, and now he has instructed Mr. von Gültlingen, who came here today, to deal with me and to see what I need for the whole year; when he asked me this, I left the whole matter to his discretion.</p>
      <p>I think tomorrow it will be discussed whether I should take on the task of teaching here; I will do what the Lord shows me to be for His glory.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jakob Beurlin will go to Prussia shortly; this was recently decided. Farewell again, farewell. Greetings, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honored lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>December 19, 1553.</p>
