      <p>Greetings. There was nothing particular at this moment, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, about which I could write, except that the writings needed to be returned, which you kindly shared a few days ago. For which I also give the greatest thanks I can; for not without benefit did I read the letter and the learned and elegant response of Mr. Portius, as much as I had from your notes, and the response and elegant letter of Mr. Portius. The same response was read by Dr. Burgauer and other friends, to whom I could not deny the reading, since that writing had been made public in print and it is useful for many to know by what lies the most holy martyrs are defiled...</p>
