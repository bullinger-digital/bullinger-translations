    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to No. 74 in a friendly tone, but maintains his opinion that the magistrate and the church are fundamentally different in nature and that excommunication is solely the responsibility of the church. One should not rely on the authority of Zwingli or other people, but solely on the Word of God. Jud does not demand a perfect church cleansed of sinners, but considers Bullinger's resigned words, that the world cannot be changed, to be dangerous, as striving for perfection is a Christian duty.</p>

      <p>I am grieved, my dear Heinrich, that my writings have fallen in such a way that they might appear to anyone as a form of verbal dispute, from which I strongly recoil, as I know that a discussion should be among the servants of God, not an altercation. I have simply and, as I believe, truly proposed certain things supported by the scriptures, namely that the excommunication of the Church of Christ should not be entrusted to the magistrate (especially as they are now, among whom the sum of affairs lies), because if they could, by any honest or at least excusable reason, they would remove the doctrine of Christ from the midst, and because the magistrate and the church are different entities. In both propositions, I have sufficiently explained what I mean.</p>
      <p>I know that the magistrate is a minister of God, and I am not speaking only of the tyrannical one, whom you call deficient and mutilated. I speak of the magistrate, who may be good or bad: he is a minister of God. But a prince can also be good, who is not a tyrant and who rightly performs his duty, yet is not inscribed among the external church of Christ. Such was Cornelius in Acts 10 [1ff], Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Gamaliel. And the thief on the cross who confessed Christ was faithful, but not in the church. I call things different and distinct, where one can exist and subsist without the other. Youth and old age are different things, although a young person can become old and an old person can become youthful again. Wine and water are very different things, although Christ in Cana turned water into wine and God can turn wine into water or vice versa. Now if anyone contends that they do not understand this, they are indeed tying the knot of contention themselves, not I, who speak the truth.</p>
      <p>One and the same God works all things, but through different means. He administers the earthly and bodily kingdom through magistrates and princes, the church and the kingdom of heaven through apostles, to whom he forbids the earthly kingdom: "But you are not to be like that" [Lk 22,26]. He entrusted nothing of ecclesiastical matters to princes, but the sword. Therefore, whatever is purely bodily pertains to the magistrate, whatever pertains to souls, to the leaders of the church. Here I do not wish to say, my dear Heinrich, that there is a certain power in the church over souls, which only God has, but the office of the apostles primarily concerns souls, not bodily matters. For although there are many bodily things in the church (for a Christian does not entirely lay down the body), yet they are bodily in such a way that they somehow regard the soul. The supper is a bodily matter and baptism. For there is water, wine, bread, but these direct and lead the spirit by hand, objects to the senses. The word preached by the apostles is a bodily matter. For speech is formed by the mouth, yet in such a way that it proceeds from God and leads to God. So it is with excommunication. Therefore, whatever pertains to religion, let it remain untouched by the church and its ministers. For if divine matters among idolatrous nations were entrusted not to magistrates, but to priests, magi, augurs, druids, from whom even the magistrate borrowed counsel, how much more is this fitting in the new law among Christians, that matters of religion are not entrusted to the magistrate, who handles profane matters? To that extent, therefore, the magistrate and the church are different entities, that Christ, whose kingdom was not of this world, did not want to divide the inheritance among brothers nor did he want the apostles to touch any worldly administration.</p>
      <p>Excommunication, therefore, however much it may be bodily, belongs to the church, as I believe, not to the magistrate. For to cast out of the church and to admit again does not properly pertain to the magistrate, but to the church. This is clear enough from 1 Corinthians 5 [1ff], where Paul commands the church, not the magistrate, to excommunicate the fornicator. And Christ says: "Tell it to the church" [Mt 18,17]. Now if anyone contends that the magistrate is the church, they will do so by the authority of scripture, not their own. For the matter still hangs under judgment. Nor will it be enough to confirm this statement that the most learned man Zwingli, my venerable teacher, gave this power to the magistrate and commanded that they be the church, even if I or anyone else agreed. For this should not have been done without the consent of the whole church.</p>
      <p>I do not write this, my dear Heinrich, to disparage the deeds or words of the most learned man, but because I believe that no man's authority should be so great as to prejudice the holy scripture, nor should we be so sworn to the words of any man that, with scripture opposing, we may not freely dissent from him. Furthermore, what the senate was like when it was entrusted to them, what it is like now, is not worth recounting, as it is known even to the blind. But I do not think that the church of Christ is such a thing as Plato's republic, which can be more truly imagined than seen. For the apostles had a true church, as I believe, not an imaginary one. Nor do I desire such a one, in which there are no sinners, but I believe that no one belongs to the church of Christ except the penitent - when I say penitent, do I not acknowledge sinners? - no one should be received who is a public enemy of Christ, but who professes Christ as the only savior, who believes in Christ. No one seeks absolute perfection, no one seeks to be blessed in every way. But this must be strived for with all prayers, that we strive for perfection. Therefore, I judge this saying to be pernicious: "We could not do otherwise than as it was from the beginning." I wish that we would refrain from such sayings. For this breeds security, not the pursuit of piety. If we cannot change the world, why then do we preach? For what purpose do we propose the gospel, which calls to a new life? God has transferred us from the kingdom of darkness, from the power of Satan into the kingdom of light and his beloved son. Christ has chosen us out of the world, and his doctrine is nothing other than the renewal of the world. Paul says: "Do not conform to this age, but walk in the newness of life" [Rom 12,2. 6,4], and: "A Christian is a new creature" [2 Cor 5,17]. What then does this word mean: "We could not do otherwise"? Indeed, we labor in this, we suffer all things for this, that we may renew the world, that we may call from the world to Christ.</p>
      <p>I know, my dear Heinrich, that you can seek refuge here and escape. But I beg you by Christ, that you use the art of dialectics and rhetoric not for deception, but for the glory of God, for the edification of the church, for the key of the scriptures. Let us leave contention, embrace the open truth, and strive that the church may be worthy of Christ and strive for perfection. For it is not fitting to provide encouragement for laziness and security. This should be more cared for, that it may become holier and purer day by day, that it may grow to the fullness of Christ its head.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me commended to you.</p>
