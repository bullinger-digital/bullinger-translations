      <p>That I have not yet sent you any letters, most learned and dearest man to me! Do not think it was due to negligence, which I wish to be as far removed from me as possible, or forgetfulness of your merits towards me, the memory of which no age will ever erase: but partly because I could not inform you about the state of England or my own affairs in such a short time, during which I have been here; and partly because I was waiting to see what would come of your recommendation. Therefore, if this delay of mine has stirred your bile (though I do not think it has), I beg you, for your love towards me and my respect for you, to forgive me this once. Now, however, since things are such that I can write to you something certain and trustworthy, I do not wish to delay writing any longer.</p>
      <p>Know, therefore, that England, which I entered with good omens, though not without a great loss of my money, is adorned and illuminated by the word of God, and the number of the faithful is increasing and growing daily with an infinite gathering; the papists' sweet-smelling mass is tottering, and in many places the mass has already been made a thing of the past, that is, rightly, by divine law, condemned and utterly, with a clear conscience, extinguished: images have also been completely uprooted throughout the land of England, and not the smallest spark is left that could provide hope or occasion for the papists to confirm their error about idols and to lead the people away from our Savior: furthermore, sacred marriage is free for priests and approved by the king himself. Purgatory is shown to be nothing other than the cross to which we miserable ones are subjected in this life, as demonstrated by Peter Martyr with great applause in the writings of the orthodox and the sacred scriptures. The cause of the Eucharist and the sacred Lord's Supper has similarly prevailed, being a commemoration of Christ and a solemn proclamation of his death, not a sacrifice; meanwhile, however, speaking cautiously and prudently (if indeed that is prudence) about the presence of the body, so that he seems to go neither into your opinion nor into Luther's.</p>
      <p>Most public preachers openly and candidly remove all carnal eating from the people as much as they can and propose that Christ is to be eaten by faith and spirit alone, and they have led a good part of the people to this opinion. The Capernaumites, papists, and such [Greek] kind, whose swords seek the truth, do not sleep; but by the grace of God, they are never slaughtered, indeed they miserably perish and are pierced by their own swords and sophistries. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>As for what has been achieved by your recommendation, I have absolutely nothing to write to you, except that Elyott has long since passed away and departed to the heavens; and Trehern has either not yet returned or your letters have had little weight with him. Therefore, if you think your recommendation should be renewed, which I greatly desire, I would like you to write diligently about me, that is, to commend me to him as of better note; or if this does not seem good to you, I would like, which would be the best of all and also your own opinion, as I hope, to give some letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who holds you in high regard, in which you would commend me to him with some testimony of your voice: for you know with what poverty I am pressed and how I am in solitude here, where when I set foot outside the house, I meet no one whom I know by face or name; and how much you can help me in this matter with your zeal and effort. Therefore, I beg and beseech you with utmost prayers, for your love in Christ and your zeal for his church, to show yourself easy and placable to me in this matter. When I have obtained this from you, I will indeed strive in all ways to make you recognize that a benefit has been placed by you in a grateful and mindful person.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of this academy and my studies, there is nothing to write except that it is filled with the best and most beautiful authors from all sides, and adorned with a great abundance of the most learned men in every kind of discipline; and that I truly enjoy here the highest opportunity for the sweetest and most honorable leisure, in both sacred and profane studies, according to the desire of my mind: with the hope and thought that Germany was not left by me rashly, and that my family will someday understand and recognize this. Therefore, farewell, and if it is convenient, greet D. Pellicanus, Theodor, Gwalther, and Ammianus, men endowed with the highest piety and learning, very much in Christ along with others who have deserved well of me; and teach them to pray to God that he may consecrate my studies to his sole praise and the salvation of my soul.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, my lord! Continue to love me as you have begun. Given at Oxford from England, in the year of our Lord 1548, on the very day of the Ascension of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you, Johannes von Ulm, disciple.</p>
