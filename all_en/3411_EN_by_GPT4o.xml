      <p>A letter has come into my hands, which was sent by the chief and common leaders of the government of the Three Leagues (thus is the signature) to the common council messengers of the Three Leagues in Chur, assembled at the meeting, etc. It was given at Zesunn (some call it Osyn) in Picardy on the Friday after Martinmas in the year 1557. From this letter, I have extracted the following: "We inform you that up to this date we have been mustered and paid twice, namely once at Kleinem Schalun and also once at Schalestierj. There we found 12 banners of Confederates, who were glad to see us and received us well. Afterwards, they and we together moved here to Zesun in Picardy, where we have now been lying still for three weeks and are still waiting to be used. We have not yet seen any enemy, nor have we caused any unrest, and in summary, there is no lack of any supplies, a full camp. The Lord of Mandossa is our and the Confederates' field commander, offering and doing much good. We have been well received by him and other French lords.</p>
      <p>The enemy is still in three places 5 or 6 leagues (estimated at 3 German miles) from us. It is said that he is preparing to withdraw, etc.</p>
      <p>We expect to receive two payments in a few days, etc." This is the summary of the letter.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the 13 banners, which have been stationed in Penmunt for some time, have been granted leave. The legate has informed our two consuls that some displeasure has arisen between the German soldiers and the Spaniards, who are stationed at St. Quentin; the matter has escalated into a conflict, and the German soldiers have suffered some damage, which has made them very displeased, especially since they have not received any payment for a long time. The commanders have been prompted to write to the French, that if he wants to have their outstanding pay settled, they would be willing to continue in his service. The legate says he has this information by post, but whether it is to be believed, I doubt; for I know the nature of the French, who are accustomed to exaggerate even the smallest things and to sell them as the greatest, if they perceive that it serves the honor of their king.</p>
