      <p>Greetings. I did not dare to speak to you about the injuries we suffer daily when I wrote recently, lest I burden your ears with empty complaints. However, our Prevotius rightly explained them to you freely.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, because you, in your fairness and virtue, have deemed it worthy to take up this cause, we offer you not ordinary thanks for that reason. Our people would also like to testify to their gratitude in action; but since it is not possible, they gladly acknowledge how much they owe you. It would be incredible for you to know how we have been harassed with unworthy insults for almost the entire year, for they have attacked us with sheer arrogance, not under any pretext of law. Finally, softened by the most flattering admonitions and even by our compliance, they gave some sign of gentleness; for they wrote that they would send envoys to satisfy our wishes. They came: great liberality of promises; when it was time to meet, they excused themselves, saying they had no mandate. Two days before our Prevotius arrived, the envoys were expected.</p>
      <p>It appears, therefore, that the time was chosen to deceive us; for they indicated that they were now ready to descend to an amicable settlement of all disputes through the envoys. Meanwhile, the conditions were perplexing, doubtful, and full of ambiguities.</p>
      <p>They deny that anything will be valid for them unless the decision of the Basel arbitrator is abolished, which cannot be granted in any way. But because they urged our people to send a delegation to commend the freedom and peaceful state of this city to the Swiss at the assembly, and not to sanction any treaty with the Savoyard without an exception being made to ensure our safety and security, this was gladly granted, indeed it had been decreed before. However, cleverly, since they had us under suspicion, they wanted to uncover our intentions, or if there was any hesitation and delay, so that they would have a plausible excuse if they happened to negotiate with the Savoyard to our detriment. Therefore, envoys will be sent to Baden.</p>
      <p>Now, advice and favor are sought from your most illustrious council. It was not reasonable to write to the council; therefore, instructions were given to private friends through Prevotius, which may be effective with everyone, as far as the matter requires. I will not urge you and our excellent brother Galtherus with many words to continue in the course of the holy office so happily begun, since I know from the account of our brother and friend how willing you are, and he himself, with his skill, will accomplish more than I can achieve with letters. Farewell, therefore, distinguished man and esteemed brother, together with Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Galtherus, and the other colleagues.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect you all, guide you with His spirit, and enrich you with every kind of blessing. Geneva, January 25, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and highly esteemed fellow minister.</p>
