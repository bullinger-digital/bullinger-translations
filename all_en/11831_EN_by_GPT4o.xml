    <p xml:id="regest1">[First copy of the letter:] The presence of Emperor [Charles V] [in the Lower Rhine] spreads fear and strengthens the opponents, especially the people of Cologne, to whom the Emperor has written; even the bishops - except for the one from Münster [Franz von Waldeck] - no longer follow the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]. On Bartholomew's Day [August 24], Düren was conquered and devastated, after which Roermond opened its gates to the Emperor; before Venlo, Duke [Wilhelm] of Jülich, accompanied by Duke Heinrich of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel], confronted the Emperor; as a condition for peace, he had to renounce Geldern. Now an attack on the Protestants is threatened, which Heinrich of Wolfenbüttel is also urging; [Elector Johann Friedrich] of Saxony has already been threatened; in Frankfurt, the [Schmalkaldic] war councils are meeting - the delegate [from Strasbourg?] left the day before yesterday -; Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] is said to have alarmed all the carters; if the French attack does not call the Emperor to Luxembourg, he will do as he pleases [in Germany]. [Second copy of the letter:] Bucer returned on September 16. The Duke of Jülich had to swear to the Emperor never again to take up arms against him and Burgundy; both want to return to each other what belongs to the other; the Duke is to marry a daughter of [King] Ferdinand and later govern Brabant; Geldern wants to become part of the Empire; negotiations continue, and it is still unclear where the two armies will move. The [Elector] of Saxony and the Landgrave are preparing under the pretext of the Turkish threat; if the Emperor wants to reinstate the [Duke] of Brunswick, war threatens the Protestants. The Turks, who have already devastated the Piceno area, are said to have landed in large numbers in Spain; [King Francis I] is making pacts with them. [Note by Myconius:] Strasbourg wrote to Basel about a Frenchman [Jacques Reynaud], who, together with a learned compatriot [Philibert...], was handed over by a robber [Konrad Köth] to Breisach; [the Vorderösterreich regiment in] Ensisheim has asked the Emperor what should be done with him. Cannot write further; the messenger is ready to depart.</p>

      <p>I understand that everything is full of fear because of the presence of the Emperor, which deters many from doing what they desire in the matter of the Gospel, and it strengthens the adversaries in their fury, especially the people of Cologne, who triumph greatly and insult their neighbors more insolently because of the letters from the Emperor written to them somewhat more liberally, commending the old, that is, the Roman, religion.</p>
      <p>Even the other bishops, except for the one from Münster, whom we thought would follow the plans of the Archbishop of Cologne, are now murmuring and think that they should wait longer, hoping that Christ might rise again, who now seems to them to be buried once more. See the misery of men and the ruinous cessation in divine matters!</p>
      <p>As for the warlike tumults, the Emperor, having barely entered Jülich, filled everything with such terror that everyone immediately surrendered, except for the town of Düren, which, after being defended somewhat more fiercely by the citizens and garrison soldiers, was finally conquered on Bartholomew's Day after the third assault, plundered, and miserably devastated by fire recklessly set, with all who did not supplicate the angry enemy being cruelly slaughtered to the last man. And since nothing now delayed victory in Jülich, the army was led to Roermond, which is the first city of Gelderland for those coming from Jülich, indeed well fortified and large, but whether it did not have a firm governor or the calamities of the neighbors instilled fear, it, having experienced nothing hostile yet, received the Emperor by offering the keys and provided him the opportunity to advance further. For why would he hesitate to attempt the others, when this one had yielded so easily? He thus came near the center of Gelderland, Venlo, which was seen to be exceedingly strong and hitherto impregnable. There, the course of victory first began to be halted, and plans for peace were discussed. The Duke of Jülich was summoned to the Emperor, led by and with the assistance of Heinrich of Brunswick; peace was granted, contrary to everyone's expectation, on conditions, as they say, not very fair to Jülich, but nevertheless to be accepted given the state of the times and affairs; for Gelderland, the cause of the war, was taken away, but the paternal and ancestral dominions, which had been occupied, were restored, which had not yet been permitted. The other things that were added do not sufficiently satisfy those who report these things to us.</p>
      <p>Now, after the Emperor not only established matters there according to his will but also augmented his army with the forces of the enemies, a certain fear - and perhaps not unfounded - holds that he might turn all his power against us, that is, the Protestants, urged on by Heinrich of Wolfenbüttel. Certainly, there are many things that make these conjectures too probable; for some threatening edicts are directed against the Duke of Saxony, and our people seem to suspect something. For suddenly a diet has been convened in Frankfurt, where, as I hear, only those appointed to handle military affairs, the war councilors, are meeting. Our delegate left the day before yesterday in the evening, and the Landgrave is said to have ordered all the carters and coachmen to remain within the borders of his dominion, waiting to see what each of them will be instructed to do. Indeed, unless the French arms, which are said to be widely roaming through the Luxembourg countryside, recall the Emperor there, he seems unlikely to miss the opportunity to punish those he wants to fine and to gratify those to whom he owes something. But enough of this; for I cannot be more prolix, indeed I scarcely thought I could say so much.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>S. There is nothing new with us. Bucer returned on September 16. Peace was concluded between the Emperor and the Duke of Jülich, this is certain. The conditions of peace are said to be these: First, the Duke swore to the Emperor that he would never again take up arms against him and the Dukes of Burgundy; second, that each would return to the other all that they had taken either by deceit or by force; for the Emperor had many things in Brabant that belonged to the Duke, and the Duke had things of the Emperor, etc.</p>
      <p>The third condition is that the Duke should marry a daughter of Ferdinand and later govern Brabant. Here the people of Gelderland do not want to be under the Emperor, but wish to be joined to the Empire. Negotiations are now underway between the Emperor and the Duke on how they might agree on this matter. Where the armies of both will be led is unknown.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave, etc., are said to be secretly arming themselves, although it is pretended that they are to be sent against the Turk. The Emperor does not yet promise peace. We will soon hear amazing things. If he wants to restore the Brunswick (who is with the Emperor), it is certain war for the Protestants, etc.</p>
      <p>In Spain, there are said to be about 40,000 Turks, who have already devastated the Piceno area; it is certain and not doubtful that the French King is making pacts with them.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>S. Thus it was possible during leisure. Letters came to our senate a few weeks ago about a certain French nobleman captured by a certain robber under no other pretext than that he was French, while the robber was a supporter of the Emperor. He offered the captured man along with a learned Frenchman, a truly learned man, to the people of Breisach, who immediately informed the people of Ensisheim of this matter; they sent a message to the Emperor, asking what should be done.</p>
      <p>I can write no more; the messenger is ready, etc. Yours, Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
