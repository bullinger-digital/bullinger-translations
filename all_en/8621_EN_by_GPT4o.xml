      <p>Greetings to you, reverend father in Christ, I wish. After I have finished printing your book, which according to the copy given to me by the reverend father in Christ, Doctor Cox, and previously corrected with the utmost diligence by him, I trust it has been truly and faithfully completed. The same, most faithful pastor, wished that I should take care to send six or more of the same books to you (if it could be done conveniently). I found a suitable time to do this. Furthermore, because of your effort put into completing that book (a great indication of your goodwill towards England, separated from you by such a distance), the reverend fathers themselves will express their most worthy thanks in their next letters to you. Meanwhile, may the Lord of glory comfort you and your entire church with His most holy spirit, so that His truth may be promoted and the kingdom of the antichrist may be confounded and utterly overthrown. And may Christ the Lord grant that more people from all over the world may devote themselves to this care with the greatest benefit to the Christian republic, and apply all their efforts.</p>
      <p>Please consider my labor in this work, however small, with fairness and goodwill. Farewell, most vigilant pastor.</p>
      <p>In London, in the month of August. Your most observant John Day.</p>
      <p>To the reverend father in Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
