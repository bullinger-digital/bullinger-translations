    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter carrier [...] also delivers a letter from the Augsburg council to the council of Zurich with a request for auxiliary troops in the event of an attack by the Catholics, who are arming themselves all around.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- These troop gatherings of the arrogant priests portend something bad. At the very least, an unchristian imperial decree will be forced upon the [Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Today, [Johannes] Haller and [Hans Wilpert] Zoller were guests at Frölich's.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Rudolf] Gwalther and [Konrad] Gessner. Hopefully, Frölich's recently sent reply [No. 2453] to Bullinger's letter [not received] has arrived.</p>

      <p>The grace of the strong, eternal, one God be with us. Most beloved lord and brother, I hasten to inform you that my lords, the secret councilors, are writing to the honorable council of the city of Zurich with this messenger, that uprisings and war preparations are arising around us and we must fear an attack from the priests and their followers. Therefore, my lords ask, if (in case) necessity arises, that your lords would come to our aid and rescue by sending some troops, etc. To this end, you will faithfully assist as much as your ability and situation allow.</p>

      <p>The priests are arrogant. They do not give a good word, and many riders and servants are already gathered. We cannot know against whom it is directed. However, we must not expect anything good. At the very least, they will want to frighten us and force us into an unchristian imperial decree; may the Almighty protect us from that.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Today, Haller and I, along with Zoller, dined at my house and were in good spirits.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Greet for me the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, Gessner, etc. I recently replied to your previous letter. I hope it has reached you. God, our Father, be entrusted with your entire household. Dated June 13, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your faithful brother Georg Frölich, etc., in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed (Antistes) of the Christian church in Zurich, to his own hands. Zurich.</p>
