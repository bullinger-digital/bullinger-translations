      <p>S. P. D. I sent your letter, which we received from you in Zürich, with care to Heidelberg to the most illustrious father and also wrote to him myself about the matter that was being dealt with. What has been obtained, I do not know; for the most illustrious father only indicates that he has replied to you in these letters, which Heinrich Seringer brought to us among others yesterday, and which I am sending to the Zürich council and to you through my servant. Certainly, if it were in my power, I would gladly have Blaurer in my household; but if, as I do not know, the most illustrious father has decided otherwise, I do not doubt that he has done so for just and certain reasons. For I entrust both this and all other matters to his fatherly wisdom and clemency towards me, as befits an obedient son.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else to write at this time; therefore, farewell and greet your colleagues in my name.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the 3rd day before the Nones of September in the year 1568. Your Christoph von der Pfalz, Count Palatine, signed by his own hand.</p>
