      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>We commend to you this good and, as far as we could judge, truly pious Michael, whom we have supported in our poorhouse for a month and a half, if I am not mistaken, and would have supported even longer if he had wished to stay longer. He has been rendered useless for manual labor due to an injured arm; he might appear superstitious and indeed seemed so to us at first glance; but upon closer inspection and as far as we could discern his soul, we found him to be quite different.</p>
      <p>He walks in a simple garment and barefoot without shoes, fearing that if he were to wear a more decent robe and shoes, he might be overcome by an uncontrollable desire to serve in the military; he complains greatly that this has happened to him before. For he is exceedingly passionate about the military, to which he has been accustomed since his youth, so we cannot at all disapprove of this decision. I truly believe that whatever kindness is shown to him is placed in Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, October 7, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
