      <p>Greetings. Most humane man, since I have found a certain messenger, these two young men are passing through Basel, heading directly to bring back here a certain sick student from our home, I thought it a sin not to write to you, even though I know well that you are quite busy otherwise. What should I write? We pray to God for all good things for you and all the learned men there, as many of us as preach the Lord's gospel in the Engadin. Furthermore, we are all doing well here, as the Lord has seen fit, and everything is healthy in the whole Engadin and untouched by the plague so far.</p>
      <p>For what God has done elsewhere in our Confederation with His rod, you have long known.</p>
      <p>The gospel in the Engadin has never been better, thanks to God. Finally, if there is anything you think it good for us to know or wish to command us, write and entrust it to these young men. I have the intention of coming there in the spring, if there is a place where I might be suitable through you. For I have five sons, whom I wish to learn the German language better, which they cannot achieve here. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you, a man of all-around learning and a diligent expositor of the gospel of His Son, for a long time in safety with all the learned and good men there. Farewell, most upright man, and do not cease to love your Philipp. From Lavin in Lower Engadin, on the 27th of December in the year 1550. Your old Philipp Gallicius, whom you once deemed worthy to have as a friend.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with all kinds of doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
