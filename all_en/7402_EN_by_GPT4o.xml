      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father, I sincerely pray through Jesus Christ, I diligently commend my respect, dedication, and service to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding my delayed return to the homeland, but by the grace of God safe, and concerning the most gracious goodwill of the Palatine of Krakau towards you, both for many other reasons and for the hospitality shown to his nephew Johann, and about some other matters, I wrote to your piety, most esteemed father, last month and arranged for those letters to be delivered to Nuremberg by our Schlisemberg, which I do not doubt you have already received through his efforts.</p>
      <p>Now I will present the request of a certain Sabinus, a good Italian man, who stayed with you in Z端rich ten years ago or even earlier. He asks that I earnestly plead with you on his behalf, to be willing to advocate with Muraltus, your surgeon, for the cause of his daughter, who is here in Poland. Thenaudus describes the entire matter and the nature of the agreement to your paternity, and Muraltus himself has a copy of the contract, detailing how the agreement was made between Sabinus and Muraltus regarding his daughter. She is married here to a good man, with whom she lives piously and righteously and has borne children. It is certainly worthy and pious that her father should not abandon her, especially since he is not going to give her anything of his own. If Muraltus would be willing to deposit the money owed to his daughter with you, I would, upon receiving your letters, pay the same amount to his daughter here in the name of Miscovius, and you would convert the amount you received from Muraltus for the use of Miscovius, thus it would not be necessary to transmit any money from Z端rich to Poland.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know, most illustrious lord and most esteemed father, that I have not yet received any letters from my people. However, the day I wrote this was the first of March, at which time no letters had yet been delivered. I showed them the method of transmitting letters through Nuremberg to the Gutteters, through whom they could most easily be delivered to Krakau. We all here marvel at their negligence, especially since there were matters worthy of writing about the French tumults, about which terrible and most distressing news for the church of God is reported here by the papists. The Palatine has also inquired with me about this matter two or three times and is not pleased with Johann's silence. The Palatine himself will write to you shortly and will respond to yours, which he received with the greatest gratitude and gave the highest thanks, for you received his nephew into your house along with his servant Malinius. With his letters, I will write more, as will Mr. Paulus Gilovius. I commend both myself and my boys to you and pray to God to keep you safe for his church for a very long time and to fulfill your wishes.</p>
      <p>I respectfully and reverently greet all your colleagues, the most esteemed lords and brothers. I warmly greet your sons and daughters along with the whole family and wish you all to live most happily together through Jesus Christ. Given in Krakau on the calends of March 1568.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and most observant of you, Christoph Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most illustrious man, the most learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Z端rich, etc., most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
