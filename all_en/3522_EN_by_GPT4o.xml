      <p>Greetings. I am very grateful for the new matters that you have informed me of through the letters of friends, and I ask that you do so often and whenever more serious occupations do not hold you back, as long as you have something to share. Before receiving those letters, I had also been informed by you about your magistrate's deliberations regarding whether to convene or rather not to convene the assembly. Know that I have asked both the people of Lucerne and others from the Confederation to take care of convening it through the people of Zurich, if possible. If they are unwilling, I hope to achieve it through others; but for some reasons, I did not think the matter should be rushed too much. Here from Italy, we have news that the Duke of Ferrara has inflicted great damage on Parma and has captured many castles in its territory, partly by force and partly by surrender, including one that is both of great importance and excellently fortified, and with its occupation, the whole region of Parma is being remarkably harassed. The Duke of Ferrara himself wrote this to me. I hope to have a successor who is so friendly to both of us that there will be no need to find another way to visit each other more often through letters, other than always directing letters to him. However, since I am not yet certain, I do not write his name.</p>
      <p>I wish to send my greetings to Consul Habium in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, on the first of March.</p>
      <p>Your Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian and most friendly man, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich.</p>
