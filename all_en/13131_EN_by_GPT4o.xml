    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received two letters from Myconius. Regarding the first letter from November 6 [No. 3071], there is not much to say, except that Myconius obviously took Bullinger's admonition poorly, which was meant solely for him, not to pass on the communications to Bucer or other persons in Strasbourg. However, there were good reasons for this admonition, which are not to be elaborated here. The fact that Myconius felt offended by this and concluded that Bullinger does not consider him trustworthy has equally annoyed him! He would wish that Myconius reads his letters as those of an honest friend, without suspicion. If not, then the break in correspondence threatened by Myconius should come to pass! But enough of that.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger wrote nothing about the council because he knows no more about it than Myconius: It was decided to continue it in Trent. The archbishops, bishops, cardinals, and the "beloved sons" of Pope Paul III are to preside over it. The Protestants were asked to present their concerns. In the meantime, they are to promise to adhere to the council's decisions. What more can be said about this? The wise will not be able to make anything of such a council. But if naive or bad [authorities] do not perceive the associated cunning and send their Protestant [pastors and theologians] to the council, the latter should then do what God and the situation command them. The Lord will certainly not abandon his cause!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The second letter from November 19 [No. 3079] arrived on November 22. Bullinger has communicated Myconius' information about Ludwig Lavater to his father Hans Rudolf. Had Ludwig listened to the advice of his father and Bullinger, he would have stayed at home!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Let the driven [Imperials] come! They are only human too, and God will decide who wins. It is important to urge the people to improvement and prayer. If the Lord wills, the enemies will be mowed down, even if they are countless! But if God does not want to help, but to punish, one must not ask for the reasons, but earnestly ask him for grace and patience, to be able to endure under his cross in a Christian and confident manner until death. However, Bullinger believes that God will have mercy on the Swiss Confederates and will not abandon them, because they have given no reason for an attack. If they are not left in peace, may God and a good battle-axe help further! The attackers will not be able to drive the Swiss Confederates out of their homeland so easily, especially since they would be dealing with much more determined people than they are, and it would lead to a fierce battle. May God grant his assistance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Myconius should return the enclosures with the next messenger. Greetings, especially to Huldrych Zwingli the Younger and Johannes Gast.</p>

      <p>S. D. I received two letters from you, my most learned Myconius. The first was dated November 6, in which there is nothing that requires a significant response, except that I understand you took my admonition poorly, which was meant solely for you, not to share with others in Strasbourg, especially Bucer. There are many reasons for my admonition, but I will pass over them. You gather from my admonition that I perhaps consider you a man of bad faith! I, however, find this interpretation and your agitation without cause as offensive as you find my admonition or request, which contains nothing unjust or of the kind you infer. Therefore, I wish you would read my writings, as those of a sincere friend, with greater tranquility of mind and firmer trust in me than you have read that one. Otherwise, it would be better to accept the condition you object to: "I would prefer your silence," you say, "to a bad suspicion of me"; for I could say the same to you. But no more of this.</p>

      <p>I wrote nothing to you about the council because I know you are not ignorant of what I know. The council is now being prepared in Trent. Archbishops, bishops, cardinals, and the beloved sons of the Pope will preside. The evangelicals will also be invited to present their case. In the meantime, they are to promise to adhere to the council's decisions. But what should I write or say about this? Such a council will have no authority among the wise. If, however, the imprudent and the worst do not want to understand the deceit and order the evangelicals to go to such a council, let them do what God, the occasion, place, and time dictate. The Lord will not abandon His cause! I am not at all anxious here.</p>

      <p>I received the second letter dated November 19 on the 22nd of the same month. I understood what you recounted about Lavater and relayed the same to his father. If he had obeyed his father and us, he would have stayed at home, etc.</p>

      <p>It cannot be otherwise, let the restless people come. They are flesh and blood. God gives victory and strength. Let us hold on to this, that the people may improve and cry out to God faithfully. If God wills to help us, the matter will turn out well. Even if they are as numerous as leaves and grass, we will mow them down with God's help. If God does not want to help us, but to punish, we should not ask "why?", but earnestly ask for grace and patience, so that we stand under the cross in a Christian and confident manner and endure under it. However, I trust God, He will have mercy on us and not abandon us, for we have given the restless people no cause or reason. We would gladly be at peace. If they do not want to leave us in peace, may God and a good battle-axe help! It will be hard enough for them to drive us out of our homeland, away from wives and children. Many will become more enraged than they are. There will certainly be good blows given. May God come to our aid!</p>

      <p>Return what I have enclosed with the next messenger. Greet all the brothers, especially Zwingli the Younger, Mr. Gast, and the others. November 22, 1547. Yours, H. B.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most faithful minister of the church in Basel, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Basel.</p>
