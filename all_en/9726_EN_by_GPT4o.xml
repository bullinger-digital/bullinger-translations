      <p>Be safe in Christ, dearest Bullinger!</p>
      <p>In my previous letters, which I sent to you on February 6th, I gave great thanks for the very learned booklet you sent me about the persecutions of the church, and I give thanks again now. I received the Latin version, but I have not yet seen the German one.</p>
      <p>I received your letters dated March 10th on June 26th; in which you write that you have now sent me a certain response to the Brentians, and furthermore two homilies on Psalm 130 and 133: but I have received none of these. Curse those by whom such great treasures are withheld from me!</p>
      <p>A certain Belgian-German girl of seventeen or eighteen years was miserably tormented by Satan for a whole year in Norwich, and she served the preacher of that church. Indeed, this girl remained firm in faith in all temptations and torments, and resisted the adversary more than manfully. At last, with God's help, the devil was defeated and left her, and at almost the same moment invaded the son of a certain senator, whom he also afflicted incredibly for several weeks. At my command, public prayers were made in the city, with fasting declared until evening. The Lord also had mercy on the boy and defeated the enemy. The boy was thirteen or at most fourteen years old, diligently versed in the holy scriptures for his age, which he boldly hurled against the enemy with unwavering faith. The Lord lives, through whom boys and girls of otherwise weak nature can overcome such a great and monstrous adversary. Praise be to God! etc.</p>
      <p>That confession of true religion, which you published in 1566, speaks English and is handled by everyone. The dearness of all things still endures among us. Rodolph Gwalther, the son of our Gwalther, a very learned young man, sharp in intellect, and pious in manners, returns to you. His father is offended with him for not living more frugally.</p>
      <p>If he has sinned in this, it is to be forgiven to youthful age. You should persuade his father to embrace his returning son no differently than that best father in Luke 15. etc.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, in my name all my friends, your sons and daughters, especially Dorothea, whom I wish God would join in marriage to our Rodolph! Certainly, I earnestly desire this. If it happens with your consent and that of our Gwalther, I will rejoice exceedingly, and you will rightly, as I hope, rejoice, and the Lord will bless their marriage.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and love me (as you do). All mine are yours. Hastily. At Ludham, on the penultimate day of June, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your John Parkhurst, N.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
