      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Alas, I bring sad news: Our MÃ¼nster ascended to heaven on the day of the Lord's Ascension at eight in the morning, now reigning with Christ Jesus the Son, having been killed by the pestilential plague. Farewell. I can add nothing due to the grief that shakes my soul. I eagerly await your letters. From your envoy, you will hear what is happening at the court of the King of France.</p>
      <p>The region of Nuremberg has been invaded by enemies. We find little faith in people. Basel, May 26, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
