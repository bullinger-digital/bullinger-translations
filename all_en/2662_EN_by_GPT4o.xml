      <p> Greetings. I hear, my son, that you have become more lax in your studies, which is something I could not hear without distress. For he who is wasteful of good time becomes indifferent in the study of good letters. But that you are wasteful of the best time is especially proven by the fact that you and the rest of our students from Zürich meet too frequently. Indeed, the company is not dishonorable; however, those that hinder studies begin to be dishonorable for students. But what need is there for that argument? Were you brought up in this way? </p>
      <p> Read, read, I pray, what instruction written by my hand has to say about the waste of time, about dividing hours for the study of letters. </p>
      <p> Irrevocable time flies; indeed, with every moment you approach the time when you will be called back home; for I will not be able to bear such expenses. When you return, it will be demanded of you with diligent examination what you have achieved in the Latin and Greek languages, in dialectics, rhetoric, in history and poetry, in theology, etc. Therefore, see what you do; beware that not even a little of your time is lost, which you do not devote to study. You must not always gather and run around; sit still and study. You were not sent out to wander, to keep company, to run around, etc. And now through these letters, I demand of you that, leaving that fellowship and frequent meetings, you attend to your own matters, keep account of your time. Announce the same to those fellow students of yours from Zürich. I know you will do an unpleasant thing to your master or lord. Therefore, I want you not to leave his house nor introduce anyone into his house unless it is done with his good grace, and that you obey him in all things, about which I have also written to him. I also want you to respond to me through this Italian merchant, a good man and my friend, Francesco Bonet, both to this letter of mine and to the previous ones. </p>
      <p> If you were to come down to Saxony or to Hesse and were to be so negligent, I would deal with you rightly. </p>
      <p> Consider that you will soon be called back and examined; see that I have not made expenses on you without fruit; see that you return with the joy of your parents, sisters, and relatives and friends. I want you to remember these things with a mindful mind. Farewell. Zürich, the last day of June, in the year 1555. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To Heinrich Bullinger the Younger, my son, in the house of the excellent man Mr. Johannes Burcher. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg. </p>
