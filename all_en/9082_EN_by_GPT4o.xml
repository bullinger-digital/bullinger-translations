      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, honorable lord and compater, sent through this messenger of yours along with the booklet "On the Authority of Scripture," which I had previously read in Latin, published by you and sent to me. I am not certain about the author; however, it is elegant and clearly discusses the primary point of our controversy with the papists, whether the dignity and authority of the church or the scriptures is greater. I thank you for both, this and that. I have not yet been able to confer with Lord Steiger after receiving your letters; I believe he himself will write to you.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new. We hear that the forces of Orange have dispersed in the Netherlands and that he himself is moving to Zealand for the winter. I cannot describe what is happening in France better than the one who sent me these letters, which I am sending enclosed, Fran√ßois Hotman, the jurist, whom I believe you know; please return them soon. I cannot yet indicate the total of our collection to you; however, I will write as soon as I know. Nor do I have anything else now, except that the physician from Sion, a pious and honest man, writes to us that the pope has ordered the bishop of Sion to collect a considerable sum of money for the execution of the council, and that the priests indeed wanted to consent otherwise, but the bishop resisted and replied to the pope that he could not do this without the consent of the entire people; however, the people are bearing this very indignantly and do not want to contribute anything.</p>
      <p>We gather from this what the papists are plotting. Would that they and their money perish miserably, indeed. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 26th October 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compater.</p>
