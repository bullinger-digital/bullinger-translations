      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I distributed the booklets to everyone you sent them to, except for Mr. Schertlin, to whom I will send them shortly, once he sends a messenger to us, as he promised, whom I hope to see soon in Alsace.</p>
      <p>News: The army of Maurice left Frankfurt after receiving a large sum of money, cannons, and other items related to warfare; they are heading to Osnabrück, an episcopal town, then they will greet the Bishop of Würzburg for provisions and supplies. It is said, which is surprising to me, that Maximilian, the son of King Ferdinand, is with Maurice's army having received safe conduct, and I am uncertain what he intends or seeks.</p>
      <p>What if he tried to imitate the deed of S. Tarquinius, who conquered and deceived Gabii with remarkable skill? Everyone knows how Caesar recovered Augsburg after the sad war. Either there are rivalries among the brothers over the imperial throne, or everything is being done with malicious intent. The princes should open their eyes and act wisely in such a difficult matter. The son of the Landgrave and the Prince of Mecklenburg have been taken to France; they will be hostages until this cruel war is ended. The Saxon nobles are still expecting some princes to arrive at any moment.</p>
      <p>Everything is going well for Mr. Schertlin; he is encamped in Lorraine at the Rimlisperg nunnery, awaiting the royal army. Strasbourg is in great danger; the priests are muttering something I do not know; they are heading to Freiburg, in which town, without a doubt, that cesspool of all evils must perish, as God disposes. In the Netherlands, a large army is gathered; the noble Martin von Rossen has infantry and cavalry, to whom the queen adheres, who was once tempted to go to the Emperor, but was hindered by the Hessians and by the lord of Heideck. We hear nothing about the English or the Danes, who have gathered a huge army; but it is unknown what they intend to do or against whom they will move.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand's men are gathering peasants everywhere in the villages; they sent some troops to the valley, commonly known as Wilertal, which was bought from the nobility of Bolwil to Constance.</p>
      <p>They want to prevent the royal army from defending Strasbourg; but the wretched ones take up arms in vain; they believe they are enemies, although they have not been provoked by them, nor do they understand the source of this war.</p>
      <p>The king in Lorraine demands three cities that were once imperial, he sent a herald to them to give their allegiance to the Roman Empire; whether they want to do this, I do not know. He also demands from these cities provisions, hostages, and money for war expenses. The Emperor threatens the princes and cities with the worst if they defect from him.</p>
      <p>The entire bishopric of Mainz and Speyer is taken, except for the cities of Speyer and Mainz; the two bishops were in Heidelberg, asked for advice on how they should conduct themselves, the Count Palatine answered that he could not advise them now; they should see where it leads. They returned home, requested some Palatine knights to be given to them; a troop was sent against them, so they were almost captured. They returned, then had a ship prepared, and traveled to Speyer on the Neckar.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Worms died in these days and another was soon appointed in his place; they say he is a good man. The priests of Speyer and Mainz have hidden themselves, some have migrated to Cologne, some have fled to the nobles seeking safe hiding places. What do you think happened in Augsburg with the interim priests?</p>
      <p>I took great care of the French booklet sent to me; Mr. Conrad Roescius received one; since it was not convenient to give it to the postmaster, who otherwise had a heavier load than usual. Nor do I think you will object. On the 13th of April, the book index will receive the booklet. Farewell in the Lord. Was I not lengthy? Our Theodore will share the book index if you ask.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his forever to be honored lord.</p>
      <p>Ingolstadt has surrendered; they are trying to harass Ulm. The Hessian with Maurice are heading to the Netherlands. The King of France... will occupy the Rhine in four or five days.</p>
