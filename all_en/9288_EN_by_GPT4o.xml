      <p>Greetings. I received the letter written by your kindness, most illustrious man and father in Christ, on April 4th, only on the 12th of the same month, in which you kindly share with me the letters from friends written to you from England, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg. Since these were most pleasing to me, I give the greatest thanks I can for them; I have used them as you prescribed to me. I now return them through a messenger of good faith. I recently received four copies of the writings of Rapsacenus; for Dr. Samuel Grynaeus had sent only six to Dr. Martin Peyer, of which Peyer kept two for himself, I gave one to Dr. Meyer, the treasurer of our city, and I offer two as a gift to your kindness, reserving one for myself. But I hope to receive more shortly. Dr. Grynaeus writes to Dr. Peyer that as many as were brought to Frankfurt were soon all sold out and the edition was highly approved by all learned and good men. It was not unpleasant to learn that my conjecture rather than my opinion about the new star was not displeasing to your kindness and other learned men. Today, seeing that divine wonder in the morning, I do not think it will disappear soon, as Dr. Dasypodius predicted for this month. Hence, its duration will provide me with a fifth argument to more boldly deny it is a comet; for Cardanus writes about other comets: "The longest time of them (unless it exceeds six months as a miracle), usually ends before the 30th day, never before the seventh." Which I judge worthy of admiration, I add: This star, first conjoined with Jupiter on March 21st, will meet with all the planets except Saturn, which perpetually occupies the opposite sign of this star, within a span of 46 days until May 6th, and during this time many other conjunctions of planets will occur, where many assemblies on earth are also held, and the Lord is to be prayed to, that soon he may celebrate his great assemblies brought down from heaven in the world. If the offspring of Jakob Andreae comes forth, it may perhaps cause greater disturbances.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, conveying greetings to all the brothers. Each of those you greeted reverently sends their regards to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste on April 16th, on which day the new star will conjoin with the sun, in the year of our Lord 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted in kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and father in Christ, most highly esteemed.</p>
