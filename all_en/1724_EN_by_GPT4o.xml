      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received a letter along with two sermons, which you have had printed in Zürich, on the 21st of this current month and are otherwise unaware of any further treatises that may have come to us from you in good time. We thank you very graciously for sending such treatises, although we do not know when we will be able to read them with due diligence, as we are currently not in the best position to do so.</p>
      <p>As far as your latest news is concerned, we believe that the neutrality between France and Burgundy will be maintained, depending on how events and times unfold, and three years is not a long time in itself. It is to be feared that this situation will eventually take a rough turn. We are well aware that the King of France desires more allies; as we understand, he does not have many more with him.</p>
      <p>We will let Duke Maurice's accepted peace remain in its worth, as it will clarify itself daily, etc.</p>
      <p>We assume you will or have already come to know every day that the Emperor has moved towards Strasbourg and will remain there with his army on horseback and foot for several days. Meanwhile, Margrave Albrecht has taken Saarbrücken, which is not far from Strasbourg, and is fairly well equipped with cavalry and infantry; they are all well-paid, reckless, and in good spirits. We truly fear that this will lead to a great bloodshed once again, mostly affecting the Germans. May the gracious God look upon us poor Germans this time with greater mercy, grace, peace, and tranquility. Amen. We are greatly concerned that this war will not end soon. May the dear God send a good and lasting resolution. Be entrusted to God. Dated Göppingen, the 25th of September, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of W[ürttemberg] etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
