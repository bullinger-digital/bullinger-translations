    <p xml:id="regest1">Blasius wishes Bullinger all the best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Although there is currently nothing noteworthy to report, Blasius did not want to let Mayor Luzi Heim travel [to the Baden Diet] without giving him a letter for Bullinger. He will learn everything about the church and politics in Chur and the news from Italy from Heim. Should he have news about the events in Germany, he can simply give them to Heim. In Chur, they are eager to know about the steadfast community of Constance and also about the other German churches, how the Council of Trent is proceeding, and what has been decided at the Augsburg [Diet] in the meantime.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Mayor Heim probably does not need a special recommendation, as he is well known to Bullinger and [the Zurich Mayor] Johannes Haab. It is thanks to him that Haab is so revered in Chur.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">However, one [Hans von Capol the Younger?] from the Three Leagues has now been sent to the Baden Diet, whom the Zurichers, if they treat him kindly, will not find ungrateful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings. In haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">In confidence: The [Three Leagues] were warned that Emperor Charles V intends to transport his troops through the Valtellina to Italy by force if necessary, should the Venetians refuse him passage through their territory. Therefore, the Leagues are asking for support from the Confederates. Additionally, a surprise attack by 4,000 marksmen on the Leagues is planned! Surely this plan comes from the dear child, Margrave Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of Musso. This is still strictly confidential!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[PS:] Greetings from Johannes Comander and all other friends.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius wishes his grace and innocence of life from the Lord to his dear Heinrich Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Although at present I have nothing worthy of your knowledge, most honorable man, I did not allow our mayor, Luzi Heim, to visit you without my letter. From him, you will clearly understand the entire state of our affairs, both ecclesiastical and secular, as well as the news brought here from Italy. Through him, you can also conveniently convey to us any news from Germany. We are continually curious about the state of the steadfast community of Constance and other German churches, as well as the proceedings of the Council of Trent and what has been decided in Augsburg in the meantime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Finally, I do not think it necessary to recommend the same mayor to you in my letters, as I know well that he is both known and highly recommended to you and to Lord Mayor Johannes Haab. For he was the sole author of the honor shown to our Lord Haab.</p>

      <p>Now, however, a delegate from the Three Leagues has been sent to the Baden Diet, to whom, if you show any kindness, you will not have done so in vain, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell through the Lord. In haste, Chur, January 19, 1548.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In confidence: We have been warned that the Emperor's troops, unable to pass through Venetian territory to Italy, intend to forcibly take the pass through the Valtellina. Therefore, our people are seeking counsel and also assistance from the Confederates. And there is a plan to unexpectedly attack us with 4,000 marksmen. Surely this comes from the dear and simple child, Margrave Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of Musso, etc. This is still very secret.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Blasius.</p>

      <p>Johannes Comander and all other good men send their regards.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in prudence, learning, and true piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished overseer of the Church of Christ in Zurich, both a faithful and most vigilant brother and his most esteemed lord.</p>
