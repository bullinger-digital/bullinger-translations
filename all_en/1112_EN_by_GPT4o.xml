      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned Heinrich. I believe you have received Gerbel's book from Froschauer, in whose package it was included with letters, or if you have not received it, go to Froschauer and ask him for it.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new. Regarding the people of Magdeburg, it is certain that they, having struck their enemies during the retreat, have regained their artillery and munitions, and through their fortune, it has been returned. Maurice is fortifying his cities and castles and is placing garrisons. Betuleius wrote to me from Augsburg: The Saxon cities have designated a noble deed and have those who take up their cause, who, it is said, will winter in Brunswick despite the incendiary's opposition. The Turk has requested passage to Italy from the Venetians, denied grain to the Genoese, and ordered them to withdraw and not return. He does not want to leave unavenged the cruelty that the Emperor exercised on the Africans; therefore, we will have war next spring.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, 43 thieves were captured, many of whom were hanged. Thus, the Spaniards should adorn public crosses.</p>
      <p>Lord Bebelius, whom you know, was buried on the 15th of this month, followed on the 16th by Rodolphus Frey, who was very devoted to the Gospel of Christ. Farewell. More soon. Lord Schertlin sends his regards to you, with whom I will have lunch; he will tell me some news. Basel, December 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
