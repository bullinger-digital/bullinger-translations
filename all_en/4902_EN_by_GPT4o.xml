      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
      <p>Most excellent man of God, Lord Bullinger, after you approved our decision to subscribe to our orthodox faith confession, you subsequently advised us not to use your letters of confirmation until you wrote to us again and revealed to us in other letters what you thought should be done. We did as you instructed and showed them to no one except your Fabricius, eagerly awaiting those letters you promised to send us. However, either because you thought it unnecessary or because you believed that the great and divine letters you wanted read at the synod would suffice for the whole matter, you did not send me any personal ones. Whatever the reason for your not writing, I cannot certainly conjecture, yet I firmly believe and also affirm that you did everything rightly, for you would not have expended so much labor in composing letters to the synod unless our cause, which was God's, was dear to you; although they are far away, you nevertheless comprehensively encompassed everything in the briefest words contained in those twenty-four articles, omitting nothing.</p>
      <p>The man wanted, if he could, to misuse your authority and great names against us, believing otherwise excellent men to be asleep; but the simplicity of Christ is wiser than the cunning of Satan. If I were to tell you, man of God, and wanted to narrate, not everything, but only half, as they say, just half of what that man has plotted against us, it would require a long treatise, for it is not right to detain you longer in such matters, as you suffer from the constraint of time.</p>
      <p>Know that he has perpetrated much worse than Camillus Renatus; among other things, a defamatory pamphlet filled with lies, which the most vile man, excommunicated from our church, had printed against us in Milan, here Michael Angelus, along with another man of his kind and a minister of the gospel, did not hesitate to distribute. It is tiresome and even shameful to speak more on this matter.</p>
      <p>Would that for the honor of the gospel and the holy ministry, the memory of this matter were abolished and buried; for that book has been carried and spread through all the churches.</p>
      <p>Nothing distresses and torments me as much as this irremediable scandal. What need was there, moreover, to invent so many articles falsely against us or rather, as we think, taken from a certain farrago of Camillus, to carry them around to disturb the illustrious churches, especially Basel, Bern, and yours, and you above all, as if you have nothing else to do. This was the man who claimed that the decision to subscribe to our confession was an impious and most unjust violence, which he would never cease to criticize and condemn unless we relied on better foundations than he did. I often asked him to take care of his own church and leave ours to us.</p>
      <p>But he, as if made the metropolitan of our churches and superior to us, never wanted to rest, but sent us very long letters to be read to the whole church, in which he tried to prove that we acted impiously regarding such subscription. These things, man of God, we wanted you to know, so that you might recognize the arrogance of the man, who was never affected by any injury or harmed in the slightest by us, indeed he received some benefits. But because the greatest goodness of God shines forth especially in this, that he brings forth good from evil, from this shameful business, or rather on the occasion of it, those divine letters of yours emerged, which we keep as a treasure, for which we thank you as much as we can in the name of our church, for the two letters filled with heavenly doctrine given to me as a gift by your excellence to the Polish churches, I thank you and declare myself your debtor, although there are many other things that have long made me indebted to you. If we have been troublesome to you, I beg your pardon; the importunity of those who disturbed us was the cause. In the meantime, we want you to remember that we are yours, whom you can and should command.</p>
      <p>Farewell well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>May Christ Jesus keep you safe for us and his church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, August 4, 1561.</p>
      <p>I greet the most excellent and learned men, Lord Rudolf and all the other colleagues.</p>
      <p>Your Augustine Mainardi.</p>
      <p>To the most grave and wise man of God, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, as to the most revered father. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
