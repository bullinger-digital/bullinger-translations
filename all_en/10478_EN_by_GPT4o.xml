    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the works of Bullinger that were sent. Bucer agrees with everything in "De testamento," he just wishes for a small detail regarding the question of ceremonies to be formulated more precisely. In the explanations about the Eucharist in the commentary on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, Bucer praises Bullinger's zeal for the unity of the Church. Bucer's writing to the people of Münster has been well received and recommended by Philipp Melanchthon and other Lutherans, even by Osiander. Luther maintains his view of the Lord's Supper as the physical eating of the body of Christ. Bucer hopes for mutual understanding and asks Bullinger to read through his writing against the Bishop of Avranches and share his opinion. Greetings to Jud and Bibliander, whose commentary on Nahum is very much liked.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I give thanks for your excellent writings. I have read through "On the One Covenant of God" and I thank the Lord, who inspired you to tackle this very necessary topic at this time, when we see all heretics trying to justify their deceptions by claiming there are two peoples and two covenants. We all agree with what you have written. However, since Momus wants to find something to criticize in Venus, I would prefer the statement on page 15, "and he declared that he liked those things which he really neglected," to be phrased more gently, so that you do not expose yourself to any slanderer who might accuse you of attributing a lie to God. You know how religious Saint Augustine was. God not only neglected but also abhorred ceremonies performed without faith. However, he highly valued those done with faith, as he testifies everywhere. And he could have preserved his people from idolatry without them; indeed, unless they were drawn away from idolatry by the faith of the word, they would have been idolaters even in the ceremonies of Moses. What if we say that when the people had grown and needed, due to the weakness of their spirit, to have the things of God impressed upon them in many ways and by whatever means human ingenuity can be aroused, God wanted to add so many visible things to the audible words, which in their own way would serve to commend all of God's teaching, not only to abstain from the empty occupation of the idolaters' ceremonies. Before they descended into Egypt, they were not yet a righteous people, and if they had their ceremonies then, they were oppressed by tyranny in Egypt. Therefore, when the Lord deigned to grant them a just polity, he also prescribed the manner of his worship, which was indeed laborious. But they needed to be reminded of their God in many ways and to become accustomed in all things, even the smallest, to depend on God's will and to act according to his prescription. You, with Saint Augustine, recognize the same significance in their ceremonies as in ours. It follows, therefore, that when they were performed with faith, they were of the same value before God as ours, which God does not neglect, so much so that he communicates himself to us through them. For God's sake, he does not care about us at all, but for our sake, since he commands everything to us and has instituted those things dedicated to his worship in such a way that they proclaim his goodness to us above all and in some way exhibit it, hence in these there has always been a profession of faith and a proclamation of divine goodness. There seems to be enough reason to attribute a greater use to the ceremonies of the old people than to say they only occupied the people so that they would not be captivated by the admiration of the ceremonies of the Gentiles. See how many sow Minerva. But with your ease, you will consider everything well.</p>
      <p>What you have discussed about the holy Eucharist in the epistle to the Corinthians, I have read, and I give great thanks to the Lord Jesus, who has given this zeal for the unity of the holy churches, to which, however, those whom we seek in the Lord do not so incline. If nothing else, the common enemy, who constantly tries to creep in where we do not unite, should have softened them.</p>
      <p>But may Christ move us, who omitted nothing to reconcile us to himself in the Father, for which reason he died. May the grave offense of so many myriads of God's children in all the kingdoms of Europe move us, may the most ample grace of Christ move us, who in all things has given us the same mind, however much we may fight with words. If I cannot convince you and those like you, endowed with judgment and tolerant of discussion, I would rather die. But you see this yourself.</p>
      <p>Our writing to the people of Münster has satisfied you. Besides Philipp and many Lutherans, even that sharp Osiander approves it so much that he has written to me these days that he has already persuaded many friends that our opinion is tolerable and has himself now pledged brotherhood in the Lord. Luther stubbornly retains his way of speaking, saying that the body of the Lord is received in the supper physically in the hand, mouth, with the paten and all, as he and as well the unbelievers as the believers. Thus, he seems to himself to express the truth of the exhibition of Christ according to those words: "Take, this is my body" [Mt 26, 26], and this also to be so solid that, in the usual way of speaking, all things done with the symbol, through which the body of the Lord is exhibited, can also be attributed to the body of the Lord exhibited with that symbol. These are to be seen, touched, physically received, and so on. He feels that it is exhibited to the impious as much as to the pious, but they do not receive it as much. He says nothing about the diffused body of the Lord. For he excludes "locally" and acknowledges that the Lord can be in one place in heaven and yet be preached here. There is no question with Luther about these two things, the body of the Lord being united with the bread naturally or being in many places locally. The only question is with what words the presence that the Lord exhibits in the supper can be sufficiently and religiously expressed, and, believe me, he attacks nothing other than asserting empty symbols in the supper. But the fact that he has not yet been able to be torn away from that opinion, which he believes we have held, causes us so many accusations. Now several great and learned men, not only Germans, are striving with all their might to finally understand each other. For they know what our enemies have thought. They hope to break in through this gap, where we still gape. And with the beginning made by you: τοῦτο μυστήριον, you can easily guess the reasons. But about this, the Lord sees. Let us now conduct the Lord's cause in such a way that no evil is brought upon us by us. But that we may understand each other mutually and in that way not only remove the dissension but also that offense which comes from their coarser way of speaking, you know that words are needed that satisfy both sides. Therefore, I constantly focus on this.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you to go through what I send written against the Bishop of Avranches, and write back about these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and greet our Leo and Bibliander reverently, whose most learned commentary on the prophet Nahum is wonderfully pleasing. Farewell excellently and lift your eyes to the harvest of the whole world and never dismiss from your mind the necessity of the concord of the harvesters. Finally, let us not judge all the children of God by those who applaud us with their writings, as if we were superior. There is a huge crowd of those who, due to the weakness of faith, cannot yet recognize us for who we are. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>September 25.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished brother in learning and piety.</p>
