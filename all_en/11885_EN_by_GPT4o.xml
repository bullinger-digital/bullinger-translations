    <p xml:id="regest1">Is surprised that he received no reply; Bullinger should publicly respond to the attack by Cochläus ["On the Authority of Canonical Scripture and the Catholic Church"], just as Zwingli did against [Hieronymus] Emser, and not remain silent or slander the opponent like Luther; Cochläus, whom Gast met 26 years ago in Frankfurt, is worthy of a response. Emperor [Charles V] is staying in Speyer, where the [envoys of the] cities and the princes are also arriving; the Rhenish electors have renewed their alliance over the holidays, undoubtedly to weaken the Emperor. Many sick soldiers are in the Basel hospital, many of whom have already died from the plague, and city citizens have also been affected. Request for a reply, greetings, and New Year's wishes. Is concerned about the news that the canons wish to return from Freiburg to Basel because of the Turkish tax, and asks for advice. Wilhelm von Fürstenberg could not conquer Luxembourg; his army suffered great losses due to the cold.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is surprising that you have not written to me at all, even though I have often reminded and asked you to let me know what you think about the pamphlet written by Cochläus against you. Perhaps you are planning an apology. Luther refused to respond to his questions, although he mocked him in a manner unbecoming of such a great theologian.</p>
      <p>Our Zwingli gave a response to Emser, not without much admiration, and will you remain completely silent? I still recognize him as a member of the church, even though he opposes the true church. He is an old man, whom I have known for 26 years. He used to share everything he had with students of the liberal arts. He was a somewhat superstitious man and very devoted to ceremonies when he lived in Frankfurt am Main. He seems to me worthy of a response, but without insults, without abuse, so that you do not imitate Luther in this matter, etc.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is now in Speyer, and the cities of the empire and the princes are flocking there. They say the Emperor is uncertain about what he will undertake this summer. The four Rhenish electors, after the festive days, that is, the bishops of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier, along with the Palatinate, gathered in some small town and renewed the alliance that had been established among them long ago. I have no doubt they were motivated by this reason, to slightly weaken the Emperor's power and to curb his arrogance after his victory.</p>
      <p>Our hospital is almost filled with Italian, Spanish, and Swiss soldiers; this disease is spreading and infecting many. Four guests infected with this disease were buried this week, and two more are suffering so severely that the doctors have despaired of their recovery. It is also affecting our citizens and children; few who have been infected with these fevers have been restored so far.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back. I pray for a happy and prosperous beginning of this year for you and all yours in my and my wife's name.</p>
      <p>Under what conditions do you think our canons should be received into the city, so that we do not harbor the most venomous serpents in our bosom? I am certain they will not give their name to our religion. They are seeking a more convenient place than they currently have in Freiburg, due to the taxes for the Turkish war. Please advise me on this matter.</p>
      <p>For these things are known to few, and I do not have this information from our people, but from outsiders who have informed me by letter. At first, this matter was worthy of admiration to me; but I see, indeed I sense, the plans of some who look more to external peace than to true peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back. January 20, Basel, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Duke Wilhelm von Fürstenberg could not conquer Luxembourg. He lost a large part of his forces due to the intense cold.</p>
      <p>To the theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
