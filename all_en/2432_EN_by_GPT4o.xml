      <p>Greetings and Peace. Although there is nothing particularly significant that I judge to be worth writing from me at this time or worth reading by you, nevertheless, to elicit your letters, I could not refrain from at least greeting you and considering you to be in good health. The churches, schools, and our entire republic are in a moderate state as they have been so far, although many things are being said about Margrave Albrecht against the Nurembergers and the bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg, and they are said to be in motion. However, we must hope for all the best and endure whatever comes. We have almost become accustomed to such things; yet we will not cease to pray to God with all our wishes and to be ever more vigilant and intercede for the common peace and tranquility of the homeland and its safety. Our sins, especially ingratitude towards the gospel and all the gifts of God, and particularly against the first table, deserve these public and private inconveniences and provoke the wrath of the Lord against us. I ask and beseech you, along with your churches, not to cease to do good even to the unworthy and ungrateful with public and private prayers, duties, and benefits, and to always be present and not grow weary in doing good [Thess. 3,13]. It is unjust, I confess, for those who do good not only not to receive the same measure or even a release, as even the pagan priest and provider of Mount Helion, as Pausanias reports, commanded. But it is also royal and truly Christian to love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you (Luke 6,27), not repaying anyone evil for evil (Rom. 12,17), not avenging yourselves, but giving place to wrath; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good [Rom. 12, 19.20.21]. But I, who write these things to you, am like a pig teaching Minerva or bringing wood to the forest. In short, nothing else, except that you do what you are doing and never allow yourself to be tempted by the rashness or malice of any clamorous and restless people, equally as unlearned, to cease cultivating mutual friendship and benevolence with us and with the learned and more sensible, now by the grace of God many, and to always respond in love and favor, and not even to regard or dignify with a word those who are vulgar and half-educated, earth-born men, but rather, in your manner, to engage in explaining the sacred writings and the chief places of doctrine against those old and greater enemies sworn to the words of the antichrist.</p>
      <p>We have written almost the same to Calvin, who is most closely connected to us by every kind of relationship and cherished with eternal friendship, and to me indeed it is very much persuaded that if we could meet face to face sometime and speak body to body or even communicate more familiarly and frequently even through paper and ink, with all unnecessary affections and impediments set aside on both sides, we would very easily agree in all things, God willing, even in words and phrases, let alone in sentences according to the holy scripture and sound doctrine in the catholic orthodox church, the perpetual and immortal mother of ours in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit. But where am I carried away by love and sweetness as if conversing with you, which perhaps will happen better in that other life without all trouble and temptation of evils, if it is not granted here face to face. For what are we or how long will we care for these things? Meanwhile, I love you and will love you for your great merit, do not omit to respond fully and very copiously on every occasion. For every one of your longest letters is always most welcome and delightful. I think you have seen what the Louvainists Ruard Tapper, what Driedo, what others recently, what now Tunstall the Englishman, etc. have written against us; but the Parisians and Louvainists, following those Spaniards and Italians, are by far the most impudent of all, whose foundation is that ruinous, unique, ridiculous thing about their pope and the infallible chair of Peter, for they do not cease to rave even now further, it would be worth it for you, as you are accustomed, to thoroughly overthrow and uproot it again with their own weapons and the most certain testimonies of scripture and the fathers, all their sophistry and sycophancy in that one place about our church and unwritten traditions and the suggestion of some spirit, how the church is rightly governed and infallible as they say. To these, and those of this kind, it would be fitting to first of all stop that impudent mouth, although it is true on the other side and extreme that Servetus, as now here with us a certain Loriot, a jurist, otherwise quite obliging human-minded man, and Stancarus and Amsdorf and Stenckfeld and Osiander now raging like their own Euripus, not to mention Westphal, Gallus, etc., with utterly cock-like minds, are now and will be a danger among our unlearned and ignorant populace. But all these clouds and schisms and divisions of schisms will easily and quickly vanish with the agreement of the learned and more sensible and with you joined with us. If, as recently, we had met in Naumburg, as we hoped, not only the Hessians and Wittenbergers, but also others or certainly the greater and better part of our more learned people with the help of the cities, of which Strasbourg was always with some others or even our princes of the Palatinate, Württemberg, Hesse, etc., could also meet and communicate somewhere with your people together with the Strasbourgers and Calvin, even with only mutual and friendly writings, as the Prussian prince through his Osiander most vehemently insisted, I would hope indeed, unless I am completely mistaken, that the churches and schools of our entire Germany would be much better provided for shortly and that the monks and sophists would have a trap and snare, who now seem to rejoice and triumph so much in our misfortunes. But I cease and beg you to write back, and I trust you will be persuaded. Farewell forever, a man to me in Christ to be honored with perpetual veneration. Given most quickly, even when there was no time to reread, in the noise of our fair in the very year of the Gaul 1554.</p>
      <p>Valentin Paceus.</p>
      <p>To the magnificent man and most deserving of the entire republic, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, his lord and friend to be honored with eternal veneration.</p>
