      <p>There remain countless things to be written, which it is now less appropriate to note. However, the fact that a certain Swiss captain is staying here for so long has led many to suspicion out of amazement. For the dissension among your fellow countrymen still makes many too confident in their undertakings, and it is to be feared that the Five Cantons are well aware of the wicked plans in the empire, which you, with your wisdom, will not unwisely comprehend. Be assured that our Thomas is very dear to us, who, standing by you, also sends his most dutiful greetings. Communicate this also to Dr. Gesner, when it seems appropriate to you, to whom I will abundantly give thanks for the infinite merits and the most honorable mention of me made again and again without any merit of mine. Now the brevity of time and the hastening speed excuse me. Finally, we earnestly request that you greet the most holy assembly and the church and school in the name of my late father and myself most dutifully, whom I do not so much revere as I will cherish with perpetual and constant celebration, observance, and devotion as long as I live.</p>
      <p>We immediately forwarded your letters to Mr. Welser to the nearby estate, where he was staying and enjoying the sun with the soldiers, and we promptly delivered the others to Peter the pharmacist, who had brought yours to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most renowned man, pillar of sincere doctrine and piety. Augsburg, June 22, 1556.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your kindness in all things, Raphael Seiler.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent minister of the divine word, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, to be sincerely revered as a lord and as a father. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
