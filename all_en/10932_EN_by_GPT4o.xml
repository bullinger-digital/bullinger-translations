    <p xml:id="regest1">May God assist [the ailing] Utinger. A victory of the Emperor would threaten the Confederates and, as is heard from Brabant, also the Low German cities; however, it seems to be calm in France, and from Solothurn as well as other places not far from Basel, [mercenaries continue to enter French service]. The meeting [on the Concord issue] already scheduled for September 24th could possibly be postponed at Zurich's request. A Basel resident reports from Brabant that the executed English queen [Anne Boleyn] had a bad reputation; criticism of King [Henry VIII] should be taken with caution. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Concerning Utinger, you wrote sorrowful news. May God assist him, I pray, whether he lives or dies.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing about the Emperor, except that danger threatens the Swiss Confederates if he emerges victorious. This rumor flies in from all directions. In Brabant, they say: The victorious Emperor will invade the allied cities (the Hanseatic League) in Lower Germany. A certain person from France wrote to me these days about his safety; not a word about the enemy. The French soldiers send a huge amount of gold here. Someone even sent a parrot. From this, they seem to me more than sufficiently secure. From Solothurn and other places neighboring us, there is no end to the excursions.</p>
      <p>As for the meeting, it was decided before I approached the consul. The consul said it was scheduled for the coming Sunday before Michaelmas. What if, by the counsel of your people, it could be postponed?</p>
      <p>In England, there is peace. About the executed queen, both the English themselves and their neighbors say: "She was a wicked piece of flesh." This is common. Therefore, anyone who speaks ill of the king could be suspect. I say this from a certain godfather of mine, who came from Brabant the day before yesterday.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife, children, and brothers. If Utinger lives, console him in the Lord or in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, September 6, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and brother.</p>
