      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most reverend father, in which you greatly congratulate us on this splendid victory of ours, which we recently won over those perverse minds. And, if only they were more willing to observe our orders and rites and were not so perversely inclined, with which they are abundantly filled with a desire for innovation! Gantner is now far more obstinate than he was before, and he would rather incite all his peasants against us than obey the decrees and constitutions of the synod and the Republic of the Three Leagues. Together with Marius, he fills the whole world, as it were, with injuries, slanders, and tyranny, with which both have been affected by us. However, we will soon hand over that petulance to our most ample senate to be judged and punished, and it will be little short of them losing the right of citizenship, of which they boast too imperiously, with great disgrace. We, in turn, congratulate you, wishing you healthy baths, so that you may enjoy eternal stable health. However, I am sorry that I could not send the little gift, as I had intended, but I will not forget it in due time.</p>
      <p>As for what and what kind of controversy there is, which intervenes between the people of Schaffhausen and the Cantons and the pagan rulers of the Thurgau province, it completely escapes us. - That Nicholas Camulius of Geneva, who was once in Basel with Ochino's help, who was also excluded by us, as you know from the synodal acts, fled from Plurio in the Valtellina due to suspicion of sodomy, of unnatural love, for which disgrace a certain boy is held captive. This is the sanctity and profound affection he bears towards the pious exiles, etc. Thus, one disgrace reveals another. The prefect of Plurio will hunt a rich prey here, if he wishes; for that Camulius is very wealthy and is said to exceed the number of 30,000 gold coins in assets.</p>
      <p>I send the articles of pacification or conspiracy between the Pope, the Venetians, and the Spaniard, with which they intend to repel the Turkish force, if it pleases the gods.</p>
      <p>I also send a copy of the Pope's privilege, with which he adorned Mr. Planta of Rhaetia and his son, recently returned from Rome, which, if they begin to use, will bring great danger upon themselves. They have long secretly labored over this; finally, it has also reached us through Mr. Paul Gady. Thus, we have reformers of the Plantas of abbeys, priories, bishoprics, and all spiritual jurisdictions in Rhaetia and the Valtellina, both of the Como and Chur dioceses. Our evangelicals snore at all this, who will indeed confirm the Pope's licenses and mandates with their flattery, etc. If you have read and used these abundantly, in your leisure and opportunity, please, sometime return them, so that they may be at hand if it is necessary to make these things public. This is what I had at present for your letters. We await new things in turn from your side of the world.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Karl, Mr. Bonett, and many others greatly congratulate you and your firm health.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from our study, July 17, 1571. Your reverence's most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Josias, Mr. Johannes Wolf, and Mr. Ludwig Lavater, whom we regret has fallen into a fever, be well. May the entire choir of the Zurich church and the school of learned men be well, and especially Mr. Wolfgang Haller, my much esteemed relative.</p>
