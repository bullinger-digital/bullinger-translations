      <p>Greetings and blessings. I am sending you, honorable man and dearest brother, a letter about the Council of Trent that was shared with me. I have received similar news from the city of Venice.</p>
      <p>It is also written from there that the Pope is preparing an army to send to France. This is confirmed by letters sent to me today from Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>I also hear that enemies are gathering from all sides; for it is said that the Duke of Guise deceitfully feigned peace, while in the meantime he was attempting something else. The Bernese have departed with 13 banners; joining them are the people of Valais and Neuch√¢tel.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless and protect them! They are hurrying to be in Lyon by the 21st; I already hear that the city is in great danger. Let us pray to the Lord to have mercy on His people.</p>
      <p>However, you are completely mistaken, my brother.</p>
      <p>No new complaints from our mutual acquaintance have been brought to me; therefore, suspicion does not allow you to judge rightly. I truly affirm to you that he has never written any letters to me against you nor accused you to me. Therefore, you are right to show no sign of an alienated mind towards him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord unite you in true love and remove suspicions, irritability, and whatever hinders harmony from among you. It has been reported to me that a certain nobleman, a follower of Schwenckfeld, has once and again shown some new things that Bullinger supposedly writes to his friends, being curious and a spreader of new things, while he was actually engaged in other duties, etc. Hence, I justly advise you to be careful whom you trust; I do not accuse you of frivolity, but those whom we consider to be upright often disappoint our hopes. Let us diligently pray to the Lord and cry out to Him, that He may have mercy on us and deliver us from evil; for you would not believe how bloody the plans against us are and how secure those are who should be more vigilant. If the Lord watches over us, even the most prepared enemies will not harm us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Matthias, Forer, and all good people. Zurich, July 17, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
