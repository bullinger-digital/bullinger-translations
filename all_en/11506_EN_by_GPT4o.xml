    <p xml:id="regest1">The Jew recommended by the people of Zurich has been gifted by the council; as another preceded him, he returns to Zurich via Basel. The bearer of the letter, a Minorite from Sardinia or Apulia, has turned to the evangelical faith, but does not receive employment in Bern due to lack of language skills and therefore moves on to Zurich or Constance; Bullinger should assist him; in Chur, they might have been able to help him more. The planned reprint of the catechism was temporarily prohibited by the council, as a dispute threatened over whether the changes made after Kaspar [Megander]'s departure should be considered.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>The Jew whom you, Leo, and Megander so highly recommended to me, I have assisted so much with the council that both he and his son are excellently clothed; for each has been given a tunic, trousers, and a robe, along with two gold coins. Since another of his kind had preceded him, who is similarly clothed and supported by the lords' stipend, he has gone to Basel, intending to return to Zurich from there. He also received alms from other good men, amounting, I believe, to three or four gold coins.</p>
      <p>But behold, while I had sent him away after lunch, this Minorite brother came to dinner, who says he was born in Sardinia, but lived for some time in Apulia, where, when he heard discussions about our religion, he desired to experience and imitate it. He has now come directly from Italy. He first sought Bern, perhaps because he hoped to find a place here in the new province where he could extricate himself from monasticism and give his name to the gospel of Christ. But because he does not know the French, Latin, or German languages, the council did not want to receive him, seeing that he would be of no use to us. However, they gave him a gold coin, and Tremp also added a gold coin from the common alms, and so he decided to go to Zurich, and if he cannot stay there, he will proceed to Constance. Therefore, have him recommended to you, and if he intends to go to Constance, recommend him to the brothers there. I truly believe that in Chur, due to the language and proximity to Italy, they could have provided for him more conveniently.</p>
      <p>As for what you ask to be informed about, what is being printed with us: They say our catechism is to be printed; but because a large part wanted it to be printed under the conditions by which it was changed after the departure of our Kaspar, with the other part opposing, the printer was ordered to stop, and I have not yet heard that anything has been decided by the council on this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell, from Bern, February 11, 1541. Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich, from the sacred sermons, dearest brother. Gen Zurich.</p>
