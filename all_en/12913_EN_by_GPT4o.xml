    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Johann Valentin Furtmüller and Anton Zili inform Bullinger that the former pastor of Gais [Balthasar Buol], a great chatterbox who was dismissed because he got drunk daily at the tavern and had to be led or carried home from there, has now been accepted as a preacher in Kesswil (Thurgau). Therefore, they urgently ask Bullinger to effect his dismissal with the [Zurich-born] Thurgau governor [Leonhard Holzhalb], so that he may be sent back to the other side of Lake Constance (where he came from)! He belongs to the St. Gallen chapter, where he is a nuisance to all colleagues. Surely there are pious pastors in Constance who could serve the parish of Kesswil and other church communities well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The good news that Bullinger had conveyed was received with joy. May godlessness finally be defeated and may it not come to an unheard-of tyranny! In a letter from Nuremberg that arrived yesterday, it was stated that after the defeat of Duke Maurice of Saxony at Rochlitz, he was defeated elsewhere by Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony and had to accept a loss of 8000 men. Also, [the bishopric of] Bamberg is said to have been occupied by the troops of the Elector. Undoubtedly, the Franconians prefer the Elector to Emperor Charles V, and the Elector, equipped with good troops, will attack the Emperor, no matter how large his army may be.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Vadian will continue to convey news, and Bullinger should report in detail after the Baden Diet what he was able to learn about it from Johannes Haab, as the St. Galleners will not have an envoy in Baden. Bullinger's last records of the previous Diet were greatly appreciated by the councilors to whom Vadian read them.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. Furtmüller and Anton Zili, our preachers, have urgently requested me these days to write to you about how those from Kesswil in Thurgau have accepted someone to preach who previously spent some time in Gais in the Appenzell region and was eventually dismissed because he lay daily in the tavern, caused much unrest, spoke badly, and became so drunk that he had to be led or carried home; he has no understanding, can talk a lot but has no substance behind it, causes much offense and harm, etc. Therefore, their earnest request to your honor would be: If you could kindly arrange through the governor in Thurgau that he be sent away from there and back across the lake (from where he came). He belongs to the St. Gallen chapter and is a nuisance to all the brothers, and there are surely pious brothers in Constance who could serve the parish of Kesswil and other honorable church communities well with good examples, etc.</p>

      <p>The joyful news you mentioned was certainly received with glad hearts, and we pray to the Lord that godlessness may finally succumb and not succeed in its cruel and unheard-of tyranny. Our people received letters from Nuremberg, which indicate that after the defeat at Rochlitz, Maurice's troops were again routed elsewhere, with a loss of eight thousand horsemen and foot soldiers. It is also reported that Bamberg has been occupied by the Elector's troops, and there is no doubt that the Franconians favor the Elector over Emperor Charles V. It is certain that the Elector, with a well-equipped army, will attack the Emperor's army, no matter how large it may eventually be, etc.</p>

      <p>If there is any news in the future, I will not keep it from you, and I would like to ask you, since we will not have an envoy at the upcoming Diet in Baden, to understand everything that can be entrusted to you from our Johannes Haab after it concludes and to write to me in detail. For your recent records of similar matters, when I read them in the council, were heard with great appreciation for you.</p>

      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 5 days before the calends of April, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the renowned church of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
