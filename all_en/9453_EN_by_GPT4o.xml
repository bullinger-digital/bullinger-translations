      <p>Greetings. Forgive me, venerable lord, for once again being a burden to you, weighed down as you are by old age and other more than sufficient adversities, including poor health.</p>
      <p>There was a preacher, both pious and learned, named Conrad Bischof, who, because of his commitment to truth and courage, suffered not a little from the envy and hatred of the impious and enemies of truth in the Upper League. He endured many hardships and, five years ago, was found dead near the small town of Ilanz, having been attacked and left on the road, not without suspicion of robbery, as the wounds and bruises seemed to clearly testify, especially since he was a man of utmost sobriety.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, his nephew Simon Bischof, the son of his brother, has a son who is believed to be born for learning, with a happy talent and disposition. He wishes to educate him in letters so that he might eventually become a preacher of truth, should God grant his wishes and support his efforts, undeterred by his uncle's adverse fate. Therefore, since he is deprived of the necessary financial support for his plan due to either poverty or a moderate number of children, he asks that, in support of his holy plan, at least daily sustenance be granted to his son through the generosity of the lords there, if it can be conveniently arranged. We would therefore like you, along with Mr. Gwalther and Simler, to recommend him to the lords, as far as it is possible, with the authority you have.</p>
      <p>Your pain and the difficulty with your bladder and urine were perceived by us with as much sorrow as if we were suffering them in our own bodies. May the Lord relieve your pain, restore you, and, once restored to your former integrity, preserve you for a long time yet for His glory.</p>
      <p>We would like Mr. Gwalther and Simler, together with Lavater and Haller, to be greeted in the name of Mr. Tobias and myself through you. Farewell until the coming of the Lord to judgment.</p>
      <p>In haste, as the courier, prepared for the journey, is eager to depart.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 21, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Ulrich Campell.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man of all virtues, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, lord and venerable father, always to be honored with much respect.</p>
