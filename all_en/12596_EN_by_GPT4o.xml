    <p xml:id="regest1">Despite Bullinger's heavy workload, Hochholzer reaches out after a somewhat too long silence. He now intends to write more often.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In short, his affairs are in order. He does not want to waste words on the war rumors (although reliable news about them would be very welcome!), nor on the turbulence in the [Bernese] church, about which Bullinger is well informed. Hopefully, these will end when a suitable successor is chosen for the deceased [Dean] Erasmus Ritter, who will nullify the intrigues of the opponents of truth. Hochholzer will also not dwell on the newly issued ordinance by the Aarau council, prompted by the Zurich council, which requires each individual pastor to sign the Bern Disputation [of 1528], a measure that greatly annoys the pastors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- A few weeks ago, Johannes Wäber wanted to travel to Zurich to find out if there were tensions among the pastors there. This is claimed by Beat [Gering] in Bern, to portray the discord there as normal. When Wäber arrived in Aarau on his journey, he inquired about this from Hochholzer. Hochholzer made it clear to him that Gering's claim was false and that there was harmony in religious matters in Zurich; indeed, when he had doubts about it some time ago, he was able to convince himself of it in Zurich. Consequently, Wäber decided to abandon his journey and return home. However, he tasked Hochholzer with greeting Bullinger and the other colleagues and informing them of the problem with Gering, in case Theodor [Bibliander] wanted to write to Gering or someone else to stop these rumors. Gering claims that Bibliander thinks differently about God's providence than his other colleagues. But Bullinger should do what seems best to him, especially since it is not certain that such admonitions will have any effect on those who even act against their own conscience!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- There are examples in the Holy Scripture for the commendable institution of public Friday prayers in Zurich. In Aarau, people are also eagerly called to prayer, but unfortunately, the number of participants is decreasing rather than increasing. For just as [the quarrelsome] Theon claims, some detractors argue that the prescribed and ordained prayers promote hypocrisy, although it is a good thing that prayers are being said at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Yesterday, [Klein-Anna], the daughter of the [Zurich] treasurer [Heinrich Rahn], was married to the noble, bloodthirsty [Wilhelm Frölich from Riesbach]. She was escorted home by his murderous drinking companions. Many are astonished by this union. But like attracts like!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings to the colleagues. Greetings from Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Although I know that you scarcely have time to attend to your own affairs, venerable father, I could not delay the interval between my letters any longer, as even this seems too long. For I am fully convinced that I should greet you more often with my letters.</p>

      <p>But, to be brief, I will say nothing now about my affairs, which are in good order, praise be to God. Nor will I write about the war rumors, which are many and varied, yet uncertain and mostly false (though it would be very welcome to receive something certain about them). Nor is it permissible to dwell on the calamity and turmoil of our churches, which I know are well known to you, and for which we hope there will soon be an end or some resolution, as a third of our bishops is now to be elected in place of the late Erasmus Ritter, of blessed memory, a faithful minister of Christ, who will break the efforts of those who oppose the truth. Furthermore, since our most prudent council, after the exhortation of your council, compels each church minister to subscribe to the conclusions of the Bern Disputation (which greatly annoys them), all these things must now be omitted, and a few other things, which I wish to convey, must be mentioned.</p>

      <p>Master Johannes Wäber was with us in Aarau a few weeks ago, intending to travel to Zurich for two main reasons: to visit and greet brothers and friends amicably, and to find out whether there was any discord or disagreement among the Zurich brothers, as Beat Gering in Bern often claimed, so that their discord would be less harmful to the lovers of truth themselves, since there were no less dissensions in other churches. Therefore, when he asked me about these matters, I completely removed this concern from his mind, as I affirmed that Gering falsely claimed discord among the Zurich people, and I taught that all were united, especially in matters of religion. For I myself was not a little concerned before I recently came to Zurich. Having learned this, he changed his mind, as he already knew what he wanted to find out, and moreover, the shortness of time scarcely allowed it. He therefore instructed me to greet your humanity in his name, along with the other beloved lords and brothers, and to inform you about Gering, in case Master Theodor (whom Gering boasts about the most, claiming that he thinks differently about the providence and predestination of God than the others) writes something to Gering or someone else, to prevent false claims about the Zurich people. I wanted to signify this. You should do what seems best to you. They are wicked, and I do not know whether warnings or threats will have any effect on such people, who do not fear to resist the truth against their own conscience. It cannot be prevented that the wicked proclaim as already done the things they wish to be done; we will leave them to their own judgment.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I also hear that during this dangerous and turbulent time, public prayers have been proclaimed on Fridays among you, which I indeed approve. For it is not without examples from the Holy Scriptures. We also urge diligently. However, we do not progress so much, as our gatherings decrease more than they increase. The wickedness of men is great, and it is so arranged that men will do nothing good; and what they see done well by others, they mock and bite with more than Theonian teeth. For they say that the prayers are forced, bound to place and time, to hypocrisy. I judge it better that there are at least some prayers than none at all. For there is an infinite number of the pious scattered here and there, whose prayers the Lord will certainly hear. I fear that all kinds of misfortune stand at the door, unless the Lord does not wish to repay us according to our merits, but according to His abundant and infinite mercy. I do not wish to burden you with more.</p>

      <p>The bride, the daughter of your treasurer, was escorted to the noble and bloodthirsty soldier and Cainite by his excellent drinking companions. Many are astonished that she was placed in this marriage. However, it is not surprising to me. Like attracts like (if I am not mistaken).</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet all your people in my name, and also the other beloved lords and brothers. My wife greets you. Farewell in the Lord and always keep me recommended to you as before. Aarau, August 25, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his lord, to be greatly revered as a father.</p>
