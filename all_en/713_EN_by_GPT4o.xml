      <p>Greetings. Although the courier is pressing and grants me little time to write, I did not want to send our old friend Robert Estienne to you without a letter from me. The bundle of letters you recently sent to me, I diligently and safely ensured was delivered to Calvin, and I do not doubt that he has responded through this courier. Your labor and effort towards mutual agreement and the peace and reconciliation of the churches will be most welcome and fruitful for all churches. You can hardly believe how all the pious men among us leap for joy, and how this hammer crushes the heads of our adversaries of all concord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve you unharmed for a long time for His church, and may He continually grant a happier outcome to your pious labors and success to your endeavors.</p>
      <p>It is hardly believable how much your letters have delighted me and all my brothers. They greet you and all your fellow ministers most dutifully. Your young men will be our care. We have not fulfilled what they testified among you. But daily, we will strive to repair what has been lacking until now. Our schools are increasing daily in the number of learned men and scholars. The greatest hope of more abundant progress shines from all sides.</p>
      <p>There remains only one thing that diminishes and even disturbs the greatest part of the joy we had conceived in the midst of pleasures, of which this hope of ours for future concord among the churches had already given us the sweetest taste. And would that it were of such a kind that we might seem to grieve and complain in vain. But the matter is of such importance that, if this opinion persists, it will bring great sorrow to all the pious and to those skilled in the administration of the churches among us. Behold, while we begin to gather our almost broken and collapsed strength from such bitter mourning of the church, and to gird ourselves more diligently for the building of the church, that very thing is taken from us which was almost the only thing left, which seemed to have some form of the old church, and that kind of exercise, than which nothing more useful or more necessary could be devised for our churches, whatever others may judge. We speak from experience. Let others see that they do not judge of a matter unknown. It does not seem that things which were established long ago for very grave reasons, and confirmed until now by the authority of all synods and the consent of the magistrate, should be easily removed by the counsel of a few. If there are those who have abused the best institution, let them be corrected and pay the penalty for their obstinacy, not the whole church.</p>
      <p>But if all things are to be removed which wicked men sometimes abuse, what will be so sacred that it will not be necessary to abolish it?</p>
      <p>The matter certainly required the grave and serious consultation of the whole church. With what mind do you think all the brothers can bear this way of acting? They will not resist necessity too stubbornly, but let them see what account they will render to God, the authors of this counsel. We do not doubt that the pious senate has regarded only the glory of God, and the peace and concord of the churches: but since it concerned all the churches, and a holy custom long received and approved for so long, the counsels of others, whose matter was being dealt with, who are daily engaged in the present matter, should not have been despised by those who were consulted. For I do not doubt that something far different would have been seen if the reasons which we can truly and with a good conscience put forward had been heard. But since we are going to write more fully about these things elsewhere, and to handle this cause more diligently, I will not add more now. I only wish to ask you at present, in the name of the brothers, to intercede with the ministers of the Bernese church, that they may not oppose our efforts but favor them. For I hope that the classes will intercede in their own name, unless I am very mistaken, because all good men are very moved. But all things will be conducted with the utmost moderation from the word of God, to which we do not suspect those who have always favored it most earnestly will resist.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. This pious man who is with Robert Estienne asked me to commend to you these two young men whom he has with him there. Which indeed I would do diligently, unless I thought they were sufficiently commended to you by Master Calvin. Meanwhile, I beg you to forgive me if I have written more freely, and dealt more familiarly with you, into whose bosom I pour out my whole self. When you know more exactly the causes of our complaints, I am sure you will not wonder that we complain, but rather if it had been done otherwise. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, October 19, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
