      <p>S. D. It is as you write, my most learned and esteemed Bullinger, that after those letters which I sent to you on July 23, 1572, I have not addressed you with letters in the meantime. The reason for such a long silence was that when you informed me in your letter dated August 15 of the previous year that you had received well and would write to me your judgment on those two booklets about the matter of the Holy Lord's Supper written in German and sent to you by me, I thought it necessary to wait for that and not to trouble you, already more than busy, with my untimely letters before you had sent it. For I feared that I might seem to want to extort that judgment from you more importunately if I had asked for what you promised to be fulfilled for me before the time. Therefore, I ask you again and again to consider me excused for my silence and to write to me as soon as possible your promised judgment on those booklets I mentioned, as much as your ecclesiastical labors and frequent occupations will allow; for I am eagerly awaiting it. I received your judgment on the Dresden Consensus along with your letter dated August 15 of the previous year, as well as the image of a certain miraculous and unusual rye that grew in a cemetery of the Rhaetians, and I thank you for sharing these with me. All who saw that image were greatly amazed. However, I did not see any booklet published by you, which you wrote you sent together; you did indeed send two booklets before, one about the coming of our Lord to judgment, the other addressed to all ministers of the word of God and churches against the desire for quarreling, published by you, and I informed you that I received these in my letter dated July 23, 1572, and I thanked you for them. That you are concerned about my affairs and are anxious lest they are not well, I recognize in this your singular love and benevolence towards me, and for this, as I ought, I indeed have and give you the greatest thanks. I, indeed, by the grace of God, enjoy both good health and all favorable circumstances with all mine, and I wish in turn from the heart that all things may prosper and succeed according to your wishes for you and yours, and may God, the best and greatest, preserve you safe and sound for us and the entire republic for as long as possible, so that you may not only complete the tract on the persecutions of the Catholic Church of Christ from the apostles to our times and on the causes of persecutions and the end and punishments of all persecutors (which I understand you have at hand), but also be of use and benefit to the Church of Christ for many more years, both privately by teaching and publicly by your learned writings and publications. Truly prodigious are the things, if constant rumor is to be believed, which have been written to us here about the nefarious and parricidal massacre in France against the admiral and his associates, perpetrated against given faith and royal oath, and about the enormity of the killings and punishments, to which the faithful in France are still subjected daily, brought by the letters and conversations of many, but much more prodigious is that neither the king of unheard-of perfidy nor his ministers, flatterers, sycophants, and the most impure of ass-kissers, are ashamed of their extreme audacity and impudence, who do not only excuse such a crime but do not hesitate to extol their perfidious and bloodthirsty king to the heavens with praises. It is indeed a wonder if God allows such brazen impudence and monstrous security, lust, and license in such a flagitious and abominable crime to go unpunished. But perhaps these furies of the devil are reserved to be punished only with eternal destruction and torments, and since the devil undoubtedly understands that his judgment is imminent, it is certain that he rages more savagely and attempts and contrives the utmost. May the Lord restrain him with his instruments and grant peace to his church, and if it will be less possible to enjoy this, may he grant patience and constancy amid persecutions! I have nothing new to write to you. It is written from the court that our emperor, although afflicted with a severe illness, has now been restored to his former health. In Poland, the dispute over electing a new king seems likely to cause new disturbances. There is also a rumor that the emperor of the Turks, because the brother of the king of France was rejected, whom he had in vain tried to persuade them to demand as king with promises and threats, is about to attack the Poles with war and already has a very numerous army enlisted. There are also those who think that the comet seen this past winter in the sign of Cassiopeia portends other calamities. May God, the best and greatest, mercifully avert impending evils from us according to his kindness and pour out his wrath on the nations that do not know him and on the kingdoms that have not called upon his name! May he also protect you and all yours forever! For the health which Wolfgang Haller, your provost, and also your other colleagues have imparted to me, I ask you to thank them in my name and in turn greet them most dutifully with my words.</p>
      <p>Amberg, March 10, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Wolfgang Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, distinguished in piety, doctrine, and judgment, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
