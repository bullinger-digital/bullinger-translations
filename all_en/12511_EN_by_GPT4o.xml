    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich surely has a reason for his silence regarding Bullinger's last letter [not received]. Nevertheless, Bullinger writes to him [again]. The Bishop of Lund and Constance [Johann von Weeze] caused some trouble for a few weeks in the Five Places and then came to Zurich for half a day. On the orders of the authorities, some councilors sat with him not as a bishop, but as an imperial prince at the table. However, they kept [expenses and costs] very low. He wanted to give the impression that he was not entirely satisfied with King [Ferdinand] and Emperor [Charles V]. The wisest, however, consider this a deception and think that he has persuaded the Five Places to refuse their support to the imperial cities in the likely upcoming war against the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The people of Augsburg should not trust the scheming Emperor! There is talk of musters in the Bishopric of Augsburg and troop gatherings of Spaniards and Italians in Füssen, allegedly destined for Portugal.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Many Confederates are well-disposed towards the people of Augsburg, the Gospel, and the Empire, even if the Five Places will likely stand on the side of the Pope [Paul III]. The Empire and the [Schmalkaldic] League should timely seek to recruit mercenaries in the Confederation via Constance and also provide for their pay. For this, they could use the close connections of the war-experienced Wernli Schlosser from Schaffhausen to the Confederate captains as well as the contacts of the people of Constance. If the [Schmalkaldic] League secures the services of the Confederate mercenaries first, the authorities [of the Confederates] would not allow musters against them, and thus the Emperor's plan would also be thwarted. He would even have to fear that the Confederates might march against him. But if they wait too long, the [Confederate] troops will run to the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger wrote this in haste and at night. Frölich should keep Bullinger's name confidential. If the League wants to present to the Confederates the danger posed by the Emperor to them, Cologne, Saxony, and Hesse, they should campaign as they did last Easter; they will surely find support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to [Hans] Welser, [Jakob] Herbot, [Johannes] Haller, and [Michael] Keller.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. Dear lord and brother, I assume there must be a reason why you have not yet responded to my latest letter. Nevertheless, I cannot refrain from informing you that the Bishop of Lund, known as the Bishop of Constance, has been in the Five Places of the Confederation for several days or weeks, where he has confirmed and caused much trouble. Recently, he passed through Zurich and stayed for no more than half a day. He never left the inn. Some councilors dined with him, as arranged by the authorities, not as with a bishop, but as he is regarded, as a prince of the empire. However, they kept everything as simple as possible. He gave the impression that he was not well-disposed towards the King and Emperor, etc. Moreover, many pious people and the wisest consider it all to be deceit, and they believe he has arranged his intrigue in the Five Places so that they will not assist the imperial cities against the Emperor, as it is eventually believed that the Emperor will not leave Germany unchallenged.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If you would like to notice something about this, dear, do not overlook it. Do not trust the Emperor too much. I fear he has strong intrigues and they are false. If he is to muster his servants in the Bishopric of Augsburg, Spaniards and Italians are supposed to come to Füssen. Although he says it is about Portugal, there is a deception to be feared. But be brave and unafraid in the Lord, watch and pray; make sure that you are also prepared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Among the Confederates, you still have many good friends who are well-disposed towards the Gospel and the Empire, although I fear many of the Five Places will fall to and side with the Pope. It would be good if the Empire and the League would timely make their acquaintance through Constance in the Confederation for mercenaries, as you will eventually need money and pay for them. There is an old man who can wage war, in Schaffhausen. His name is Wernher or Wernli Schlosser. He is not unfavorably disposed towards the Gospel. He has connections with all the leaders in the Confederation. If he were taken in hand in good time, and some with him, who could well inform the people of Constance, and they made their arrangements in cities and lands, you would draw the better hope to you. I show you this in very good trust, so that you know how to act in times of need; for looking at the situation, the Emperor's plan has nothing good in mind. If then the common mercenaries from the Confederation, who are accustomed to war, were paid and arranged by you, the authorities in the land would certainly not draw against you or anyone else. And thus a plan would be broken for the Emperor and the bishops. He would then have to fear the authorities in the Confederation, they would also draw against him. But if you were to make arrangements that the troops all fall upon the opposition according to the pay, they would have so much more courage, although it can also happen that God overthrows it. We would like to pray that He may be gracious to us, dead and alive.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I wrote this in haste by night. You can use it well for good, if you know that it is good and brings benefit. However, do not mention my name. It would also be good if the matter, that the Emperor unfriendly with you, Cologne, Saxony, Hesse wants to undertake, should break upon us, that you turn to the Confederates, as happened last Easter. You will always find good friends and supporters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>God be with you and yours. Greet both mayors W. and H.b., also Haller, Keller, etc. In haste, 18th June 1546. Whom you know well.</p>
      <p>To the pious, prudent, and wise Georg Frölich, city clerk in Augsburg, his dear lord.</p>
