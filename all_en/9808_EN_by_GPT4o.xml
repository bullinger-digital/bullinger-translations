      <p>S. Through your men Zoller and Aescher, who recently brought Condé here, I have written nothing; for they were so occupied with the prince and others that I scarcely had the opportunity to speak with them. However, I believe they have orally conveyed to you whatever they heard from our lords. They think Condé will stay in Geneva for some time to closely observe the affairs of France and assist them as much as he can. They say he has been elected as the supreme captain by the public consensus of our people, but with designated advisors whose industry will manage affairs. Many have high hopes; I, however, think things have never been worse. The king resides in Lyon and, as I hear, has divided his forces into three parts: one to Dauphiné, another to Provence, and the third to Narbonne Gaul. Of those who went to Dauphiné, they say six hundred were slain near Nona, a moderately fortified town held by our people; the king is concealing this defeat and redirecting his forces elsewhere; our people are so spirited that they trust they will be safe in each small town, also collecting money from everywhere and receiving all royal revenues they can acquire, so that even the people of Avignon and Toulouse now pay them tribute to be safe from them. These beginnings are promising; but I fear the outcome, which, however, God holds in His hand; may He arrange everything for His glory. It is written from Lyon (I sell you all this at the price I bought it) that the Duke of Savoy spent up to a hundred thousand crowns for the king during his passage; for he was received everywhere in his domain for free with all his retinue; the king, in return, promised him golden mountains and especially two cities in Piedmont or the Marquisate of Saluzzo, which he still held. Meanwhile, the king allowed the duke to live in Lyon at his own expense and did not provide him with anything special; indeed, it is written for certain that the Duchess of Turin met the king; but immediately, as her husband departed with the king, she fell ill, having apparently taken poison, so that before he could return from Lyon, where he was immediately summoned, she, along with her son, was dead, and on that journey or return, the duke himself was also seized with a similar illness, so that many believe he too will perish, so that this duchy, along with our three prefectures returned, will revert to the king; for they say it was agreed in the marriage contract of the duke and his wife that if they die without children, it should be so. These are now the rumors being spread here, to which I attribute as much as I can. However, Lord Chandée writes thus, and similar things have been written to some of our people. These are the things that occur now. The lords consuls send you many greetings, as do La Vallaeus and the Andelots together with Mr. Gracili and Merlin. I think they will depart for Iferdun before winter and spend the winter there.</p>
      <p>Your brothers and fellow ministers also greet you. Greet all yours in my name as well.</p>
      <p>For what reason this messenger is sent, I do not yet know. In Bern on the day of Michaelmas in the evening 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, my dear lord, relative, and godfather.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
