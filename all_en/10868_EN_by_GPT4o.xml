      <p>He sends his best regards.</p>
      <p>Honorable, highly learned sir, my particularly dear brother, Mr. Bartholom채us, pastor in Walchenhofen, has shown me some of your sent letters and writings, from which I have received great admiration for your humanity and have been reminded that you are a special patron (of all good-hearted people and those who, through the grace of God, find favor in His word and bear secret compassion), and it is easy to recognize that you are a man of all honor and praiseworthiness and a lover of divine and human arts (sciences). Therefore, I have not dared, out of presumption and foolishness, to make acquaintance with such an honorable man through my writings and living spirit (though dead letters). However, since (according to the opinion of the divine Paul) true brotherly love is shown in the performance of works and every Christian person is obliged to show it to another, I have not hesitated to address you, my wise one, like the Parthians with empty hands, without gifts, though useless and small, through which I desire to eternally imprint myself with you and all the faithful. Such a gift, I speak of a sundial (horologio sciothericon), in the old manner of my handiwork, as I am currently unable to offer a better one, I ask you to kindly accept, as I sincerely mean it, from your friend, recognizing the intention behind the work, for the poor poet gives his poem; and if I see that you accept this from me, I will be encouraged to send another and more in the future. I have not withheld my confidential opinion from you, to whom I fully submit myself in service, and have entrusted this to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in F체ssen, the 24th of May, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Martin Furtenbach, city scribe in F체ssen.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher and servant of the community and church of God in Zurich, my gracious lord and special patron, to his hands.</p>
