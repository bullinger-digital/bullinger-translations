    <p xml:id="regest1">Has learned concerning matters from Paris and asks Bullinger, as a recognized champion of the truth, to oppose the danger. Bucer and Melanchthon are said to have ingratiated themselves with the French King [Francis I] to obtain an opportunity for a disputation with Parisian theologians; they have already been assured safe conduct, albeit on the condition that they do not oppose the Pope. Meanwhile, they are said to have sought advice from [Johannes] Sturm, whose response is unknown to Brunner. In Paris, there is fear of secret machinations given the unjust premises for the conversation. Since nothing is more necessary than an open fight for the truth, such a convention of sophists could bring more harm than benefit. Fears that Bucer and Melanchthon are pursuing self-serving purposes and may fall into the trap of the Papists. In Paris, it is said that if Melanchthon and Bucer only want to come to defend the Lutheran Mass, instead of fighting against superstition without any reservations, they should better save the trip and let the papist Mass remain. Asks Bullinger to oppose the dangerous undertaking. Is ready to deliver to him the letter that Jakob Avienus [Vogel] has translated from French.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Candid and most distinguished man, certain new and indeed not fabricated, but perhaps most inauspicious matters have been communicated to us from Paris on the 18th of August by a pious and sincere man; I have deemed it worthwhile to transmit the same to your humanity. With these things known, you can defend against the impious efforts and untimely plans of certain individuals more maturely and happily, since indeed all the pious, good, and learned have delegated this task to you, that you, foreseeing the doctrines devised and erected to the detriment and harm of the Christian republic, as a vigorous defender of the truth, should earnestly strive to attack and eliminate them. In this duty, you have hitherto performed quite skillfully and with good auspices.</p>
      <p>But to approach the matter, the summary of the new things, which among other things I had deemed worthy for you to know, is this: for some time now, Bucer and Melanchthon have ingratiated themselves with the favor of the King of the French by different means, especially with the grace that they might be given the opportunity to dispute and discuss the essence of our religion with the Parisian rabbis and theologians (having obtained this, they promised themselves that altercations, insults, and contentions for sacred matters could not be better and more easily terminated by any other means or remedy). Now, having achieved their desires and obtained letters of safe conduct, they are well assured; a safe and free passage is now open to them, yet on the condition that they leave the Roman Pope with his seat of impiety, the cesspool of ceremonies and lies, untouched, indeed not even allowed to condemn or attack him with a word. Meanwhile, having taken a delay on this matter, they have written to Sturm - a man, as they say, good - anxiously requesting his advice, that he may consult them amicably and sincerely in this matter and inform them of his counsel as soon as possible. What Sturm has advised or written to them about this, has not been revealed to me. But in my judgment, having carefully weighed the conditions, I would have conjectured that not much deliberation and consultation was needed in this matter, since anyone with little prudence, having rightly inspected and weighed the conditions and exceptions of the safe conduct, could advise what should be done in this matter.</p>
      <p>The letters indicated that this action was pleasing to few pious people in Paris for the very reason that they fear clandestine practices and plots, confessing that this business is not without suspicion, since the disputation is admitted under prescribed unjust laws and the royal safe conduct is sanctioned with conditions, namely that it is not allowed to drag out, explode, or convict the Pope in his nonsense, decrees, and lies of falsehood.</p>
      <p>What kind of meeting is this going to be, when it is not allowed to freely advocate for the truth in every respect? Perhaps a discussion about trivial matters with the rabbis is going to take place. For nothing will be more necessary at this time than to overcome and refute the Pope of deplorable malignity, the obstinacy and error of heretics and unbelievers. For the church suffers no enemies as much as the papists, who always oppose the truth and meditate on its downfall day and night. If it will not be free to defend and conquer them with the arms of the sacred scriptures and to dispute about all the articles of our faith, I would indeed affirm in my judgment that this convention of sophists will bring more harm than benefit to the Christian cause, and be as fruitful for the church as the papist councils of old, which were always (as is clear to all) conducted under these laws, so that the papacy with its decrees and fabrications would remain in force inviolate, and no one was ever freely entrusted to attack the now manifest impiety without ejaculation and to struggle against impostures.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if Martin and Melanchthon, having first read the conditions of the safe conduct, nevertheless promote the journey, I frankly confess that I do not at all approve of their foolish undertaking, because no pious person can be led to hope that any good fruit will come from this matter. I fear not a little that they may perhaps be more eager for their own praise and advantage than for Christ, even to the point of being more blind than moles, going along with the opinions of the sophists and papists, with the truth set aside. This is also feared and lamented by many men of proven integrity in Paris with these words: If Melanchthon and Bucer intend to come here for no other reason than to establish the Lutheran Mass with its fictitious ceremonies, and do not have in their wishes to treat everything according to the truth and rule of the word of God without any exception and prescribed human laws, and to reform and eliminate all superstition and error whether of the Pope or of other arrogant people, indeed if they acquiesce to the aforementioned conditions, they confess that it would be better and more advantageous to let the papist Mass with its ceremonies remain at home for a long journey.</p>
      <p>Since we clearly see that this business tends to the danger of the gospel and truth, therefore, most humane man, make sure to oppose this endeavor with all your might and to hinder their undertaking with word and deed. Always also take care not to allow it to be seen anywhere that you have failed in your duty. But what should be done in this matter, I think you have more than enough insight. For thus my mind stands: Whatever presumes to oppose the faithful will be suppressed by the mighty hand of God. Even if the most powerful kingdoms have risen against the word of God, they will be overthrown by the strength of divine truth and virtue.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>From Glarus, on the last day of August 1535.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, ensure that He preserves you for a long time for the benefit of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell and count your Fridolin among your clients, who will yield to no one in love, zeal, and duty.</p>
      <p>The letters sent from Paris were written in the French language, but Jakob Avienus, a man of great promise, who is skilled in the French language, interpreted them for me. If you therefore wish for the letters themselves, they can be transmitted. For I would have written to you longer if it were always possible to find a trustworthy messenger, whom it would be safe to burden with letters.</p>
      <p>Fridolinus Fonteius Glareanus.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in the cathedral of Zurich, to his very gracious lord at hand.</p>
