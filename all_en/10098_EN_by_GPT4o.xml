      <p>Greetings. I have learned from the messenger of our city that you have not yet received my letters from your Walther, most esteemed brother. You are entirely engaged in reconciling both cities, as am I and many other thoughtful men. But I do not see by what means or methods this can be achieved, except that I hear it might finally be possible through RÃ¶sti via the people of Basel. Some of ours have written there. I have heard nothing about the response. Megander, it seems, has taken on this task, although he does not share all his plans with me. He sent his own messenger to you without my knowledge, but for what reason, I do not know. What I think, I will more easily keep silent. I am simple and open. I wish others, with whom I must deal, were the same. Therefore, you have a reason why I have not replied to your two letters except through Walther. If only whoever acts would act most successfully, so that the discord between the cities, where each almost disdains to address the other, would be removed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I would like you to inform me as soon as you can what this means, which Capito indicated in two letters, namely that Megander is to be recalled to you in his province, whether this is at hand and whether your people desire it or he himself. In any case, he is otherwise a good man, learned and pious, but I would wish that if he did not want to stay with us, he would indicate it. For it matters not a little who succeeds him. Oh, if only it were he whom you know best!</p>
      <p>Leo wrote about the money collected by the brothers sent to you. He made no mention of yours, and I do not know what he is finally planning, since we, who should be one, thus neglect each other in turn. Letters are often written to us, but no one writes to me except the pious Pelikan and you. Therefore, you do not judge wrongly that I have not replied immediately. I seemed to myself that others had taken on this province, whom I also easily admit act more successfully, provided they would sometimes make me aware of their plans. In summary: I depend on you, dearest brother; whatever you command, I am ready, which I also expect from you. Write most amicably to the questor Tilmann about the concord of the cities, for you can do everything with the man, similarly to Peter Imm Hag, Jacob Wagner, who know you best.</p>
      <p>Froschauer sent two pages about the office of the prophet, intending to send the rest soon, as well as the beginnings of Pelikan's works, which delight the brothers in a wonderful way. If only they would appear sooner. In the meantime, do not neglect me regarding what seems to be taught about the method of studies and predestination. The printer promised annotations on your letters to John. If only I had them for Hebrews immediately.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, and pursue with increasing love the one whom you have begun to love.</p>
      <p>February 28, in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich. To Zurich.</p>
