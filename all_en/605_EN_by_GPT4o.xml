      <p>S. On the feast of Bartholomew, delegates from the six cantons will come to us to resolve the disputes and conflicts that have arisen between us and the abbot, either through negotiation or by law itself. It is unbelievable what unfair and absurd demands he imposes on us, whom we will prove to have brazenly shown his true colors. But in the meantime, it is to be feared that the shameless harlot might perhaps win favor for herself with that potion of bribes (for you know the character and customs of our age).</p>
      <p>You must strive to ensure that we have a man from your side whose wisdom and authority can command respect among the other delegates.</p>
      <p>We desire nothing else than to act against the hateful and envious machinations of those who, against all fairness and not without contempt, intend to deceive us and to increase their own welfare at the expense of ours, etc., only in matters where we have clear justification and right; we wish to gain nothing that we do not already have, desiring only to remain with what we have long possessed. Therefore, be vigilant and show yourself in this urgent matter of our public affairs as you have always done. I would wish for Master Lavater to be present, so that I could personally and directly administer the care for alleviating the illness, as I promised. Farewell and keep what I share with you in great confidence.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, July 27, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
