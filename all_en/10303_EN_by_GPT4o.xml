    <p xml:id="regest1">In the confusion left by Zwingli's death, which also spread various rumors in Zittau, he has once again read the works of Zwingli and Oecolampadius and drawn strength from them. In Prague, at Konrad von Krajek's place, he came across Bullinger's «De prophetae officio». He thanks for a book sent by Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>After the unfortunate Mars, by which the man of holy memory, Ulrich Zwingli, was taken from our midst, there was little hope among our people that anyone would dare to publicly profess his doctrine, especially concerning the Eucharist. Many of my brothers - for they knew I adhered most fervently to his writings - began to call me an errant sheep, as if because the pastor had miserably perished, whose death indeed brought great sorrow to many here. Regarding the cause of his death, as is usual, there were various opinions, but mostly false, and since I could hardly stand alone against such a crowd, I began to silently reread all the writings of both Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius, a man of incomparable worth, diligently at home. Finally aided by these silent teachers, I did not greatly fear the onslaught of adversaries, who prefer to interpret everything sinisterly rather than rightly.</p>
      <p>Later, when I was acting as a legate of our republic among the people of Prague in the year 1532, in the month of May, I happened upon the house of a certain Baron Konrad von Krajek, also a very close friend of mine, who greatly delights in your writings, especially the German ones. When he had received some books from a bookseller to give to his son Ernst, who also takes pleasure in Latin literature, behold, as if by divine providence, I found among them your truly Christian booklet «On the Prophetic Office». I immediately approached the bookseller. I asked if he had more copies. He said he had only had two and they were already sold, nor had he seen more at the Leipzig fairs. Again, I approached my baron. I asked if I might use this booklet of yours for a few days, as none could be found among the booksellers. Not only did he agree, but he also gave me the booklet as a gift, promising to give more if I asked, which he did not infrequently. For he is most observant of evangelical truth and uniquely embraces your assertion, indeed the doctrine of Christ and the apostles concerning the Lord's Supper. It cannot be expressed how much enthusiasm your booklet has inspired in me and my brothers, who publicly share my views on this matter. I dare not write, most learned Bullinger, how much we have benefited from your booklet, and this by the grace of God. I do not know by what fate it happens that even with the opposition of enemies, the books from Zurich are brought to us.</p>
      <p>We give you perpetual thanks for the book sent to us as a symbol of friendship. If only it were possible to return the favor equally! In the meantime, please accept the goodwill and readiness of our minds; other brothers, who are partly in other cities, will also be consoled by it. The distinguished men in this city, Wenceslaus Lankisch, judge of our republic, Friedrich Vigant, a Swiss by nation, a man of senatorial rank, Caspar Gettel, Onofrius Herzog, Caelestinus Hennig, and many others greet you and your fellow soldiers. I dedicate, devote, and surrender myself entirely to you and the brothers in Zurich. Farewell most happily in Christ, most Christian man, and pray for us.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau in the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia, on the 13th of October in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, Master etc. of letters.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God of the Zurich church, his dear friend and brother.</p>
