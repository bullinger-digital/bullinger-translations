      <p>S. Myconius wants to write to you about the rather happy outcome of the war. He promised me that he would do so. Six servants of the Spanish bishop were captured in the Solothurn area. They did not want to pay their host in our region. Afterwards, they stabbed two carters on the road because they would not yield to them, causing much trouble. Then the peasants rose up, gathered together, captured them, and took them to Gösgen Castle, which belongs to Solothurn.</p>
      <p>What will be done with them will soon be heard. What do you hear about the Valaisians? There is a rumor that they are in great discord; however, the cause is unknown. If you have any certain information about this matter, please let me know.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, parish priest in Zurich, my kind, dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
