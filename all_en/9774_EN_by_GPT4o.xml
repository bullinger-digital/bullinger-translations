      <p>S. I received all your letters, dear brother, including your apology, and later also the story of the fire, good God, how mournful. It certainly brought tears to my eyes. But what has ever been more disastrous than the destruction of Jerusalem by Emperor Titus? But you are not unaware of what profane men have judged about it from history; hence, there is no reason to wonder that the judgments of some profane men are so far from the truth. May the Lord enlighten the minds of all, so that they may recognize the true causes of calamities and turn to God!</p>
      <p>I did not clearly understand whether I should have returned the Latin history to you, so that you could send it to Lentulus; if that is your opinion, I will not delay returning it to you in eight days.</p>
      <p>You will greet Mr. Lentulus very kindly and diligently and thank him for the efforts he has made for us. I also thank you for that diligent description. I have communicated everything I received from you to Mr. Haller as you wished, as I usually do. You will forgive me if I am brief; for that illness of mine torments me so much that I am almost useless to myself and to everyone, and these days Mr. Thretius has come from Poland through Germany, laden with letters. He leaves today; I am forced to respond to each and every letter. Now the Frankfurt fair is approaching; therefore, I must write to England and respond to the letters received at the last market, and write to many other places. Meanwhile, domestic affairs distract me, and I am overwhelmed with business. Here was Bellevre from Poland, the king's envoy; he discussed many things, and the four republics have decided to send envoys to the new king in France to obtain peace, but it is not yet certain when the legation will be sent. - Sad news is brought from Saxony and not very joyful from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that he may deign to preserve his churches and console and preserve the ministers. Nothing certain from Belgium. - It is said by some that Chur intends to urge our lords for a loan of 20,000 guilders or more or less. If that were the case, then be careful that it does not happen; for at this time many have been approached for loans, but have been refused. It is up to my lords' territory, especially those hit by hail, to help my lords, but it cannot be done as needed; for it is not available, and it cannot and may not be done. What is from the monasteries, the greedy beggars devour, and such a significant cost goes over the city that we ourselves hardly know where from; that I trust you and do not bet that it would become public. But be careful that no request is made; for the refusal would bring displeasure.</p>
      <p>An honorable donation has been made with the 200 bushels of grain; all this would not be counted if the loan were refused, and if we had more resources at this time, it would have been done willingly, etc. Greet both my lords, the mayor, Mr. Karl, Mr. Viktor, Bonet, Pontisel, and Comander, who are here; God willing, we would have comforted them well. Johannes Baptista Müller, a sick but capable man, is coming up; let him be entrusted to you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you and your household and all our friends. August 20, 1574.</p>
      <p>Bullinger. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
