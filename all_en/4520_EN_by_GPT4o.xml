      <p>Greetings. Junker Niklaus rode to Baden in the morning, as your letter arrived in the afternoon, which is why he was not there. However, I went to the chancellery in the evening to see if it could be sent to him. I have received Philipp's judgment and thank you kindly for it.</p>
      <p>We are now waiting every day to hear what comes from Baden. May God send everything for good and peace!</p>
      <p>From France, we hear nothing special, except that two prominent gentlemen came to Geneva on foot these days and barely escaped. It is said that many people are secretly being executed and drowned.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Unterwalden church fair, I assume you know more than we do. As for Junker Niklaus, I assume you will hear other things. The Lord be with you!</p>
      <p>Given in Bern in haste, with my messenger waiting, on the feast of Simon and Jude 1560. Johannes Haller, yours.</p>
