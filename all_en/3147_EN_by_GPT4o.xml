      <p>Greetings. The person you recommended to me, both in your name and in Sulzer's, I listened to carefully. Immediately, I saw that he was not suitable for our regions; however, so that he would not suspect me of acting less fraternally or unwilling to try everything for your sake, I sent him to places that do not have pastors but need them, and which speak German and Romansh, with my letters added, as I knew he needed. He went, preached; yet he was not accepted. Indeed, there are places among us lacking preachers; but they cannot be served unless they speak Romansh. You can ask him about my faith and diligence for your sake as well.</p>
      <p>On this very day, leading men from the communities around the city came to me, asserting that for four days now, after six in the morning, they have seen two suns, one the usual and true one, the other smaller and following the legitimate one; they asked me to take notice. Some of our soldiers often return from Italy; they do not speak much; however, it is quite noticeable that the Rhaetian soldiers are being treated poorly. These days, it is reported that some have led away a few centuries of soldiers from Rhaetia to Italy to fill the places of those who have left from there. The king is said to be requesting several thousand soldiers in Picardy, which you know there. We have seen Fabricius; we are waiting to see how similar he will be to you. The man who carries this letter is very troubled. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, a man to be honored by all good people, and continue to love your Philippus.</p>
      <p>From Chur, April 10, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, to be honored by all good people. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
