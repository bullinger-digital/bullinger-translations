      <p>Greetings. Although I am unexpectedly delaying both myself and the proceedings of this assembly, which has just concluded, I did not want to send the most elegant Mr. MÃ¼ller to you without my letters. He brings a gift from Mr. Josias, but indeed it is not equal to the great efforts that had to be endured by him. May the Lord make up for our shortcomings, we whose unique talents must be considered, as we remain hidden in the rural areas and the Alps. I still desire certain things in the proceedings, which my special friend, the chancellor of this city, will send tomorrow. I would now wish for a stable end to all these matters, which the Lord may graciously deign to grant us. Indeed, that last assembly has ended; but I ask the Lord to keep the peasants, who are now focused on their work, at home even during their leisure time and free from labors. Now, I wanted to send what I could gather, so that I would not in any way fail to meet your expectations; the rest will follow shortly.</p>
      <p>Chur, 1572, June 26.</p>
