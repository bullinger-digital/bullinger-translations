      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters, most esteemed lord and compater (godfather), and I give you great thanks for your diligence and labors, which you undertake for our sake. May the Lord repay you for everything! I received one copy of your responses to the papist questions, which you wrote was the first collected from the printing house, and for that, if I remember correctly, I thanked you in my last letter. I have not yet seen others, nor does Musculus recall having received any; perhaps they are still on the way; nevertheless, he sends you many thanks.</p>
      <p>Regarding the assembly you write about, we hear it has been recalled by the king because peace has now been established and concluded. I have not yet heard other conditions except these: 1. that the king retains Calais, but pays the English a large sum of money, 2. that he returns Corsica to Philip and also receives a certain sum of money for it, 3. that Philip marries the king's daughter, 4. that the Duke of Savoy marries his sister. This was reported to me yesterday by Mr. Nikolaus von Diesbach; but soon we will hear more certain news. We all wonder why the English write nothing; I fear it is not a sign of good success; we must pray to God to help his people and to wield the power of his right hand against the impious. We are very concerned about this matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding our school in Lausanne, we hope it will be well provided for. We have obtained from the senate in these days that Hyperius from Marburg be called, since he has already given us undoubted hope of his favorable disposition. A liberal stipend has also been arranged for him, so that he knows how he is to be treated: for he also (not without reason) wished to know this. Tomorrow a courier will leave here, who will deliver letters to him and to the prince.</p>
      <p>He is also sent 30 crowns for travel expenses, and if he incurs greater expenses, these will also be reimbursed to him.</p>
      <p>The stipend, calculated from money, wine, and grain, completes the number of two hundred gold coins. He will also be able to have a considerable profit from boarders and students.</p>
      <p>For it is very comfortable to live there.</p>
      <p>If only we could also have your letters to him, in which you would also encourage him not to reject the call. Philip is said to be excommunicated by the Saxons as a sacramentarian, writes my brother in your name. If only we could also have him.</p>
      <p>Our people would spare no expense.</p>
      <p>These two could bring all of Germany to Lausanne with them. Besides Hyperius, Mr. Beatus Comes is now appointed as the rector of the school in Lausanne. He will take on some lecture suitable for himself.</p>
      <p>What kind of man he is in terms of learning and how much authority he has, our Gwalther knows, who lived with him for some time. The remaining lectures are assigned to certain others, but in such a way that until the arrival of Hyperius, none of them is confirmed, but then everything will be arranged by the authority and judgment of Hyperius and Comes.</p>
      <p>All classes have been provided for again. Learned men fly in daily from Geneva and elsewhere, so we hope that this movement of the school will not only not be harmful but also beneficial. For just as there are those who did not want to serve us, so there are also those who do not want to serve the Genevans. In Geneva, they have also established a college, and many who taught in Lausanne now teach there. Who does not see that these things were arranged beforehand? Viret and Beza have been added to the number of ministers. The fruit of that school will also return to us when many are educated there who can later serve our churches. I have nothing else to write now.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you loving greetings.</p>
      <p>We also pray for the health of your entire household.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 10, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable lord and dearest compater.</p>
