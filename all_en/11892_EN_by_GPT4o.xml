    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger was informed that Myconius had preached differently from his earlier stance on the Lord's Supper, repeated this at Christmas, and also stated that Oecolampadius had thought the same about the Eucharist as Luther; an exhortation to preach according to apostolic simplicity, which consists in Christ constantly assisting His Church, especially at the Lord's Supper; to assert an unfathomable physical presence of the Lord in the Lord's Supper falsifies and corrupts apostolic purity; a reminder of the positions of the evangelical cities of the Swiss Confederation towards Luther, who even publicly approved the condemnation of Berengar of Tours by Pope Nicholas II, and of Oecolampadius, who throughout his life disputed the concept of an unformulable presence. For us as servants of the truth and not of men, the Word of God and not Luther is authoritative for teaching and life; a request not to distance oneself from the [Z端rich] Church. Since Myconius is struggling to support his boarders, they were allowed to seek another host; thanks for the benevolence rendered. Leodegar [Hirsgarter] married without the knowledge of his father and the school authorities in Myconius' house; if Myconius had known about this, he would have been subject to severe reproaches. These are brotherly admonitions in perilous times. Greetings from all brothers.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>After our Martinmas fair preceding the birth of the Lord, some of our citizens, who are quite devoted to piety and your name, came to us complaining that Myconius has become unlike himself, now teaching the church in Basel something very different from what he once taught in Z端rich, namely that the body of the Lord Jesus is truly present in the supper and is corporally received by those who partake, though in an ineffable manner; for the manner is not to be inquired into, and they asserted with great constancy that they were listeners of this sermon in which you ardently taught these things and condemned those who thought otherwise. This matter grieved us all not a little, and our grief was not slightly increased by the fact that other brothers, not insignificant or trivial, reported that during the Christmas holidays the same was repeated by you and, in addition, that you stated that the blessed memory of Oecolampadius held the same view on the Eucharist as Luther, by which you have gravely offended many even among your own pious followers. You have certainly offended us and ours most gravely, wherefore we write to you, requesting and beseeching by the Lord Jesus and by Christian charity, that you henceforth discuss the matter of the supper more purely, more circumspectly, and more in accordance with apostolic simplicity.</p>
      <p>No one denies that Christ is perpetually present with His church and especially when the supper is celebrated, that Christ nourishes, preserves, governs, and vivifies His faithful in the church; indeed, He would not be king or priest of His church unless He lived in His own and His own in Him. Thus indeed the apostles of the Lord taught. But to insert a disputation about the corporal presence of the Lord in the supper into this pure simplicity vitiates and corrupts apostolic purity. Moreover, it is contradictory to say that the Lord is corporally present in the supper and that the manner of presence is ineffable, unspeakable, etc. Our Lord is in heaven with His body, not on earth; He is in the church and among the faithful partaking of the supper by His spirit, divinity, redemption, grace, preservation, and vivification. And this is a most expressible and intelligible reason. You know that Oecolampadius strongly opposed that ineffable manner of presence while he lived. You know what we wrote to Luther about that manner. You know what we confessed before him and what our confession and the declaration of the confession contain. You know what Luther wrote and what he writes today. He approved in a public writing the faith of Pope Nicholas concerning the Eucharist, because he agrees with the condemnation of Berengar. However, you know what the blessed memory of Oecolampadius thought about it; it is read in print by the whole church. Therefore, Oecolampadius never taught the same as Luther about the sacrament of the Lord's supper.</p>
      <p>We therefore pray you, most learned Myconius and dearest brother, not to depart from pure and open simplicity nor to distance yourself from our churches, with which you once agreed very well. We are ministers of the truth, not of men. The Word of the Lord is the rule of our doctrine and life, not Luther.</p>
      <p>Let us look unanimously to this, we pray, so that the gracious Lord may look upon us in these most perilous last times and deliver us from all evil.</p>
      <p>Since we understand that you are entangled in various affairs and find it difficult to support your boarders, we have given them permission to turn to another honest citizen. However, we give you the greatest thanks we can for your benevolence towards the people of Z端rich and for the benefits conferred upon ours. It truly grieves us greatly that Leodegar married without the knowledge of his father and the school authorities in your house, nor can we think that this was done with your knowledge; otherwise, we would reproach you and expostulate with you.</p>
      <p>Now we frankly lay these few things before you, as befits brothers, beseeching our Lord to deign to be present with us in those perilous times, so that we may govern the churches entrusted to our faith by the word of truth according to His will. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Z端rich, 12th of February, in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, in the name of all the ministers and brothers.</p>
