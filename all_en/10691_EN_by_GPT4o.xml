    <p xml:id="regest1">His duties do not allow him to come to himself and prevent him from writing letters. He defends himself against rumors about an apology allegedly written by him. He hopes for a concord; has learned about the plans of the Zurichers through Capito and asks them for restraint. He was about to set off [to Tübingen] when he received Bullinger's letter; has not yet seen [Hans] Hager. Assures Bullinger of his commitment against the rise of sects and expresses his trust in him. There is agreement between King Ferdinand and [Ulrich of Württemberg]; as far as religion is concerned, no impairment has occurred. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings again and again, indeed more than a thousand times, my dearest and most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You rightly attribute my silence to my countless and most troublesome affairs. For I am not only far from you and my other sweetest friends, but also far from myself, so you should not be surprised if you receive no letters from me, who am not myself.</p>
      <p>You have heard trifles about my recent apology. I wish everyone would pursue concord! For I see how much it would benefit the affairs of Christ. Capito has informed me about you all. See to it that you do not propose anything beyond Christian decorum and untimely. More, as you love me, brother, I cannot say.</p>
      <p>Having completed my business with the prince, I was preparing to set out on a journey when my servant offered me your little letter. I have not yet seen Hager. Know that I am entirely committed to ensuring that no sects, no pursuits of odious names arise in this domain. I have no doubt about your candor and your sincerity in the cause of the Lord. However, see that you do not allow yourself to be led by the overly raw spirit of certain others.</p>
      <p>There is excellent agreement between King Ferdinand and our prince. As far as religion is concerned, he has not demanded anything significant; everything remains intact for us through the king.</p>
      <p>But farewell, my brother, my sweetest head, with your wife and children, whom you will lovingly greet with my words, and indeed add to them the best and most learned Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and others, especially Consul Rösch, and intercede diligently for me with the Lord. I strive beyond my strength, but not unsuccessfully, thanks to the Lord, who is always present with us. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Penultimate of September, the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother, the bishop of the Zurichers, most esteemed.</p>
