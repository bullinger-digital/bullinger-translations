      <p>May God's grace, favor, and help be with you all through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Revered dear sir, I received the letters you sent me on July 6th, but I did not act as I would have liked. Therefore, I earnestly ask for forgiveness for God's sake and listen to my apology. Firstly, I sent the letters with a trusted messenger to the camp. Before he could reach the camp, he was turned back by another messenger who came with him and said that the soldiers and knights were given leave and the princes would surely come to us at Hohentwiel. I was glad that I could personally hand the letters to both princely graces. However, when it was delayed, the princes returned to Stuttgart; I asked my young lords to allow me a messenger at my expense. One young lord told me he would soon deliver the letters into their hands himself. However, he is still with us, and all my plans have failed. Yet I have an excuse that I did not dare to write, but I will, God willing, soon tell you in person. I actually expect that you will soon come to both princes yourself. We have had good information about Ferdinand's practices beforehand. However, I confess that I did wrong by not sending the letters back to you sooner. I sent them once and instructed the messenger earnestly to deliver them into your own hands or bring them back. He brought them back to me and said you were in a bath. So now I have given them to my trusted dear friend and son, so that he may deliver them to you as soon as possible with a certain message. I hereby ask for forgiveness for God's sake.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I express my utmost thanks for the epistle and Christian exhortation, which I cannot deserve, therefore everything is lost that is done for me. Everyone should go my way. However, I will not forget such your good deeds when I return to my lord.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I let you know that the evangelical freedoms are greatly increasing in our land. However, how it stands with the fear of God, His commandments, and Christian obedience, I do not yet know. Therefore, help us pray that we do not forget and are not ungrateful for the great wonders of God, (without) acting on His fatherly counsel in the future. With this, may the power of God be in us all.</p>
      <p>From Hohentwiel, August 12, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your very willing</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, guardian at Hohentwiel.</p>
      <p>Confession of Ambrosius Blaurer and [...]</p>
      <p>To the revered servant of the word of God in the church of Zurich, my especially dear lord, to the hands of M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
