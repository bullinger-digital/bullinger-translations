      <p>Upon reading your letter, the saying of Nevius immediately came to my mind: I am glad to be praised, father, by you, a praised man. At the same time, I felt spurred on to pursue those things of which I seem to have shown some example. But indeed, your benevolence, which you abundantly testify, is certainly sharper to me than any spur. Would that I could imitate you praised men and, however little it is, contribute what I have received from the Lord to the common benefit of the church; for nothing has been more in my wishes than to use my leisure, whenever I have obtained it, and my efforts in some useful matter. Throughout this whole decade, during which I had to make excursions to England, then to wander through France and offer my services to our nation here and there, no time was left at all to devote to books and gentler studies. Now, having been rescued from those storms and a severe shipwreck, if any spare hours are given from sermons and lectures, nothing will be more pleasant than to devote them to that work to which you incite me. I currently have Cyprian in hand; when I have finished him, we will take counsel together about the others. Our Beza has undertaken to handle Tertullian, as he had already begun, and will also lend a hand to some others, as leisure will allow. Our French Bible now somewhat distracts me, but I hope it will not prevent me from persevering in my purpose, nor will the anxieties, which sometimes distract me, nor the care of my household, as I think, divert me. I still have a wife in France, who cannot make her way here due to blocked routes, and an elder son, who escaped the danger of death at Toulouse at the beginning of this last war; where he is, I do not know at all, nor have I received any letters from him for two years. However, I hear he is among the Bigorre at the foot of the Pyrenees with some nobles who received him in the name of religion. Two younger ones are with me, one of whom I received from Orl√©ans with great difficulty, the other I called from Lower Germany. Regarding the youngest, who is about eighteen years old, I would like to take counsel from you, unless it is troublesome. He has pursued literary studies, but not with the same spirit as others. He learned the German language; but of that lower region, whose dialect I hear is not so elegant or pure. Therefore, I would like him to study the peculiarities of your language and especially writing, so that, informed by a purer dialect, he may know how to interpret aptly and to speak and write something in both our language and yours, due to necessary communications. In which city and with whom he might achieve this more easily and better, I beg you, do not find it burdensome to write to me. If any such opportunity were offered among you, I would certainly prefer it; for I wish him to study religion and piety above all and to associate with those whose example would strengthen him in the doctrine with which he has been imbued. I have found him teachable so far; but the more easy-going his manners, the more I must consider the company he might imitate. By God's grace, although my resources have been taken away, I have enough to provide him with sustenance and necessary things for some time. I will pay what you decide, or if there were someone who would like to send his son there in place of mine, I would treat him as my own. The rumors about peace are so uncertain that I can place no trust in them; I am not unaware that it has been negotiated, but we have learned at great cost how our enemies are accustomed to deceive us. But in the end, they will not mock God with impunity.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you and yours safe for a long time, venerable father, and bless your labors.</p>
