      <p>S. I am sorry for my situation, most learned and dearest Bullinger, because due to the untimely and immense waves of business, I was not able to do what I greatly desired; for as I am setting out abroad tomorrow, it was necessary for me to disentangle myself from many labyrinths over the course of three days. Therefore, it was not possible for me to receive your people as is my custom, nor to guide them around and show them the dreadful monsters of wealth and luxury of our future city. I therefore ask you to excuse me to the best men and to say the same to Gesner.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it was not possible for me to convey to you what I wanted, even a little from the many things; I will make up for this fault with the next messenger. Your son lives honorably and piously.</p>
      <p>The door at my place, your love for me, and your son's most honorable conduct, is open to your son at all times; I will not cease to spur him on as he eagerly runs towards all the heights of honor. I cannot hide from you that Gesner will soon be called to bear tolerable labors. Therefore, the plan is that if that man is an honor and benefit to you, as I believe he is most useful, you should treat him in such a way that he is not missed if taken from you, nor is it a burden if you say the same to Gesner. I would have said this to your people if the Fugger and my preparations for departure had not hindered me.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe how much the letters of our Gwalter have cheered me. I seek his friendship and well remember seeing him in Regensburg, but the importunate business of my prince, which burdens my shoulders with such great matters, did not allow me to lay the foundations of future acquaintance. I was not able to write to him; but henceforth I will send Gesner very frequent letters.</p>
      <p>I ask that he write to my son Raphael; for he was greatly pleased with him when he was in Z端rich. You have learned from our Peter how things stand with my son; encourage him to prepare for a return soon.</p>
      <p>Tell Gesner that I received a large fish from his house, but as he only fed the eyes and not the stomach, I will take care to return this spectacle; if only it were possible to send back to you for pleasure and refreshment the fat Bavarian fish held in the delights of princes and to receive something similar from Lake Z端rich; but I will do what can be done. Today the Landsberg assembly has begun to be celebrated; those from Bamberg, W端rzburg, and Nuremberg have gone there through their representatives, desiring to contract marriages or at least betrothals with that Bavarian harlot, I mean the Landsberg alliance. The Swabian Circle, as they call it, is holding an assembly in Ulm.</p>
      <p>I think by the grace of God it may be possible to prevent the gathering of soldiers, which for several years now has been a great danger to Germany, from being done with impunity. For Polweiler is enlisting soldiers around the Hercynian Forest, but he has declared that he will lead two armies and 1000 horsemen to the King of England; meanwhile, no one knows where these rotten things tend. A league has been made between the Palatinate, Cleves, Hesse, W端rttemberg, and Baden, which I hope will be of great benefit to religion.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand has repelled the Turk in his usual manner, and nothing is heard of further expedition. I hope the money of the empire is sought in vain, because the Lord has need of these things.</p>
      <p>A certain Doctor Jacob Andreae is said to have published a booklet on reconciling sacramental concord. It is praised by many, but I have not yet read it.</p>
      <p>The Turk lives and indeed better than is good for us. King Ferdinand has cleansed the fold, yet found no sheep except a few without fleece. I dare not assert anything about the Worms colloquy.</p>
      <p>Letters will certainly be delivered to the Viennese bookseller. You do well to call your son away from this Lerna of evils.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, August 10, in the year of our Lord 57.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished theologian and dearest friend.</p>
