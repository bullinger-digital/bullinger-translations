    <p xml:id="regest1">The high value of the sciences and languages for human education is generally recognized; especially the newly flourishing cultivation of Greek and Hebrew has already borne rich fruits and must not fall into decay again. The work inspired by Bullinger and now dedicated to him is intended to serve the well-being of the youth and above all the instruction of beginners. Do not count on praise, but hope for a good reception of the little book.</p>

      <p>Ludwig Lopadius to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Since letters (literature and learning) deserve the highest place by the great consensus and judgment of the most learned men, and it is agreed that they surpass all possessions, it is not unjust that they are also held in high esteem by us. For I do not see that anything better or more excellent can be found than them. Therefore, we will most deservedly call these the best and most humane, as they alone among all things have the greatest weight and importance for shaping the human mind, for composing the morals of life, and for more correctly establishing our way of living. For these reasons, it is clear that letters and languages were given by God as gifts, than which nothing is more divine, and were created for human use. Therefore, a person must strive with all their might to learn them for their own and others' benefit. The fact that these were neglected and ignored in previous centuries, we still find and feel today, has brought great loss to the mortal race. The evils they have brought into this world are well known, so I will pass over them for now. To our great detriment, the Greek language was unknown. What loss and ignorance did the lack of knowledge of the Hebrew language bring us, good God? But in these times, when both began to be taught and learned in turn, it is universally acknowledged what distinguished, magnificent, incomparable fruits they have brought to the world, about which it would be superfluous to say much. Until that time, we see that the more elegant disciplines, the best authors, and books lay hidden as if covered by neglect and dust. But after they were brought back to light and revived as if recalled from the underworld, not without the greatest compassion of our God, piety and the true worship of God also revived. With the restoration of letters, laws were restored to their former state. Many things returned to the right path, which in previous ages and years had deviated and strayed from the correct way of living. To what things, I ask, can we attribute these fruits, except to the newly revived studies, languages, and arts of speaking? But if, God forbid, contempt for literature arises again, everything will fall back into worse. Therefore, let us continually pray to our Lord, that it may not come to that, and that so many good things, both created and discovered by our labors, indeed by the grace of God, may not perish and be lost again in a short time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, be my encourager and advisor, most learned Bullinger, in publishing my little works. I will obey your encouragements, they will indeed come forth to the public, but on the condition that you accept them as your own offspring, now truly made yours, as they are dedicated to your name, to be defended. Through you, I hope, it will happen that envy will not be allowed against me; for I think there will be those for whom this effort of mine will seem more like rashness than a certain inclination of the mind wishing well for young people of good character. But it is not doubted that this rashness of mine will turn out well among the youth of great hope. For what I do is for the sake of the children. This small labor is undertaken for those whom I intend to instruct publicly and privately in Greek letters, especially those who have not yet progressed beyond the basics. The older age will have those to read who are more learned than I. As far as I am concerned, I have aimed from childhood to this point, to go where, if I could, I might serve the public good. But if I do not achieve this nor become its possessor, it will grieve my heart not in a common way. I have strived and given my effort diligently to this point, so that I might not spend this age without the benefits of many and so that I might arrange myself in such a way that I might be thought to have lived for others as well. I know well enough that no praise will be born for me for such a small thing. If, therefore, I do not deserve any praises, it is fitting that no hatred be gained for me from this. If any small favor arises from it, I will not reject it, whatever may come from my supporters. From them, I believe, this small duty of mine will not be poorly received. For it is not unknown to me that young people prefer to use modest books rather than lengthy ones, and finally, there is hope that this small study will be pleasing to the studious.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do, most candid Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Ides of February 1535.</p>
