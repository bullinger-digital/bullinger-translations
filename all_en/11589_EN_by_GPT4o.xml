    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports very briefly on the outcome of the [Regensburg] Imperial Diet, as a messenger is just setting off [to Zurich]. The Protestants reject parts of the [Regensburg] Book and demand further explanations. The princes are divided; some condemn the book sharply. The majority of the Catholic cities have agreed to it. Emperor [Charles V] grants a standstill until January, and the Protestants approve aid against the Turk [Suleiman I]. Greetings. Inquires about the number of pastors in the city of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>As the messenger is already in the harbor, he announces his departure; therefore, so that you have something from me, I briefly inform you and the brothers of the conclusion of the assembly, but hastily. Our people have steadfastly refused to accept the book offered by the Emperor for establishing concord in many aspects, and in some, they demand more explanation. The princes are divided, but in such a way that some condemn the book of concord to the crows.</p>
      <p>The majority of the papist cities have accepted the book, hoping that at least in this way some path for the gospel is prepared.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Emperor grants a truce until January, and our people provide assistance against the Turk.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and all the others.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Write to me, I beg you, how many ministers of the word of God you have in your city, not in the countryside, etc.; I will add the reason another time.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his brother.</p>
