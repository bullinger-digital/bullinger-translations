      <p> Greetings. But what is the faith of men, or rather, what is their treachery? I wrote to you extensively and at length recently through a certain trumpeter, who served our magistrate here for a long time and whose loyalty I did not doubt at all, especially since he requested and claimed that you and your brother were known to him. I allowed myself to be persuaded to entrust him with extensive and lengthy letters, to which I also added any news I had previously received from you. Now, from yours, which you sent through him, I understand that you did not receive them. Therefore, I am very anxious and disturbed, for I wrote and poured out certain things, as I usually do, which I would not want to fall into the hands of others, and this one thing comforts me, that he told me he would not go there directly, but would use a certain detour; hence I still hope that mine will be delivered to you. I therefore beseech you to free me from this concern as soon as possible. I will send my own messenger along the route he used if I do not soon learn that mine have been delivered to you, indeed I intend to send this one of yours through Solothurn, so that he may inquire along the entire route, wherever he may be. His name is Peter Oberhofer from Ulm. As for what you have now sent, I return everything to you along with the common response of the brothers. We all pray that you will consider this favorably. I also add here a note from Senior Zerkinden, to whom I also entrusted those writings to be read; you will see in his few words both judgment and talent; return it to me when it seems convenient. I thank you for the copies of your exhortation; the same does Lord Aretius and Musculus, to whom I handed the other in your name. I ask you to thank Mr. Gwalther for his homilies on the incarnation of the Lord, which he translated and sent to me; Lord Steiger also thanks him; likewise, for your news, which you sent at the same time, those lords to whom you wished to communicate them express great thanks. As for us, we have nothing special, except that in these days the Prince of Savoy requested assistance from us of three hundred soldiers for a certain fortress he built near the town of Bourg in Bresse; what this means is still unknown, nor have the lords yet wanted to grant him anything. I think he does this only to appear somewhat powerful over us and to deceive others with our service. Here in the city is a newly elected abbot of the monastery of St. Maurice among the Valaisans, seeking certain fiefs from our lords as usual. Otherwise, I have nothing new from Geneva or elsewhere. As for my health, I am moderately well now by the grace of the Lord. May He strengthen mine and yours more and more. Amen. </p>
      <p> The lords consuls and treasurers greet you, as do the brothers and father-in-law with Telamon and many others. I recently replied to you about this last one, if only those letters have not been lost. </p>
      <p> Bern, March 17, 1572. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, yours as you know. </p>
      <p> If you have not seen the edict of the Count Palatine against the Zwinglians, I am sending it; you can return it to me sometime, so that I can also show it to our lords if the occasion arises. So where does that Landgrave's concord remain? </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather. </p>
