    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian had already sealed the envelope with his letter [18082] and [Johann Valentin Furtmüller's report (18348)] about his dispute with Hans Vogler the Elder, when he thought that Bullinger would surely also want to know his opinion [about the mutual insult between the two]. The following should therefore be added: Furtmüller complains that due to a serious insult to his honor [uttered by Vogler], he lost his self-control and responded to this insult quite vehemently, but (in his opinion) appropriately. As witnesses, he names, among others, Anton Zili, who was already mentioned by Bullinger [in his letter] [not received]. Vadian cannot judge whether Vogler or Furtmüller is in the right, but he wishes that both would behave more humbly. Furtmüller may be hot-headed, but he is sincere and his way of life causes no offense. The same probably applies to Vogler, unless he is hiding something that only a few have seen through! This is Vadian's assessment in brief. Furtmüller has solemnly promised to present the course of the dispute in detail and faithfully, so that Bullinger can thereby recognize who is to blame [for the conflict].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Vadian is not sure whether he accurately conveyed Furtmüller's opinion on the alliance of the Confederates with King Henry II of France in his previous letter [18078 from April 16, 1548]. It was meant that the [Protestant] cities of the Confederation should reject any alliance unless Henry II gave his assurance not to persecute the Protestants in France anymore, until the correctness of the doctrine is examined at a general council. Whether Bullinger agrees with Vadian on this view, he must decide for himself.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After sealing my letters regarding the dispute between our Vogler and Furtmüller, it occurred to me that you would surely wish to be informed of this disgraceful matter by me as well. Therefore, I deemed it necessary to add this to what I have already written to you: Furtmüller complains that, provoked by a serious and indeed insulting injury, he somewhat forgot his modesty and responded rather sharply, but truthfully and openly, as he himself says. He calls upon witnesses such as Anton, whom you also mentioned, and others who were present at the quarrel. I do not know which of them is in the right. However, I wish that both would possess the sense and spirit to prefer Christian modesty. Furtmüller is very hot-tempered, but nevertheless sincere, and you cannot catch him in any aspect of his life that would offend or lead to suspicion by those who think ill. Similarly, Vogler, as far as I know, is remarkably and skillfully sincere, unless he knows how to conceal things that are apparent to few. In summary, to satisfy you: Furtmüller has solemnly promised to write to you in full detail with the candor and faith that befits a Christian brother, so that you may interpose your judgment and recognize, with your good grace, whose fault the sin is.</p>

      <p>Regarding the alliance with the French King, I am not sure whether I fully included Furtmüller's opinion in my previous letters. He believes it would be very beneficial for the cause of our religion if the Christian cities of the Swiss Confederation were to refuse the alliance unless the king solemnly promised to cease the persecution of our faith until the truth of the doctrine is recognized at a general council. This also seemed agreeable to me! But it will be up to you to follow what you deem right.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a very good and esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
