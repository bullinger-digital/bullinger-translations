      <p>S. When I write to the merchants of Lyon, especially Vincent, who visited you, that the things he lost in Basel have been found, I also wanted to inform you that I have received your letters and the messages you sent; they are most welcome, and I am grateful. What has been written by the merchants about the defeat suffered by the Turks does not seem very true to me, as they have no war with the King of Persia, nor are so many thousands of men easily defeated. Our people here are saddened that the Pope has recovered.</p>
      <p>I am waiting to hear what has been done about the peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote about the guest at the Stork Inn, I will write to Mr. St. Laurentian, so that through him I may understand what he promised him, and as much as it is in my power, I will ensure that he understands how much weight your recommendation carries. At the next assembly, I think my wife will go to you with our son.</p>
      <p>She sends her greetings to you, and I to our mutual friends. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, October 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>If Vincent has not yet left, tell him to return to Basel and recover his belongings and pass through here. His father is an excellent and pious man.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
