      <p>Greetings. I have written several times these days. I have nothing to add to those letters now, except that in the meantime, yours have finally been delivered to me, in which you write about Christoph, your son, and how generously he has been granted some fiefs by the Landgrave.</p>
      <p>For this, I congratulate you and all of yours and pray to God that He may continue to bless all of yours perpetually. The Lord also blesses mine, for which I give thanks to Him.</p>
      <p>My son has obtained a very favorable position for himself; for he lives with me and in the meantime preaches not far from the city. I was going to send him to France; but the current state of affairs makes it so that none of my friends advise me to do this. We have nothing new. I am expecting today my Blasius and his wife, my daughter. May the Lord keep you and all of yours safe! Steiger, Gravenried, Manuel, and all friends and brothers greet you. Musculus began to suffer from a headache yesterday; however, we hope today that the matter is out of danger. He also greets you and will write to you after he has received a copy of your Isaiah. I have given thanks in my recent letters on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 24, 1567.</p>
