      <p>Gracious and highly trusted, dear lord and brother. Your two letters, along with the books you sent, have delighted my heart, and you should know that I did not wait for the arrival of your Christian and very necessary sermons, but rather, several weeks before, I endeavored to have them translated into Latin and German. When Prentzius and other learned men were summoned here, they were used for the right necessity, and with the support of my gracious prince's court preacher Michel and then Mr. Johann Ehinger and other faithful ones, I found the truth, hoping to God that he will open the eyes of the proud WÃ¼rttemberg heads to give place to the truth and grant grace, so that they will no longer hang on to the devil and his papacy because of the Lord's Supper and the cursed images. If that happens, I hope for good improvement; if not, I trust in my dear God to visit you with my person, earnestly asking, brotherly, that you will continue to support me with your further letters and not abandon me in any other way, and also commend me in the same manner to the other lords and brothers; for if I could serve you all, especially my lords of Zurich, and repay the grace and friendship that the place has shown me, I would spare no effort of my body and means. Greet your dear wife and children for me, and especially my dear host, your brother Mr. Hans. Dated Neuburg, the 25th of October, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>G[abriel] Arnold.</p>
