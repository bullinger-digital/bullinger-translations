      <p>Christian, illustrious, high-born prince, we are always ready to serve you willingly.</p>
      <p>We received your princely grace's letter to us, written in October of the year 1533, with particularly great joy, for as your princely grace so comfortingly encourages and exhorts us to persist in God's word, we can well understand how well things are going in this regard in your princely grace's city. Therefore, we praise God and thank your princely grace for the friendly letter and exhortation. We also want to always keep this in mind for good and, with God's grace, remain steadfast and continue in the recognized truth, as we have suffered much tribulation so far and still do, in which God has faithfully preserved us. It is also the unanimous will and firm intention of our lords and superiors of the city and the land to persist in the accepted truth with God's grace. We ask here that your princely grace may consider this letter of ours as good, having entrusted ourselves to you in faithfulness. For if we could serve you and do what is pleasing and agreeable, we would be willing to do so for your princely grace.</p>
      <p>May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, March 11, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's humble servants,</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf Lavater, bailiff of Kyburg, and Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, illustrious, and high-born prince and lord, Mr. Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, etc., their most gracious lord.</p>
