      <p>S. D. I could not refrain from transcribing for you word for word the letter I received this hour by post; it will be of some use: "To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, greetings. From the letters of Mr. Peter and mine, you have understood the continuation of the colloquy.</p>
      <p>Everything is now in a better place, and the Lord triumphs through almost all the cities of France. I will write to you more extensively soon; in the meantime, greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>The king recently wrote to the Swiss and the Rhaetians to remain steadfast in faith. Paris, October 2.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignetius." I transcribed it syllable by syllable. But the letters he mentioned, we have not yet received; they are delayed on the way.</p>
      <p>When they are delivered, I will share them as well. You will present this to Mr. Friedrich von Salis, my old and singular friend, whom you will also greet. You will commend me to the most illustrious Mr. Hercules von Salis, whom I wish to be known to; I love the man for his singular devotion to piety. Greet him in my name and commend me to all good people, especially to the consuls and ministers.</p>
      <p>Also greet Egli, etc.</p>
      <p>Zürich, October 18, 1561. May the Lord bless your assemblies and eliminate all dissensions, all impiety, and especially papal deceptions and impostures, keeping you safe and sound in peace and harmony always. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste.</p>
      <p>These letters were delivered to me by Ilantii at the assemblies. To the most excellent Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, his most esteemed lord and brother. To Mr. Johannes Fabricius, pastor in Chur at St. Martin, currently at the assembly in the Pünten.</p>
