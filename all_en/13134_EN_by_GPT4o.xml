    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received Blarer's letter from November 23 [No. 3083] on the evening before. He thanks him for the warnings conveyed with Blarer's letter from November 24 [No. 3084]. When he shared the latter with Hans Rudolf Lavater, Lavater ordered them to be forwarded or copied to Johannes Haab and Itelhans Thumysen, the envoys [at the ongoing Diet] in Baden, without mentioning the source. Bullinger thus copied one of the warnings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He is not to blame for the delay in the repayment of the money owed by Kaspar Seidensticker [to Ambrosius Blarer and Konrad Zwick]. He has repeatedly urged for it, but Seidensticker has only now responded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger had no opportunity to discuss the war machine with Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick, as they talked about so many other things during their conversation, including Blarer, which gave Bullinger cause for concern about him. During the meal, the topic could not be broached either, as other people kept joining them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] After Zwick had taken his leave, the messenger he sent to Basel returned with the letter from Sebastian S[chertlin] enclosed here. The messenger demanded another ten batzen from Bullinger, as Blarer's cousin had only given him ten, and the messenger claimed twenty for the four days (five per day). Bullinger thus paid him this additional amount on behalf of Zwick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He will inquire with [Caspar Bodmer], the host of the inn Zum Rotenhuß, about the medicine for the fever and inform Blarer about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] There is nothing new to report about the Diet in Baden, except that King Henry II of France has become the father of a daughter [Claude] and now desires that the Swiss Confederates and their allies act as godparents, as was the case during the time of his father Francis I. As soon as Bullinger learns more about this, he will report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer will learn the rest from the bearer Gabriel Arnold, the treasurer of Elector Palatine Ottheinrich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My willing service beforehand. Your letter, dear sir and brother, dated November 23, was delivered to me last night (yesterday evening). On the 24th, I thank you very much for the warning, which, when I shared it with my lord Lavater, he instructed me to forward or copy such a warning to the envoys in Baden, Mr. Haab and Mr. Thumysen, without mentioning your name. As for the warning, I have copied it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have not let the payment of Seidensticker's debt remain outstanding for so long through my negligence, as I have often written and reminded. However, I have received no response until now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>With your cousin, I did not manage to discuss the matter of the war machine, not only because it did not fit into the conversation, but also because we were constantly talking about other things, and he made me anxious about you. Also, during the meal, other people came to us, so we could not discuss it at that time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>After he had taken his leave, the messenger he sent to Basel returned, bringing the letter enclosed here from Mr. Sebastian S[chertlin], and said that your cousin had given him 10 batzen. I was to give him the remaining amount: that is another 10 batzen (as the days are 4; he demanded 5 batzen per day). I have paid him these 10 batzen on behalf of your cousin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>At the inn Zum Rotenhuß, I will diligently inquire about the fever medicine and let you know the answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We have nothing new from Baden, except that the news has come that the young king in France has had a daughter born. He desires that the Swiss Confederates and their allies act as godparents, as they did for his father. As soon as I have more detailed information, I will not keep it from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The rest you will learn from the treasurer of Duke Ottheinrich of the Palatinate, who delivers this to you. Farewell with all yours. Zurich, November 24, 1547.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful minister of the church in Constance, incomparable brother. Constance.</p>
