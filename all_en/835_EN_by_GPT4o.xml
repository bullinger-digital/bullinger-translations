      <p>S. D. Although I am unknown to you by face, most learned and kind Bullinger, this does not prevent me from embracing you with all benevolence and respect and wishing to gratify you in all things. For I am not one who does not see how much we all, who profess a more sincere doctrine, owe to you and your kind for the illustrious labors and monuments by which you have purified the very church of Christ, which had been miserably corrupted by the antichrist. Therefore, I wish, most pious Bullinger, that you may promise yourself everything from me that can be offered by a grateful disciple to his teacher, which indeed I would rather have you persuaded of by deeds than by words.</p>
      <p>The state of the English republic is now most peaceful compared to what it was in the previous year. The Duke of Somerset, who had been the royal governor and who was so ignominiously thrown into the Tower of London, has now at last been liberated by divine favor and honorably released. Although he is deprived of his former office, he can still live quite honorably and splendidly from his revenues, which were left to him. You see, therefore, the admirable liberation of God towards his elect; for from the beginning everyone said he would die; but it turned out quite differently.</p>
      <p>The Gospel is here being propagated more widely than it is being changed. Master Bucer, Bernardino, and Peter Martyr are laboring strenuously in their ministry and indeed are making much progress.</p>
      <p>There is great hope for peace between us and the French, although it is not yet known on what terms it will be concluded. May the most merciful God grant that all things may succeed happily, whom I also pray most earnestly to preserve you together with Master Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalter, Vergerio, and the whole church for a long time in safety to the glory of His name. Master Bucer, who is now in the University of Cambridge, where he professes the Pauline Epistle to the Ephesians with great eloquence and piety, sends his loving greetings to you and your church. Cambridge, February 10, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and attached Peter Perusinus, a refugee from Italy, his homeland, on account of the confession of the evangelical doctrine.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, outstanding in piety and learning, and to his most revered master and father.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
