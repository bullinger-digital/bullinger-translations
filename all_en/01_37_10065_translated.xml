  <input>- - - qui, si pollicitationem suam stultam et incogitatam aut vino inscripsisset aut remisisset, posteaquam cerneret voti atrocitatem, minus peccasset et venia dignus erat; nunc vero cum atrocem etiam pollicitationem opere, iam non nescius quid ageret, crudeliter perficit, scelus etiam designavit.

Verum equidem esse fateor id omnino opere complendum esse, quod semel voveris, idem enim suadet veritatis honestas et decus, mendatii item et inconstantiae infamia, sed si interim votum eiusmodi sit, ut opere perfectum in nephas non abeat aut infamiam inurat. Quod si aut infamat aut scelus est, praestat quidem verbis tantum peccasse, quam male sana facta malis iungere verbis.

Habemus autem huius rei typum in sacris fortissimum illum et prudentissimum Hebręorum imperatorem Iephthae. Is enim deo vovebat parricidium, sed nescius, quod rem usqueadeo funestam voveret. At ubi depraehendit, an non prudentius et melius egisset, si a parricidio sibi temperasset? Nemo negat, cum etiam Iosephus Judaeus alias factum Iephthae plurimum accuset, quod eius sacrifitium sive votum deo non fuerit charum neque legitimum, quin et apud omnes ecclesiasticos inolevit Iephthae quidem in vovendo fuisse stultum, sed in solvendo etiam impium. Notissima enim omnibus est ista Hieronymi sententia. Hic vero audi, quam constanter in voto pergat Iephthae: «Aperui», inquit, «os meum ad dominum, et aliud facere non potero» [Ri 11,35]. Sic enim sibi persuaserat nullo alio argumento nisi quod vovisset, non secus atque tu iam iam obiecisti te omnino vovisse, unde etiam incunctanter preastandum sit. Interim rectius fecisset Iephthae, si hoc, quod per votum fecit, non fecisset. Iccirco velimus nolimus conditionem admittunt haec legis verba: Quicquid voveris verbo, facto adimplebis; hanc videlicet: si iuste, sancte et legitime voveris. Neque enim frustra additur: «Si voveris domino deo tuo» [Dtn 23,21]. Nam quod impium est vel illegitimum, deo gratum non est, ergo votum non est; proinde melius fuerit ab impio facto abstinere, quam stulta verba seu vota impie perficere.

Iam vero quod attinet locum Psal. 75: «Vovete et reddite» [Ps 76,12] mutile citatur a plerisque, corrupto etiam sensu. Palam enim loquitur propheta de muneribus deo offerendis, quae res externarum est et ceremoniarum. Sic enim hortatur propheta ad offerendum sacrifitia: «Vovete et reddite domino deo vestro, omnes, qui in circuitu eius sunt, afferte munera» [Ps 76,12]. Et sane frequens est hoc verbum in scripturis: «votum reddere», quod significat pendere et solvere quod promisimus rerum videlicet externarum. Votum enim veterum obligabat ad res externas, quae tota vovendi ratio abrogata est. Non quod vovere non possimus eo quo supra diximus modo, sed quod votis nemo suffragari amplius potest iis scripturis, quibus solent. Nam omnes legis victimae, hostiae, oblationes et sacrifitia terminata sunt in Christo, porro veterum vota maxime in iis inerant oblationibus, una ergo cum ipsis abolita. Christianorum oblatio est innocentia, beneficentia et oratio: Rom. 12 [1], Heb. 13 [15f]. Quod si syncerius lustres veterum prophetarum libros, comperies vota plerumque pro iis rebus accipi et non pro externis perpetuo ritibus.

De Nazaraeis vero vel alii ex eruditioribus et pientioribus sic responderunt, dominum multa praecepisse filiis Izrael, quibus ipse nec egebat nec delectabatur, sed fieri sibi iubebat, ne demoniis fierent, sed et eum ritum non minus esse abolitum quam omnem vovendi rationem. Quod autem Paulus votum suscipit, id quidem charitatem magis docet quam vovendi ritum, testamur Acta apostolorum [21,23 ff] et simile pene factum: circumcisionem Timothei, de qua et in Galatis cap. 2 [3].

Ceterum locus 1. Timoth. 5 [3ff] pro nobis, nihil contra nos facit. Praecipit enim Paulus Timotheo, ne cito aut temere suscipiat eas, quae per stultitiam simulant adeoque vovent castimoniam; scire enim se, quod multa mendaciter polliceantur neque vero ipsas praestare quod polliceantur. Unde postmodum, cum vivendi statum immutent, enascatur κρίμα, iuditium sive condemnatio (ein fürzug), quod primae isti pollicitationi non fecerint satis. Prius itaque quam polliceantur, ab instituto stulto arcendas tradit; unde nos liquido intelligimus condemnationem hoc loco non accipi pro condemnatione animae, sed pro infamiae macula. Legatur ex integro locus Pauli, et aparebit, quibus suffragetur!

Haec sunt, Vernhere, frater dilectissime, quae in praesentiarum de votis habuimus eaque tibi - qualiacunque tandem sint, si non compta, certe non prorsus impia - dedicamus et oramus, ut haec paucula boni consulas.

Vale et Pellicanum, praeceptorem nostrum, plurimum salvere iubebis.

  <output>I admit that it is certainly necessary to fulfill that which is once vowed, for the same thing advocates the honesty of truth and the glory of decency, and also the infamy of falsehood and inconstancy; but if, in the meantime, the vow is such that its fulfillment does not lead to a heinous crime or to infamy, then it is better to have sinned only with words than to join evil works with foolish words. We have a model of this in the most courageous and wise king of the Hebrews, Jephthah. He vowed to commit parricide, but not knowing what he was vowing. But when he realized, would it not have been better and wiser for him to have refrained from parricide? No one denies that, even Joseph the Jew accuses Jephthah of having done something very wrong, that his sacrifice or vow was not pleasing to God nor legitimate. And it is well known to all that Jerome's opinion is this: "Jephthah was foolish in vowing, but even more impious in fulfilling it". Hear then how firmly he perseveres in his vow: "I have opened my mouth unto the Lord", says he, "and I cannot go back" [Judges 11:35]. Thus he had persuaded himself that he must fulfill it, not on any other argument but that he had vowed it, just as you have now said that you had vowed, from which it must be necessarily fulfilled. In the meantime, it had been better for Jephthah if he had not done that which he did through his vow. Therefore, we must necessarily admit this condition of the law: "Whatsoever thou shalt vow, thou shalt pay" [Deuteronomy 23:21]. For that which is impious or illegitimate is not pleasing to God, therefore it is not a vow; hence it is better to abstain from an impious work than to cruelly fulfill a foolish vow.

But as for the passage of Psalm 76: "Vow and pay" [Psalm 76:12], it is frequently cited by many, and even with a corrupted sense. For the prophet clearly speaks of the gifts offered to God, which are external and ceremonial matters. Thus he exhorts to offer sacrifices: "Vow and pay unto the Lord your God, all ye that are round about him, bring presents" [Psalm 76:12]. And indeed this word is repeated frequently in the Scriptures: "to pay a vow", which means to pay and to fulfill what we have promised, of external matters. For the vows of the ancients bound them to external matters, and so the whole practice of vowing was abolished. Not that we cannot vow in the manner mentioned above, but that no one can support their vows with those Scriptures which they usually do. For all the victims, sacrifices, offerings and sacrifices of the law are ended in Christ. Therefore, the vows of the ancients were mostly incorporated in those offerings, and so they were abolished together. The offering of Christians is innocence, beneficence and prayer: Romans 12 [1], Hebrews 13 [15ff]. But if you look more closely at the books of the ancient prophets, you will find that vows are mostly taken for those things and not for external rites forever.

But those of the Nazarenes and other more learned and pious ones answered that the Lord had commanded many things to the children of Israel, which neither he needed nor delighted in, but commanded them to be done, lest they should be done to demons; but that this rite also was not less abolished than the whole practice of vowing. But that which Paul accepts the vow, rather teaches charity than the practice of vowing, it is testified in the Acts of the Apostles [21:23 ff] and something like it: the circumcision of Timothy, about which also in Galatians 2 [3].

But the place of 1 Timothy 5 [3ff] does not do anything against us. For Paul commands Timothy not to receive quickly or rashly those who feigned foolishness and vowed chastity; for he knew that they lied in many of their promises, and that they did not fulfill what they promised. Therefore, when they change their way of life, let there be a judgment or condemnation (ein fürzug) that they did not fulfill their first promise. So before they make a promise, he advises to refrain from a foolish purpose; hence we clearly understand that condemnation is not taken here for the condemnation of the soul, but for the stain of infamy. Read the entire passage of Paul, and it will appear to what he agrees!

These are, Vernhere, my most beloved brother, what we had to say about vows and we dedicate them to you - however inadequate they may be, they are certainly not entirely impious - and we pray that you may consider these few things for the good.

Farewell, and give my warmest regards to our teacher Pellicanus.

On the eve of the calends of November, 1530.
