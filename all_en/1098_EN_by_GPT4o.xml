      <p>Greetings. What do you say, most excellent and beloved Bullinger, that perhaps I was offended by your letter? So far from being offended by it, I have rather recognized your singular love for me more truly, more clearly, and more certainly from it. For I know it is the nature of true friendship to advise and be advised, for one to do so freely, not harshly, and for the other to accept it patiently, not with resistance.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would prefer not only to be advised by a friend but also to be reproved and corrected rather than by an enemy. I omit here the sayings of David and Solomon on this subject; for who brings owls to Athens, who says these things to you. Therefore, know that I was neither offended nor was there any reason for me to be offended. For your letter was gentle in words, serious in thought, free in admonition, delightful in love. As for why I did not reply then, it was not done because I did not think it necessary; but when you sent the fourth Decade of your sermons, I was so distracted and almost overwhelmed not only by business but also by cares, that I could hardly breathe freely, although even now some rivals do not allow me to rest, about whom, when they reveal themselves more, you will understand. And there is no reason to suspect anything bad: there is nothing, except that, envying our honor and peace, they try to bring to light things that are forgotten and buried.</p>
      <p>But while my conscience consoles me, so does the fact that their envy and the cause of their envy are known to all good people. But enough about this matter. I have touched on these few things so that you may understand that I am not always in control of myself, so that I can perform what I owe, as cares sometimes take me away from myself. Added to this is the constraint of my domestic affairs, which exercises me day and night with mercenary labors so much that I am forced to make a loss of health; for even now, while writing this, I am lying down from a certain distillation of the brain, which often torments me. However, do not think that if I write less, I love and honor you less; for nothing can ever diminish my goodwill and respect for you at any time or by any chance. This is done by piety, by your love towards me, which shows itself in every way, by the merits with which I have been affected by you, which no oblivion can erase. This young man, whom you have often recommended to me, has always been most commendable and dear to me; he himself is a witness.</p>
      <p>But now he returns to you; I do not know what he has decided. He always seemed good to me, but somewhat duller and less suited to the cultivation of letters. So it seemed to the supreme artist God, who has tempered these natures. Our Perna is there with you, who, as I think, is taking care of printing the New Testament in Italian; I commend him to you as a good and simple man and very friendly to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most excellent brother and patron, and in my name and in the name of my wife and children, greet your wife, children, and relatives, and also in my name the best and most learned brothers. Basel, December 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, who always wrote, Celio Secondo Curione.</p>
