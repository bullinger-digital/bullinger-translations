    <p xml:id="regest1">Report on the entry of the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, the [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse, and other princes into Donauwörth, after Vogler was allowed to accompany the two mayors of Augsburg, Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser, there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- First (according to Herbrot's record) the list of princes (allegedly eleven) who rode into Donauwörth: The Elector of Saxony, his eldest son [Johann Friedrich II.] and his brother [Johann Ernst of Saxe-Coburg], the Landgrave of Hesse, three princes of Brunswick, Duke Franz of Lüneburg, and Prince [Wolfgang] of Anhalt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- It is believed that the military campaign of these princes comprises 6,000 cavalrymen and 20,000 infantrymen. Many more soldiers are expected to follow. Below is the description of the processions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Preliminary report: Vogler arrived in Donauwörth with both mayors on Wednesday, August 4. The following day, they went to a hill where the Landgrave was located, but his camp had not yet been set up. When both mayors requested an audience, they were told that the Landgrave would see them the next day. [On Friday, August 6] they were indeed admitted to the meeting of the two princes and their war councils. During this, letters arrived one after another, which the Landgrave quickly read through himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- When Vogler, Welser, and Herbrot [later] went to the camps of the two princes, they rode past the two camps, which were set up near the Danube and Lech, already in the territory of Duke [Wilhelm IV.] of Bavaria, near Rain. These camps were exceedingly impressive!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Both [military columns] have meanwhile advanced further into Bavaria, which 18 companies (including a Swiss one with 600 men) had already done a few days earlier after leaving Donauwörth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The mayors were accompanied by about 65 riders from Herbrot's guild of merchants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse wrote a letter to Emperor [Charles V.] and renounced their allegiance to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- They also wrote to the Duke of Bavaria, urging him to finally choose a side.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Emperor has moved from Regensburg to Landshut.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The Italian and Spanish troops are now with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- During the two days [August 5 and 6], a total of 84 companies passed through Donauwörth (not counting the [aforementioned 18] companies of the South Germans and Swiss).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Description of the entry of the Landgrave's troops into Donauwörth on August 5, lasting from 5 to 3:30 PM. The procession was led by the baggage, followed (according to Hessian custom) by the women and children. Often, a rooster or a hen [in reference to the Hessian coat of arms] as well as dogs could be seen with the wagons. [A description of the procession follows, mentioning, among other things, the five companies that previously served King [Francis I.] of France (namely in his war against England) and were sent to the Landgrave by the people of Strasbourg. Two banner inscriptions are also mentioned.]</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- On August 8, Augsburg sent four large cannons to the camp [of the princes] along with about 100 wagons loaded with ammunition, weapons, and provisions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Description of the entry of the Elector of Saxony's troops on August 6. [Vogler recalls that] during the two days, a total of 84 companies passed through Donauwörth before settling in Rain [on the Lech]; that six more companies had previously passed through Donauwörth; that meanwhile, the 18 companies (including the Swiss company) had joined the companies [of the princes]. The Elector's procession lasted from 5 to 3 PM. [A description of the procession follows, mentioning Duke Ernst of Brunswick-[Grubenhagen] and Lord Henning of Burtfeld].</p>
