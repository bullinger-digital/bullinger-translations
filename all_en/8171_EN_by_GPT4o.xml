      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, beloved brother, and I congratulate you, for the Lord has made you a parent with a new child; may the same Lord bless her, you, and your wife, whom I am glad to hear has given birth safely. Having often experienced what it is to have more children and a wife in childbirth, and how many responsibilities arise, I easily forgive you for being brief in your writing. I will send the letters destined for Basel through the first safe courier; for I sensed that money was enclosed, from which I understand that greater trust and diligence are needed. I will do what I can.</p>
      <p>I ask you to kindly convey my warmest regards to Campell and all those you mentioned to me. I received quite detailed letters from Lyon, Geneva, Bern, Nuremberg, Heidelberg, and elsewhere. The main topic of all is the imperial diet to be convened in Augsburg, which some indeed think will certainly proceed, while others doubt. I think it will be convened due to the Turkish matters, unless it has already been announced.</p>
      <p>The general Swiss diet is also scheduled by our people for the 26th of this month in Baden, as you know. In France, they write that the admiral is wintering not far from Toulouse; the royalists are preparing and resisting them; the king is in Paris; there is talk of peace, which some suspect will be deceitful, others tolerable, because both sides are weary of war. May the Lord grant a good peace! Alba is cruelly raging in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>It is believed that he has stirred up sedition in England with the help of others. Northumberland had gathered about 18,000 insurgents against the queen. She led over 30,000; before they clashed, she offered peace and pardon to all who returned home.</p>
      <p>Therefore, more than a third defected from Northumberland; others and the remaining are said to have dispersed, the instigators of the troubles besieged in a certain fortress.</p>
      <p>Northumberland, however, was taken captive and led to the Tower of London. It is said the sedition has been suppressed. In Spain, the Moors are said to be advancing successfully, the king leaving Madrid to advance to CÃ³rdoba, the grand master of Malta seeking help from the Spaniard. There are countless other matters of this kind, which I do not have time to write. Let us pray to the Lord to have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you. I wrote this in great haste. Also, greet Doctor Ruinella.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 10th February 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
