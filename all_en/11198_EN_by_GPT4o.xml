    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the booklets sent through [Eberhard von RÃ¼mlang]. Is unjustly accused of having distributed a writing by Bucer that is disadvantageous to the people of Zurich following the meeting in Zurich. Has only shown the explanation presented by Bucer, which corresponds to the [First Helvetic] Confession, to Sebastian [Meyer] and otherwise only spoke about it kindly. Asks to accept his justification and to express criticism openly.</p>

      <p>Honorable, well-educated, esteemed sir, I offer you my complete willing service, etc.</p>
      <p>Following this, I thank you most highly for the booklets you sent me through my lord's treasurer. Such things are meant for me to earn your favor.</p>
      <p>Then I hear that some of my detractors have slandered me to you, concerning the matter of the sacrament and the concord that took place at the meeting in Zurich, as if I had given you much offense in the aforementioned matter, which occurred between you and the learned men of Strasbourg, and that somewhere a booklet, issued by Bucer, was circulated, which might be against you, etc. You should know that I am not involved in this unpleasant affair; for it would deeply grieve me if I were to cause any discord between you and so many dear, highly learned, pious men. For unfortunately, too many evil seeds have been sown so far, and there are still too many restless heads, as I fear, who would gladly cause discord between you and us. But knowing that I have not spoken anything about the aforementioned matter, except what is in accordance with the truth, and especially praised you for always desiring that this sacrament matter be clearly and with cheerful words presented to the common people, etc.</p>
      <p>And it is not the case, as Master Martin Bucer has given his interpretation and response in writing about this past contentious article, as you well know, that I have taken it; for my understanding was well pleased with that explanation, herewith having scolded no one, in my opinion also satisfying everyone and not harming anyone, except those who are against the truth and the confession, as presented by you and other pious, learned preachers in Basel, etc. I have given this booklet to no one except Doctor Sebastian, our preacher, who was greatly delighted with all the proceedings of the aforementioned agreement. Besides, I have praised with truth to everyone that your lords, our faithful, dear confederates, have done us much honor and good company, and also that you, along with your worthy chapter lords, have done us, to which I know nothing else, than that you all generally parted with us all, who were at the aforementioned meeting, well and with good peace of all things, which everyone among us rejoiced and praised God for.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you hereby, to excuse me from such useless talk, which might embitter you against me and many other good lords and friends in the city of Bern, who bear special favor towards you; for no one has the intention or mind to hinder or scold you. You should believe this in good faith and not let your good willing mind, which you have towards this common Christian peace, be turned away by our detractors in any way, as I have no doubt about it, etc. And I ask you thereby, if you find any fault or deficiency in this matter with me or others, to inform me of it; God willing, you will always be met with a proper response and always found in willing service by me with God's help. May He grant us all His grace and peace of His word.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern on the 5th of August in the year 1538. Your willing</p>
      <p>Bernhard Tillmann.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-educated Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the praiseworthy city of Zurich, his esteemed lord and good friend.</p>
