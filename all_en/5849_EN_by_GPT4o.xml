      <p>S. D. The insolence of our Cantons is incredible and intolerable.</p>
      <p>They exalt their victories won in France to the heavens.</p>
      <p>They say that our soldiers, though few in number, have routed, scattered, and defeated those French who have become heretics, otherwise strong, as well as the German knights, and now the indomitable English nation: from which it is clear that our religion or faith, which we strive to defend and preserve intact in France, is the true and victorious faith, and it is required of us to persecute that vile heresy everywhere and in all heretics, and never to abandon such a victorious faith, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you have done us all a most pleasing service by indicating in your latest letters that the king has received the Port of Grace by surrender.</p>
      <p>And so we thank you for those letters written on the 12th of this month.</p>
      <p>The students delivered them promptly.</p>
      <p>We can respond from them to those whom the Cantons try to drive mad with their vain boasting.</p>
      <p>And would that our Jonville would sometime describe the entire history of that recovery a little more fully.</p>
      <p>For the rumor is that many on both sides fell before the surrender, many also from the Swiss soldiers.</p>
      <p>Froschauer the younger received the Admiral's response to Pultrot's confessions and promised to print it, if not in this city, then elsewhere.</p>
      <p>However, the translator completed it rather late. When I receive the copies, I will send one or two to you.</p>
      <p>What I said would happen last summer, I now announce has happened.</p>
      <p>I said that the Duke of W端rttemberg was diligently working to impose and commend Brentius's doctrine of the Supper and ubiquity to some in France.</p>
      <p>Now indeed a certain friend from T端bingen writes in these words: The Duke was here a few days ago, he brought with him a certain Lithuanian prince, a very young boy, who they say will study literature in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>During dinner, the W端rttemberger said he was greatly surprised that among other doctrines of the Supper, the Zwinglians find it most absurd that God is said to be in every herb, stone, and even in the devil.</p>
      <p>Your Brentius was also present then, who is said to be writing a new book against you, or even has already completed it.</p>
      <p>The Brentian Catechism, about which I wrote to you this summer, has long since been translated into French and printed.</p>
      <p>All the copies were sent to him by the prince's order, and about 200 of them were collected in this city, which were sent to France.</p>
      <p>Many others will also be sent at the prince's expense. He tries by all means to introduce that gross Lutheran doctrine of the Supper against Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and Calvin into the French churches.</p>
      <p>Would that his efforts may come to nothing, and that no dissension may arise in France that would impede the course of the gospel as it did in Germany, etc.</p>
      <p>These things from T端bingen.</p>
      <p>However, I thought it was my duty to seriously and promptly inform you of this, so that with your vigilance and diligence you may counteract these wicked attempts.</p>
      <p>Besides, I have nothing to write at present. All of ours send their greetings to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Especially, you will most kindly greet our Jonville.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 22, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
