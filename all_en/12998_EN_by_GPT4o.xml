    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] In response to Bullinger's question [in No. 2934], Gast informs that he has received the money for the wool. His wife [Apollonia, née Glaser] thanks for the gift, but it was too much of a good thing! She will soon reciprocate to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] in another way. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] In Basel, there are only unverified rumors. However, it is certain that a priest [...] died miserably in Sundgau these days. He was formerly a Dominican monk in Basel, left the monastery, became a barber, ran his own barbershop for several years, and even attended medical lectures. But the devil led him back to Papism. He left his wife [...] (who did not want to stay with such a scoundrel) and took on a parish office. He lived in Papism for eleven years, in debauchery and drunkenness, without any shame. Then he became ill and lay bedridden for a long time. His maid [...] also left him. Since he held a rural parish office, the poor man had to die at home alone and abandoned by all. The peasant women laid his body on the ground the day before the burial, but at night pigs came into the house and ate his head and hands. Thus, the Lord punished him even beyond death! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria was commissioned by Emperor Charles V to send cavalry and infantry to Naples and Bologna. He seems to disregard the danger posed by Sultan Suleiman! Some captains are lurking around Basel who do not want to serve the Emperor. No one knows what they are planning. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] The Basel council has issued a mandate against drunkenness and blasphemy in all guilds. Hopefully, it will also ensure its enforcement! </p>

      <p>Safe in the Lord. I have received the money for the wool, as you have written, and my wife expresses great thanks for the honorary gift, which is too much of a good thing! But she will soon reciprocate to your dear wife in another way and that too soon, etc.</p>

      <p>We have nothing new. Rumors are flying everywhere, but they are uncertain. However, it is certain that a priest died miserably in Sundgau these days. He was once a Dominican monk in Basel, who had cast off the monastic habit and learned the barber's trade, so that he had his own barbershop with us for several years and even attended medical lectures. But with Satan deceiving him, he adhered again to Papism and, leaving his wife, took on the office of a pastor. His wife did not want to follow the scoundrel. He lived for 11 years in Papism, in debauchery, drunkenness. He was ashamed of none of his crimes. But he fell into a severe illness and lay bedridden for a long time. His maid abandoned him. He was a burden to the peasants, and thus the wretched man, abandoned by all, died alone at home. The peasant women placed his body on the floor of the house, waiting for the next day for burial. But during the night, pigs came into the house and devoured his head and hands - a cruel spectacle! Thus God avenged his treachery even after death.</p>

      <p>The Bavarian sends cavalry and infantry to Italy to wage war on behalf of the Emperor against the Neapolitans or Bolognese. He disregards the Turk, I wish not to his greatest detriment. Many captains are with us who do not want to serve the Emperor. They wander here and there. I do not know what they are plotting.</p>

      <p>Our senate has published a most Christian mandate in all guilds against drunkards and blasphemers. May it continue in execution!</p>
