      <p>S. I cannot pass by without writing to you, albeit distracted, if I have gathered anything from the various rumors of people.</p>
      <p>Dr. Carolus sends you many greetings and today, discussing various matters with me after the sermon, he said these words from the mouth of the interpreter: the king has commanded his captains and leaders to perform their duties diligently, and whatever may bear arms, given the signal to battle; he has this proclaimed everywhere in his cities, so that young and old may be ready for battle, if necessary. The interpreter boasts much about this matter; but Dr. Carolus predicts that this is the last refuge and the final effort, and considers it a sign of great misfortune. Today, a brave soldier from Lagnetz in the Upper Punt has come here; he reports that he was still in the camp for 3 weeks, and comes to us, as we were discussing together (as mentioned above). He has moved on from here, had 12 guilders in his pocket and was well-dressed; now he has only a broomstick under his arm, no coin, no sword, has been plundered by horsemen along with many others. He is a true soldier, has often been in France; but he says he has never experienced such a miserable war. The leaders treat them badly, withholding their pay. A small measure of wine costs 10 to 12 kreuzers, 2 loaves of bread cost 1 French groschen; great hunger, great death, and pestilence among them. - Our Zipperlin from Vellthur, who is a quartermaster, is said to have gone to the hospital in Troyes in Champagne and asked how many have died or how many are sick; there he learned that 1000 have died within 3 weeks; 500 are lying sick. All the current soldiers who are returning home say this. How will it go when Jupiter first arrives here, while it is still going on like this in Beltziter(?). He also says for certain that among the Confederates and the PÃ¼nter there is such a disorder and incompetence that many soldiers believe there is not one among them who can even form a battle order. He also consistently says that in Basel, 307 of the discharged soldiers were together, although they did not all leave the camp at the same time. - From Ragatz, one has returned home named Luci Jeger, a brave, honest man; he had 10 gold crowns on his body and armor; yet he says he has lost 100 guilders. He was badly stabbed (as he defended himself against the highwaymen and plunderers) and was robbed of 24 crowns along with his sword, horse, and everything else. - Good father Dr. Collinus could have retrieved his money at less expense; I certainly, as he initially decided, diligently expedited it, and our magistrate was about to send it next week. For he did not know that Cobler had recently left; otherwise, they would have sent it already, before the sworn messenger of your city came here for that reason. I would not want Dr. Collinus to think that I have not fulfilled my promises; for I had scarcely set foot in the city when I informed the magistrate to send someone to prevent expenses, in which matter Dr. Pontisella will be my witness.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed and honored sir, and forgive my nonsense.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 11.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme leader of the Zurich church, his eternally and faithfully honored sir. Zurich.</p>
