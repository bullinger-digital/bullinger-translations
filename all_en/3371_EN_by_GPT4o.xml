      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote you a rather long letter, my most esteemed Bullinger, in which I advised that no occasion for discord should be allowed to arise among the Swiss, between the evangelicals against others and others against you. For many years, many have sought opportunities through which some kind of monster might be introduced among the Swiss. If only I could converse with you for just one hour; I would clearly outline the matter to you, which cannot be safely entrusted to letters. I am sending a fish called "star," which has two "ceulner" (a type of fin); offer this to Dr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>Polwiler is greatly triumphant among his friends due to the very successful outcomes against the Lotharingians and Burgundians. It is certainly written that a truce for seven years has been made between King Ferdinand and the Turk. Weida is said to have contracted an engagement with the daughter of a Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Schnepf, Andreas, Musculus from the Margraviate of the Elector, Sarcerius, and Victorinus have been excluded from the colloquy due to their obstinacy in the matter of the sacrament. It is remarkable how much your little book on the matter of the Eucharist pleases me; it pleases many good men to whom I have secretly communicated it. I do not see what more could be desired in this matter.</p>
      <p>A most worthless scoundrel named Ko√üler, who is causing trouble for your mint and also for other public matters in the empire, is neither capable in mind nor in prudence, but he has a most avaricious and more rapacious than harpies advisor and director named Zehender, formerly a mint master here, under whose instigation everything is done. I am not allowed to say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, 19th of October, in the year 57.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, most dear lord and friend.</p>
