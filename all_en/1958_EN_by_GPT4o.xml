      <p>Strasbourg, 16th August 1553.</p>
      <p>Greetings. What I wrote in the previous letters, esteemed Bullinger, is confirmed day by day and is augmented by the writings of the best men. That monstrous being, more a monster than a man, the Duke of Northumberland, has nourished horrendous and portentous things: a trustworthy source indeed writes that our excellent king was most disgracefully removed by poison. Before he died, his nails and hair fell out, so much so that he completely lost his form, otherwise most handsome. The authors of the poisoning were ashamed to display the body of the deceased king to the people during the funeral (as is customary); therefore, they secretly buried him in his palace's park and placed a young man not so dissimilar to him, whom they had killed with a sword, in his place for viewing. This was confessed by one of the Duke of Northumberland's sons. The Duke, along with five sons and nearly twenty nobles, was captured, among whom were also Lord Cheke, Lord Doctor Cox, and the Bishop of London, along with others unknown to you by name or reputation.</p>
      <p>It is believed that they consented and supported that Joanna, the Duke's son's wife, should be declared queen; if this is true, it is over for them.</p>
      <p>The King of France wrote to the city of Calais and Guines, instructing the citizens to leave their homes and leave the city and the castle of Guines empty for him; this was promised to him by the English counselors. The Duke, along with the captives with him, is considered guilty of this crime. In England, soldiers are being gathered to fortify the city and territory. I fear that your Swiss may have been gathered against ours.</p>
      <p>You see, dearest Bullinger, how you are deprived of all your expectations regarding our England; therefore, see what should be decided about your son. My house is open to him, and help will not be lacking. Farewell and please diligently greet all the learned men, and I am immensely grateful to all of you for the kindness shown to me.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind lord preacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
