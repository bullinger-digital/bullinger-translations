      <p> Greetings. All your previous and recent letters, even the latest ones sent to us through our public courier, have been faithfully delivered, and I would have responded to you eight days ago if there had been even one person to whom I could entrust my letters. I had entrusted our Lucius Nyero to diligently search for someone trustworthy; he replied that there was not even one here, and I am writing this now, still unaware if there are any today; if none are found, I will defer to the next available person. As for your question, I would encourage the citizens, as a friend, to pursue peace and not to make enemies and adversaries of those who offer friendship and do not demand anything unjust, unless absolutely necessary, and to act with just reasons and not with insane and furious force in what needs to be done. They should always consider what pertains to peace and the preservation of the republic, wives, and children, etc. Therefore, I approve of what you write about selected men considering the calling of public assemblies, in which the complaints of communities are heard, and then to decree that the good and just be defended by law and that the wicked and unjust be punished and restrained. </p>
      <p> I sincerely pray to the Lord, the director of hearts and the avenger of evil and protector of the good, that He may resolve your dissensions, raise justice, and suppress injustice. </p>
      <p> I have written to the best in Bern about what is happening with you, imploring them to pray to the Lord for a successful outcome, and I now hear that a Bernese courier has arrived here; what he brings, I do not know. The people of Basel wrote to our most honorable senate this week, reciting and affirming as certain the things I previously sent to you about the victory of the Gueux against the Spaniards in Holland at Haarlem. </p>
      <p> As for the state of the French kingdom, which I also received this week, I send it written down; you will share it with Mr. Willi and Mr. Campell, and be wise and strong in the Lord's business. </p>
      <p> May God bless you and keep you! Greet everyone. From ZÃ¼rich, most swiftly. March 13, 1573. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. </p>
