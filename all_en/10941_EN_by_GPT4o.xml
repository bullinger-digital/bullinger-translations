      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Balthasar von Kuenring, the baron, wrote a letter to me. He was with you last year, if I am not mistaken, to see the church and seek advice. What he discussed with me in person then, he now also addresses in writing, and very anxiously at that. Among other things, he writes: "Whenever I consider in my mind the responsibility of governing those whom God has entrusted to me, I can find no other conclusion than that he has only truly taken up the helm who not only oversees the bodies and external goods but also, and much more importantly, ensures that the souls of his subjects are imbued with the living word, so that many may be gained. Therefore, my dear Zwick, I send this message to you, and I earnestly and sincerely request that you arrange for someone to be sent to me to shepherd my people. I desire such a person to be in accordance with Paul's doctrine, etc., especially one who can adapt to the times, just as the prince of the apostles was all things to all people, so that he might gain some for Christ, and even circumcised Timothy; one who holds nothing dearer than Christ, whom neither death nor life can separate from the Savior. For I myself would wish to pour out my blood for the glory of Christ, if I were found worthy of martyrdom. Understand your calling, assist those who are eager to hear the word of God; send someone who can also sow spiritual seeds among us. As for the stipend: What I promised before, I will give even more, etc. I await your response, and my hope will not deceive me, that I will receive a minister of the word of God," etc.</p>
      <p>Now, let me know through this messenger if there is anyone with you who could be sent by me to this excellent man. However, it would be necessary for him to have a gentle and fair disposition and an exceedingly tolerant spirit.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more. For I am preparing for my journey to Ambrosius [Blarer] [in Tübingen]. Pray for me and write back. Then I beseech you to send me the copy of my letter that Leo [Jud] translated into German.</p>
      <p>Farewell, farewell, my brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>5th of October.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zurich, my dearest brother.</p>
