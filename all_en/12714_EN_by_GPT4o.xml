    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Schuler wrote about three weeks ago [with No. 2646], but was very reserved in transmitting his news to avoid putting the letter carriers in danger. Unfortunately, he was negligent when writing letters was still possible without problems. Now he would like to write, but he is no longer allowed to...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The bearer [...], whose credibility is known to Bullinger, will report on the state of the war. He is a pious patrician who leads a company of Memmingen citizens as an ensign. There are several Swiss mercenaries from Zurich in the garrison. They are holding up bravely and well. If all mercenaries were like them, much could be accomplished!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The [Schmalkaldic League] fights in a much too considerate manner, which the Papists exploit with outrageous impudence. [Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], the furious carnal [Bishop] of Augsburg, behaves like a traitor to his country. Upon the withdrawal [of the troops], he will probably reclaim his land unless God prevents it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Otherwise, no enemy attack is to be feared this year. What spring will bring remains to be seen. Certainly, the former Emperor [Charles V] will still undertake everything against the [Schmalkaldic League] and would rather ally with [Suleiman I] [than give up]. This is what the motto "Plus ultra" of this truth-hostile creature is capable of!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Therefore, let us hold on to God, so that with His favor we, as pious Germans, remain faithful to one another to preserve the Gospel and the freedom of the fatherland! Schuler and others feel very clearly that Bullinger also exhorts his pious Zurichers in this regard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler], to the children, to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and to all colleagues. Greetings from Mayor [Balthasar] Funk, from the physician Ulrich [Wolfhart], and from all colleagues, especially Johannes Schmid. May the Lord preserve [Bullinger and his people]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] P.S.: The people of Memmingen are well and await the coming of the Lord.</p>

      <p>Dear, friendly lord and brother. I wrote to you about three weeks ago, but not as openly as I would have liked, considering the dangerous times, where it is good and necessary to spare the messengers. Therefore, please take my writing in good faith. When I could, I was negligent. Now, when I would like to, I am not allowed. It is like a lid over the pot.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for the state of the war with us, you will learn well and sufficiently from the bearer of this letter, whose credibility you can trust, as you well know. He is an ensign over a company of citizens in our city and conducts himself admirably in this time of our tribulation, as befits a pious patrician. We have several Swiss from Zurich under one company in our garrison, excellent, honest people who conduct themselves very well. How much good we could accomplish if we had a few thousand such people! They bring joy to my heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Besides, it seems to me that we are fighting with too much mercy, which the miserable Papists use for too much impudence and wantonness. The carnal [Bishop] of Augsburg is raging madly and furiously. He behaves as a traitor to his own fatherland would. We expect a conflict now in the withdrawal: Otto will reclaim his land unless God prevents it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing to fear from an enemy attack this year. What spring will bring, time will reveal. All sensible people expect that Charles, the former emperor, will, out of greed, envy, hatred, and arrogant, tyrannical spirit, lay all his power upon us before he turns against the Turks. That is what "plus ultra" can do! There is no worse beast on earth than a godless enemy of the truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Therefore, dear, friendly brother, it will be necessary for us to turn to God properly, so that we may have His favor and then unite our heads as one and, as pious Germans, mean well with each other, so that we may remain with His holy word and the freedom of our fatherland. I also want to exhort your pious Zurichers, as I have no doubt you do, and we will feel it well here. Then we will, without doubt, experience God's mighty hand with joy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet your dear wife and children a thousand times for me, Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Theodor, and all dear brothers. Consul Funk, Dr. Ulrich the physician, and all dear brothers, especially Johannes Schmid, greet you. May the Lord preserve you for fruitful work in His vineyard for a long life! Given at Memmingen, November 10, 1546. Your old dear friend and brother, by my own hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>We are all fresh and healthy and wait with patience for the Lord's hour.</p>
      <p>To the pious, God-fearing Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the Gospel of Christ in Zurich, my dear, friendly lord and brother.</p>
