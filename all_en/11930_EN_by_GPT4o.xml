    <p xml:id="regest1">At the Imperial Diet [in Speyer], they are still waiting for King Ferdinand. A priest reported from Vienna about an agreement between Viennese and Turkish merchants, which allows them to bring their goods to market in Vienna and Buda. Gast's wife [Apollonia, née Glaser] gives a pair of knives to the wives of Bullinger [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and Theodor [Bibliander], [Rosilla, née Rordorf]. He will inquire about newly published books this week; sends greetings to [Bibliander] and intends to send the [Apocalypse commentary of] Primasius, completed today, to him and Bullinger soon. He asks for support for the bearer of the letter; this person will report on his concerns orally, or [Bartholomäus] Westheimer will write in detail.</p>

      <p>Most learned Bullinger. I hear nothing certain from the Imperial Diet. King Ferdinand is still expected. If he arrives, perhaps the affairs of the empire will be addressed. A certain priest was with me these days, who was in Vienna a month ago, and he said that the Viennese merchants made an agreement with the Turks, so that they can now trade safely, and he saw more than 800 Turks freely entering and leaving at the last Viennese market, and the Viennese also display and successfully sell their goods in Buda. What this alliance means, I can easily guess.</p>
      <p>Farewell. April 1, 1544.</p>
      <p>My wife sends to your wife and Mr. Theodor's wife each a pair of knives and asks them, along with this, to accept a small token of goodwill, which is done with all good intentions, and not to disdain it, and she greets you and your wives in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Regarding the books completed at our place this fair, I have not yet been able to inquire; but I will accomplish this during the week. You will greet Mr. Theodor in my name. You and Theodor will soon have Primasius; for it is completed today.</p>
      <p>If you can assist the bearer of the letter in any matter - for he has business with a certain person from Zurich - I ask you to serve me in this matter. He will explain the business, or Westheimer will write in great detail.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend. To Zurich.</p>
