      <p>Greetings. Clebitius returns to you, a man whose talent and memory we have all admired. He did not insist too much on having a position with us; for he himself prefers to return to Heidelberg, following your advice. Therefore, we have obtained for him from our magistrate a recommendation to the Elector Palatine and an honorable travel allowance, and we pray to the Lord that He may wish to protect, encourage, and preserve him for the defense and propagation of His truth. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, on the first day of November 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
