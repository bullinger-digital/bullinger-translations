    <p xml:id="regest1">After Easter, Johann Wilden sent a letter to Bullinger, as mentioned above in No. 384. Reiterates the promise to write, even if there is nothing to report. News about the siege of the city of Münster by the bishop and the defiant resistance of the inhabitants. The people of Soest are also called "Sacramentarians," but in Bitter's opinion, they could still be saved. Requests the sending of Vadian's Epitome and news from Zurich. In the matter of the altar sacrament, Bullinger should not rely too much on himself and should read the works of Alger and Guitmund recommended by Erasmus. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My willing service, what I can do for your good pleasure, dear and good friend, as always, dear friend Henricus.</p>
      <p>Know that I, along with the friends, am in decent health and well-being, thanks be to the Lord, which always delights me to hear from you, also about your beloved wife and children. Not long after Easter, I sent a letter to you with my good friend Johan Wilden, armorer, citizen of Cologne. I do not know if it reached you. In it (I have rightly included), among other things, is a request that you do not take my negligence, which has happened several times in writing back, as suspicion, and besides that, I assure you: Even if I have nothing special to write, I would, before leaving it unwritten, write just the word "farewell." I am still of that opinion. Therefore, I have prepared this little letter, although I did not particularly know what to write. For the Münster affair, I assume, is sufficiently spread among you. Now, whether that is the case or not, know that the Anabaptist faction within Münster has become powerful through one named Stuten Bernt. They have therefore wanted to establish their way of life (as you well know), tolerate no authority, have all goods in common, rebaptize, divorce, etc. So much so that the cathedral canons and furthermore other citizens, approximately (as they say) six hundred, had to flee and seek help from their bishop, who then took it to heart and, together with more princes, namely the bishop of Cologne and the duke of Jülich personally and the sent mercenaries of the duke of Guelders and the bishops of Liège and Trier, fortified the city at five places, before Palm Sunday until today, with the intention of turning them from their evil, poisonous intentions without great bloodshed and the destruction of the city. However, since this cannot succeed, because there is a defiant, foolish assembly within Münster, which often gives itself out of the city into the camp and has done much damage, the princes are now of the serious opinion to completely destroy such a city with those who are in it. And it has now come to the point that one gate after another can no longer be recognized. And they intend, it is said, to storm the city the day after tomorrow. How it will fare, God knows. I suspect they cannot hold out, for many hands kill the hare, and they have no relief at all.</p>
      <p>The poor people are miserably led astray under the guise of the gospel. They cry and call continually for instruction from the scripture, and otherwise refuse to deviate from their course of action. This is briefly about Münster. How it will turn out, I will not hide next time.</p>
      <p>As for the people of Soest, not much good is said, and they are called Sacramentarians. However, I do believe they will not be easily attacked, for they are in alliance with more cities; they can be reasoned with. They have also not delayed themselves, if God is otherwise with them, etc.</p>
      <p>I thank you, dear Henricus, for all the good and your books, with which you honor me. I do not know how to repay you, and I ask again, do not delay the compendium of Vadian in the Acts of the Apostles as you promised. I also desire to know the dealings of your fatherland. Furthermore, I ask: Do not rely too much on yourself, and do read Alvarus and Guimundus on the Sacrament of the Altar. For Erasmus writes, he has read them with no small benefit. I, however, have not seen them, but I believe they are worth obtaining. We are young, can be led astray. Take it for good, for I wish you well as myself.</p>
      <p>Entrusted to the Lord, and greet your wife, your brother, and other friends a thousandfold.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, on the 30th day of August in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Diderich Bitter von Wipperfoird, your favorable friend.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my favorable good friend, to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
