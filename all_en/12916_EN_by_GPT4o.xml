    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Georg Frölich will tell all the news, especially the memorable deeds of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. Augsburg's future is completely uncertain. The priests and Emperor Charles V will not rest until they have crucified Christ! May the Lord save His Church, which is now threatened by its former supports!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should strengthen Frölich so that he does not abandon the Augsburg church. Within a month, he has changed a lot! However, he is unlikely to have been bribed. He probably behaves differently to inspire courage in the pastors. But at some point, he might recognize the omnipresent corruption and give up any hope for improvement. Haller knows what he is talking about!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] That is why Michael Keller is also writing [No. 2865]. Wolfgang Musculus also promised to write. May Bullinger recognize from these letters that the pastors do not want to leave Augsburg out of fear or without reason.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Haller must break off, for he only learned of Frölich's departure when he was already about to mount his horse. He asked him to wait for this little letter and also asked Keller to write briefly. He does not trust many people who are still appreciated by the Zurichers far from Augsburg! One day, perhaps, Haller will reveal everything to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] He can hardly keep Thoman Ruman in Augsburg. In the next letter, Bullinger should encourage the impatient one. Where Hans Wilpert Zoller is, is a mystery. Haller's brother Wolfgang should send the already copied notes on [Bullinger's] sermons on the Acts of the Apostles. Haller wants to start preaching on this book after Easter. He is moving into the apartment of Bernardino Ochino, while Sebastian Lepusculus or Ruman will take over his previous apartment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to colleagues and family. In haste.</p>

      <p>S. P. Regarding the new developments, you will learn everything from Mr. Frölich. There are indeed many memorable things happening with the Saxon. Our situation is so uncertain that it is hardly possible to predict what will happen tomorrow. The priests and their Emperor will not cease until Christ is crucified! May the Lord come to the aid of His Church! For I see those who once seemed to be its pillars now threatening to collapse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Strengthen and advise Mr. Frölich not to abandon the cause of the Church. I do not know why he has changed so much within a month or two, whether he has been softened by gifts (which I do not willingly believe), or whether he does this to console us. Perhaps he sees everything as so corrupt that an easy remedy is not possible. I do not warn without reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>That is why Keller is also writing. Musculus will also write at some point (for he promised), so do not think we are either fearful or seeking to leave without cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I cannot write more now, for I did not know he was about to leave until he was already booted and ready to mount his horse. I asked him to wait for me to write even one line. Meanwhile, I also asked Keller to write even one word, for many are suspect to him, about whom you, being far away, think well. I do not willingly write much. However, I will tell everything someday, if the Lord grants us to meet.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I can hardly keep Thoman Ruman with me. He is somewhat more impatient. Therefore, I ask you to encourage him in your next letters. I wonder where Zoller has remained. Advise my brother to send any notes he has copied on the Acts. For I will begin after Easter. I am moving into the house of Bernardino Ochino. Lepusculus or Ruman will succeed me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell. I wish all the brothers well along with your family. In great haste. March 30, 1547. I, Haller, am forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
