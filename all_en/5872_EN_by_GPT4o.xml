      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Although your virtue alone could have sufficiently attracted me to love you, your letters have done so even more abundantly, in which there was an image of expressed humanity and a certain non-silent image of your spirit, which I had often imagined about you; for I never doubted that if I ever wrote to you, I would receive letters worthy of Bullinger. O fortunate me, I say, to whom with a single letter God, our author of true and holy friendship, has given the way to the friendship of such a man, in which letters you pursue ξιλοπροσ... εσζατα: you excuse, you give thanks, and that for nothing. Then, you wish for what is to be desired for the glory of Christ, the best shepherd, and the salvation of the flock; finally, you advise and encourage me, which my weakness indeed needs. Therefore, for this spirit of yours towards me, I give you, hold, and will always hold the thanks I can; for I cannot promise to repay, but I can certainly hold. However, I would like you to be persuaded of this, most learned Bullinger, that you will find no one who loves you more, respects you, and admires your elegance in writing (for I have begun to taste some of your works) more, which indeed, if you wish to test, you will easily recognize. May God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, keep you long-lived and fulfill your desires, and guide you with His holy spirit for the preservation of His church. Farewell, the best instrument and chosen vessel for the glory of Christ, and allow Grasser to be in your debt.</p>
      <p>Brothers Severin and Battmann greet you.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 6, 1563. Hastily in the evening. Your most devoted servant, Jonas Grasser of Basel.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Master Heinrich Bullinger, most sincere theologian, most faithful doctor of the divine word at Zurich, my esteemed lord and very dear brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
