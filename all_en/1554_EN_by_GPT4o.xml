      <p>Valiant, magnificent, excellent, and noble princes and our lords, your most humble and devoted servants, the pastors of the churches of Lausanne, Geneva, and Neuchâtel, most humbly and earnestly beseech your most worthy excellencies to be pleased to write letters as quickly as possible to Mr. Morelet, the envoy of the King of France, who will send your letters to the King of France as quickly as possible, so that he may deign to act more leniently towards the faithful who are detained in his kingdom, ensnared in chains for the sake of Christ's gospel, and that he may wish to free them: especially Hugh Graver, in French Gravier, a minister of the holy gospel in the county of Neuchâtel, who was captured about a month and a half ago, or thereabouts, while passing through Mâcon, in French Macon, and was then, after some time, taken bound in chains to Lyon. There, two months ago, two learned and pious men, one named Claude Monnerius and the other Velutarius, were burned alive with remarkable constancy of faith, just as a little before, with incredible confession of the name of Christ and faith, a certain young man of nineteen years was similarly consumed by slow fire in Paris, who was the brother of the most learned man Francis of Saint Paul, pastor of the church of Vivarais under the dominion of the lords of Bern. We indeed greatly fear that the same fate may soon befall our fellow minister, the pious and holy man Hugh Graver, unless your excellencies come to his aid. The situation now, most Christian princes and lords, is indeed most worthy of compassion among the French. For recently, some refugees fleeing from there have reported to us that a vast number of men and women, along with their very poor families, have fled from their own homes, especially from the city called Nîmes and the surrounding areas, who now hide in the woods and caves there, perishing from hunger, and do not dare to return to the cities, villages, and their own homes, lest they be immediately recognized, seized, and thrown into prisons with others, since they have been listed in the registers of those who are called inquisitors of the papal faith.</p>
      <p>We therefore humbly ask that it may please your most Christian excellencies to have mercy on them for the name of Christ Jesus, and to write on their behalf to the King of France. Meanwhile, we will pray to the Lord Jesus that he may be pleased to keep you in good and perpetual peace and tranquil happiness, and to retain you in the faith and confession of his word. Amen.</p>
