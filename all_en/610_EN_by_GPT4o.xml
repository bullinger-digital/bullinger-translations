      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I am always amazed, especially when I write to you; therefore, you might wonder why I am always amazed. I am amazed now, too, that I know nothing of the common affairs that are conducted among our people. Here, it was said that not a word was spoken about the oath until, by chance, the Solothurn envoy asked ours what had been decided about the oath; ours responded in such a way that the other did not know what he had answered. Now, what you write, do I not rightly marvel? I am also amazed that you do not mention anything else about Valentinus, about whom I believe you had received word a year ago that you would write. He oppresses us and completely disrupts our churches and secretly contends against us, so that he has gained public authority, which none of us have. I do not know what he says; for it is not allowed to hear, as the sermons almost coincide in time; however, what I experience shows that the man is not suited for the peace that should exist among the preachers of the Gospel of Christ. I have many things I could complain about regarding this inept man; but I will say only one thing that pertains here: he sat among his not insignificant guests, with whom he almost always dines; among other things, the conversation turned to the action that was held with us about the silence of the oath. Then he said: "I know that Myconius and others like to swear according to the old custom by God and his saints; but because you did not agree with them before it was concluded by you, now they are indignant, resisting out of pure envy and stubbornness." See the brother, see the lie, indeed see the damage that can flood into the church because of us. The brother elevates all the authority of the brothers among his own. The lie is evident; for more than half a year ago, I dealt with the matter of the oath, unaware that such a contention would ever arise.</p>
      <p>Moreover, hatred against us and suspicion of arrogance are increased, as if we were such people who seek the first place even in political matters, which has never been thought of us by any good person. In these great evils, we are forced to remain silent, lest we wish to stir up tumult; so many are pleased that they have found someone who does not agree with us. By remaining silent, therefore, we try to quell this evil through the Lord. These things are for you alone.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is reported that Charles, seeing his son more than sufficiently foolish, dismisses all those under whose discipline he has been until now, and places him in the court of his sister, so that, I believe, he may learn to become a king in the women's quarters. It is certain that a huge multitude of these people pass through here.</p>
      <p>It has been announced here for the third time very consistently that the Brandenburgers, together with some other princes, have gathered an army of 26 banners of infantry. Sixteen hundred cavalry have moved camp against Magdeburg. Having divided the army, he sent ahead part of the infantry along with six hundred cavalry, the rest following at a half-day's distance. The first ones have already appeared before the city; the Magdeburgers, having held a brief council, broke out with six banners and 300 cavalry and killed almost half of the cavalry, with many infantry scattered; they scattered the rest, having gained a considerable booty. However, where the remaining part has gone, nothing is said.</p>
      <p>Our scribe writes these things to me. You have again what you can discuss with yours. Add etc.</p>
      <p>Who denies that nothing is sent from Rome here except the holy, after the Mass there, since the chaste mule remains?</p>
      <p>The Lord, shining with a red hat, prepares to drive it in the stable, perhaps in Mainz, as if detesting the thing, he kicks it with his foot, he falls immediately and lies half-dead, still partly uncovered.</p>
      <p>He who was summoned as a witness by the innkeeper calling, the Vicedominus. "This one was more honest," he said, "that one was more wicked."</p>
      <p>From here, placed far away on a litter, he orders to be carried out of the city, where this crime may be hidden.</p>
      <p>For where the sacred synod of the shaven ones was perhaps gathered, then it was, those who should be more chaste.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The last of July, the year 1549.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of the Lord, his venerable brother in Christ. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
