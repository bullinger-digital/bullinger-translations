      <p>Greetings. After it happened by the marvelous providence and singular grace of God that the ministers of all the churches in Switzerland agreed on that Confession, which you have seen before and in which you also agreed with us, it seemed appropriate to publish it with a preface in the name of all of us. We pray that this may be fortunate and successful, with our Lord Jesus Christ blessing our labors.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel responded that they do not find it necessary to join this confession now, as they published their own last year; in other respects, they embrace us as brothers, etc.</p>
      <p>We have been instructed to send 12 copies to you, so that you may distribute them among yourselves and among the principal senators. We have done everything with the common counsel of our magistrate, at whose public expense this matter has finally been completed. It remains, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers, that we first give the greatest thanks to our Lord God for this harmonious agreement of ours, and then that we diligently implore His help, so that He may continue to bless our labors and make our confession bring forth much good fruit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerable men, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers, pray for us, and let us love one another with sincere charity.</p>
      <p>Zürich, March 15, in the year of our Lord 1566.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, in his own name and in the name of all other pastors, professors, and ministers of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety, learning, and vigilance, Johannes Fabricius, and to the other ministers of the church of Chur and the other three Confederations, our esteemed lords and dearest brothers.</p>
