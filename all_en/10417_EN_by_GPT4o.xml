    <p xml:id="regest1">Appointment of Andreas Karlstadt. He has been so warmly recommended to Basel from both the Zurich side and others that the proposal was immediately accepted. Since Karlstadt happened to be in Basel at the time, direct negotiations were held with him at the Synod on May 19; he was then unanimously called to church service in Basel. The only concern of the people of Basel is whether the departure of Karlstadt might cause harm to the church in Zurich. Their decision is therefore only valid if Zurich is willing to release Karlstadt to them.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has not escaped your notice, dearest brothers in the Lord, that our Myconius wrote to you not so long ago, asking if you knew anyone who could assist us in the work of the Gospel, to let us know. This was done in a brotherly manner. Dr. Andreas Karlstadt was recommended with such commendation that he was immediately pleasing to us. Therefore, in these days, as he happened to come to Basel, we did not know what he was going to do, but based on what we had conceived from you about him, it seemed that it could not be more conveniently arranged than while he was present. We therefore sat down to discuss this matter and found from your recommendation, as well as from the multiple commendations of others, that he would be suitable for us and our church, so that we unanimously agreed to receive him. There was one thing that caused us some concern in this matter, which was whether perhaps the removal of Karlstadt might cause any inconvenience to you. For we were in the position that we would rather suffer loss ourselves than the church of Zurich. Therefore, what we have done, we do not wish to be considered as done and confirmed without your consent. If you grant it, let what we have done be ratified; if not, we ask that, as before, you do not hesitate to share with us the care of our church in this regard.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ the Lord and commend us to God in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 25, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your brothers and elders of the church of Basel.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and the other leaders of the Word of the Lord in Zurich, their dearest brothers.</p>
