      <p>Last year, when I visited you to seek a certain position, you requested that I write to you several times, and you promised to do the same. However, this correspondence was interrupted not due to negligence, but due to a lack of messengers. By chance, the bearer of this letter, a man who appears not to be entirely impious, happened to be available, and I entrusted him to deliver this to you, so that you might be informed at least once about my situation. As you criticized me for abandoning literature for a craft entirely alien to the liberal arts, I assured you that I would not pursue it permanently, but only temporarily, to alleviate my poverty until something more suitable came along. I was prepared for any position not beyond my abilities. After waiting several years, nothing was offered until this present year, when the teaching position in Bern became vacant. I sought to be appointed to it with all my effort, using the help of Megander, who certainly took care of my matter as if it were his own and performed the duty of a brother excellently. Meanwhile, while Megander was visiting the brothers' meetings, a sub-teacher from Augsburg - whose teaching and character Megander knows well - was appointed, I believe, through the machinations of Berthold. When Megander returned from the meetings, he was indignant and went to the council, recounting the entire matter as it had been arranged, and managed to have an annual stipend of forty pounds assigned to me until I was called elsewhere. However, due to the injury of a certain slanderer, the council rescinded this decree. Thus, I am quite convinced that by some force and divine will, I am drawn to manual labor. But you, my dear Bullinger, continue to love me as you always have. For I also love you. There is one thing I would like you to do: when you write to Megander, please recommend me to him. For there is nothing I desire more than to be connected, at least in some part, to the fellowship of learned men.</p>
      <p>Our Aenobarbus, Simprecht Vogt, and Jakob Würben, ministers of the word, send their greetings to you. Please also convey my greetings to your wife.</p>
      <p>Farewell, stay healthy with Christ.</p>
      <p>Given on the 17th of January, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ulrich Fischer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, a learned and pious man, and his most beloved patron.</p>
