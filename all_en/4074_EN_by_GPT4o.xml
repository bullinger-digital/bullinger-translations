      <p>Greetings. I received your letter through my nephew and I thank you for informing me more fully about the Savoyard affair; I too was suspicious of what is being done, yet I did not fully understand, since the Duke had begun the matter in this manner. Our envoys received the same response from ours as from yours.</p>
      <p>May the Lord open the eyes of the Confederates, so that they do not decide anything to the ruin of the country and that no window is opened to internal disturbances. We have deserved (I know) more severe things; but let us not cease to invoke the mercy of the Lord and to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>We receive absolutely nothing from France, nor from Germany; however, I expect letters from friends from the Frankfurt market, from which I have no doubt many will reach you; if I receive anything worth knowing, I will not hide it from you. The bearer of this letter, Master WÃ¼rttemberg from Silesia, is recommended by Philipp's testimony extensively, which he will also present to you; he seems to be endowed with a modest and pious nature; whom I know you will receive with your usual kindness. Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, 11th of September, in the year 1559. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed and dear brother.</p>
