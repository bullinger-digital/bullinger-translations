      <p>S. D. Regarding the sacramental concord, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, what the brothers here collectively think is being written to you in a common letter; I cannot disapprove of their opinion. I clearly congratulate the churches on this agreement of yours.</p>
      <p>The document you sent has nothing that disagrees with the previous one, even if something has been added in one or two places.</p>
      <p>Everything is approved, and I wish that all the contentious and superstitious would agree with this opinion. Regarding the publication of this document, it does not seem to me that it would bring as much benefit to the community as it would cause quarrels and disturbances, not because it is not such that it could be very beneficial in itself, but because of the incredible malice of the present times and the disturbance of all things, which I write to you privately, as you wished.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about my affairs at present, except that everything is quite peaceful at my home. My wife is indeed somewhat troubled due to excessive anxiety of mind and concern for necessary things; she feels that we are spending what we have earned due to the smallness of the stipend and therefore fears that someday, when our resources are exhausted, she will be forced to bear poverty with the children. This worry gnaws at her day and night; I wish I could remove it from her mind. It is true, I admit, I am gradually spending what is at hand; yet I hope the Lord will not fail me and mine. What else can I do? when this republic either does not understand or does not care what my necessity is or what use of me could return to this church, but to commend these things to the Lord, who providently cares for all things? As for my wife, I hope she will be of a freer mind after the childbirth, which she judges will be on the 26th of this month, God willing. All my friends send their most friendly greetings to your entire household, your most honorable wife, and children; they will respond to the received letters, but it was not possible now. Farewell excellently, most esteemed of men, and keep your Musculus in your care. Greetings to all the lords and brothers and to our dearest Gervasius in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 10, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, lord and brother in Christ, most dear by far.</p>
