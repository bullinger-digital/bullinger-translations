    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Almost three years ago, a bitter and sophistical polemic was conducted against Pierre Toussain on the question of whether, during the Lord's Supper, the godless and Judas also partake of the body and blood of Christ. At that time, Erb wrote a treatise on this topic, which he sent to Toussain in an unedited form so that he could improve it. He now also sends it to Bullinger, as Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard urged him to do so when he recently sent him Bullinger's [“Consideration whether the traitor Judas also sat at the Lord's table”]. If Bullinger finds the time, he should read and correct it, or even throw it into the oven so that no one takes offense, especially since Erb is well aware that others could treat this topic better with the help of Bible quotes and arguments for the edification of the church. At least Bullinger can derive Erb's view on the “communion of the impious” from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Erb and his colleagues are awaiting the execution of the already imposed sentence by the executioner. However, they count on God, their sure refuge and asylum. Everywhere there are so many ambushes, threats, and enemies that loyalty can no longer be found anywhere!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings to Bullinger's household, the Zurich church, and among others, Rudolf Gwalther and Gerold Meyer von Knonau the Younger! In haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] The people of Zurich should pray for the people of Riquewihr.</p>

      <p>May the grace of the Lord be with you! Almost three years ago, there was a superstitious and sharp dispute involving Pierre Toussain about the communion of the impious and Judas. Toussain wrote to me, and I sent him my thoughts, which I was contemplating at the time, in an unpolished form, just as I am now sending them to you, so that he could refine and polish them with his own intellect. Recently, when the prince sent me your judgment, most learned Bullinger, he wanted me to send you my meditations, etc. Therefore, you have my letters and trifles. If you have time, read, correct, or, if it seems appropriate, consign them to Vulcan, so as not to offend the eyes of the readers. There are indeed those who can address this matter with more solid writings and arguments for the edification of the church. From my writing, you can at least gather what I think about the communion of the impious, etc.</p>

      <p>Here we live no differently than those who, having been sentenced, await the executioner. There are so many ambushes, so many threats, so many adversaries, that nowhere is faith safe! We rely on the Lord, who is the refuge of His own and the safest asylum, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Farewell perpetually with your family and the church of Christ. Greet Mr. Gwalther and Gerold along with the other pious ones. In great haste, Riquewihr, December 22, 1547. Yours sincerely, Erb.</p>
