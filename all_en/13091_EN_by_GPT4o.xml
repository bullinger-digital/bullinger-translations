    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Travers would like to take the opportunity presented to him by the letter bearer [...] to write something, even though he has almost nothing to communicate. However, he would like to ask Bullinger, if he finds the time, to inform him about any news, especially regarding Emperor Charles V's intentions on the religious question at the Diet of Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Pope Paul III is sharpening his blades against the Emperor to avenge the murder of his son Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Piacenza. The Pope's grandson, Ottavio Farnese, is occupying Parma. The Governor of Milan, Ferrante Gonzaga, has seized Piacenza with the help of traitors. Thus, the enmity between the Emperor and the Pope is swelling! The Council of Venice is observing the whole situation with distrust and eagle eyes. They are reinforcing the guards of the [cities belonging to them], stockpiling supplies, and protecting the enemies of their enemies. May God turn everything for the good!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should, for Travers' sake, ensure that the Zurich Council pays an honor to the letter bearer. He is an upright, discreet, and very wise friend, a supporter and advocate of the true faith, and a particularly important councilor of the Grisons state.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear Bullinger, having found the opportunity with the letter bearer, I could not restrain my pen from its usual trifles. Although I have no other subject to write about, I thought it would suffice if, in your rare leisure, you could share with me any news, especially what the Emperor is planning regarding religion at the Diet of Augsburg, and other matters worthy of knowing through your letters.</p>

      <p>The Pope is sharpening his weapons against the Emperor, striving to avenge the death of his son, the Duke of Piacenza, in Italy. Ottavio, the Pope's grandson, occupies Parma. Ferrante, the Governor of Milan, has seized Piacenza through traitors. Thus, the hostilities between the Emperor and the Pope are swelling. The Senate of Venice, full of suspicion, observes everything with eagle eyes, has increased the guards and supplies of their cities, and seeks to avenge enemies with enemies. May the gods turn everything for the good!</p>

      <p>Furthermore, I pray you, most humane brother, to ensure that the Zurich Council bestows some honor (as is customary) upon this friend. He is indeed a virtuous man, a friend of the good, both a professor and defender of the orthodox faith, sparing in speech, great in understanding, and also a sincere and faithful friend of ours, prominently named in the council of our republic. Do this for the love of your Travers, so that he may be honored.</p>

      <p>To the most steadfast and pious lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, my most esteemed in many ways.</p>
