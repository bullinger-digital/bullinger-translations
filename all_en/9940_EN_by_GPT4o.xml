      <p>[...] you have undoubtedly heard more about these things from others. I return to where I left off. We foresaw these events (however simple we may otherwise be) and other similar unfortunate and turbulent things would erupt at some point if the prince continued, as was suggested to him from here, to establish a new ecclesiastical senate, and therefore we faithfully and modestly dissuaded him from this. We do not regret this even now, and we earnestly pray to the Lord that He may kindly temper this dangerous matter with His mercy and prevent it from erupting into some great evil, etc. From your letter, however, we understood that Olevianus and his accomplices value you more than any other mortal and would do, with you as their advisor, what they would do for no other person's favor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg and beseech you, as much as I can, for Christ's sake, for the salvation of that church, and for our intimate friendship and brotherhood, to seriously consider these dangers and obstacles to be removed and to urge your people to seriously think about preserving that church and not to abuse the power granted to them, and not to follow feelings of hatred and envy rather than sound reason. Indeed, let them consider who they are, where they have emerged from, in what place and among whom they stand out, and with what favor or hatred, and what dangers they bring upon themselves and the excellent prince from their administration, etc.</p>
      <p>But I ask you to use my words prudently, as befits a true friend and sincere brother, so that these words of mine do not reach anyone else's hands but yours alone, lest those who previously hated me without any merit on my part hate me even more intensely, and thus it would be better to tear up these words of mine or throw them into the fire or send them back to me rather than preserve or have them copied.</p>
      <p>What I have written, I have written to you alone with a candid spirit; and I call God as my witness that I seek the salvation and preservation of that afflicted and torn church, as well as the reputation and well-being of the excellent prince.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable lord and dearest brother, and continue to pray to the Lord for me. May He bless you and the other fellow ministers and beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 25, 1575.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Théodor de Bèze, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
