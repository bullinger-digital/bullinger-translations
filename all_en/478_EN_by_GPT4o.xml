      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, my most esteemed Myconius, is a boy from Chur.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tscharner and Mr. Herus came to me and asked that I commend him to you in my letter. He was with you in Basel, but fell ill (as they tell me) and therefore left. If this is indeed the case and you can help him, I ask you to assist him, even for my sake. There is nothing particularly noteworthy here that I could write to you about.</p>
      <p>Farewell then. I await from you news from Strasbourg and Lower Germany. Zurich, March 29, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
