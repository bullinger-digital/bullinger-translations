      <p>Greetings. On my return journey from Freiburg im Breisgau through Basel to Burgundy, most illustrious man, when our Gastius said he would send a messenger to Zurich tomorrow, and asked me if I wanted anything, I did not want to let him leave without a letter from me, expressing my feelings towards you, even though I believe you have no doubts about my respect for you.</p>
      <p>For your kindness, with which you have embraced me continuously for many years, I give you eternal thanks. You recently provided a candid example of this in your letter to me about your views on the Eucharist. I wish, my dear Bullinger, that I could someday show myself to be not ungrateful!</p>
      <p>As God loves me, the will is never lacking; if I cannot demonstrate it in deeds - since you are greater than our efforts can aspire to - you will still praise the effort, for as he said, in great matters, even the will is enough.</p>
      <p>My dear Bullinger, take care, as much as you can, to stay healthy, and consider that nothing is more pleasing to us than your health, nothing can be announced more gratefully.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the 4th day before the Ides of March in the Christian year 1545, hastily, as you see. I have entrusted Gast with a gift for you; I ask again and again that you consider it kindly. Greetings to all friends, especially to Bibliander and Gessner.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gilbert Cousin of Nozeroy.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable defender of true theology and Christianity, his esteemed lord and teacher.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
