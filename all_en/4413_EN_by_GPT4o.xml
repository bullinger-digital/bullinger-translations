      <p>Greetings. Although there is no need to trouble your kindness with my letters, since our beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. Johannes Faber, sufficiently provides what should or could be written, yet because he, who is most observant of you, demands that I also write something, I write this. I thank your kindness for always including my greetings in the letters you write to him and for remembering me so honorably. And so that you are not burdened with any unnecessary care, I will add this: In our Leagues, all is calm and in the same state as it has been for several years now.</p>
      <p>Recently, however, this happened: a certain very large community of our League, which we call the House of God, rose up against our bishop. Messengers of the same community and the bishop went around the communities of the House of God together. They accuse him of oppressing them in the annual collection of pensions, contrary to the custom observed by all bishops until now; they also want those who serve the bishop to be excluded from public councils, which law was previously made through the articles of the Three Leagues.</p>
      <p>The bishop's supporters defend themselves as best they can. More communities have subscribed to the same community than to the bishop, among which (to your surprise) are even those who perform the Mass and still wish to retain the Mass. They further urge that the bishop should account to the House of God for the goods he cultivates and the pensions he receives annually from everyone. That community deprived the administrator appointed by the bishop, who had been in charge of them until now, of his power and took away the public seal and keys, appointing another prefect for themselves.</p>
      <p>It remains for the House of God to convene, in which assembly the vote of the majority will prevail. No tumults are to be feared from this.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, let us live in these last and perilous times with an undaunted spirit and be prepared for all things, following where fate leads and draws us back; it will find a way, and Jesus will be present when called. Farewell, most excellent man, and continue to always remember us.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 26th of August, 1560.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness as always, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>For the horse, I gave as much and to whom you instructed. Truly to the great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people.</p>
