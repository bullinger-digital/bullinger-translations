      <p>My always ready and willing service, dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>The plan, which I informed you about three years ago, is present and about to break out. For on the upcoming Thursday, the first day of June, the people from Appenzell, Rintal, Gotthaus, Thurgau, Schaffhausen, Kaltschmid, and around Stammheim, Ossingen, Rapperswil, and from my lords of Zurich's territory near the Rhine are to set out and march towards Brugg in the service of the King of France, as you may well know. Now their intention and final decision is to march down through Thurgau to base themselves at Rheinau and then move down through the Rafz field towards Kaiserstuhl with force and quietly towards the ferry and through the Bernese territory upwards. The leaders are ten: First, Conrat Brüllisauer. Bartli Berweger, although he has not received the money; it has been sent to him afterwards. Also, Clar Hans from Appenzell. From Wil, the abbot of St. Gallen's leader, Antoni on the Mur and Onofrius Vonbühler. From the county of Toggenburg, the bailiff Batzenham, has not personally received the money; whether it is sent to him secretly, I cannot know. Federli von Frauenfeld, he has withdrawn. From Schaffhausen, Casper Ringg, Thoma Spiegelberg. From Rapperswil, Türing Göldi. From Kaiserstuhl, Hans Kaltschmid. Also, Jacob Wepfer from Stammheim. And furthermore, Jörg von Höwen and Mr. Felcher von Knöringen are each supposed to come with 4,000 landsknechts. I did not want to withhold this new information from you, in case you might be able to prevent some of it through your efforts. You may also report this to a respectable authority, so that something against God may be prevented. This I wanted to inform you of in trust, without being asked.</p>
      <p>Given at Brugg, on the 29th day of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my particularly gracious lord and benefactor.</p>
