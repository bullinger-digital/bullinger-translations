      <p>Thus, each envoy brought back a response, as I wrote, and indeed in writing.</p>
      <p>And what is more: it has been confirmed for the second time; for the malicious ones have taken it up again and yet could do nothing. Meanwhile, Peter Martin, the son-in-law of the old Mr. Travers from Milan, comes here, aligning himself with the Pope's embassy (he, however, along with his brother-in-law, still wants to be good evangelical), and they practice so long until this Peter Martin is granted permission to speak before the common Three Leagues.</p>
      <p>He reports how he lingered in Milan for several days (as he was also one of the wedding guests), and understood well that the matter was not right; for they gather a large crowd, but no one knows where from. Therefore, he thinks that one should not have given such a blunt answer, lest it gives cause for war, etc. In summary: some, who are otherwise not malicious, fall from their opinion (though they previously justified each other quite well), and the answer is softened so much: they want to let it come before the communities.</p>
      <p>This is a very bad affair, if God is not especially with us; for in the meantime, the cursed money will flow in, and if one cannot go further, it will go out over the exiled in Valtellina, if God does not especially intervene. I must write this with great heartache.</p>
      <p>The practice of Philipp and the Pope is beginning to become strong; it comes from the fact that the money doors are used to taking, but the Frenchman wants to stay out too long. - This Peter Martin also spoke before the common Three Leagues, how 22 of the Confederates, the most prominent, rode through Milan via Venice, lingered in Milan for several days, and dressed in velvet and silk, so that they all went around like counts, adorned with chains. He encountered some of them in the cathedral in Milan, and especially spoke as needed with the governor of Uri, and as one word led to another, he, the governor, also mentioned the people of Glarus and said: "You from the Leagues take up the matter; but you will find that they will strangle the people of Glarus while you are sleeping." He spewed out these and many other unworthy things against the people of Glarus. - I cannot send the confession now.</p>
      <p>I have a single copy, which I carry with me to Chiavenna. However, I will ensure that Mr. Augustinus Maynard sends a copy as soon as possible. It is not complete; for we refer the reader to the synodal confession.</p>
      <p>However, it includes the main points that are controversial.</p>
      <p>Farewell, June 16, 1561.</p>
