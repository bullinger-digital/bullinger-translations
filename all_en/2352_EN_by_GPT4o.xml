      <p> Greetings. From this, I gather that you are occupied with great matters, as it was possible for your lord, Mr. Burcher, who is otherwise very busy, and Mr. Martyr to write to me extensively, but you alone, undoubtedly entangled in greater matters, were not able to write even a little to your parents, brothers, sisters, or other friends. Perhaps you lacked messengers, and no one from Zurich came to you at the last fair. If it is not negligence, it is certainly laziness. I expect your account to be recorded on a sheet, starting from where you recently left off, with expenses. </p>
      <p> The lord demands eighteen crowns for sustenance, feeding you at a very cheap price. See to it, therefore, that you are not ungrateful or proud, but modest, humble, and serving him in all things in which you can serve without detriment to your studies. I am now sending a small gift to his wife, gold and silver coins. Farewell. Zurich, July 30, 1554. May our students be well. </p>
      <p> Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, in the house of Mr. Burcher in Strasbourg. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg. </p>
