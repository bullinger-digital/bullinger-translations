      <p>Greetings. Your letter, along with the attached history of your affairs, has been delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that, just as He brought the dangerous movements to a not unfortunate end last year, He may now also, in His mercy, bring all these evils to a good conclusion for His people. You may impatiently hear me opposing my advice to your plans, yet nonetheless, as a faithful friend, I am doing my duty now and will not trouble you with this again later. I urge you not to do what you have planned. You are preparing to leave, and you see that everything is full of turmoil and that false teachers are more loved than faithful teachers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I predict for you that, when you leave in such grave danger, there will be no shortage of those who will claim that this turmoil was stirred up by you and that you fled in repentance, leaving them in the midst of the whirlpool and in the depths.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when the church of the Corinthians was somewhat corrupted by some false teachers and there was a danger of being further entangled in greater evils and errors, he did not think of abandoning them and leaving the place to the seducers, but rather worked most vehemently to prevent the false teachers from being received. Consider, therefore, what you will do.</p>
      <p>There is no news beyond what I last sent you, except for the rumor spreading about the death of the emperor and the Turkish army, which recently came to Szigetv√°r, expecting immense Turkish forces there, with which they intend to proceed through Carinthia and the neighboring areas against the Venetians. If these things are true, Germany will have much to do. I greatly fear that a great evil is prepared for all Christians, both those who truly are what they are called and those who are called and are nothing less. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>I give you my greatest thanks for your efforts in writing or recording the history of your affairs. May the Lord bless you and keep you together with your entire family and all good friends and acquaintances!</p>
      <p>I wrote this in great haste.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 10, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
