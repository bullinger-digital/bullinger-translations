<letter xml:id="file13102"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Bullinger finished his sermon at 10 o'clock, the mayor [Johannes Haab] approached him and reported that a letter from the authorities of Constance was read in the Zurich council, which caused great dismay and distrust. One should think of Laocoön's words: "You believe the enemies have sailed away? Then you do not know Odysseus well!" Moreover, it should be known that no one is more cunning than Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle. He has sons who are bishops. He wants to maintain and expand their rule. The Bishop of Constance, Johann von Weeze, is pressuring the people of Constance to achieve what he has long been trying to obtain from Emperor Charles V. As already mentioned in his letter from the previous evening [not received], Bullinger warns the people of Constance again not to let themselves be deceived like the other cities.</p><p xml:id="regest2">[2] The following is only for Blarer: Attention! Perhaps there are people among the citizens of Constance who love the Emperor more than their homeland!</p><p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Zurich council writes to all twelve places that it has learned from a reliable source that Constance is in reconciliation negotiations with the Emperor. However, it is concealed that they know this from the council of Constance itself. This evening and tomorrow, the messengers will set out with the corresponding letters.</p><p xml:id="regest4">[4] Perhaps the people of Constance would be helped if the Confederates interceded for them with the Emperor in writing. If so, Blarer should present a well-reasoned letter explaining why it would be good for the Confederates to write to the Emperor. He should emphasize that it would be desirable for the Confederates to remind the Emperor in their letter how peacefully their neighbors, the people of Constance, have always behaved, and therefore ask him to be gracious to them and grant them a tolerable peace, especially since they, the Confederates, are allied with him through the Hereditary Agreement [of 1511]. He should not provoke, neither stir up resentment nor war, and not station foreign troops in Constance, etc.</p><p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer should quickly inform whether such a thing or something else should be done, or if it is already too late for that. Bullinger writes this at the suggestion of God-fearing people.</p><p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blessing wish. Whatever may happen, Blarer can count on Bullinger as a brother. His house is open to him and his family.</p><p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. Written at 11 o'clock in the morning.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Dear sir and brother, just now, after I finished preaching at 10 o'clock, my lord the mayor [Johannes Haab] came to me and told me how your lordship's letter was read in our council with great compassion and concern, for they do not trust the matter. Laocoön said: "Do you believe the enemies have sailed away? etc. Is this how you know Odysseus?" One should have learned to know Granvelle, than whom no one more cunning and malicious lives in this entire world. He has sons who are bishops. He desires their rule to remain intact, indeed to be expanded. And your bishop is beginning to press you to finally receive what he has long requested from the emperor. I ask you, as in the writing of the previous evening, to be careful that you are not deceived like other cities!</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>Now I write and suggest to you alone: Beware, lest there be among you those who love the emperor more than their homeland.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>My lords are writing to all twelve places, but not that they have written from you, but that they have good reason to believe that Constance is negotiating and will negotiate a reconciliation, etc. Tonight and tomorrow the messengers will set out.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>Let me know, but with solid grounds, whether there is not something to be done, that the common Confederates send a brave embassy to the emperor: Since Constance, your dear neighbors, have behaved peacefully and well so far, to ask the emperor to graciously consider them with a tolerable peace, and especially since we have an alliance with him, that he may lay aside cause (provocation), displeasure, and wars in the future, and not station foreign troops in Constance, etc.</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>Give me a quick answer, whether there is indeed something to be done, or how to proceed, or if it is too late, or how to approach the matter.
