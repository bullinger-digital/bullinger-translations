      <p>Greetings. Recently, I wrote to your kindness, most esteemed Myconius, through a certain Fleming, a citizen of Ghent, and I do not doubt that you have now received it. Meanwhile, I hear that you are gradually recovering well; may the Lord strengthen this in you; you also take care to stay healthy.</p>
      <p>From Hungary, a certain distinguished man writes to me, testifying that the matter of religion is progressing beautifully and that the Gospel of Christ is being preached even into Thrace. For this reason, we must give the greatest thanks to divine goodness.</p>
      <p>You will understand what is happening in Italy from these good and pious men. The first among them is Hieronymus Massarius from Vicenza, recommended to me by our Mr. Vergerius, and therefore I also commend him to you in turn. He pursues the study of medicine; thus, he could not stay with us, among whom there is no study of medicine at all. However, you can recommend him to your physicians and assist him with your advice; you will do something worthy of yourself, who knows how Christ should be received in his members.</p>
      <p>Many think that the war this year will be transferred by the Turk to Africa, but incursions will be made from Hungary to divide the forces of the Emperor. The Lord will give enough war to the bloodthirsty prince. Farewell and write back soon. Zurich, May 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the Basel church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
