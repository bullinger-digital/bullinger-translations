    <p xml:id="regest1">[Hans Wilpert] Zoller lacks the time to write to Bullinger or his mother [Agnes, née Schmid]. Haller occasionally gives him advice in letters on how he should behave. A few days ago, [Sebastian] Schertlin [von Burtenbach] was in Augsburg and praised Zoller highly. Haller then advised him [in a letter] to remain humble and modest despite [Schertlin's] praise.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Allegedly, food is not expensive in [Zürich]. In [Augsburg], prices have even dropped by more than half.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If Zoller does not write to you or your mother, forgive him. He does not have the time. I write to him from time to time and advise him on how he should conduct himself.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Schertlin praises him highly, whom I spoke to a few days ago when he was in Augsburg for that purpose. However, I advise him not to be carried away by the praise of others, but to temper his strength with humility and modesty.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. I hear that food is not expensive with you. The same is true with us; the price has dropped by more than half. Praise be to God!</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich, his particularly kind lord and father.</p>
