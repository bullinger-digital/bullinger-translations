      <p>Greetings. I wrote on October 2nd via your courier to you, my esteemed and dear Calvin, as much as was possible at that time amidst the turmoil of affairs and haste: however, since I have not received any letters from you in return, I am uncertain whether mine have reached you. And so that you are not unaware, I had also sent you a copy of our response in the Servetus case. At present, I am sending another, so that if you have not received the first, you may have this one from me. What I had requested from you in my first letter, I now repeat. I beg you, my brother, to procure and send me the book by Servetus, which I believe is the one he published on the Restoration of Christianity, and of which your most honorable council sent us a copy. Furthermore, please ensure that the articles extracted from Servetus, Servetus's writings, and your refutations, along with Servetus's annotations sent to us by your people, are copied at my expense, and send them wrapped and sealed to Bern to our Haller, who will faithfully ensure they are delivered to me. In this matter, you will do me a great favor, and you will not find me ungrateful, should I be able to reciprocate your kindness. And since we are very concerned here about the Servetus case, you will relieve us of great anxiety if you write that the plague has been suppressed, or what has finally been done with the blasphemous man. Let us pray to our Lord and Savior that all may turn out well.</p>
      <p>Caesar has announced new imperial assemblies to be held in Augsburg on the Feast of the Three Kings. Therefore, miserable Germany expects new exactions and expeditions, to say nothing else.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with His church. Farewell together with all brothers in Christ. I hope you have received the letters from England sent to you through me. ZÃ¼rich, October 28, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, honorable lord, and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
