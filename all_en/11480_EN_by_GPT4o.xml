    <p xml:id="regest1">Is surprised that Bullinger does not respond, and encloses a report from Worms, where a mixed committee has begun negotiations; what is passed by the plenary session is to be further negotiated at the announced Imperial Diet [in Regensburg], alongside Turkish aid and coinage regulation. [Johannes] Fabri attacks Basel in connection with the granting of the cathedral provostship, which is why the council seeks support from the Confederates; the granting has been done under the same rights as with the predecessor of the current provost. Would like to know if Bullinger is interested in further reports from Worms.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is surprising that you have not written for so long, indeed you have not responded to what I have written. However, in the meantime, I do not cease to inform you of whatever I learn from Worms.</p>
      <p>Today letters have been sent, which you see attached to mine. I could not refrain from sending them. Therefore, I had them copied, as it pertains to you equally. I believe you will explain it excellently. Now at last, negotiations have begun; it is fitting for us, who are absent, to pray to the Lord to be present with the truth. For in this way, this battle will be rightly fought. The senate has made two committees (which is not in the attached letters), a smaller one of eleven and eleven from each side, and a larger one of, if I remember correctly, sixty-six men. What will be decided by all these, I think, will come to the announced Imperial Diet. What happens next, the Lord knows. At the Diet (to mention this in passing), matters of religion, the Turk, and coinage will be discussed. May the Lord turn it to good.</p>
      <p>Bishop Faber attacks us through the Emperor regarding the provostship of our cathedral chapter, which I hear our lords have informed all the Cantons about, so that they may deliberate in the next assembly on what seems to be done. Make sure that you act with your people so that they do their duty. Our magistrate followed the right it had while the papacy was still in force, then, what was long ago agreed between it and the chapter, from which the canons were forced to have the previous provost before the current one, a brother of a certain citizen of this city, who was not noble, however much they resisted. It is therefore surprising who has driven Faber to attempt to act in this way. Some fear that there are bad advisors from our city behind this. But this is between you and me.</p>
      <p>Let me know if I serve you or not, while I write about Worms, or if you receive from elsewhere what pleases you more. For if I knew that I was less gratifying to you, I would cease writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours, Theodor and all the brothers. Basel, hastily, December 6, 1540.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
