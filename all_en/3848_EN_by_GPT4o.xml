      <p>My return to you, which I wrote about through Burcher, is being delayed by the Vilnius resident, who wants to wait for the outcome of the assemblies where they are currently discussing the method and form of electing a new king, should the current one pass away without children. The Archbishop of Gniezno has indeed died; however, the vice-chancellor, who is said to have succeeded him, claims it is his responsibility to convene the nobility, as he holds the highest rank in the kingdom; but Tarnowski has opposed him, denying that this is a duty of the spiritual leaders. Others, and most of the evangelicals, are trying not only to exclude them from the election but also from the royal senate forever, because they are bound by a new and abominable oath to the pope and have nothing to protect themselves with except a very long-standing prescription, which is of no significance, since this oath was hidden from us. Therefore, the king is in great perplexity and does not know what to do.</p>
      <p>I have often been admitted to private conversations with him, and I will not return to Vienna with his letters in vain; however, I do not dare to write what I hope or fear.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, consider the enclosed pages and ensure they do not come into everyone's hands. The Poles have now made peace with the Tartars, and in the matter of Bar, the Palatine of Kraków and the Chancellor of the Kingdom have been elected to the imperial majesty; they will depart after the Sunday of Invocavit. But more from me or from letters, when a trustworthy messenger presents himself to me.</p>
      <p>I beg Mr. Martyr and Wolf to forgive me, as I am not able to respond now.</p>
      <p>I will also bring some things from these lands to Mr. Gesner, which Biacensis has already given to be sent to Rheticus. Forgive me; I am again called to the Palatine of Vilnius, where there will be a meeting of the brothers.</p>
      <p>Kraków, January 23, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient son, Lelio.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be honored with perpetual respect. Zürich.</p>
