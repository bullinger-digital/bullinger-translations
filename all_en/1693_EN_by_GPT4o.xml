      <p>Greetings in the Son of God! I never thought that either you would make a longer interval in writing, or that I would be more intensely tormented by the expectation of your letters. I believe the tumult has still prevented you from writing to us, which we have heard has been stirred up in Germany. However, I cannot quite understand why you have not found another way to send letters through France, since we have already received letters from Zürich twice in this way. Sometimes it also comes to my mind to suspect that the letters of the prince, which I have sent to you almost ten times from here, have not been faithfully delivered; which indeed I would easily believe, if I did not have certain knowledge that their original was carried as far as Basel by a most trustworthy messenger. Indeed, I do not see what I should do or how I should satisfy the prince. Therefore, I will put at the end what I feel: If you love us, if you wish to be loved by the prince, send letters to me, so that I may be filled with joy as soon as possible. And I would like you to fulfill the rest of your promise and duty to the Duke of Northumberland most honorably. Indeed, commend Alexander himself as diligently as possible, whose entire cause he has taken upon himself, led by your recommendation. I ask and beseech you again and again to be willing to do this, and I ask you in such a way that I cannot with greater care or greater zeal. There is nothing, most learned and dearest Bullinger, since I expect everything from you, that you can do for me that would be more pleasing. I, thus testifying about myself to you, promise and confirm by the immortal God, that I will undertake all duties and labors for your dignity in this part, in which alone something can proceed from a grateful man, and even surpass your expectations; although I see how difficult this is, I trust that I will prove it to you in the end. So as not to be longer, farewell, and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>I am sending the letters of Johanna, the duke's daughter, enclosed with mine to you. I had indeed planned to travel to my homeland this summer, (as you will learn from the letters of my Augustine, with whom I lived most closely from school days), but since I see that everything there is being turned and disturbed, I think I must remain in these places until we hear where these disturbances will lead; which is why the gloves, which the duke's daughter wanted to be given by me to your wife as a sign of utmost goodwill, cannot be conveniently sent to you before the autumn fair. Again and again, farewell, most excellent man. I would like you to convey my greetings in my words to Mr. Pellican, Gwalther, and Wolf. Peter Martyr sends his greetings to you. Oxford, August 9.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your greatness, Johannes von Ulm, in Christ your most steadfast son.</p>
      <p>Here everything is especially peaceful and tranquil: Chekus has recovered from a most dangerous illness.</p>
      <p>Now thinking to include Johanna's letters in these, I realize that I probably included them in the package I sent to you from here on July 10, along with the others. Therefore, I expect them to be delivered before these.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord. Zürich. Let them be delivered swiftly.</p>
