      <p>S. E A letter was brought from Bologna to me by a certain merchant, which was addressed to you. I was asked, however, to ensure it was delivered to you in good faith. Johannes Konrad Escher, the abbot's prefect, will deliver it, and there was nothing else to write except to commend Musculus's cause to you, so that you may act with the diligence you usually show for friends, with the legate coming from Bern in his name. For I would hardly think that expenses could be borne in such a large household if we have no benefactor or no reward for our efforts. I write this not because I doubt your faith or because I am invited by him to remind you, but because I cannot help but be most favorably disposed towards such a learned and sincerely pious man. If you hope to obtain anything from my letters either to the Bernese senate or privately to some senators, I would not refuse any effort; for I am entirely ready to gratify such a great man.</p>
      <p>Regarding that assembly of cities, I promise myself all auspicious things; only take care that the fatal and truly treacherous voice is not heard in your field: wir wellend von dess gloubens wegen kheinen krieg haben (we do not want to have a war because of faith). For I have no doubt that if the Emperor is going to pour out that poison of accustomed malevolence upon our freedom, those who, if only they wish their altars and hearths, as they say, to be safe, will certainly fight for freedom, who value the freedom of faith so lightly, will in vain refuse to undertake war for religion. But the Lord will arrange all these things for our safety; for this we will pray sincerely. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, November 14, 1548.</p>

      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most distinguished city of ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
