      <p>To your esteemed Christophorus, most revered Bullinger, who is returning to his homeland, I did not want him to come without my letters to you, however brief, in which I would briefly explain the state of both himself and myself. Indeed, by the kindness of the best and greatest God, I am in excellent health, which I also greatly desire to hear from you and yours. The study of medicine, for the sake of which I came here, pleases me, and the rest is as it is.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having completed my business, I am thinking of coming to you as soon as possible. I am deeply sorry for the poor health of your beloved son.</p>
      <p>For almost four or five months now, he has been afflicted by various illnesses, the outcome of which the doctors predicted to be bad, and although he himself, feeling a little better, hoped to endure the labors of the journey well, he immediately prepared for the journey by buying a horse. Indeed, I would never have advised him to do this at this time; but seeing the great expense, he wanted to escape it as soon as possible. Therefore, he asked me to help him in this matter and to provide him with travel expenses, which, remembering your benefits to me and mine, I could not refuse, eager to serve you and yours in all things.</p>
      <p>He therefore received from me 10 Italian gold coins, as testimony of which he left me his handwritten note. When you receive it from my parent, to whom I will send it, you can return it to him.</p>
      <p>Now I have nothing else to write, except that I pray to God, our heavenly Father, that in His mercy He may soon return your son to you safe and sound. Farewell in Christ and have my regards to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Padua on the 8th of December, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Funck, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered lord.</p>
