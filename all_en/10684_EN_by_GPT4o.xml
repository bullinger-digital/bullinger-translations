    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not yet finished reading a defense script sent by Vadian, which is also being read by Theodor [Bibliander], Leo [Jud], and Pellikan. Capito, on behalf of Strasbourg, has requested not to publish anything against Luther, after Luther has shown willingness towards a concord with Gereon [Sailer]. They responded that they are preparing an apology of their faith because their silence has harmed them; however, if Capito can dissuade [Erhard] Schnepf and [Johannes] Brenz from their slanders, they are willing to delay the publication. Hopes for the soon completion of Vadian's ["Aphorismi"]. Requests to be informed of anything noteworthy by him and [Diethelm] Röist.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have received the apology and, what I have read, is not disapproved. However, I have not yet read everything. Theodor [Bibliander] read through it all before me. It seems to him that it was written more purely than anything he has read from this person before. Leo [Jud] has already read it. From him, Pellikan will receive it, and lastly, I will, then it will be returned to you in good faith.</p>
      <p>Doctor Capito, on behalf of the Strasbourg senate, requested from us not to publish anything against Luther at these Frankfurt fairs. For there is greater and more stable hope for concord today than before, which he confirmed with certain acts with Doctor Gereon [Sailer], the envoy of the Augsburgers to Luther: This one, with explicit words both spoken and written, promised not to hinder concord in the future. For he sees that hearts are not so far and wide apart as he previously thought, etc. He declared that this hope would be completely removed by us if we continue to write anything hostile against Luther. We responded that we have prepared nothing against Luther nor any other good man and lover of truth; indeed, we testified that our minds greatly abhor those insults, quarrels, and biting papers. We are indeed preparing an apology for our religion, but with no injury to anyone, as we wish to have our innocence attested to the whole world. Until now, we have passed over intolerable insults in silence and with the most patient stomach, but we truly experience that our silence is harmful both to us and to our religion. Therefore, either he should ensure that Schnepf and Brenz with their followers cease to slander and malign the innocent, or he should cease to delay our response. As for our apology, we are prepared to defer its publication for the sake of the most prudent Strasbourg senate. Meanwhile, he should ensure to open and approve a certain hope of concord with solid arguments. If this is not done, we will publish the Apologetic. Capito agreed to the condition and promised to do and achieve something great. May the good man be able to fulfill the same!</p>
      <p>But you, most learned Vadian, continue in your new work. Nothing will be more pleasing to me than to receive it shortly.</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly, and if you have anything that concerns either me or Röist, write it.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 10th of September, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, his esteemed patron.</p>
