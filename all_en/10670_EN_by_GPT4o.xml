      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter is a nobleman from Austria, a skilled young man, whom I commend to you. He wishes to have the Gospel preached in his domain, provided he knows of a capable fellow. He must, however, proceed cautiously at first, but he will discuss this with you himself. In the matter of the Lord's Supper, the good man, as far as I understand, is somewhat inclined, but he is entirely fair. Dear friend, ensure that Master Werner Steiner accompanies him and that he makes a good impression on the Austrian.</p>
      <p>He has pressed me to express my opinion on the marriage of cousins. For he himself desires to marry his cousin. I could not send you a copy of my judgment, but I would like you to request it from him. Then I ask you not to hesitate to let me know what you have replied to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the pious brothers. I wish Pellican well.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Recommend the departing one to Grynäus</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
