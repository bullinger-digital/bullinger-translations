      <p>To all the most reverend ministers of the Church of Z端rich, the Christian Church of Locarno sends greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen. We give thanks to God the Father, that although we have fallen into various temptations and persecutions, He has never allowed us to be tempted beyond our weakness. For although some have suffered exile, others the dreadful darkness of prison, some have been beaten, others insulted, and others exposed to various evils, yet all of us (which is a gift from God) still stand fearless for Christ, our Savior, ready to suffer much greater things. There is one thing, however, that torments us, namely that we have only one life to lose for Christ. For if it were possible to die a hundred times and it were necessary, it would be preferable to choose this rather than to deny Christ, our only Savior, at such a great loss to the soul. For what can be dearer to us or should be than our soul, for which Christ Jesus, the Son of God, shed His most precious blood, or what should be equally dear to our heart, than to offer it as a living, holy, and unblemished sacrifice to God for eternity. But we will never achieve this unless we embrace Christ with all our heart. After this, we confess everywhere, undeterred by persecutions, dangers, misfortunes, or any other kind of evil. "If you confess," says Christ, "me before men, I will also confess you before my Father who is in heaven." We write this to your truly incomparable kindness, dearest brothers, so that you may know our faith towards God and, knowing it, protect it with your ineffable mercy, piety, kindness, and charity. We confess that it is God who nourishes, cherishes, and protects His children at home and abroad, who increases their faith, confirms their hope, and daily grants them a more fervent love, who governs the entire machinery of the world with a nod and with the greatest wisdom. Nevertheless, it is also your part, most illustrious lords, to take care of your people (which is not unknown to you, adorned with all wisdom) and to ensure, as much as possible, that they may live in peace and harmony, having expelled seditious men from the city and the enemies of good morals, holy religion, the most beautiful disciplines, and all humanity. However, there is no need to pursue this with a longer speech, since we, who are most loving of all justice and especially of the Christian religion, have always had it at heart, as we have always received and experienced in reality, especially since the very learned Johannes Beccaria, a not insignificant teacher of evangelical truth, has taken refuge there. Therefore, we first give immortal thanks to God, and then to you, who strive day and night, as much as you can, to ensure that the Christian Church of Locarno suffers no harm. Act, dearest brothers, (you will forgive us for daring to call our most illustrious lords brothers; for the cause of this is our immense love for your most humane kindness) with your innate mercy combined with equal wisdom and justice, restrain the tongues of our most wicked citizens and blunt their fury with your precepts, so that the Christian Church may not be exposed to impious slanderers, as it has been and is. Therefore, we all, who number more than two hundred, beseech your mercy, that through you it may be possible to have a Christian pastor, who will feed the flock of Christ with evangelical doctrine and defend it from ravenous wolves, of which, alas, there is an excessive abundance among us. Indeed, you have hitherto used much diligence (for which we again give the greatest thanks) to help us, and among others, you, most reverend Heinrich, who spare neither expenses nor labors, so that Christian truth may be safely preached among us, that it may not be in the hands of the magistrates to persecute anyone for religion, and that our republic may be as peaceful as possible. But we beseech you to put the finishing touch to this work, so that the most ferocious lions, who continually roam seeking whom they may devour, may no longer tear us apart. Unless the Lord (which indeed we hope) gives some help, it is over for us. Therefore, most powerful lords, we implore your help in this matter: help us, help us, I say, with the most holy laws, which provide that no one may disturb or overthrow our church in the future, but allow us to have our own pastor and our own ministers and grant a temple where they can preach the word of the Lord and administer the holy sacraments in the way they should be administered, rejecting the most superstitious appendages with which papal tradition abounds. We commend this cause to you, dearest brothers, because it is just, with the greatest earnestness.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Locarno, the day before the calends of October 1549.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and distinguished men Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Otto Werdm端ller, and the other ministers of the Church of Z端rich, our dearest brothers. In Z端rich.</p>
