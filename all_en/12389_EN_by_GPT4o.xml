    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian received Bullinger's letter [not received] the day before. The writing pleased him all the more as Bullinger expressed himself very openly [about Vadian's "Little Chronicle"] despite all the praise. May Vadian's contribution to the [“Swiss Chronicle”] by [Johannes] Stumpf be useful to many, especially since Vadian has endeavored to write in an instructive and pleasant manner, according to Horace's recommendation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding Bullinger's concerns, the following is to be said: Bullinger rightly complains about the length of two chapters, but Vadian was [indirectly] forced by Stumpf to do so, as the latter had explained to him during his visit [in St. Gallen] that he did not want a higher number of chapters for his "Chronicle" than planned. Since Vadian had already dedicated two chapters to the monastic order and St. Gallus, he could not divide his further explanations into chapters at will due to the predetermined, limited number of chapters. Now that Stumpf knows that Bullinger intends to [arrange the content of the "Swiss Chronicle" differently], it is no longer necessary to adhere so precisely to the [originally] set number of chapters, especially since it is sufficient to refer to the book and [addressed] topic, and not also to the chapter, in cross-references within the "Swiss Chronicle." It is important to agree with the division intended by Bullinger. Vadian is impressed that Bullinger was able to devote so much time to this undertaking, and he completely submits to his judgment. Vadian requests that his treatise on bailiwicks and monastic bailiwicks, which he had placed in the section on Abbot Nortpert because he had nothing else to mention there except for some events, now be inserted as Chapter 21 after Bullinger's planned Chapter 20 on fiefs, especially since these explanations fit thematically well there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger reproaches Vadian for having conceded too much to the abbots, even though Vadian's biographical depictions clearly show that he is hostile to the Papists (which the latter also know). Certainly, Vadian has shown himself to be magnanimous by conceding the three-tiered tiara to the Pope, but only if he becomes a successor to the teachings of Christ. However, Bullinger may rewrite or omit the passage, as Vadian can understand his concerns. Vadian behaved like a narrator and not like an accuser when writing, to arouse interest among lovers of chronicles who otherwise consider the [Protestants] as heretics. The marginal notes, [which are offensive], may therefore be removed, as long as not all marginal notes disappear, because these attract the reader's attention.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Vadian is allowed to have a different opinion than Bullinger about the founding date of the churches in Zurich and Lucerne and to bring in Stumpf as an arbitrator on this question. It is not true that he dates this to the time of [Frankish King] Louis [= Chlodwig] II (the son of Dagobert I)! By "Louis," he meant Louis [III], a son of Theuderich [III]. Louis III succeeded his father to the throne only a few years after the death of [Bishop] Leodegar [of Autun], and this after his father (a brother of Chlothar [III] and a son of Louis [II]) had reigned for a very long time. What Bullinger conveys in this matter contradicts the chronological information of the chroniclers for Vadian. Bullinger mentions [Queen] Brunhilde in this context, as if she had still lived in the time of Leodegar or at least not long before Leodegar's death, which is untenable! Credible sources rather prove that Brunhilde was killed by Chlothar [II] around the year 618 (almost six years after the accession of the Byzantine [Emperor Flavius] Heraclius). This is evident from the [“Historiae Francorum”] of the French [chronicler] Annonius [= Aimion de Fleury], whose writing Vadian lent to Stumpf. The same [is confirmed] by the conscientious chronicler Sigebert [of Gembloux]. From Brunhilde's death to the martyrdom of Leodegar, about 67 years passed, as the latter died around 685. For such chronological questions, Vadian refers to French, not Italian or German authors. In doing so, he discovered that Brunhilde, through [her grandson] Theuderich [II], caused the murder of Desiderius, the Bishop of Vienne, but not that of Leodegar. Sigebert confirms this. After the death of Louis [II] and after the death of the loyal [mayor of the palace] Erchinoald, Chlothar [III] appointed Ebroin as [Neustrian] mayor of the palace, who caused unrest in France for years with his outrageous claims to power. When Chlothar [III] died and his brother [Childerich II] tried to make Theuderich [III] king [of the entire Frankish Empire], Ebroin was imprisoned in the monastery of Luxeuil, while Theuderich had to hide as a shorn monk in the Abbey of Saint-Denis [north of Paris]. Ebroin and Theuderich hated the bishops because they tried to keep their raging behavior in check; hence the execution of Leodegar caused by Ebroin. This happened shortly before the time when Pippin [II] [or the Middle, of Heristal], son of the [Frankish nobleman] Ansegisel, became mayor of the palace of Austrasia, successor of Wulfoald. Ebroin also fought against Pippin, but the latter managed to have him murdered around 688 by Ermenfred. Vadian gave Stumpf his careful chronological record of the Frankish kings. If only Bullinger had seen it too! Caution is advised in these matters. One should beware of the authors of great works, for they have employed [assistant] writers for their work. Even the Glarner Ägidius Tschudi soon found out that the historical source used by [Beatus] Rhenanus, in which [the Wichard and Rupert mentioned in the Lucerne tradition register] are considered dukes of [Emperor] Louis the Pious and assigned to the year 905, is unreliable, especially since Louis the Pious lived not even a hundred years after Leodegar. The [Louis mentioned in the Lucerne tradition register] cannot be Louis II either, as he died about 27 years before the murder of Leodegar. Rather, it refers to Louis, who reigned after his father Theuderich III and his brother Chlothar III (both sons of Louis II) and died around 696, about 10 years after Leodegar and about 18 years before the accession of the [mayor of the palace] Charles Martel, the founder of the Carolingian [dynasty].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The [foundation] of the Zurich and Lucerne church is therefore to be dated to the time [of Louis III]. But Vadian is not so foolish as to believe that the first church in Zurich was identical with the Grossmünster, as the latter was completely renewed and furnished by another duke from a modest, original church, later also expanded by Charlemagne. This is also evident from the historical sources that Vadian received from the Zurichers years ago. Vadian learned from Bullinger himself that Christianity had already taken root in Bregenz and other localities in the region during Roman times; indeed, that not only the church but also the city of Zurich existed before the invasions of the Alemanni and Zurich was reduced to the size of a small village by the latter. Consequently, the foundations of the Franks are more [re]constructions than foundations. And it is highly commendable to the Franks that, after turning to Christianity, they immediately rebuilt the churches that their godless ancestors (to speak with Paul [Eph 2, 12]) had destroyed. It was also the Franks who moved the [bishop's] seat from Vindonissa to Constance, and it was Dagobert [I] and later Berta [Bertrada], the mother of Charlemagne, who endowed Constance with churches and benefices. Christianity was also reintroduced in other Rhine cities, as [Beatus] Rhenanus has already well demonstrated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- It is also not necessary to attribute the foundation of the Fraumünster in Zurich to another ruler [than commonly assumed], especially since it is established that [King] Louis the German, the grandson of Charlemagne, founded the monastery. Vadian hopes that Bullinger will abandon his somewhat forced assumption after some consideration, especially since the arguments he presents are not convincing. Bullinger's argument that it was not possible for Leodegar to be venerated shortly after his death is not compelling, especially when one considers how much the Franks tended to veneration and also otherwise the pagans almost venerated the living. One thinks of what Sulpicius Severus reports in this regard about Martin of Tours. According to Tertullian, the [Roman Emperor] Tiberius wanted to be venerated during his lifetime. One thinks of the [St.] Gallus: Hardly had he died, he was already venerated and considered holy by the [Bishop] Boso [of Merseburg]. The chronicles of the monastery of St. Gallen further testify that Abbot Konrad von Bussnang erected a shrine to the [St.] Elisabeth, the wife of the [Landgrave] Louis [IV.] of Thuringia, shortly after her canonization [1235] (Abbot Konrad [von Bussnang], a court councilor of the [Emperor] Frederick II, was already an advocate of Elisabeth at the court of his son, King Henry [VII], during her lifetime, as Stumpf can also confirm). Finally, Sigebert [of Gembloux] reports in his entry under the year 688 that [Pippin II] already venerated Leodegar and preferred him to many other [saints]. However, the claim by Antonino [Pierozzi] [the Bishop of Florence], according to which Leodegar already had a shrine during his lifetime, is hardly true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Vadian already knows that the Carolingians are not descendants of the Merovingians! The Roman popes are accused of having promoted the dynasty of the [Carolingian] Pippins to the crown in their own interest, although they were not destined for it by kinship. However, the Carolingians did not subjugate their predecessors; rather, they gained their trust. They wanted to be considered descendants of the Frankish royal house and successors of the Merovingians. If Bullinger doubts this, the discourse held by the Carolingians will convince him. Consequently, Bullinger's criticism is not well-founded. - What Bullinger brings up about the first duke (dux) of the Alemanni is also unjustified. It is established that the Franks, after subjugating the Alemanni, appointed not princes (principes) but dukes in Alemannia. These were responsible for military affairs, but only since the time of Pippin and the Carolingians. The dukes did not act independently. Even in church matters, they waited for orders from the [rulers], as is evident from the old historical sources. Bullinger should rather adhere to the established [chronology] instead of presenting pure assumptions that do not match the historical sources of the Zurichers. Therefore, Vadian does not want to question the [previously assumed] age of the Zurich church, nor that of the rebuilt Zurich church (much older than the Lucerne church). So much for the foundation [of the church of Zurich] and Leodegar.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Should Bullinger reject Vadian's explanations, he is ready to submit to the judgment of the mutual friend Stumpf. If only Bullinger would find a successor for Stumpf, so that he could move with his wife [Regula, née Brennwald] and children from [Stammheim] to [Zurich] as soon as [Christoph] Froschauer begins to print the [“Swiss Chronicle”]! In such a complex work, Froschauer will probably need Stumpf's help. - Vadian is eagerly awaiting [the Latin translation] of the work [“De providentia sermones X”] by Theodoret of Cyrrhus. Since he hardly knows Greek, he did not know [when he sent this book to Bullinger] whether it was a different work than the [“Rerum ecclesiasticarum libri quinque”] or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Some Baal abominations: Bullinger should know that the Abbot of St. Gallen, [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee], has ordered the captured priest [Heinrich Sailer] to be handed over from [the Castle St. Anna in] Rorschach to [Johann von Weeze], the Bishop of Constance. [Sailer] is said to have abused his illegitimate daughter [...] for a long time and has also admitted this. The priest of Goldach [Johannes Trutli?] is said to have impregnated his sister [...] and also seduced the second sister [...]. Vadian is also trying to find out more about the matter he had already written about. But everything that has been heard about it since then agrees with what has already been reported.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The [Catholic] pastor [Johann Heckler] in Arbon, who [internally] knows the truth well, is plagued by the devil. To remedy this, he often had the evangelical preacher [Anton Zilli or Johannes Tecker] called to him. He is said to no longer be tormented by apparitions. May he turn to God!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Vadian has read with great interest the table of contents of Bullinger's work "De sacramentis" and would like to receive a printed copy of it. Luther's writing [“Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum”] did not need to be printed because it contains nothing new. It advocates a carnal Thyestes meal, in which Vadian would by no means participate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- He is pleased with the good reception of [Johannes] Haller in Augsburg. Furthermore, he thanks Bullinger for his shipments. What he wanted to receive back is enclosed with this letter. Vadian also sends two epigrams attributed to [Kaspar Gräter], the [court] preacher of the Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg [in Stuttgart]. It is also claimed that [Erhard] Schnepf sent the epigram "De Luna, Aquila et Gallo" from Regensburg to friends in Stuttgart and that it is by Philipp [Melanchthon] (the content of the poem would support this). Others believe it was by a student of [Melanchthon], namely the [court] preacher [Gräter]. [The second epigram] was written on the occasion of the death of the Abbot of Blaubeuren [Ambrosius Scheerer], after a rather large sum of money was found in his monastery, although the abbot always complained about his poverty during his lifetime!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- In Lindau, work is being done on the city walls, specifically on the towers and the gate located after the bridge. The Emperor [Charles V] is said to have secretly recruited experienced soldiers in the Walgau and Allgäu. Vadian likes the caution of the Lindauers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Bullinger was right to forward the [last shipment of Vadian] to Stumpf [with letter no. 2318]; he should also review everything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Vadian sends greetings to the mayors [Johannes] Haab and [Hans Rudolf] Lavater.</p>

      <p>S. I received your letter yesterday, which was not only welcome but also delightful to me, because you seemed to use a freedom worthy of a true friend, except that in praising me and commending my work, you seemed to stray a little from the path and attribute much to your genuine humanity. However, may it happen that, since I have also taken on the task of assisting with that common and publicly beneficial work, the chronicle, to the best of my ability, whatever I have contributed to Stumpf's favor may benefit many! For indeed, I have aimed with great effort at this goal, to collect both useful and at the same time pleasant things, according to Horace's precept.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the things that offend you, to respond: First, you are rightly burdened by the length of two chapters, and that length also caused me no small amount of annoyance. But our sincere Stumpf, when he was with me, forced me into this narrowness. He denied that he could admit a greater number of chapters than he had designated. Since I had embraced both the origin of monasticism and the history of St. Gall in two chapters, I was so constrained by that number that it was not allowed to divide into more. Now, since you yourself are advised by the matter itself, there is no need to cite so exactly what has been produced or indicated in other books, so that the number of chapters must be set, but it is enough to have cited the book and indicated the material, it is far better to approve your distinction. And I truly marvel that you could place so much effort and diligence in our trifles, and I give you great thanks, diligent man, and I accept without controversy what seemed right to you in this place. I would only wish that what I have sufficiently diligently pursued in Abbot Notpert, I think, about advocacies, that is, about various bailiwicks and what advocacy or bailiwick was in former years, and what I have taught, I have also demonstrated with selected examples, so that readers might grasp me, be transferred into that series of chapters and be immediately added to the chapter on fiefs, which you have set as the twentieth, and be considered the twenty-first chapter; for it is not a matter alien to that treatment nor is it unworthy of that series. For when in several abbots I had nothing to report except a bare and indeed cold little history, I deliberately turned to the explanation of certain places, which are not very clear to the common people, but are better known to those who have been somewhat exercised in the affairs of civil actions; but they are useful for the multifaceted knowledge of the middle ages.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Everywhere, however, the pontiffs have me as a hostile and confessed enemy, as will be evident from the entire catalog of abbots; although you accuse me as if I would grant them certain things that cannot be borne by the pious. I have done, I confess, quite indulgently, what I was about to bear his three crowns, provided he did not persecute but pursue the doctrine of Christ in that Persian mitre of his; but I would consider some external enormities to be borne, if what is internal were rightly held. But come, let it be done as you command. Substitute your own for mine; amend that place, since I dare not deny that you rightly feel, on the contrary, I must confess that I, in my manner, bear and even swallow certain things that could offend many. I therefore acquiesce and take your very approved judgment in this part and take it well that you think the discussion of religion, not undertaken in its place, should be conveniently interrupted and you fear that those judges of the works to be published will not admit it, and you bring a cause not to be despised. Let those things be interrupted, therefore, but in such a way that they do not perish; perhaps it may be permitted to use them elsewhere. However, I wrote these not as an advocate pleading a case before a judge, but as a narrator of the dissensions that had come into controversy in the present age in the knowledge and inquiry of monastic matters and of which monks of all orders were accused. I did these things so that incidentally and conveniently a taste might be given to certain stiff-necked readers of chronicles, who otherwise do not touch our works even with a finger, but count them among the exploded and condemned and heretical. But indeed, when I also consider the more than delicate and irritable minds of some, moreover, I recall in my mind how great the license and perfidy of calumny is and how with open doors it is admitted by many even if slightly exasperated, especially if a little purse has greeted them; I have altogether thought that your judgment should be yielded to, if only you will take care that those annotations placed in the margin be added to the rest, which may remind the reader from which books and places each thing was sought.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the dating of the foundation of the churches of Zurich and Lucerne, I would like to argue with you for a while, with our Stumpf as the judge, provided you admit him. First, you say that I refer the foundation to Louis the Second, the son of Dagobert; which I do not do, unless I slipped by hand while writing. For I referred it to Louis, the son of King Theuderic, who was appointed to the paternal kingdom not many years after the death of Leodegar, when his father Theuderic, the brother of Lothar and the son of that Louis whom you impose, had reigned for several years and finally died. However, the chronological information given by the chroniclers seems to me to differ greatly in this matter, in which you make mention of Brunhilde, as if it should seem that she was alive under the presidency of Leodegar or certainly not far from his death; which I do not accept. For it is established by the consensus of good writers that Brunhilde was executed by King Lothar around the year of our Lord 618, that is, about the sixth year after Heraclius began to reign in Byzantium. I think Annonius, a French writer, whom I lent to Mr. Stumpf, will be a supporter of this matter. Sigbert the monk, a chronographer praised for his diligence, has clearly noted what I say. From the death of Brunhilde to the torture and death of Leodegar, about 67 years intervene. For he suffered around the year of our Lord 685. In the computation of this matter, I use not Italian nor German, but plainly French or, to speak more truly, Frankish authors. However, I find that not Leodegar, but Desiderius, the bishop of the city of Vienne, was ordered to be stoned by King Theuderic at the instigation of Brunhilde. For this too has been diligently noted by Sigbert. Furthermore, that Eberwin (whose madnesses for many years disturbed Gaul or France) first emerged after the death of that Louis of yours, the son of Dagobert, having become mayor of the palace of Lothar (after the death of the most upright man Erchinoald), who took more power and authority for himself than any other of the mayors of the royal house before him; and therefore, after the death of Lothar, when he had promoted his brother Theuderic to the kingdom with great efforts, such was the lust and insolence of both that Ebroin was handed over to the custody of Luxeuil and intruded into the monastery and Theuderic, shorn, was forced to hide in the monastery of St. Denis. These were the first beginnings and causes of the hatreds of Theuderic and Ebroin against the holy bishops, whose counsels had restrained their madness. Ebroin had begun to rage first, having escaped from Luxeuil, gathering from everywhere those whose support he could rely on. Soon Theuderic, also restored and made a friend from an enemy, indulged Ebroin in everything. Hence the opportunity was given to Eberwin to murder Leodegar, whom he had previously often harassed and afflicted in various ways. This happened around the time when Pippin, the son of Ansegisel, prefect of the affairs of the Austrasians, succeeded Wulfrad as mayor of the palace, and he himself was defeated in a heavy battle by Ebroin; by whose singular skill Ebroin was later stabbed and killed by Ermenfrid, around the year of our Lord 688, that is, about the third year after the death of Leodegar. On this matter, the French chronographers agree beautifully, to whom indeed this is owed more faith, as it is more certain that anyone can be a more certain author of things done at home than any who have followed others and reported foreign things in writing. I have compiled the kings of the Franks in good faith and not with negligent computation of years into a certain catalog, which I gave to Mr. Stumpf as a gift. From this very thing, the computation of years about Ebroin and Theuderic can easily be gathered, which I would wish you to have seen. Here the step must be set cautiously and not easily acquiesced to anyone. For in no kind of writing is one more quickly asleep, especially by those who, having used scribes, patch together large books. Since therefore even Tschudi, the Glarner, quickly saw that certain tables, of which Rhenanus also makes mention, which make Wighard and Rupert dukes of Louis the Pious and bear the year of our Lord 905, are unworthy of faith, from which Leodegar was not absent by one century, and that Louis the Second, the son of Dagobert, cannot be understood, as if Wighard and Rupert were his dukes, since he died about 27 years before Leodegar was murdered, with two sons reigning afterwards, Lothar and Theuderic (who succeeded his deceased brother); I had to incline towards Louis, the son of the aforementioned Theuderic, and believe that Rupert and Wighard were his dukes. For he died around the year of our Lord 696, about the tenth year after the fate of Leodegar and about 18 years before the principate of Charles Martel, who was the author of the Carolingian lineage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In this way, therefore, the antiquity of the church is considered both yours and that of Lucerne (for it is useful to claim antiquity for this one for many reasons), nor am I overwhelmed by this stupor, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, to think that the first foundation is the greater church of Zurich, when it was collected and restored from the ruins by another of the dukes and again adorned with its gifts, and then indeed augmented by Charlemagne, with nobles meanwhile contributing as if their own offering; which your records, sent to me a few years ago, prove in clear words. I know and have learned more from you as an author, that the beginnings of that seat are very ancient, nor do I doubt that even during the flourishing times of the Romans, the beginnings of the Christian religion were in that place, as in other places of our country, namely Bregenz, of which there are evident testimonies. But not only that old building; but also the old city of Zurich, having been destroyed and obliterated by the eruptions of the Alemanni, with the forms of the provinces already going to ruin, was extinguished and reduced to a village. About this, I think, you do not doubt. Therefore, it must be understood that the foundations of the old Franks were more restorations than foundations in many places, and their praise was not small, that, having been converted to the faith of Christ, they immediately restored many churches to his glory, which their ancestors, lacking God in the world (to use Paul's words incidentally), had devastated with great hatred of the Christian name. The seat of Constance was quickly transferred from Windonissa, as it is believed, by the Franks; Dagobert later adorned it with buildings and revenues; Berta also, the mother of Charlemagne, provided for that seat. In this way, and also on the Rhine, some seats, previously afflicted by the Franks and treated foully, were finally restored and most splendidly adorned by the same, having been led to a better mind. About this matter, Rhenanus himself has reported with great faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Therefore, there is no need to attribute the foundation of the Fraumünster of your city to another duke and to deviate from another, which suffers no detriment and has more glory; especially since the Fraumünster has its own, and indeed well-known and undoubted, author of its foundation, that illustrious prince Louis, the grandson of Charlemagne. This would be a twisted and convoluted conjecture and would not a little arouse suspicion of some little glory, somewhat more affectatiously and without any necessity sought, from which I am persuaded you will easily decline, provided you have assessed the matter with dignity. However, I will easily yield if anyone has admonished me with certain and evident testimonies and arguments; for your (with your permission I say) do not satisfy me. For that which you bring: that Leodegar could not have been so suddenly referred to the gods, is rather cold; both because it is established that the Franks were so superstitious in this kind of veneration, that it was not far from the custom of the pagans that they sometimes almost referred even the living, excelling in holiness of life, to the gods (you know what Sulpitius wrote about Martin), and also because examples teach that miracles, as they were most recent, were received with the greatest admiration. Tiberius also, as Tertullian has reported, shortly after Christ was raised, wanted to refer him to the number of the gods in Rome and to pursue him with divine honors, unless the authority of the senate had opposed him. Our Gallus was immediately after his death held in divine honors, and he himself was without delay referred to the saints by Boso from the evidence of miracles. They also say that the acts of our monastery, that Abbot Conrad of Bussnang took care to have a chapel built and dedicated to Elizabeth, the wife of the Duke of Thuringia, recently canonized, to whom, however, while she was alive, he had joined himself as an advocate and intercessor in the court of Henry, the son of Frederick the Second (of whose counsels Conrad was). I appeal to Stumpf as a witness, whom I do not doubt read this in the acts of Conrad. Finally, about Leodegar, Sigbert in the deeds of the year 688, that is, the third after Leodegar suffered: "The innocence," he says, "and merit of Leodegar is declared by many miracles," etc. Therefore, moved by the fame of these, the duke, as if about to preempt others, dedicated a memory to him, where the miracles were more recent. Certainly, he did not receive a temple while alive, whatever Antoninus may collect.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What you bring about the lineage of the Carolingians, who did not have the Merovingians as predecessors, I know, that the Carolingians were neither successors of the Merovingians from the direct line of blood nor were these their predecessors. For the Roman pontiffs are noted for a certain perfidy, that for their own advantage, having rejected the legitimate blood of the Franks, they admitted the lineage of the Pippins to the kingdom, of which they were not previously lords nor heirs, but ministers. Therefore, the Carolingians rather aspired than rejected those predecessors of theirs, as if they too were of the royal lineage of the Franks, and they wanted to be seen as successors of them. But if you do not accept this, yet the discourse itself convinces, that the Carolingians were successors of the Merovingians and vice versa these were their predecessors. Therefore, this dart of yours, which you hurl at me, lacks sharpness and inflicts no wound; just as neither does that which you brought about the first duke of the Alemanni. For it is established that the Franks, after subjugating Alemannia, had dukes there perpetually for military affairs, not indeed princes, such as the later ones were around the time of Pippin and the Carolingians and afterwards, nor of their own power, but as devoted to servitude, although illustrious men, as they were then called. Therefore, they dared nothing without the orders of the kings, and that old table signifies that not even those churches built by their work were without the consent of their prince. I would like, therefore, to say in summary, that you would yield the place to the conjecture of the times, excellently confirmed, and not urge a full opinion of suspicions, with which your records disagree and fight. However, for this reason, I would not want anything to be confidently affirmed, which our conjecture supports the antiquity of either the restored church of Zurich and that long-lived antiquity of it, by which it far surpasses the church of Lucerne, does not detract even a little, but rather acknowledges and confirms it more. So much for the foundation and Leodegar.</p>

      <p>But if you do not accept my opinion from the reasons I have brought, I appeal to Mr. Stumpf and testify that I will stand by his pronouncement. Although I would have a right to an exception due to the exceptional friendship by which he is joined to you, yet because he is also, as I hope, by a great right of friendship and familiarity attached to me, I will not be burdened to accept without any tergiversation what has been pronounced by him. This one thing I solemnly pray to you, my dearest, that you give a successor to Stumpf and call him from the countryside to the city with his wife and children, when Froschauer begins to print the work. He will be able to gratify both us and Froschauer greatly here, especially in such a great and varied and impeded work. As for Theodoret, we anxiously await yours. I, being mostly ignorant of the Greek language, could not perceive whether it was the same work or different. Now, having been truly informed by you, I no longer hesitate.</p>

      <p>Regarding the crimes of the Baalites, there is no doubt. For from Rorschach, the parish priest was ordered to be taken away bound and handed over to the Bishop of Constance by our abbot, and it is clear that he abused his natural daughter for a long time; which he himself also confessed while in chains, in which she is still detained pregnant. It is a constant rumor that the parish priest of Goldach made his sister pregnant, and there are those who believe that he violated both. Regarding the others, about whom I had written, there is also a constant rumor; but to know for certain what the matter itself holds, I will inquire more thoroughly.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, the pastor in Arbon, who still holds the priestly office and is well informed of the truth, attempted for the second time at night to be led away by the devil. He also showed in great sweat, with drops running down his face, that he saw the spirit before him, who wanted to take him, and then called out that the evangelical preacher should be sent quickly (for he is not badly at one with him, and therefore was willing to appear and offer comfort for the second time). As often as he has come, it has gotten better, and the pastor said that the fellow, whom he saw stumbling before him, has gone away from him, etc. We are of good hope that God will have warned him with such a trial, so that he may turn to the Lord and truly proclaim his name, for he is otherwise a well-spoken, personable, and not unlearned man.</p>

      <p>I have read and reread the table of contents of your book on the sacraments and see the illustrious work, which can certainly admonish the reader of clear truth in this matter. I earnestly ask you not to let me lack a printed copy of it.</p>

      <p>Luther's propositions have nothing rare, why they should have been printed. He inculcates and proposes the carnal eating of the flesh of Christ. Such a supper (since it is Thyestean) will not have me as a guest. I greatly rejoice in the grace and fortunes of Haller among the people of Augsburg. Many good men feared that his first arrival might cause some discord due to the variety of doctrine; but I see the grace of the Lord opposing the arts of Satan, which we earnestly pray may elevate him to great dignity among them.</p>

      <p>Regarding the rest sent to me, I give great thanks. I return what you ordered, and at the same time send epigrams, which are thought to be of the preacher of the Duke of Württemberg, a man not inelegant; although the other, about the Moon, the Rooster, and the Eagle, is said to be by Philipp, which Schnepf sent from Regensburg to some friends in Stuttgart. They are written in a not very dissimilar thread. However, they say it is by Philipp's disciple, who is now the preacher of the Duke of Württemberg. The Abbot of Blaubeuren died a few months ago, a man, while he was, frugal, avaricious, and sordid. After his death, Duke Ulrich sent to confiscate the remaining furniture. There they found a considerable sum of money, who examined the chests, although the hypocrite, however vain and mendacious, at the rumor of any even the slightest exaction, cried out that he was poor and without money. Because of this and because otherwise, according to the custom of these men, he was not of a sufficiently approved life, it is said that an epigram was written about him, as a type of wicked abbots, indeed an elegant argument, from which it can be inferred how boldly some do not hesitate to cut into the lives of wicked abbots. The other about the Moon, the Rooster, the Eagle, that is about the Turk, the Frank, the emperor, seemed rather cold to me; but it nevertheless has not inept praise of the orders of the empire and is not an inauspicious omen of victory, which it promises to them with great confidence.</p>

      <p>Besides, there is nothing new. The people of Lindau have equipped the walls of the city or rather the towers for every case of war, they are fortifying the gate of the bridge connecting the island with the mainland very strongly. For what reasons this is done is kept silent; but it is nevertheless said by some that the emperor has secretly provided for some tribunes and somewhat more experienced soldiers through the Walgau valley and the Allgäu mountains; for that region abounds with good soldiers. I like the will of the Lord in his acting so vigilantly and circumspectly. Indeed, it is for me as a vice of the most certain argument, that the father of mercies is in this, lest his own for the glory of the son shining again in the world be deserted, but rather be adorned with certain benefits of grace.</p>

      <p>Epigram about the Moon, the Eagle, and the Rooster. The Moon, grieving that she is placed in the lowest part of the sky, full of anger and redness, says: Shall I always suppress just sorrows, despised, and my honor lie without end? If I cannot hold the highest of heaven, I will hold the highest of earth, whoever thinks to follow the lowest is degenerate. The invincible signs of monarchs will yield to me, nor will anyone feel himself to be my equal. The Eagles will shamefully lower their wings, the Rooster will henceforth be prey to me. All climates will obey the ruling Moon, climates which the fleeing Sun and the rising one see. Perhaps balancing their wings through the summer sky, the twin birds heard the words of the speaking one. One is sacred to Jupiter, the other banishes the night with song, both think themselves worthy to hold the highest. The Moon forbids, they desire, she desires, and at the same time all three want to be the lords of the whole world. Soon the Eagle strives into the stars with aerial flight, despising the bird, despising the goddess. The Rooster, a rival, follows with foolish effort, and will raise his crest among the other birds. But the goddess who fills the lands with nocturnal light thinks it shameful to yield her power to a bird. Then Jupiter, moved by the doubtful contest, says, I have given the scepter neither to the Rooster nor to you, Moon. My bird will always have the judgment of the world, let this be the armiger of great Jupiter and remain so. If anyone dares to pluck his swift feathers, he will feel his feet armed with claws. He will feel the sharpness of the beak, which he wields, and those which are accustomed to bring thunderbolts to us. He had spoken: hence the Moon and the Rooster fear the Eagle, and allow what Jupiter has decreed to be. Whenever they remember the judgment of the Thunderer, immediately unwilling blush covers their faces. Hence you see the Rooster's crest often blushing, hence the Moon's cheeks are often marked with purple.</p>

      <p>What an abbot of our age should be like, a graphic hypotyposis to the example of Ambrose, Abbot of Blaubeuren: If anyone asks me what an abbot should be like, whom the mitre makes in our time. Let him receive briefly, and learn in true verse, what a written page hardly teaches from behind. First, let him be unlearned, and finally so uninitiated, that he has not even once touched Aesop. Let him attribute nothing to right studies, let him despise everywhere those who devote all their time to good studies. Let him drive away those who know both the Greek and Latin languages from the first doors as if they were a snake. If profit occurs, let him never avoid perjuries. Let him always neglect faith for the love of money. Let him always love filth, let him always be avaricious, let him never receive the needy in hospitality perfidiously. If something is to be given to the king, let him immediately cry out that the granaries are exhausted, and that nothing remains for him. If the horrid impression of the Turks is at the very threshold, let him wish to help our camp with no hair. Let him squeeze the miserable farmers, and increase the taxes from everywhere, eternal avarice being his sustenance. Let him applaud himself, praise the most luxurious baths, lead many courtesans with a generous hand. Let him bind the brothers like donkeys in a harsh prison, and order them to be chaste with little food. Meanwhile, whatever is luxurious and pleasing to the palate, let him procure for himself with a sumptuous purchase. Let him consume no oil, but very much wine, let him always make Venus more than Pallas. Riding on a high horse, and with a large accompanying crowd, let him raise his brow with a grave forehead everywhere. Let neither piety nor the insignia of virtues bend him, let him believe that he alone lives and is wise. Let him never buy books, it is better to hire cooks, who nourish the fat limbs with easy labor. Let him have many wives, if he is a spring abbot. Thus he will be said to be a father indeed. The end.</p>
