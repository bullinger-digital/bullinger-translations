    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has suggested informing the guardian [of Dorothea Wirz] of the girl's opinion and, if he [still does not agree to her marriage with Jakob Walder], to hand the matter over to Heinrich [Lochmann]. Wirz was not with [the?] miller, the guardian, and therefore cannot negotiate with [Sulpitius Haller], but he intends to take care of the matter. If the rumor is true that the marriage has already been consummated, the relatives would probably be easily persuaded to relent, but deliberately circumventing the laws is not advisable. He asks for information about the true situation and warns against trusting the wrong people.</p>

      <p>Kind, dear, and Christian lord and brother, I have well understood your letter, namely that you are concerned the guardian might not be favorable to the matter. It might seem more fruitful to you that we inform the guardian of the girl's opinion, and if the guardian then agrees, it would be well and good; if not, we should then recommend the matter to Heinrich. My response to this is that I have not been with the miller, the girl's guardian. Therefore, it is not my place to negotiate with the chief guardian, as I do not know if he is with him or not. However, if I come to him, we will see how the matter unfolds. Although, according to what I hear from my wife, who heard it from someone who knows and is aware of the matter, it might not be necessary. For the matter is clear, they have taken each other. If this is indeed the case, I again know no better advice than that you appeal to the chief guardian, that he, since it is bound to happen anyway, helps persuade the relatives, and if that happens, I think the relatives, although they will otherwise not be entirely satisfied, will soon relent. However, if it is not yet over, my advice is not to do it secretly; for you can well imagine what it might bring you and the lord if you violate your own decrees. Therefore, my request is that you do well and inform me, once you have learned the truth about the girl and the boy, so that I can then act with the guardian accordingly. I am concerned that you trust some people who, without a doubt, have already spoiled the matter before. With that, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given on the last day of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your always willing Ulrich Wirz.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially kind, dear lord and Christian brother, to hand.</p>
