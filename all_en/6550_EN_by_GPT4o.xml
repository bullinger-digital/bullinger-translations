      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, with the longest-lasting safety, I pray for you with all my heart. I diligently commend to you my respect, dedication, and service.</p>
      <p>In the previous months, I wrote to you, Bullinger, most illustrious man and most revered father, quite long letters, and I took care to have them delivered to you diligently; for I gave the same letters to several merchants traveling by different routes, so that at least one, as I hope, would reach your hands, and also to show you how your letters can be safely delivered to us.</p>
      <p>In these, I lamented much about us, more about the disturbance of our kingdom, and most about the devastation of our church, which would be long and very troublesome for both of us to recount again. You will read those letters, silently consider them, and, I know, with your humanity, you will weep for our situation, especially since no remedy appears, and that contagion spreads more and more each day. About this matter, everything would be reported to you by Nicolaus Dlusius, a noble Pole, renowned among our people, and distinguished. Since he is now very closely connected to me by habit, I cannot help but love him greatly, whom you already know well with your fellow students; for he was educated among you and now returns to visit you and to conduct some other business.</p>
      <p>I ask you to embrace him in your usual manner; he is worthy to be loved by both you and all the pious; for he endured many struggles with the Arians with us and even strongly opposed his own mother, an Arian woman.</p>
      <p>For when all those tried to draw him to their side, he, by the singular protection of God, escaped not once, which is why you should receive him and welcome him with the humanity you are accustomed to. Moreover, he brings with him to you two noble young men, connected to him by the right of kinship and dear to him.</p>
      <p>I commend them to you, especially since they have been with me and in our company and instruction for several months, and I wish them to be particularly commended to all those distinguished men who pursue the humanities. They are sent there at my urging and persuasion, to devote themselves to the humanities and also to divine studies, to learn not inelegant manners, to then acquire your language, to observe and contemplate the form and image of the well-established church, which alone I am refreshed by as the purest, to thoroughly learn the doctrines of the most holy true religion, untainted by any error, to receive the seeds of Christian piety, which among you are most incorrupt, best, and sound, so that when they return to us, not some common, but a distinguished example of our divine religion may shine in them, not mediocre learning, but profound knowledge may be shown, manners not unrefined nor inelegant may appear, all of which we confidently believe and persuade ourselves they will bring with them through your utmost humanity.</p>
      <p>Their father is a distinguished man, born of an illustrious family and adorned with great dignity, endowed with the best morals, a supporter of evangelical doctrine, and a most ardent opponent of the antitrinitarians, which is why we wish his noble and well-educated children to be most commendable to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the booklet of Osii, the most wicked scoundrel, in which he draws the sword against you and the ministers of Heidelberg, we are very eager to know what you have decided. Here, as if having achieved victory, his conspirators are already preparing a triumph.</p>
      <p>But oh, if only, most illustrious Bullinger, you could dispel his clouds with a few words and place some bridle on his so unrestrained mouth, so that he may not so freely, insolently, and petulantly frolic and rant against you, the distinguished servants of Jesus Christ, and the other ministers of God with impunity.</p>
      <p>As for me and my condition, there is nothing else to write to you, my father, that I have not most copiously expressed in previous letters. I am in constant labors and am afflicted with the gravest troubles daily.</p>
      <p>May God grant that all things may turn to the benefit and growth of our church. The noble Mr. Nicolaus Dlusius will fill or rather complete the rest about the miserable state of our kingdom and our church. But even the boys would report much about my vigils and labors.</p>
      <p>I touched on a few things in letters to Simler and Lavater. Now farewell most happily, my most revered father Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May God, our one in Trinity, whom you serve from the heart, keep you safe and happy and in this decrepit age in good health for a long time and fulfill all your wishes.</p>
      <p>I most dutifully greet your dearest sons, my most revered brothers, and Veritas and Dorothea, your daughters, most excellent virgins, and your entire family and fellow students, to whom I humbly commend myself. Given in Krakow from our little school on the Nones of October 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and observant servant Christophorus Thretius... and to the most pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger,... the distinguished servant of Christ and the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich,... most revered brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
