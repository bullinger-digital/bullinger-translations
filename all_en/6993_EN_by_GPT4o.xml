      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless you and keep you from evil, dear brother. I was pleased to read that you have been most amicably accepted by the esteemed council of Chur and the beloved brothers. However, I was not pleased to read that after so many proofs of your rightful calling, you nonetheless speak of having someone more worthy than you appointed in your place. You ask this in vain; remember Jonah, lest something worse befall you. The talent you have received, place it on the table, and leave the success and profit to the Lord, who gave it to you and called you; have you forgotten what happened to the servant who buried his talent wrapped in a cloth? Nothing more disgraceful could happen to you or be imposed upon you than if you were now released and had another as your successor. Therefore, offer your hand to the Lord and say with the prophet: "Let my Lord speak, and the servant will listen." How imprudently you complain in the meantime, while you remain in Chur for a month or a month and a half, that your wife and children will perish from hunger at home! Does she live among barbarians, so that if she is deprived of everything, there is no one to relieve her poverty, or have you managed your household in such a way that your home does not have enough to live on for a month and a half? See, see, my brother, lest by complaining too much you offend the Lord and recommend yourself too little to good men and your friends. However, I attribute this to your mind, now indeed anxious, and I excuse it in some way.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, see to it, for your piety, that you make amends for all this at some point and conduct your life and manners more worthily. You have a merciful and powerful Lord, who will not fail you when invoked. Farewell again and always use me as your own.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in great haste, January 6, in the year of our Lord 1567. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the esteemed councilors most amicably on my behalf. To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
