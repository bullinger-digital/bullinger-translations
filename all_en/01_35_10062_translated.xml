  <input>Gratiam et vitę innocentiam per Christum.

Recte tu quidem, mi Heinrice, sed sero nimis mones atque eum, cui haec sententia parum placet. Quid dicam? Si iudices damno, parum officiosus sum et periculo me expono, si laudo, culpę socius ero, si dissimulo, parum candidus et dexter iudicor, si scribo me non interfuisse iudicio, dum ferretur sententia, arrogantiae notam quis inpinget. Nihil igitur restat nisi deum anxiis precibus pulsare, ut omnibus nobis id donet, ne adfectibus praecipites feramur, quod hic factum si siet, parcat. Non nihil autem et ab eo peccatum est, quem mihi commendas, qui, ut audio, socorditer contionem suam instituit, frigide adversarie partis argumenta repulit, quęque maxime loqui oportuit, neglexit. Scis, quos stimulos et aculeo[s] oratio habet ad excitandos animos iudicum. Sed hic factum doleo, quod Plinius Secundus in «Epistolis» scribit: «Minor», inquit, «vis bonis quam malis inest, ac sicut ἀμαθία μὲν θράσος, λογισμὸς δὲ ὄκνον φέρει. Ita recta ingenia debilitat verecundia, perversa confirmat audacia». Ego vero hominem admonui, ut gnaviter et strenue coram senatu dicat et priorem ignaviam resarciat. Quod si priorem sententiam confirmaverit senatus, utcumque ipsi peccarint, nihil tamen dubito divina hunc providentia pessima meretrice liberatum nihil habere, quod vel doleat vel queratur.

Tu vale optime, frater.

  <output>Through Christ, grace and innocence of life.

You are right indeed, my dear Heinric, but you are too late in your warning and that of him who is not pleased with this sentence. What shall I say? If I condemn the judges, I will be thought unfaithful and put myself in danger. If I praise them, I will be a partner in their guilt. If I dissemble, I will be considered as not being honest and even-handed. If I write that I was not present when the sentence was given, someone will accuse me of arrogance. There is nothing to do but to pray to God with anxious prayers that He may grant us all not to be hurried away by our emotions, if this is done, may He have mercy. It is also to be blamed by him whom you recommend to me, who, as I hear, began his speech with too much indifference, coldly repelled the arguments of the opposite party, and neglected to say what should have been said. You know with what force and vigour speeches have to excite the minds of the judges. But I lament that this has happened, as Pliny the Second writes in his 'Letters': 'Less force', says he, 'is in the hands of the good than the bad, and as ignorance is boldness, consideration is timidity. So, modesty weakens honest minds, and audacity confirms bad ones.' But I have admonished the man to speak bravely and vigorously before the senate, and to repair the former negligence. If the senate should confirm the former sentence, let him not, however, grieve or complain, since I have no doubt that divine providence will deliver him from this wicked prostitute.

Farewell, my dear brother.

From Zurich, 11th July 1530.
