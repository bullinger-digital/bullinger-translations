      <p>S. I was entirely hoping that, before those two brothers, from whom you received this letter, returned to you, we would receive a response, Mr. Calvin and I, to those matters about which we recently wrote to you.</p>
      <p>However, I do not doubt that you are certainly aware of the reason for the delay in the response up to this time, nor do I press except with this condition, as far as the ongoing affairs, which I know well press upon you daily, will allow, and as long as it will not be inconvenient for you to respond, although I do not hide that the hope of this concord, which perhaps I dream of rather than hope for, is of such great concern to me that I am somewhat importunate whenever I think about promoting these matters. Yet, you will at least, as I trust, approve of my intention.</p>
      <p>Regarding our affairs: we continue still by the grace of God; a wolf or rather a hungry lion is looming at the door, who perhaps will even bite. Meanwhile, however, we continue and, as I hope, will continue relying on God's promises and the prayers of the churches. I have already written about what I feared concerning France.</p>
      <p>Things are indeed such that it is necessary for horrendous tumults to be stirred up, and we expect no other news daily. We have kept everyone in duty as much as we could, nor have we ceased to advise that the brothers arm themselves with patience alone for a while, until God provides for them either by another means or by raising up some prince. Now I do not know whether they have the foundation of a certain calling; but it is entirely certain that the patience of the pious, once exhausted, will produce something remarkable. Therefore, we are now entirely anxious and do not cease to pray to the Lord to moderate these storms according to His remarkable clemency and mercy. One of the presidents of the parliament was slaughtered in Paris by four passersby, when he was returning home from the slaughterhouse, a notable scoundrel and apostate. The author of the murder is unknown; but I wish that our people are not falsely accused.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the judgments of God are just; but our hands often sin, and I confess that I shudder at these crimes. If things continue in this way, good God, how much slaughter and bloodshed everywhere! May the Lord therefore have mercy on us and grant us that the doctrine of peace and patience does not suffer ill repute through our fault! In Scotland, they say everything is still succeeding excellently, may it be so to the end! Concerning the people of Trier, sad news, which I think is better known to you than to me. The people of Strasbourg have opened their city to our exiles, of which service may God remember! I have postponed to the last place what has greatly disturbed us these days.</p>
      <p>Our Calvin, when on Sunday, December 24th, he had strained his voice more vigorously in the sermon because of the huge crowd that had gathered in the main church to celebrate the Lord's Supper, and the next day in the evening he was seized by a very severe cough, began to cough up blood profusely, so that the doctors plainly suspected some vein had burst. However, the Lord granted to the prayers of our entire church that the flow stopped the next morning and now we have conceived the best hope that He will also have mercy on our head in him. Therefore, I ask that you also join your prayers with ours or rather thanksgiving, so that you cannot now reproach me with that Homeric saying, a prophet of evils.</p>
      <p>I would have most gladly written to Mr. Martyr, with whom I do not doubt you will share everything I have written to you; but time did not allow. Therefore, I ask that you be willing to share this letter with him and greet him most lovingly in my name. May the Lord Jesus preserve you for His church, my father, with the remaining brothers and bless your labors more and more. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Mr. Calvin, Galasius, and Viretus send you many greetings. On the first of January.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father, and the faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
