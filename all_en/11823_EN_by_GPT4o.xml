    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bucer's letter from July 21 [No. 1763], in which he reports on the dangerous situation [of Archbishop Hermann von Wied]; understands Bucer's concern about the behavior of the estates, but was able to gather from a letter by Myconius [No. 1773] that the diet has approved the reformation draft ["Einfaltigs bedencken" by Bucer and Melanchthon], which greatly pleases [the people of Zurich]; requests the sending of this document. Has written a commentary on the Gospel of John in nine months of work; in it, he opposes [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld's teachings whenever the opportunity arises, and addresses the unity of the divine and human nature of Christ, as the old errors are resurfacing - just think of [Michael] Servetus, Campensis [Johannes Campanus], Claude [d'Aliod], and the Anabaptists. Recommendations and best wishes.</p>

      <p>To Dr. Martin Bucer, minister of Christ Jesus, beloved brother.</p>
      <p>I received your letter written in Bonn on July 21st, on August 6th, from which I understood the great danger faced by the excellent old man, which made me very anxious not so much for the excellent old man as for the great scandal and the downfall of the saints, which you rightly feared would happen if the counts, nobles, and townspeople of the archbishop turned their backs on the truth. But thanks be to God, who moved the hearts of these people to obey the truth! For on August 14th, Myconius writes that in that diet, they unanimously agreed on the prescribed reformation and added that they would bravely endure whatever the Lord would impose on them for it. You cannot believe how much joy this news brought to all of us, praising the Lord's mercy, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever. May He grant that they adhere to the reformation they have received with ready minds, holy and steadfastly, through all the dangers of temptations. However, I have not yet seen anything of this reformation; therefore, I would like to ask you not to withhold it from me. For we all greatly desire to see it.</p>
      <p>For nine continuous months, not without great labor, I have both written and published ten books of commentaries on the Gospel of John amidst public and domestic affairs, which are neither few nor light, in which I have endeavored to render the context of the speech, that is, the sense of the apostle, and to vindicate the use of the gospel. Whenever the occasion allowed, I opposed the new and harmful doctrine of Schwenckfeld, especially in chapters 1, 2, 3, 9, 16, 17, and 20, where I discuss the truth of the resurrected body. But I also treated with great care and diligence the adorable divinity of Christ the Lord and His true humanity united in one indivisible person, so that I might timely prevent the old errors, which are continually sprouting with quite abundant growth in the curious and weak minds of some, with the scriptures and the orthodox interpretations of the holy fathers. For you are not unaware of what seed Servetus, Campensis, Claudius, and the most venomous sect of the Anabaptists have left in the minds of many. I certainly wished to serve and benefit all the saints with these my labors, as the Lord Jesus, the searcher of all hearts, knows, and I hope I have done something not ungrateful to the pious and grateful.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your charity and your prayers. May the Lord Jesus keep you together with the most holy church and school of Strasbourg.</p>
