    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter yesterday, from which he saw that Bullinger was grateful for his letter; hindered by business, pain, and the haste of the young, learned messenger, he can now only write back briefly. Melanchthon informed Frecht by letter that the rekindled dispute over the Lord's Supper, which does not heal the churches but rather throws them into turmoil, causes him infinite pain; he also expressed the possibility of discussing it with Frecht in person soon. Since the young messenger from Schaffhausen [Blasius Oechsli or Jakob RÃ¼eger] is bringing a copy of Luther's polemical writing ["Kurtz bekentnis"], Frecht does not need to send the only copy [available in Ulm]; the rest will be reported by the messenger. Allegedly, Emperor [Charles V] wants to move the Diet of Worms to Augsburg and publish a new book to settle the [disputes over] religion, which pleases neither the Lutherans nor the Catholics. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received your letters, which were welcome not only because they conveyed that mine, however they were, were pleasing to you. Although I should have responded more fully, I am hindered by both my occupations and pains, as well as the haste of this learned young messenger. As you see, I write back rudely and briefly, asking the Lord to so guide and direct your pen that you commit nothing unworthy of Christ's truth and your modesty.</p>
      <p>The excellent Melanchthon, writing to me, begins thus: "If I were to shed tears as your Danube does waters, my sorrow would not be exhausted, which the renewal of the war over the Lord's Supper brings me. I am not greatly troubled by the change in my own affairs; I grieve that the churches are disturbed, not healed. For this controversy is not resolved nor settled by these quarrels. I think of many things, about which perhaps we will soon speak in person." The excellent Philipp Melanchthon wrote this from the depths of my own heart, beseeching everyone to restrain the words of the wise with Christian moderation.</p>
      <p>Since this learned young man from Schaffhausen is bringing a copy of Luther's most bitter writing to Zurich, there was no need for me to send it; for we have only one common copy here. The rest will be told by this living letter.</p>
      <p>It is indeed rumored that the Emperor wishes to transfer the Diet of Worms to Augsburg and propose some new book for the settlement of religion, which will be acceptable neither to the Lutherans nor to the Papists. Time will reveal this and other things.</p>
      <p>Friends and brothers respectfully greet you all, with whom fare well in Him who is our truth and champion.</p>
      <p>In haste, Ulm, 29th October 1544.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful and worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
