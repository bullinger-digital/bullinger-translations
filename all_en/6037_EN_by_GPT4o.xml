      <p>God's grace and all good things through Christ first, etc.</p>
      <p>Especially trusted, friendly, dear lord and brother, I have received your brotherly letter and very faithful warning with special great thanks, as is proper.</p>
      <p>May the faithful God also always warn and save you from all dangers of body and soul. Amen.</p>
      <p>In addition, I inform you that the bailiff of Schwyz recently addressed my dear brother-in-law Gorius of Ulm on behalf of and in the name of the Five Places and accused him (not without a long preface of honor) of how his sister, my dear sister, had her parish in Leutmerken secured by me, which was intolerable to his lords, since I have no dismissal or legal right from an authority in Constance, nor otherwise like any other common preacher, but am the one who brought the people of Constance into all their misfortune, etc. To which my dear brother-in-law replied: since his sister's pastor had died and they could not immediately find another suitable and capable one, they had asked me to secure the parish for a time until they could fill it with another who would then be permanently there, which I had kindly granted; I had also agreed to stay here no longer than until next Easter or at the latest until St. John's Day, and whether they would not want to grant and allow this to my dear sister; for she hoped to obtain one in the meantime. To which he replied: it was his lords' opinion that they should get rid of me there; the sooner it happened, the better it would be; yet they would not proceed against her for a fortnight. He also let it be known that they had good reason to act differently against me; but nevertheless, they had refrained from doing so for various reasons, etc. He flattered the dear brother-in-law, saying he was a man who suited the country well, and the like, etc., all of which the dear brother-in-law, as soon as he returned home from the meeting, reported to my dear sister through her son, my dear cousin Hans Walther, who informed me of the same, and the dear brother-in-law himself also came to me in Griessemberg and revealed all this to me, whereupon I, since it was Friday, preached the following Sunday and on Wednesday, the Purification of Mary, since it was also a holiday, and then ceased preaching, and Master Josua Maler from Elgg preached here on February 6th. It will be seen that the parish will thus be secured by others until the arrival of my dear brother's sons, who are on their way; they would like to assign the parish to one of them, to whom the matter would be intended among them; they are all pious, Christian, and capable young men, but perhaps not gifted enough to preach, as my son is also not at all suitable for it, who has nevertheless practiced it now and with me for a year and a day, so that I must grasp that the Lord wants to use him for something else, as He then accomplishes much and various things through us humans on earth. My dear brother-in-law and others of mine can well suspect for good reasons who has practiced these things with the Five Places; it cannot be written. But nevertheless, the Lord has willed it so; He does everything for my good, of which I have no doubt at all.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, if it were only a matter of obtaining a dismissal, etc., I would still trust to obtain it; they have not expelled me, any more than the others, but have released us from our service and amicably dismissed us with the payment of the usual salary, without banning the city.</p>
      <p>There will also be no need to give us credit for our honorable, pious conduct, and that we have taught what the authorities have commanded us to teach and preach more than once, and that in a friendly and peaceful manner; but there must always be a pretext and appearance when one wants to act in such a manner.</p>
      <p>Everything is entrusted to dear God.</p>
      <p>Until now, I have written in Leutmerken and waited for a message to you, which is still not certain. And now there are rumors that the Five Places have completely forbidden me the Thurgau, so that my dear sister and her sons think I should withdraw for a while until this is properly clarified; for my dear brother-in-law Gorius of Ulm has been instructed to speak with my dear sister so that she does not let me manage the parish, with the attached reasons as stated above.</p>
      <p>If they had wanted to completely forbid me the Thurgau, they would have done so in another way and not through my dear sister, that she should forbid me the Thurgau on behalf of the Five Places; it would be quite unreasonable, nor do the words match what the bailiff from Schwyz said to my dear brother-in-law and instructed him to convey to my dear sister, etc. But nevertheless, for my greater security, I have arranged with the advice of mine to go to you next Tuesday, intending to ask you to inquire through one of your envoys, especially with the mayor of Chur, who is also involved in this undertaking... *, whether it is their intention that I should completely avoid the Thurgau, etc.</p>
      <p>For such a thing would be very burdensome to me for many reasons (as you can well imagine), nor can I suspect it at all, since I have been in Griessemberg with all mine for a year and a day after the Constance incident; I have not been accused of anything new since then to my knowledge, and mine and I consider it to be solely about the preaching; if I desist, they will be as satisfied as ever. However, mine and I kindly ask you to inquire about this with yours, if they were present; if not, that they may learn it from the bailiff Reding on the upcoming day. You would do us all a special friendship by doing so, so that we do not come into new trouble unexpectedly and without guilt. We are all entirely obliged to you in a friendly, serviceable, and Christian manner.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday before Invocavit.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours on behalf of all of us and pray for us.</p>
      <p>Winterthur 1564.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius Blarer, entirely yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable brother and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
