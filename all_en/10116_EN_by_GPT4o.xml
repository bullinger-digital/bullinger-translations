    <p xml:id="regest1">Concerned about the bad news spread by enemies regarding the state of the Reformation in Switzerland, Sam complains about attacks from two sides: from Luther, whose latest writing, the "Open Letter to Duke Albrecht," he encloses, and from the Catholics, who were already speaking of the downfall of the divided Swiss. He requests more frequent news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>That wound, most illustrious men, which the death of the most illustrious heroes Zwingli and Oecolampadius had long since inflicted on my mind, is being reopened and made to fester by bad rumors day by day. For from the Swiss, nothing but the most unfortunate news is reported to us, namely that the mass will soon be restored both in Zurich and everywhere, that the ministers of the word are regarded as the refuse of all, and that the audacity of the enemies is growing more and more. There is nothing, dearest brothers, that torments my mind more than such rumors flying from the mouths of the impious. Only the power of Christ consoles, lifts up, encourages, and makes one confident and cheerful. For I hope that even in this age, people will say that there is fruit for the just and that God is a judge on earth. Therefore, let us be steadfast. He, whom we serve, can do all things, and the weaker we have become, the more vigilantly let us act and more ardently implore the help of our God. For He will not fail His cause, when we have wholly devoted ourselves to Him alone.</p>
      <p>Satan exercises us from the right and from the left: from the right through Luther, who desires all to be lost who refuse to adore his impanate. I am sending to you the booklet which the madman has spewed out, where the only truth I found was his complaint of a headache. For truly and most gravely he suffers from a head ailment. May the Lord grant him not only a healthy head but also a sounder mind. The Catholics on the left proclaim that it is over for us. They say that an opportunity has been given to the Emperor, by which he can defeat and utterly destroy his enemies through the remaining Swiss of the Five Cantons, now broken and dissenting, and that he can easily and with almost no effort crush them. When this succeeds, it will be over for the cities and other orders professing the Gospel of Christ. But we, knowing what follows the security of the impious and that the Father has given all things into Christ's hands, will meanwhile proceed bravely and diligently pray to the Lord to frustrate and destroy all the efforts of all the impious.</p>
      <p>Write to us more frequently about the state of your churches, so that just as we have been companions in tribulations, if a better breeze blows, we may also be companions in consolation.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, best brothers, and keep me commended. Greet Pellicanus from me courteously. I wish all your pious, learned, and all yours to be safe.</p>
      <p>Ulm, 14th of April, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Konrad Sam, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the men of outstanding piety and learning, Leo Jud and Heinrich Bullinger, overseers of the people of Zurich, his brothers always to be respected.</p>
