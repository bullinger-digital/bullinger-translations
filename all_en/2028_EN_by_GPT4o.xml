      <p>My friendly greetings. My dear child, know that it greatly pleases me that you are so well taken care of. I ask you to conduct yourself well, be humble and clean with yourself, godly and... honest towards God and the people.</p>
      <p>I ask you to always remember why you are in a foreign land, and use your time well, get up early, do not be lazy, and pray diligently at all times. Beware of bad company and enjoy being at home. Furthermore, let me know how your clothing situation is, if you have enough shirts or how they are being washed, do they need to be soaped or does your lady wash them? Whatever it is, have it written down and greet her warmly for me, and do not let your shoes fall apart, have them repaired and be thrifty.</p>
      <p>No more, may God protect you from harm.</p>
      <p>From me, Anna Bullinger, your mother.</p>
      <p>Atty greets you.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger from Zurich, my dear son, currently in Strasbourg with Mr. Johann Burckhardt, the Englishman.</p>
