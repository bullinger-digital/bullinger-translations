      <p>Greetings. I would certainly now use a longer excuse with you,... and I would be even more anxious that I have refrained from writing for so long, contrary to my custom, and have not yet responded to your last letters, in which you once deigned to leave your utmost kindness and singular benevolence towards me confirmed and attested, if I did not hope that you would easily grant me pardon when you understand that I was mistaken in my continuous expectation of your arrival to us. For almost all of your people have been expecting you in this city for more or less a month and a half, hoping with incredible desire that you would come any day. Knowing that I was not the last among them, I confess that I also refrained from writing back. But now, since all hope has been cut off for me, I can no longer delay, but at least at this time I must declare in my letters what I could not explain in person, that your Charles was so affected by your letters that he cannot express in words how much he owes you for this reason alone. For you immediately connect so many reasons from the beginning, by which you both encourage me and urge me to continue, and finally persuade me never to hesitate to write to you, that I would be plainly rustic if I did not henceforth, relying on that freedom which you so liberally grant me, diligently write as often as an opportunity presents itself for someone to deliver letters to you. Moreover, from the fact that you wished to inform me about matters so varied and of great importance, I also gather how much you value a man well aware of his own modesty, and at the same time, I admire and respect your candor and rare humanity more and more. But that is the excellence and incredible virtue of all the former servants of Christ, that the more benefits they have received from the best and greatest God, the more they humble themselves and embrace the most abject. I certainly say this not for the sake of flattery, but truly from the heart and having experienced it so often, that if I were silent, I might be considered the most ungrateful of men, nor indeed are these things said by me only to bestow the honor they deserve to the sincere servants of God as a duty, but to attribute praise to the author of all good, to whom they credit whatever virtue and excellence they perceive in themselves. Now, most distinguished man, since I can do nothing for your sake, I at least give you the thanks I can for the benevolence with which you treat me, and I will not cease to humbly pray to God the Father to keep you safe for a long time for His church. However, I do not see what news I should write, since you understand everything much better from others. Our Oswald has conducted himself modestly and calmly so far, and not only is he making progress in literary studies, but he is also applying himself to our language, having already made some progress in it. There are those who encourage him towards piety and duty. The one who will deliver my letters to you is the son of a certain French merchant, a good man, who conducts his trade honorably in our city. If you ever see him, please remind him to always be mindful of his duty. All of yours here greet you reverently, especially Mr. Marquis Vici, Martinengus, Macharius, Brother Budaeus, Crispinus, Robertus, all of whom I have greeted on your behalf.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and most esteemed by me with perpetual respect. May the Lord always be with you, protect you with His care, continue to enrich you with His gifts, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, on the Ides of June 1557.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful servant of Christ and most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
