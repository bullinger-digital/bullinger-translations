      <p> I wrote to the council of Zurich; it seemed more prudent this way. If the consuls think that it should not be read in the council, let it be up to them; however, I hope it is written so modestly that it can be read in the council. I account for the matter I have handled in such a way that I always aim at the target; I would have sent you a copy, had the labor of copying not delayed me. I am very busy. If I had not been too modest at first, now more people would have known the truth, who could have been educated by me. But since both were priests, I did not want to intervene for a while, until it began to be about the freedom of the fatherland and the church, etc. - The advice of Mr. Heinrich's son pleases me, and when the host said he would do what the consul ordered, I met with Consul Tscharner. He said he would announce the matter in the council, that he would not do too much or too little; but there was no need. However, I doubt the crowns of Lamprecht; I will still urge the matter. - The assembly of God's house is still gathered here. There are still 2 messengers who were sent to the Masox Valley; they are awaited, although nothing has been heard from them since the first day. The communities in the 2 Leagues are heavily divided, although the majority is good, if only the truth could come to light. The response from the 2 Leagues has not yet been received; once it is, a council will be convened, and, as I suspect, they will write back to the 6 places, as they requested in their writing, to be informed of what happens at any time, etc. - Today, one of the council, like one of our citizens, who came from Feldkirch, was at Mr. Batten's sermon, who stepped onto the pulpit in a whole assembly and preached entirely about papal holiness and the regalia. Our city judge says that Mr. Batten has recently taken up sixteen hundred florins. It is certain that three weeks ago he took up twelve hundred florins from those of Zug. Everything is for sale in most places of Rhaetia; therefore, a simple man must be frightened when he is told about the right. Moreover, the assembly of God's house incurs considerable costs. I think the bishopric will go down. It would be better if it were managed better; but now it is a carrion: where the carcass is, there the eagles will gather. It is not yet time to mediate; one must first obtain something better; when it is time, I will inform you. I hope to God it cannot go so badly, it will be a thousand times better than if Mr. Batten had been forcibly installed." Chur, at night, March 13, 1566. </p>
      <p> I hope the subscription (at least the German one) is tolerable, as mentioned before. </p>
