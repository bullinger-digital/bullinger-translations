      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>They should not be called strangers, dearest brother, those whom the same faith and Christian love so closely unite, that the danger, the cross, the hope, and whatever can be told of adversity or prosperity, is the same for both. This reason, excellent Heinrich, compelled me to write, although neither of us has ever seen the other. For who would not be rightly affected with the greatest sorrow by the present so great calamity of the holy church of God, when we see it being deprived of such illustrious heroes, one wickedly killed by the sword of the most impious men, the other, as human affairs are fragile and perishable, having perished by the common fate of us all, who nevertheless cultivated the vineyard of the Lord with constant labor and such tireless vigils!</p>
      <p>But when this so great ruin is considered so light, this blindness, which will undoubtedly experience a worthy retribution, is rightly to be feared by all. But that is far more horrible, that we see the sons of light thus fornicating with those treacherous ones, that they try to raise up all their impiety again, beyond that, which gave such an unworthy profession to the Christian name (in the conditions of peace), namely, to say briefly, that a lie is the truth, darkness is light, Belial is Christ. In which I do not see how we ministers can pass by, without rebuking with unbroken spirit such a denial, and also indicating how it cannot stand with the true worshipers of the Christian name. But what am I doing? When you and your fellow ministers need no admonition at all. But since there is great authority among the Zurichers, I would wish that the matter would mature more quickly. Not that I want you and yours to fight with strength only, but more with prudence.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what has been done among us these days, the present messenger will tell you. I pray daily that the Lord keeps you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother. January 1, 1532.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, dearest brother.</p>
