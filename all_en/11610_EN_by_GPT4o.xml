    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns [a sample from Bullinger's commentary on Matthew?] and praises his exegetical studies. Also sends back the protocol of the conversation with the dean [Ruprecht von Mosham]; the conversation with him in Konstanz was also fruitless. The death of Bullinger's mother [Anna, née Wiederkehr] is no reason for mourning in light of the attained blessedness. Congratulations on the wedding of Rudolf Gwalther [and Regula Zwingli]. Wilhelm von Zell has died. In Überlingen and other places beyond Lake Constance, the plague is raging. The Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] has decisively defeated King Ferdinand's troops and captured all their military equipment; it is said that he is already before Vienna; what this means - together with the plague - is easy to foresee. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am returning the copy of the evangelical work, dearest Bullinger, and we praise your efforts, by which you tirelessly support the common studies of the sacred scriptures. May Christ assist you with His spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>I am also sending back the copy of your discussion with that dean, and you seem to have acted wisely with him. Here, we also treated him kindly according to the nature of our church, but we were forced to leave him to his own judgment.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death of your mother, I do not grieve, to speak freely, but rather congratulate the most honorable matron for finally attaining the happiness she hoped for.</p>
      <p>To your Rudolf Gwalther, a most learned young man, I wish a long and happy marriage.</p>
      <p>Our dear, pious bearded man, young nobleman Wilhelm von Zell, has gone to our Lord; I do not know if you knew him or not. Thus, we all retreat quietly.</p>
      <p>The plague is raging entirely in Überlingen and is also prevailing in some other places beyond the lake.</p>
      <p>The Turk has almost completely destroyed King Ferdinand's army and captured all the artillery, indeed the entire treasure of war instruments, and some think Vienna is certainly besieged. With Pharaoh and the plague reigning, what will happen is easy to predict. May God have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers and the whole household. Ambrosius and all the brothers greet you. May Christ keep you safe.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 15th September 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, uniquely dear brother.</p>
