      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron and lord, Johannes Rudolf Stumpf sends greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most excellent man, dated at the end of October of the previous year 1549, was received on the 6th day before the calends of February of this year 1550. Nothing could have been more pleasant or more eagerly awaited, and that for many reasons. First, because you accepted our humble service so graciously and deemed us worthy of your recommendation to the most renowned man, Dr. Peter Martyr. We embrace with the most grateful heart your report of the peaceful state of the fatherland and your most salutary and truly paternal advice. I acknowledge your faith and your loving care for me in advising me to abstain from the gifts of the king and other princes. However, I would not want you or my dearest parent to be overly concerned about this. Although the opportunity and means to seek such stipends have long been available, the law of the fatherland has always been inscribed in my mind. As for the fact that I have been given the opportunity to live among the king's scholars, I do not consider it a disgrace; for it was not granted for free, but I pay more or less 5 English crowns for each quarter for my sustenance. If this should be doubted, I have a royal mandate to support me; for it is stipulated that no foreigner may be admitted as a member of any college. Moreover, I have as most reliable witnesses Dr. Hooper, Martyr, and Richard Hilles, who know well how much I pay and how much I have spent this year. Therefore, I beg you, by your humanity and faith, if this matter is ever mentioned among us, that you would defend me with your recommendation.</p>
      <p>There is little news at present. The main thing is: there is a rumor that negotiations for peace are currently taking place between the kings of both England and France, and there are those who say that your interests have been considered by the English in this matter, so that the gospel and the church may continue to exist among the Swiss; whether this is true or not, I cannot easily say. You will hear the rest from our Johannes Uldmio, who has taken on this task. Dr. Hooper and Dr. Martyr are well; Francis Triander, whom you greeted in our letters, recently went to Basel. Farewell, honor of the fatherland. Given at Oxford, 1550, 4 days before the calends of February.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rudolf Stumpf, most observant of your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned, most serious and renowned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church at Zürich, his most esteemed patron and lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich in Switzerland.</p>
