      <p>Greetings. Dear godfather, after I have already written, so much has happened that my lords are advising and writing to small and large councils in Zurich. I wanted to add this so that you would know why I mentioned in the previous letter, written on behalf of the treasurer, that nothing would be written this time.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
