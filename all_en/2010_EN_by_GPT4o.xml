      <p>Greetings. In recent days, Mr. Musculus wrote to me in these words: "At present, I wish to know from you whether it would be agreeable to you if you were transferred to Zofingen in the place of Mr. Georg; for he has been transferred to another church, and his position is vacant.</p>
      <p>As soon as possible, let me know your decision; for this matter cannot endure delay," etc. Regarding this request from Musculus, I sincerely wish to hear your opinion; please inform me of it as soon as you can, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter is traveling to Poland and stayed overnight with me; he seems to me to be very learned and very eager for the matters of Christ; receive him with your usual kindness towards travelers. Farewell, incomparable friend. Given at Lenzburg, September 16, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, old friend and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
