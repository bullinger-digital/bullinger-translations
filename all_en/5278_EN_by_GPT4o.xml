      <p>The noble men and counselors of our prince, distinguished in piety and learning, Jacob von Schwerin, prefect of the court of the younger duke, Friedrich von Kanitz, chief chamberlain of the senior duke, and Friedrich von Aulock, have requested, most reverend sir and most esteemed and beloved brother in the Lord, that I inform you about the reprinting of that defense from the year 1545 against Luther's brief and importunate confession. It has been newly published in the workshop of Master Ernst Vogelin, and our people read and circulate it with great joy, so that even the gates of hell may not prevail against this writing, which they dare to boast about with utmost arrogance. This little book would indeed break their foolish jealousy and produce good fruit among many. Many and infinite evils are attributed to Zwingli by them.</p>
      <p>We would therefore wish to have his works, so that those wretched ones might read them (if only they would not reject them in their usual manner) with their emotions set aside. We would also wish for the published German booklets, the Zurich Catechism, and similar ones, which we could give to those who do not know Latin to read. I therefore earnestly ask you to inform me in your next letters whether there are still some copies of that defense available or whether you would be willing to have them reprinted, with the modification of the Swiss phrasing to be more adapted to the common German language, such as certain words like 'kilch' for 'kirch', 'habend', 'tragend', 'thuind' for 'haben', 'tragen', 'thuen', and similar, as it is more expedient for our churches to read, since they are better established... than ours. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given as in the letters.</p>
      <p>Your most loving Johannes Jaske.</p>
      <p>However, we do not want them to be republished at our instigation, lest they rage against us even more. To the most reverend sir, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his esteemed lord and most beloved brother, to his own hands. ZÃ¼rich at the Great Minster.</p>
