    <p xml:id="regest1">Understands that Bullinger could not write to him; he himself has a special reason to do so today. An Italian, whose demeanor reminded him of the Dean of Passau [Ruprecht von Mosham], wished to have a conversation with the pastors; however, an informant let Myconius know that he considered the petitioner to be a spy, as he had demanded the establishment of a new papacy in Lucca in front of Paulus [Lacisius]. Since the stranger kept the pastors waiting too long, the conversation did not take place, but he revealed himself to the few still present as a kindred spirit of the Dean and criticized the disregard of [Catholic customs]; Myconius reports in such detail only to pass the time and wonders why the people of Zurich did not warn him. Warns of an Italian recommended by Calvin, who has distanced himself from the faith in the Holy Spirit in Aarau. It is said that Pope [Paul III] is tearing down the fortifications of Rome, as he fears Emperor [Charles V] and his own people more than [Sultan Suleiman I]; from Savoy, it is heard that the Scots have elected the French crown prince [Henry of Orl√©ans] as king. Inquires about Bullinger's opinion on the renewal of the alliance proposed by [Basel]. The Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] remains steadfast; the suffragan [Johann Nopel?] preaches evangelically, as does a Minorite [Johann Meinertzhagen] supported by the entire convent. Request for a response to the previous letter [No. 1729]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your notary has sufficiently excused you for not being able to write, which I have been expecting for some time. I accept it. I would have remained silent too, if not for a significant occasion that arose today.</p>
      <p>An Italian man came to us, breathing something grand about the kingdom of God, and requested a conversation not so much with me as with the brothers, the pastors, and, to use his own words, to hear and be heard. He began to speak in such a way that it immediately reminded me of the Dean of Passau, whom you know. Indeed, I could not deny anything to someone requesting so honorably; therefore, I set an hour, at which I also called the brothers, so that we could listen to each other among ourselves. In the meantime, I learned that there was someone among us who knew the man; I immediately called him and asked. He replied: "Indeed, I consider him a spy; for I heard him disputing with Paulus Italus in Lucca, who is now in Strasbourg with Peter Martyr, and indeed, in such a way that hardly anyone else was heard speaking against Christ for the papacy with such words. For he was trying to establish the papacy anew, whatever might please Christ." I was exceedingly pleased to have even a little knowledge of the man; for in this way, the meeting would be much easier. The hour had already arrived. We gathered; the man delayed so long that the brothers, affected by boredom, left, except for Marcus, Wolfius, and me; for there was something that kept us together longer. And as we were about to leave, he arrived, greeted us. I immediately said: "Why are you so late? The brothers have left, so you are here in vain." "Come," he said, "we will defer the matter until my return." And with this, he sowed seeds, so that it could be clearly understood that he did not disagree at all with the Dean of Passau regarding the plan. For both want one shepherd and one flock, but for different reasons. For this man is much more blunt; the dean acts cunningly and almost deceitfully. The Italian began to criticize us for neglecting Lent and the appointed fasts and holidays and the intercession of the saints and the canonical hours and other things, so that it could not be unclear to anyone that he wanted to connect Belial and Christ, if he could. We responded briefly, reserving the rest for his return, of course. "But why," you ask, "all this in such detail?" To converse; for I sometimes pass the time in this way. Meanwhile, we wonder how it happened that none of you warned us; for he says he came to us through Zurich and had conversations with some people there. But enough about this.</p>
      <p>There is another Italian who dealt so peacefully and piously with Calvin that he gave him letters of recommendation. After he arrived in Aarau, he revealed himself as not believing anything about the Holy Spirit. If he passed through you, well indeed; if he is coming, as he has planned, beware.</p>
      <p>They say the Pope is demolishing the fortifications around the city of Rome, and when I asked, "Why so?", it was answered: "He fears his own people and the Emperor; he does not fear the Turk." It is also said that the Scots have elected the Dauphin, the son of the King of France, as king. This from Savoy.</p>
      <p>In the recent assembly of our people, these things were discussed: "Why do we not renew our alliance at some point?" And this speech did not displease the envoys of some evangelical cities. What do you, I ask, think about this?</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne remains steadfast. The suffragan preaches the gospel most sincerely in the city, and a Minorite monk, to whom the brothers of the entire convent are said to have promised either to bring the truth to light or to suffer death.</p>
      <p>Respond to the previous letters, if you please. Farewell with your family, Theodor, Pellican, and all good people.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, March 30, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, the best minister of Christ, my venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
