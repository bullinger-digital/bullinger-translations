      <p>S. As I returned home late last night (I had preached in a papist community that still wants to have mass, but I will soon send you good news, God willing), I received a dear letter from your son-in-law, the well-learned Mr. Ludwig Lavater. In response, I write as before, explaining myself and showing you the whole matter further, so that you can speak on my behalf, wherever you wish. The district judge in the Upper League has informed our mayor and council that several honorable men from the Five Cantons and from Fribourg and Solothurn are riding to Rome to the Pope, for reasons I have written to you before; he did not explicitly say that they were sent by the Cantons, but he said: honorable good people from those Cantons. Accordingly, he further announced that he also wanted to ride with them in the name of his League; he further urged that the Two Leagues should also send and select people for this purpose, for which a league day, indeed a meeting, was urgently requested; for the ride is scheduled for the twelfth day. Our council and the Third League, the district governor in Davos, initially did not call a meeting for this reason; however, they were so urged and prepared the second time that they quickly called and held a meeting here in Chur, as I had written before. The Two Leagues were together from Monday until Wednesday afternoon; however, the district judge and his Upper League never came, which surprised the Two Leagues. They parted and returned home, but secretly entrusted our mayor to keep an eye on the district judge and the Upper League; if they ride to Rome, he should quickly send to them and in the name of the Two Leagues request that they stay at home and not ride to the Pope; but if they stay at home themselves, he should not say or write anything to them. Thus, the mayor, your well-known good friend, has informed you in writing. Some communities in the Upper League are quite unwilling about the journey; for it was presented to them by the district judge, whether it should not rightly please them that he rides to Rome, etc. But since no one came to the Two Leagues on the meeting day, as mentioned above, the bailiff of the Upper League sent a letter to our mayor on Thursday morning, stating that the majority of the communities in the Upper League do not want anyone to ride to Rome in their name; and that nothing should be done in this matter without the will and advice of the other Two Leagues. Thus, it has remained and still remains. Furthermore, you should know, not I, but others have considered this a ridiculous matter; they think that king and emperor hold and regard them so highly, etc. I have quickly sent a letter to the Upper League to the preachers; for I did not dare to the communities. What my opinion and writing were, you have here this enclosed copy. In addition, I have preached vehemently against the Pope, his members, and his friendship on the meeting day, and then the Commander also, even more vehemently and as bravely as I have told him, as he has never done in five years; he has conducted himself very well. The copy will be sent back to me in eight days. I hear nothing new; I ask you in the name of all Christians, you should take care of your health and spare yourself, preach less and study, so that Christianity may have you for a long time, a noble jewel and a beautiful light. O God, have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, on the 7th day of January 1556. Your willing son in Christ, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>Commander and Pontasella send greetings to your humanity and Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord, to be honored by him and all his good ones. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Grace from God and courage in the Lord Jesus. Beloved brothers in the Lord. As you have appointed me as your minister and I should fulfill the office, I inform you that, as I fear, it will ultimately not last against our faith, so that you may consider in time what should be done about the matter. I understand that the old Five Cantons in our praiseworthy Confederation and yours, yes, also our dear Upper League, are willing and preparing to go to Rome to the Pope for three articles: firstly, to wish him well for the office, that he has become Pope; secondly, that they bring our Leagues three hundred guilders or ducats, which he, the Pope, still owes us; thirdly, that they help to speak and act, if it may be, that an eternal peace is made and accepted by the imperial and royal majesty in France.</p>
      <p>Now, dearest brothers, what need do we have to run to Rome in distant foreign lands to wish the Pope well for the office? He has been set as Pope for almost a year, has enough happiness now and remains Pope without us. None of our ancestors and parents have ever gone to Rome to wish the new Pope well. Therefore, this should now be a new matter and entirely a new, devout intention, even if we are willing to believe that nothing else is behind it. For although no one should trust your and our faithful League, likewise our dear allies and league members of the Five Cantons, that they intend and do nothing else than what is proper and right for them, it is not proper for your communities and churches, according to divine justice, to speak, which we should preach and promote, that they, informed by God's word, confess with heart and mouth that the Pope is the true Antichrist, yes, such communities should not, against their faith and their confession, unforced and uncoerced, run to Rome themselves to the Pope, the destructive Antichrist, greet him, fall at his feet, kiss his shoes, and almost worship and honor him as their God.</p>
      <p>Consider in your hearts whether this is not denying the recognized truth. For if the Pope is the Antichrist, why do you kneel before him? Although we cannot blame those who have not accepted our gospel and think nothing else than that the Pope is a vicar of Christ.</p>
      <p>We let them go in their faith and do not speak of them now, but we speak of your communities, who boast of the holy gospel against the Pope and his mass. Yes, we tell you: do you not know that he is cursed who preaches another gospel than Christ and his apostles have preached? Do you not know what the holy John has written to us: "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not greet him; for whoever greets him shares in his evil deeds?" How can you then want to go to the Pope and greet him, yes, even worship him? Is this not idolatry, yes, among those who have known and cried out against the Pope as devilish? We do not speak of those who have not recognized or believed this, for they have not been judged, but God has set them aside. And therefore, dear brothers, do what is proper for you in your office; be faithful watchmen and warn the simple ones, whom you should be shepherds of, that they do not do what is against their faith, to their detriment, a sorrow to their fellow believers." Do not err," says the apostle, "God is not mocked."</p>
      <p>We do not particularly concern ourselves with the other two articles, but only with the one that concerns our faith and office; although there are people who are also involved in the matters, who say that the Pope owes us nothing, he has paid us and has a receipt from us. Regarding the third article, it seems to me that we hold too much of ourselves; we are not so esteemed that king and emperor would desist from their undertakings for our sake.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it would be good if they were united and left the world in peace and we all better and did not deserve such punishment with our sins. Take my warning and admonition, which I do to you in office, in the best way and do courageously what is proper for your office, with warning and defense.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, on the 27th day of December in the year 1555. Your willing minister, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned proclaimers of God's word against the Pope and the mass in Thusis, etc., his kind lords and brothers.</p>
