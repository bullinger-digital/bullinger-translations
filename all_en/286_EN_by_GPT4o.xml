      <p>How much I owe you, most excellent Bullinger, who have not only visited me with your most courteous letters, but also deigned to gift me with your learned and pious writings! I do not seem to be able to express in words how much pleasure your love towards me has brought. I would have most gladly greeted you with my letters long ago; but such great tragedies have arisen among us this year, so utterly unheard of, that I could not bring myself to write, indeed, I did not even wish to live at all. I do not doubt that you have heard everything. Now, by the admirable goodness of God, everything seems to be settled. The religion of Christ, which seemed to be wavering, stands firm, and we attribute this to the providence of God alone. However, we fear that Flanders may send some storm our way. We have a king who is steadfast beyond his years, learned and pious. If ever there was a Josiah since the time of the first, this is undoubtedly he; may you also, as a common father, deign to implore in public prayers that he be preserved safe for us. Believe me, my Bullinger, no holier nature has existed in our time; he alone, with incredible piety, most holy morals, prudence plainly of an old man, and constancy utterly unheard of at this age, seems to uphold the gospel. Such a miracle of God should not be unknown to the pious. But to add even more to the praises of God, know that Latimer, concerning the truth of the Eucharist, has come over to our opinion along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other bishops, who previously seemed to be Lutherans. Let us implore the Lord with common prayers, that He may deign to continue the work so beautifully begun, and may He keep you and yours safe for a long time! You will bid farewell to D. Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalter, dearest brothers, very much. Farewell.</p>
      <p>London, 4th day before the Kalends of October.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bartholomew Traheron.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
