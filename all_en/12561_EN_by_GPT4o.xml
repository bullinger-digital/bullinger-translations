    <p xml:id="regest1">Good things are always being written about the Swiss [mercenaries] serving in the [Schmalkaldic army]. Therefore, Konrad Zwick suggests maintaining good conduct by having the Swiss address a letter to the mercenaries with the content outlined in the [not preserved] attachment. This draft can be modified as desired but should not be too long. Bullinger is only being involved because he can formulate the letter more skillfully and in accordance with the language and customs of the land.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Four copies of this letter should be sent: to Ravensburg, Kempten, Memmingen, and to the troops under Sebastian Schertlin, with the heading proposed here.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The letters should be enclosed with a letter addressed to the council and mayors of Ravensburg [Bartholomäus Hensler], Memmingen [Balthasar Funk], and Kempten [Caspar Zeller]. The councils and mayors are to be asked to inquire with the captains about the content of the letter to the Swiss [mercenaries] and then to allow the communication of the letter to the latter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- All letters should be sent to Ravensburg with a request for forwarding to the respective recipients in the other three locations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- If no messenger is available to Ravensburg, the letters should be sent to Blarer, who will ensure their forwarding. [The drafting of these letters] will certainly be advantageous.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger will learn current news from the letter of the Konstanz council to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Due to the Danish naval blockade, no provisions are reaching the Netherlands. This is causing great inflation, especially in grain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Jakob] Herbrot from Augsburg has written. His servant [...] told Blarer that he was able to sell many valuable items at the wedding of [King] Ferdinand's daughter [Anna or Maria of Austria]. The king and queen [Anna of Bohemia and Hungary] alone bought goods worth 12,000 guilders from him, without knowing that the goods came from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Just now, the young [... Herrliberger] delivers Bullinger's letter [not received]. In haste, the following:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [Konrad Zwick] spoke enthusiastically about Bullinger [after his return from Zurich] and reported on his many works. He would have liked to stay with him longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Blarer has received Bullinger's letter from July 10 [No. 2493]. He informed the Zurich messenger [Melchior Vögeli] of it, but only verbally, because the letter arrived just as he was about to entrust his letter for Bullinger [No. 2507] to the messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Blarer has also forwarded Bullinger's letter to [Johannes] Haller [No. 2494].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- The [secret alphabet was correctly used by Bullinger in his letter entrusted to the young Herrliberger].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] confiscated a package of letters [addressed to merchants in Ulm and Augsburg]. Since the letters are partly encrypted, not everything could be understood, but it was learned about the dissatisfaction in the Netherlands [with Emperor Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [The Schmalkaldic League] hopes to hold the pass [Ehrenberg]. Blarer agrees with Bullinger: The Schmalkaldic League is too slow and wastes far too much money. Some monasteries have been taken. From the letter [of the Konstanz council] to the Zurich council, Bullinger will learn more, namely about the events in Günzburg (a town belonging to the Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg]) and in Donauwörth, about the fortification measures of the Bishop of Würzburg [Melchior Zobel], about the queen's and several bishops' prostration before the emperor [Charles V.] with the request not to start a war, and about the friendly reception of the queen by the emperor, while he asked the bishops why they had always urged him to war before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Bullinger should pray for God's assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- [P.S.:] Blarer has [just] received Bullinger's letter [not received] and the letter from the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse to the Swiss]. He has shared the relevant information with [Konrad Zwick] and his brother [Thomas], who will pass it on without mentioning [Bullinger's] name.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Blarer likes the poem [by Sebastian Lepusculus]. He will send it to [Georg] Frölich, who will probably share it with the Landgrave. May God grant him victory!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- Bullinger does not need to send the letter from Milan. He is believed, and they thank him for his efforts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- The response to the Landgrave is good. May God help bring unity and peace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- Blarer forgot to mention the heading of the letter to the Swiss mercenaries under Schertlin above and does so here.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">- [Attachment:] Those from Frankfurt [a.M.] have confiscated several thousand arquebuses, armor for 1,000 men, and several hundred barrels of gunpowder. All of this was intended for the emperor.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and highly trusted brother. Since your dear Confederates are always being written about favorably by those among whom they are stationed, my dear cousin Konrad Zwick had a good idea that might serve to maintain and increase their honorable conduct. It would be beneficial if a letter were addressed to them in the name of some Confederates, whose names need not be printed, with a draft of the content as you will receive shortly. If you find this agreeable, you may then modify and improve it as you see fit, or expand it further, but it should not become too long. We would not have troubled you with this, etc., but you can compose the letter much better and more in line with the customs of the land than we can, and also draft it better, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There must be four copies: one to Ravensburg, one to Kempten, one to Memmingen, and one to the captains and Swiss mercenaries under the command of Captain Sebastian Schertlin, who are stationed or still stationed there. The heading might read: To the captains and Swiss mercenaries stationed at Ravensburg, our loyal, dear Confederates, etc. Likewise to the other three places. You will know how to compose it better.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Afterwards, a letter or cover must be made for each letter to each location's authorities, such as the mayor and council of Ravensburg, Memmingen, and also Kempten, etc. And in each cover, it should briefly state: Prudent, honorable, etc., it is our friendly request that you forward the enclosed letter to the Swiss captains stationed with you and have it read to them, in good hope that when you hear the content of the letter from the captains, you will then be unburdened, and also have it read to the mercenaries, etc. The signature of these four letters must also now stand as in the other letter to the mercenaries, namely: Some benevolent Confederates, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Once these letters are dispatched to the mentioned three places, you must enclose all the letters together in one letter. This must be addressed to those in Ravensburg, also in the same manner as the others, and they should be requested to forward the other three letters to their respective locations, and thus send the letter to Ravensburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If you do not have the opportunity to do this, then send it to me. We will ensure it is delivered by our own messenger to Ravensburg, so that it is handed over to the mayor and then proceeds further. We believe it will be useful and good, and much benefit will come from it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our lords are writing to yours everything that is new. Therefore, there is no need to accomplish a task with double effort. I know well that nothing is withheld from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Denmark has closed the sea, so that no provisions or anything else can reach the Netherlands. Therefore, great inflation has broken out, which is unbearable, so that what used to cost 12/14 guilders now costs 67 guilders.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The mayor Herrbrot from Augsburg writes to me, his servant was with me on Sunday. And he told me how he was now (understood, the servant) at the wedding of Ferdinand's daughter, etc., with some small items. The king and queen alone bought goods worth twelve thousand guilders from him. And if he had had the right small items, he would have wanted to redeem a hundred thousand guilders. But it was not known that the small items belonged to Herrbrot. They might have been left behind otherwise. O execrable luxury of the most impious princes, who spend so much gold on stones!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Now at 2 o'clock, the boy brings me your other letter, to which I respond in haste:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>First, my dear cousin speaks all honorably of you, mentioning your many works. You are no less dear to him. He would have liked to have stayed with you longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Know that your letter dated July 10 has reached me. I showed it to your messenger recently, he should tell you verbally, as it only reached me after I had entrusted my letter to you to the messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I have also already forwarded Haller's letter to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The secret alphabet is good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Duke Ulrich has intercepted a post. Not everything could be understood because some hidden signs and characters were in it. However, it was understood enough to know that there is great dissatisfaction in the Netherlands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>The pass is well occupied and sufficiently secured, as they hope to hold it, as they write. Otherwise, as you write: They are far too slow, and many sensible people complain about it. But we cannot do anything about it. It pains the heart to bear such excessive costs and achieve nothing! Our people are taking the monasteries here and there, as it happened in Günzburg in the bishop's place in Augsburg, and what was dealt with in Donauwörth, and how the bishop of Würzburg has demolished the towers and prepared for defense, and how the queen with all her children, along with some bishops, fell at the emperor's feet and begged him to stop the war preparations, etc., how the emperor received the queen well, but spoke somewhat sternly with the bishops and said they had urged him for so long about such matters, why they are now asking for it, etc. All this and more will be written to your lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Oh, pray to God faithfully for us and ours. It is necessary, ut omnia melius cadant quam vel pro nostris meritis vel ratione nostrorum consiliorum. July 27, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Dear lord and brother, your letter along with the Landgrave's letter has reached me well. I have shown it to my dear brother and cousin. They will pass it on without mentioning the secretary.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>The poems please us very much! I will forward them to Leto. He will certainly not withhold them from the Landgrave. May God give him heart and courage with much victory.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>We do not need the letter from Milan. We believe you for this and much more. We thank you for your diligent loyalty and all possible efforts. We know well that you mean everything well and most faithfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>We are very pleased with your response to the Landgrave. May God will that one day we may come to unity of spirit and maintain it in the bond of peace. Amen, amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>The heading for the Swiss mercenaries under Captain Schertlin should approximately read: To the Swiss mercenaries stationed under Herr Sebastian Schärtlin von Burtenbach at Burtenbach (a knight) or still stationed. I forgot to mention this above.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Those from Frankfurt have laid down several thousand arquebuses, also armor for a thousand men, and several hundred barrels of gunpowder for the emperor.</p>
