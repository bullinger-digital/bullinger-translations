A letter from Innsbruck and other reports or rumors speak of the threat of war; in Basel, the peasants are securing their harvest. There is great anger against monks and abbots, etc. Myconius fears great evil and hopes for God's help.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am somewhat glad that your messengers report nothing of what we warned you about. I say "somewhat" because the current situation has brought only a little peace to my heart. However, no one will remove the distrust I have long held towards the Five Cantons until they agree with us in God. Therefore, I am firm in my belief that what we sent is true: that their plans are in place and nothing is lacking except the opportunity to carry them out successfully. We must therefore ensure that we are prepared against such people whenever they finally erupt, so that they do not catch us unprepared as they did in the past. There is nothing certain from the letters from Innsbruck. Why they wrote as they did, if they are trifles, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Everything around us is full of arms and various rumors. The neighboring peasants are beginning to rent cellars and granaries from us, where they can store their wine and grain if enemies attack.</p>
      <p>There are great threats against monks, abbots, and others of this kind. The nobles see how impiously the goods of their ancestors are being consumed and are filled with disgust. I foresee great and many calamities. He who can avert them lives: May He grant that we may live with Him.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with your family and Utinger. Basel, April 10, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
