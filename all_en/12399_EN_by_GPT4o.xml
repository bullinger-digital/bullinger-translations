    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger did not need to apologize for not having received his letter. Vadian had not felt such joy in a long time as when composing his [last] letter [No. 2342]. He did not write to present his [view] as the best, but to present it to [Bullinger and Johannes Stumpf] (whose opinion is decisive for him). - He is pleased to hear from [Bullinger] that he and [Stumpf] do not intend to speak favorably about the monks. True piety and impartial historiography demand this. It also corresponds to the Zurich [attitude] and should not be criticized by anyone, especially since the [reader] must not be misled. The people of Zurich have done well to expel the hypocritical [brethren] from the city and the countryside, as they cause problems and are quite the opposite of the Sileni, [who carry God within them] and about whom [the Athenian statesman] Alcibiades [once reported]. [The monks] are only outwardly religious, and the people must be enlightened about this. However, Vadian is not in favor of bizarre attacks; pleasantly composed representations, which are sometimes praiseful, sometimes ironic, are much more effective. Stumpf will certainly be up to this [writing] task. - Furthermore, it is to be hoped that the [Zurich book censors will wisely review his contributions planned for the "Swiss Chronicle"] and not simply [cut from his text] anything that might offend someone. - Moreover, Vadian is well aware of how reliable and precise [Christoph Froschauer's] proofreader Peter [Schmid] works; but he also knows how conscientious [also] the authors themselves usually are when printing their writings!</p>

      <p>Greetings. Why do you make an apology for us from our own words and jokes? I wrote to you, my foremost lord and friend, with the greatest delight of my mind, and for a long time, there was no leisure more pleasant to me than this very act, which I devoted to writing those letters for no other reason than to make you more certain of my mind's intent. For I think of nothing less than to defend my actions, words, or writings as the best before those whose judgment is my touchstone, to whose understanding I submit all my matters, although it was most pleasing to me that you indicate there is nothing to fear, nor that you are about to grant excessive favor or dignity to the monks. For this is demanded not only by the zeal of piety but also by the candor of history, that we do not exalt those erring in error, but paint them with worthy colors, nor will this be new among you nor odious to anyone's judgment to praise them with sparing or no words, those whose feigned hypocrisy you have thoroughly removed from the city and countryside and do not deem worthy to cause trouble for others in the future, who are nothing more than inverted Sileni of Alcibiades, who, though outwardly religious, are inwardly more than sluggish and filthy, whom it is indeed better to present to the people whenever a convenient opportunity is offered, so that even with a dull nose, they can smell who and what they are. I do not approve of nor admit scurrilous attacks; on the contrary, I praise a clever and sarcasm-laden portrayal, which is often used even in the guise of praise and has no small amount of charm, even if it drives the sting a little deeper. We trust that our Stumpf will perform this accurately and promise ourselves a higher judgment from those our reviewers than to decide to introduce something suddenly, which no one can easily drag into calumny. And indeed, the faith and diligence of Peter the corrector have been observed; but I have also experienced with what faith those who are the authors of the publications of their labors are accustomed to strive in publishing.</p>
