      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord. I comply with your command, most esteemed sir and godfather, to always inform you about the progress of our journey.</p>
      <p>We arrived in Straßburg on the 29th day of March, all safe and sound, by the benefit and grace of God: I think we will stay here until the third day of April, so that we may join good and honest companions who are already setting out for the fair. Our journey is also somewhat hindered by the irritability of our little daughter Rahel: her teeth are growing, and the air's influence doubles the discomforts of her emerging illness. What is being said about Hedio, I believe is not true. On the 30th of March, I attended his lecture, which was from the tenth chapter to the Romans. He spoke quite candidly about the dignity of the word of God and openly said many things, and he admonished his listeners to be very careful of the enticements of the Interdenet. I think whatever was committed was done out of excessive fear and dread, not hatred. He is not lacking in piety, but he is excessively fearful of the Emperor. On the same day, I attended the evening sermon: among other things preached (which I had heard with difficulty), he foolishly inveighed with great anger against the Swermeros.</p>
      <p>May the Lord forgive him and give him a better mind. Paulus Fagius left before our arrival. I believe Bucer will leave tonight, but I do not yet know where. He has been called to England, Poland, and Saxony. He hosted me yesterday at a banquet, where we found Johannes Sturm, Sapidus, and Christopher Mont. They were very pleased with the concord of the Swiss, which I pray the Lord will always keep firm and steadfast.</p>
      <p>My wife, Rahel, Joanna, and I commend your charity, the well-being of your entire family, and the health of all the most pious ministers of your church to God Almighty in our prayers, whom we all truly and sincerely greet. Farewell, most excellent man and always most esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>Straßburg, the last day of March.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient, John Hooper.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
