    <p xml:id="regest1">Thom Camph asks the [Zurichers] for understanding if he does not write during his journey. However, they should know that he is forever grateful to them. - The present letter serves to introduce and recommend to the Zurichers the brothers [Gerhard Westerburg and Johannes Mączyński] who are traveling to [Zurich] and have become dear to him. - Westerburg, Doctor of Law, is a Cologne native who was attacked by the scholars of Cologne 20 years ago for [his opposition] to purgatory and had to leave Cologne. He has been living as an exile in Friesland for twelve years and has always defended the Zurichers' view of the Lord's Supper. He now comes to consult with the Zurichers and to be encouraged by them. He will tell pleasing things about the Church of Friesland. Despite the spatial distance, it is close to the Church of Zurich. - The young noble Pole Mączyński has given up court life to devote himself to study, mainly of the Holy Scriptures. He first went to Wittenberg, then to Strasbourg (where he has been for a year now) and traveled to Paris after Easter [1545]. Since he has heard much good about the Zurichers, including in Paris, he now goes to Zurich out of love for the truth and because he wants to learn Hebrew, although one of the Strasbourg pastors [Johannes Marbach?] has admonished him not to read the Zurichers' view of the Lord's Supper [expressed in the "True Confession"]. He will certainly become a faithful defender [of the Zurichers], unless he allows himself (as is true of all Wittenbergers) to be too intimidated by the reputation that people enjoy. Therefore, the Zurichers should take special care of him and, if necessary, admonish Pellikan to take him [in], especially since he comes to Zurich to learn Hebrew. Even Bucer has encouraged him [to do so] so far. If Luther did not exist, or if he were not so feared, Bucer would certainly hold a different opinion about the Zurichers. - Bucer has summoned thom Camph to him. He wanted to know if it was true that he was hated by the Zurichers (whose church he allegedly always defends), as he learned from a letter received the previous evening and written by friends [...]. Thom Camph explained to him that the Zurichers did not hate him, but mistrusted him and blamed him for his peace negotiations, which had only worsened the situation. Bucer tried to justify himself; thom Camph, however, countered him. Finally, Bucer admonished thom Camph not to discuss this matter and to submit to the word of God. - Thom Camph encloses the letters from [Georg Cassander] and Johannes a Lasco [No. 2194 and 2176]. He already received a Lasco's letter in Basel. [Westerburg] will be able to report more about [Cassander and a Lasco]. - Thom Camph thanks Bullinger for the letters of recommendation issued to him and [Samuel Pellikan], which opened doors for them everywhere. The [book desired by Bullinger] he has not yet been able to find. He will probably receive it in Mainz. - Many brothers send greetings and are grateful for the [“True Confession”], while others naturally hate the Zurichers for it. Greetings to all brothers and teachers in Zurich. Matthias Zell and his wife [Katharina Schütz], who are often forced to defend the Zurichers, also send greetings. - [Johannes] Marbach, who was formerly in Isny, was solemnly ordained as pastor in the Church of St. Nicholas today [Sunday].</p>

      <p>Although it is my duty, most learned Bullinger, to express my gratitude to you and the other teachers and brothers for your kindness and the services rendered to me through this letter, I am currently hindered by the inconvenience of travel and lack of time, which prevents me from doing so properly. Therefore, I ask for your forgiveness, especially since you know my benevolent disposition towards you and your church. I can only say this: The memory of your kindnesses towards me will be eternal, and nothing could ever be more pleasing to me than to be able to demonstrate my feelings towards you and your church with clear evidence and to repay you in equal or even greater measure. Be assured of this in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The main reason I am writing to you now, dearest brother, is that I could not allow these two excellent men and dearest brothers in Christ to travel to you without my recommendation. Not because I doubt your hospitality towards guests or that they could not commend themselves to you through their own virtues and learning, but to inform you of their qualities and the reasons for their journey to you, so that you may judge how worthy they are of your hospitality and care, and to express my affection for them.</p>
      <p>The elder is named Gerhard Westenborch, a Doctor of Law, originally from Cologne. He is the one who had a great dispute with our masters in Cologne about purgatory twenty years ago, and as a result, was expelled from the city and eventually stripped of all his possessions. For the past twelve years, he has found a place of exile in my homeland and has always been a staunch defender of the Gospel and your more sincere view of the sacrament, which has made him disliked by many. Driven by love for you, he comes to confer with you and receive mutual consolation, especially now when he sees those churches wavering and falling away from the truth once vigorously embraced and defended. Meanwhile, he will tell you about our church in Friesland, which will bring you joy and for which you should thank the Lord, as it connects churches that are far apart. Therefore, receive him with your customary kindness and send him back to us not without benefit. He loves and honors you in the Lord as dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>The other is a Pole, noble by birth and virtues, as well as piety. He was indeed driven by this to leave court life and devote himself to studies, especially of the Holy Scriptures. For this reason, he first went to Wittenberg, then to Strasbourg, where he has been for a year, and after Easter, he went to Paris. Having heard much about your church, both from my account and others, as well as in Paris, he now comes to you out of love for the truth and to learn Hebrew. He has not been deterred from his purpose, even though one of the Strasbourg preachers warned him not to read your view of the sacrament. Therefore, receive him with your usual candor and support him in the Lord. I have no doubt that, once he knows the truth from you, he will become its most faithful defender. I believe there is nothing, as is the case with all Wittenbergers, that holds him back except excessive reverence for human authority. Therefore, treat him as a weak brother in this matter, who desires to be taught better. He is certainly very dear to me for his candor and piety. Whatever you do for him, do not doubt that you are doing it for me, and if Pellikan refuses to receive him, be his advisor and encourager not to reject him, for learning Hebrew from Pellikan is also a major reason for his coming to you.</p>
      <p>Until now, he has been a companion of Bucer in Strasbourg, who did not dissuade him from going to you. I truly believe that if Luther did not exist or if he were not so feared, Bucer would think and speak differently.</p>
      <p>To say a few words about Bucer: He sent a messenger to call me to him. When I came, the main point of his speech was that he heard he was being pursued with great hatred by the Zurichers and that his name was being maligned by you in various ways. He said he had learned this from letters from friends the day before, although he defended the Zurichers and their church wherever he could. He wanted to know from me what I knew about this matter. I replied frankly that I knew nothing of any hatred against him, but it was true that he was very suspect to the Zurichers, so they did not trust him, and they openly said that if Bucer had not attempted this poorly constructed concord, the matter would have been better. He then began to excuse himself; I, however, raised objections as they occurred to me. Finally, he said he would leave the matter to God and pray for you, and that it would be best if you did the same for him. He also advised me not to dispute about this matter but to submit to the word of the Lord and strive for peace as much as possible, as there were enough contentions. And so he left me.</p>
      <p>I write no news because there is nothing true and good. However, I am sending letters from your Gerhard and Lord a Lasco, which I received in Basel, but I did not have a safe way to send them to you until now, so I am sending them now. If you wish to know more about both, this doctor will tell you everything, as he knows both very well.</p>
      <p>It would be too long to write about how the journey went, except that I do not want to hide from you that we were received with great kindness everywhere, and I thank you for your recommendation, which I acknowledge I am not at all worthy of. I am inquiring about the book everywhere, but I cannot find it anywhere; however, I think I can get it in Mainz. As soon as I receive it, I will send it.</p>
      <p>Many brothers in the Lord send you greetings, who love you very much for the confession published, although others hate you for it. Greet all the brothers and teachers who know me in my name. May the Lord Jesus be with you all. Amen. Please always remember me in your prayers to the Lord. I will do the same in return. Matthew Zell and his wife greet you, who are often forced to defend you. Farewell, most learned man, in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, the day before my departure, July 12, 1545. Gerhard zum Camph, from Emden, your brother and friend from the heart.</p>
      <p>On this day, with great ceremonies, Mr. Marbach, who was in Isny, was ordained as pastor in Strasbourg by Bucer at St. Nicholas. Consider this impromptu writing favorably.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his dearest brother in the Lord and always to be respected friend.</p>
