      <p>Greetings. On the very day that this my treatise was published, the book by Brenz on the personal union, etc., was delivered to me. If it had been offered earlier, my book could have been more comprehensive; but it seems that he does not use any other arguments in this new work than he used before in his writings. He accumulates testimonies from Luther; however, the men of God, Zwingli and Oecolampadius, have long since responded to these wisely and piously. These could also be selected and printed, etc.; yet I do not regret the brevity I followed in my treatise; for I see that readers, affected by a certain weariness, discard rather than read lengthy disputations. Therefore, I have tried to be brief and, as much as the Lord allowed, clear in brevity. I strive to unravel the intricate cause and present dense arguments rather than play with a multitude of words and embellishments, saying little with many words, but I also refer everything to piety and abstain from sneers, insults, and contentions. But let the judgment be with those who are seated.</p>
      <p>These things, which I hope will suffice for pious minds in this cause, can be more fully explained if an antagonist is found, and then a response can be made to the arguments or sophisms that have not yet been examined here. I regret that Brenz, by bringing in Bonaventura, concedes to Eutyches, which is as if you were to say Benaventura. This we owe to the zeal of contention, and because, with transubstantiation refuted, the devil again wishes to introduce insubstantiation or subsubstantiation. May the Lord have mercy on us! Here I seek your judgment, and indeed freely, so that you may tell me candidly what you think of this my treatise.</p>
      <p>To my beloved, from your most loving.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 14, 1561.</p>
      <p>May Master Matthias be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Let it not be troublesome to you that I overwhelm you with so many letters and books. To the most illustrious man, Master Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>With the explanation In the house of my father, March 14, 1561.</p>
