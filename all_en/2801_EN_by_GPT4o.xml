      <p>Greetings. Our revered Mr. Franciscus Lyßmanninus showed us your letter, dear Alexander, in which you included several questions, asking that the judgments of the churches be gathered on them. Although Mr. Lyßmanninus himself can better explain what the ministers of our churches think about them, and our writings are available, which discuss them more extensively, I did not want to deny my assistance in this matter to Mr. Lysmanninus, my dearest brother, and to you, my most esteemed lord. Meanwhile, kindly accept from me what I pour into a friend's lap amidst my affairs more than I recite and count in the ear, of a man otherwise learned and experienced in these matters.</p>
      <p>First, you ask whether Christ suffered in both of his natures, as it seems to some. I truly do not believe that my Mr. Musculus or Mr. Andreas Hyperius, my singular friends, ever thought or wrote this, unless perhaps they proposed it in some ecclesiastical manner of speaking, about which more shortly.</p>
      <p>It is established from the evangelical, prophetic, and apostolic writings that our Lord Christ has two natures, divine and human, and these are so connected or united in one person that, just as the natures are not to be divided into two persons, so conversely they are not to be mixed or confused, so that a certain third thing is produced and imagined from both, which is neither fully divine nor human, but a mixture or medium of God and man. For our Lord Jesus Christ is true God, and the same is true man, and each of these natures retains its own property safe, unharmed, and unmixed, so that the same Christ is read as crucified, suffered, and died, but according to that nature which could suffer and die in him, while he remained immortal and impassible according to that nature which is impassible and inconvertible in him. This indeed the blessed apostle Peter signifies most openly: "Christ himself bore our sins," he says, "in his body on the tree, that we might die to sins and live to righteousness." Again, the same apostle: "Christ once suffered for sins," he says, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit." And again, he says: "Since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind." The apostle Paul also taught us to think no differently about this very doctrine, who said: "Since the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared in the same, that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death" and so on. The faithful apostles of Christ did not deviate a hair's breadth from the doctrine of the Lord; for he himself said in the gospel: "I lay down my life for the sheep and will give it as a ransom for many," also: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."</p>
      <p>Since these things are certain and can be supported by infinite testimonies of Scripture, the apostle of Christ Paul nevertheless says that the Lord of glory was crucified, not because he felt that the glorious deity of the Son suffered in humanity, but because he who was crucified and felt pains in the assumed human nature was not a mere man, but at the same time true God. The ancient doctors and ministers of the church explained this kind of expression, which we read elsewhere, that God redeemed us with his own blood, through the communication of idioms, by which indeed one nature is attributed to the other because of the union, what is proper to the other.</p>
      <p>All the symbols of the ancient church have taught us to confess in the manner we have now briefly explained, nor did the ancient interpreters of the Scriptures and pastors of the churches of God judge otherwise, whose testimonies we recite, therefore, to show the consensus of antiquity and that we have invented nothing from ourselves. Nor indeed can they be despised or rejected, since they are illustrated and confirmed by the testimonies of Scripture.</p>
      <p>The most ancient writer Tertullian, whom the holy martyr of Christ Cyprian, as the blessed Jerome commemorates, called his teacher and master, disputing against the heretic Praxeas: "So safe," he says, "is the property of each substance, that the spirit performed its own works in him, that is, virtues and works and signs, and the flesh performed its own passions, being hungry under the devil, thirsty under the Samaritan woman, weeping for Lazarus, anxious unto death, and finally died. If there were a third thing confused from both, so that the distinct documents of each substance were not so clearly evident, but both the spirit would have performed carnal things and the flesh spiritual things by translation, so that neither carnal nor spiritual things, but by the confusion of some third thing, indeed either the word would have been dead or the flesh would not have been dead if the word had been converted into flesh; or the flesh would have been immortal or the word mortal. But because both substances were acting distinctly in their own state, therefore their works and outcomes meet them, etc. You will read other most elegant things of this kind about this matter by consequence there towards the end of the book.</p>
      <p>The most ancient bishop of Iconium Amphilochius, in the presence of St. Gelasius, about both natures in Christ: "Do not," he says, "apply the passions of the flesh to the impassible word. For I am God and man, heretic, God, as the miracles profess, man as the passions testify; because therefore I am God and man, say, who suffered? If God suffered, you have spoken blasphemy; but if the flesh suffered, then you do not apply fear to the passion, to whom do you also apply fear? For when one suffers, the other does not fear, and when the man is crucified, God is not disturbed?</p>
      <p>Blessed Athanasius to Epictetus, bishop of the Corinthians: "The Lord did his own things, which were proper to the body as his own." The incorporeal word finally, when the body was struck by a minister, as he himself said, suffering: "Why do you strike me?" Thus naturally impassible he said: "I gave my back to the smiters and my face I did not turn away from shame and spitting." For what the humanity of the word suffered, the word dwelling in it referred to itself, so that we might be partakers of the deity of the word. And it was admirable, because he was suffering and not suffering, because by nature God remaining the word is impassible and he indeed was incorporeal in a passible body, but he had in himself the word impassible destroying the infirmities of the body itself" and so on.</p>
      <p>Saint Jerome in the exposition of his faith to Damasus: "The Son of God," he says, "suffered not fictitiously, but truly all that the Scripture testifies, that is, hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, death, and other such things according to that which could suffer, that is, not according to that substance which he assumed, but according to that which was assumed. For the Son of God according to his deity is impassible as the Father. And although the person of the Son, that is, the word of God, assumed a passible man, yet by his indwelling according to his substance the deity of the word suffered nothing, so that the whole Trinity, which must be confessed as impassible. Therefore the Son of God died according to the Scriptures according to that which could die" etc.</p>
      <p>The most faithful doctor of the church, blessed Augustine, in the book on the struggle of Christ, left it written in these words: "Nor should we listen to those who say: If Christ suffered, he is mutable, and if he is mutable, he is a creature, because the substance of God cannot be changed. With whom we also say that the substance of God cannot be changed and that a creature is mutable. But it is one thing to be a creature and another to assume a creature. Therefore the only-begotten Son of God, who is the power and wisdom of God and the word by which all things were made, because he cannot be changed at all, assumed the human creature, which he deigned to raise when fallen and renew when old, nor was he himself changed for the worse in it by suffering, but rather he changed it for the better by resurrection. Nor therefore is the word of the Father, that is, the only Son of God, through whom all things were made, to be denied to have been born and to have suffered for us. And we also say that the martyrs suffered and died for the kingdom of heaven, yet in that suffering and death their souls were not killed. Just as therefore we say that the martyrs suffered and died in the bodies they bore, without the killing and death of their souls, so we say that the Son of God suffered and died in the man he bore, without any change or death of the divinity.</p>
      <p>Leo, bishop of Rome, to Flavian, bishop of Constantinople: "As God," he says, "is not changed by compassion, so man is not consumed by dignity. For each form acted with the communion of the other, what is proper, namely the word operating what is of the word, and what is of the flesh, the flesh executing. One of these shines with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries. And as the word did not depart from the equality of the paternal glory, so the flesh did not leave the nature of our kind; for he is one and the same, which must often be said, truly the Son of God and truly the Son of man." And soon: It is not of the same nature to say: "I and the Father are one" and to say: "The Father is greater than I;" for although in the Lord Jesus Christ there is one person of God and man, yet it is one thing from which there is reproach, another from which there is common glory. For from our humanity he is less than the Father, from the Father he is equal with the Father in divinity. Because of this unity of person in both natures to be understood, and the Son of man is read to have descended from heaven, when the Son of God assumed flesh from that virgin from whom he was born. And again the Son of God is said to have been crucified and buried, when these things were not in the divinity itself, by which he is the only-begotten, coeternal and consubstantial with the Father, but in the infirmity of human nature he suffered. Whence we all also confess in the creed that the only-begotten Son of God was crucified and buried," and so on.</p>
      <p>However, I may seem too troublesome in reciting so laboriously so many testimonies exhibited to the same matter in a similar and concordant manner. Therefore I cease and refer you to the letters of the blessed, written piously and elegantly on this cause against heresies and heretics for the orthodox faith. There are three most learned and very clear dialogues published by the blessed Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, the first of which he titles: Immutable, the second: Unconfused, the third: Impassible. There are also the most excellent books of St.</p>
      <p>Vigilius the martyr against heresies, especially those of Nestorius and Eutyches. Books of the same kind were published by the blessed Fulgentius, African bishop of Ruspe, also by the blessed Gelasius, pastor of the Roman church. But if you wish to read a summary of all these, read the 3rd book of John of Damascus on the orthodox faith, especially chapter 3 and the neighboring ones.</p>
      <p>With these premises, it is easy to answer the question of whether Christ is the Son of God also according to human nature; for as far as he was born of the Virgin Mary and received human substance from her, he is to be called the son of man, not of God.</p>
      <p>However, since the Son of God, who is from eternity, became the son of man in the womb of the virgin by assuming human nature, the blessed messenger of God very truly said to the virgin: "What will be born of you will be called the Son of God." However, care must be taken in the cause of this question, lest we incline to the heresy of those who once taught that human nature descended from the Father from heaven into the womb of the virgin and thus passed through the virgin more than was born of her. Care must also be taken, lest, while we refer the truth of human nature to its proper origin, we tear apart the unity of the person and deny that he is the Son of God because of the assumed human nature from the virgin, who by assuming man, did not lose what he was, but became what he was not. And now he is the same and one God and man, remaining in the property of both natures.</p>
      <p>I bring nothing new in these matters either. For if we read in the dogmas or definitions of the church verbatim: "The Father did not assume flesh nor the Holy Spirit, but the Son only, so that he who was in the divinity of God the Father himself might become in man the son of man's nature. Therefore the Son of God became the son of man, born according to the truth of nature, from man the son of man, so that the truth of the begotten might have the name of son not by adoption, not by appellation, but in both nativities by being born and be true God and true man, one son. Therefore we do not confess two Christs nor two sons, but one son, God and man, whom we therefore also call the only-begotten, remaining in two substances, as the truth of nature has conferred on him, not confused nor mixed, as the Timothians wish, but united by society etc.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we do not oppose the proposition that asserts that Christ the Lord is a mediator according to both natures, that is, Christ, as he is God and man, is a mediator with the Father.</p>
      <p>I do indeed remember reading elsewhere in Augustine: "He is not a mediator because he is equal to the Father; for by this he is as distant from us as the Father; therefore the apostle did not say one mediator of God and men Christ, but man Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Therefore he is a mediator by that by which he is inferior to the Father, by which he is closer to us, superior to us, by which he is closer to the Father."</p>
      <p>These are found in book 2 against Pelagius and Celsus on original sin chapter 28. However, the same in the book on the harmony of the evangelists first chapter 35: "Christ is called the mediator of God and men, between immortal God and mortal man, God and man, reconciling man to God, remaining what he was, made what he was not." Nor does he write otherwise to Laurentius in the Enchiridion chapter 8.</p>
      <p>Certainly St. John Chrysostom explaining the first to Timothy: "A pure man," he says, "could never be a mediator at all. For such a mediator had to speak with God; God alone could not be a mediator, for those to whom he would come as a mediator would not have received him. Therefore by divine counsel the true word was made flesh." Epiphanius also, bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, whom the blessed Jerome so highly commends in the letter against John of Jerusalem in his Ancoratus, brings these words of the apostle: "One God, one also mediator of God and man, man Christ Jesus," and adds: "You see, he pronounced the man himself, but not naked, for he is the mediator of God and men, because he is in the middle of both. To the Father indeed being God, naturally begotten: to men truly a natural man, genuinely born of Mary without the seed of a man. For thus he is the mediator of God and men, being God and made man, not changed in nature, but according to both being in the middle of both.</p>
      <p>We detest by all means the doctrine of the Spaniard Servetus and do not doubt to call all adherents of Servetus open enemies of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and of true religion. This monster of a man has gathered many old heresies long ago refuted and condemned by the testimonies of the word of God and contrary to sound reason and has secretly spread them through preaching around the world and printed and published them with the types of printers. My mind shudders whenever I recall his heresies and blasphemies, and I persuade myself that if Satan were to return from the underworld and preach to the world according to his desire, he would use many of the expressions of the Spaniard Servetus. Of which Mr. Lysmanninus will report more.</p>
      <p>All of us who announce Christ and true religion in these churches think that the blasphemous and incurable man, who laughed at and mocked all instruction, was not unjustly subjected to capital punishment, who otherwise we know should be received in faith if weak and the erring should be brought back to the way and we teach that we should deal with the seduced diligently and faithfully. But those who want religion to be overthrown and the church to be destroyed, let them favor Servetianism and plant it among the people or loosen the reins for those who strive and contend to propagate this extreme impiety and therefore are accustomed to simulate and dissimulate everything until they build a step for themselves to higher things.</p>
      <p>We hear that there are serious and odious disputes about justification among the Lutheran, as they call them, churches. By the grace of God, we have no dissension or altercations in our churches; we retain, however, that old doctrine of justification, which we had from the beginning and learned from the holy apostles of the Lord Christ and from the continuous tenor of ecclesiastical doctrine, which was for some time interpolated and interrupted by the antichrist. We teach simply that a sinful man is justified by the grace of God in Christ Jesus through faith alone, from which works of righteousness follow, to which God prepared us to walk in them.</p>
      <p>When we say that we are justified by the grace of God, we exclude the merits of man and refer justification to God alone and his mercy and benevolence. The apostle taught us to think this way, who said to the Romans: "There is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace:" And the same to the Ephesians: "By grace you have been saved and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, lest anyone should boast."</p>
      <p>The same to Titus: "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us," and again to Timothy: "Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace he saved us." Moreover, by justify and be justified, lest anyone here desire light, we understand to be absolved from sins, from condemnation and so to speak, from guilt and punishment, to be received into grace, to be considered or recognized as just, etc. We indulge nothing in this interpretation of ours arbitrarily. For again we learned these things from apostolic doctrine. For Paul to the Romans: "The judgment," he says, "was from one to condemnation, but the gift was from many offenses to justification." Behold, he clearly opposes condemnation - justification. So in the second to the Corinthians: "If the ministry of condemnation," he says, "is glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness excel in glory." And again the same to the Romans: "It is God," he says, "who justifies; who is he who condemns?" In the Acts of the Apostles chapter 13 and to the Romans chapter 4, he most manifestly interprets justification by absolution or remission of sins. Among other things, he calls just the one to whom God does not impute sins. If those passages are read and considered, they will supply abundant material for this matter and illustrious testimonies.</p>
      <p>For we do not argue as some cavillate that we argue. Somewhere the term justification is used for the forgiveness and remission of sins and acceptance into grace; therefore also in this cause. For we add that in this very cause the apostle uses it thus and so declares himself, and therefore we do not conclude, as is said, from the staff to the corner. Now indeed lest we seem to exclude or not clearly express or maliciously pass over in silence the mystery of the Son of God and our redemption, we most clearly explain the manner of justification and say that we are justified by the grace of God in Christ. God had mercy on us with gratuitous favor and love, as far as we are concerned; but the Son of his righteousness meanwhile satisfied by expiating our sins on the cross, on which he also died. Therefore for Christ's sake the Father loves us, for the sake of Christ's incarnation, offering, and obedience the Father forgives us our sins, so I say, that he does not impute our sins to us and considers us just, purified, and expiated by the blood of Christ, indeed and imputes the righteousness and obedience of the Son to us for our righteousness. We add here that we receive these things by faith alone and for this reason testify to the apostolic doctrine that sinful men are justified by faith alone without the law. Again, we learned these things verbatim from apostolic doctrine and we certainly know that they are not only true but also irrefutable. And we will exhibit even a small taste of this matter.</p>
      <p>Paul to the Ephesians says: "God predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he made us accepted in the Beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins" and the rest that follows in chapter 1. The same to the Romans: 'we are justified,' he says, 'sinners freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith'" etc.</p>
      <p>The apostle delivers more copiously to the Hebrews chapters 9 and 10, nor does the blessed Peter disagree with this doctrine, as is also clear in Acts chapter 15 and in the second epistle chapter 2 he says: "Christ himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sins and live to righteousness," and in chapter 1: "You were redeemed not with silver or gold, but with the precious blood of a lamb without blemish" and the rest. Again, the vessel of election Paul: "What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin (namely as a sacrificial victim) condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit." And again: "Christ Jesus became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, that, as it is written, he who glories, let him glory in the Lord." The same again: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them." In chapter 4 to the Romans he repeats and inculcates to the point of weariness that faith is imputed to us for righteousness. Where he also explains what kind of faith it is, which namely believes that Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification. Therefore God imputes to us for righteousness that Christ has purified and expiated us, then he has conferred his life and righteousness on us.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere Paul says: I now live, not I, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."</p>
      <p>The same apostle, pleading his cause before Agrippa, clearly says that we receive the benefits of God by faith. Peter says the same in the church of the Gentiles at Cornelius. The evangelical history testifies the same, in which it is so often repeated: "Do you believe, can you believe that I can do this? Only believe and it will be well." Therefore they obtained nothing because they believed nothing. For this reason, Paul clearly says that we are justified by faith, not by works. The holy fathers also said this, especially the blessed Augustine in the Pelagian cause, in which he so often inculcates that sinners are saved by no merit, but by the mere grace of God for the sake of the mediator Christ through faith.</p>
      <p>We consider that this simplicity and sincerity of doctrine must be entirely preserved in the church, as it is testified by such clear testimonies of Scripture and always propagated in the church until the antichrist, who corrupted all other salutary things, also obscured and trampled underfoot this most salutary doctrine of justification. However, the faithful perform good works, which in the doctrine of justification are not to be overlooked, yet so that nothing is attributed to them that Scripture does not attribute, and nowhere do works obscure the merit of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. But perhaps I dispute too prolixly about these things, since not long ago I published a book on this cause, as Mr. Lysmanninus can report.</p>
      <p>However, if I have not satisfied some even with these things, and they continue to press what I think about Osiandrian substantial justification, not imputative, I answer that I have read nothing of Osiander except certain propositions published and disputed in Königsberg in Prussia on October 24, 1550. These indeed then seemed to be so intricate, obscure, and affected and undertaken with no necessity or no fruit, that from the beginning I immediately began to abhor such a treatment of justification, which I also feared would give rise to the greatest disturbances, which those who wrote to us about the most bitter contentions, about proscriptions, about excommunications, about treatments through synods and retractions, about hatreds and reproaches and manifest injuries indicated had soon followed. But what was the need for Osiander to involve a matter so clear and orthodoxly handed down in such intricate and affected disputations? What was the need to invent new forms of speaking and by these to dissolve the concord of the churches and to vex so many consciences and almost render them doubtful? Why was the apostolic expression not preserved that God does not impute our sins to us, but imputes faith for righteousness? Why was this simplicity dragged into an odious disputation, why was the disputation about substantial righteousness, about essential, about abstract, about concrete, about inherent and acceding righteousness brought into the middle?</p>
      <p>Why was this simplicity dragged into an odious disputation, why was the disputation about substantial righteousness, about essential, about abstract, about concrete, about inherent and acceding righteousness brought into the middle? These seem to have been sought not from the simple doctrine of the apostles, but from the ambitious and tangled garrulity of the philosophers. Meanwhile, we do not refer the term homoousios to this order, which Mr. Augustine disputing against Maximinus, bishop of the Arians, manifestly derives from the Scriptures, which we also did against Cochlaeus at some time. And lest I dissemble anything here, this pestiferous dispute or altercation seems to me to have invaded those churches not without great wrath and vengeance of God. Until now all the Lutheran, as they call them, churches agreed in the article of justification, which they preached everywhere and among all. But suddenly in this very article he himself with the exotic expression and the philosophical term mixed in stirs up a tumult and divides the concord, who was not among the last defenders of the substantial presence of the body of Christ in the bread. The old church indeed for almost eight hundred years was ignorant of the disputes about the substantial and corporeal presence of the body of Christ in the bread; they called it a sacrament and a mystery, and they spoke of the sacrament sacramentally. It was enough besides to confess and believe that the Son of God proposes his true supper to us as the food of eternal life and that we receive it spiritually by faith and thus vivify. But this did not satisfy the later philosophers; for they began to dispute intricately about the sacrament. That dispute lasted, to say the least, for a hundred years and more, indeed it was not enough that the corporeal and substantial presence of the body of Christ in the bread was decreed in the councils of Tours, Vercelli, Rome, and others, unless Innocent added a certain fifth essence, that is, transubstantiation. But what was the need to introduce such prodigious opinions in such light and simplicity of evangelical and apostolic doctrine? They went further; for error draws error: they disputed about accidents or subjects, subsisting, about the body of Christ, which subsists at the same time and in several places. Who does not recognize in these the apostolic phrases, namely. What vanity and absurdity did the wretched omit? I am ashamed to report more. But when good, pious, and learned men began to oppose those prodigious doctrines moderately with reasons and most evident Scriptures proposed in the middle, suddenly the Lutherans broke out and among the first Osiander and more than morosely and imperiously urged that substantial presence, which the primitive church was ignorant of. Moreover, if anyone used the words used in the old church spiritually, mystically, significantly, sacramentally, these cried out. These are new and heavenly prophets, profane men and sacramentarians, who establish bare signs and take away Christ the saving food from the supper of the faithful. Nor did any excuse avail with these, whatever good men might bring and testify that they do not take away the food of life, that they do not deny all presence of Christ, that they do not invent bare signs, but only want to restore the old simplicity and to cut off from it those things that were sought from philosophy. Nevertheless, these urge the substantial and corporeal and indeed carnal presence adding, not however as in a place, not qualitatively, not quantitatively. From what apostolic school did these words come to us? Who does not know that they were sought from the sophists and that they are held in common with the papists? This, namely substantial, doctrine divides the church and separates even today with the most unhappy schism the churches prepared by the blood of Christ. Therefore it seems to me that the same substantial dispute has divided those churches in vengeance, which otherwise seemed to be in concord in the cause of justification. And they see now, unless they wish to see nothing, that their affairs cannot be consulted unless the philosophical phrases are removed from the middle, the apostolic simplicity and that of the old church is recalled. Therefore let them learn from this their example, which the Lord has proposed to them for their good, if they wish, that they may also tread in the sacramental contention what the sophists have glued from the deceiving and quarrelsome philosophy, and return to the first simplicity and purity. Thus indeed the Zwinglian, as they call them, and Lutheran churches will be united in holy and perpetual concord. May Christ, who instituted the supper to foster concord, grant this to us. Farewell.</p>
