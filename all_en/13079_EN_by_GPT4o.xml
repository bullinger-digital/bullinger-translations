    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] May God's grace always be with Bullinger and the people of Zurich!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Welser received Bullinger's Christian letter [not preserved] already on July 26, when he returned to Augsburg from his stay at the baths in Pfäfers. Now that Johannes Haller, this faithful servant of the Gospel and dear brother in Christ, no longer wishes to stay in Augsburg, he does not want to let him leave without a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Welser admits that the [German Protestants] have brought God's punishment upon themselves through their sinful behavior. They have tried to secure God's word, as well as many claims that serve only their own reputation (which they have advanced under the pretext of being "evangelical"), with the sword. But for what would Christ have died if people could be brought to or obligated to the Gospel through war? Only God deserves the honor of drawing people to Himself, and He will never let anyone fall whom He has destined for rebirth! The [German Protestants] were rightly punished! By the way, Welser has never believed that the Gospel could be preserved with the help of alliances and wars. He knows that it can only be preserved in the people chosen by God through the work of the Holy Spirit and through rebirth. God alone deserves the honor, and not the people who seek something else!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Welser has suffered much during the war. Once he almost fell away from God. But the Lord has and will continue to preserve him, better than the loudmouths. The [German Protestants] wanted to be both disciples of Christ and disciples of this world, even though Christ made it clear to His own that His kingdom is not of this world! So why was there a need for cannons and gunpowder? And although it is claimed that it is the Christian magistrate's duty to call for war, Welser cannot agree with this opinion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Now to Hans Schöner, whom Welser [in the past] admonished. He left Augsburg without being forced to and behaved improperly towards the councilors. [Also] he should have acted more cautiously! This matter is so contentious that Welser cannot elaborate on it here. However, if he can assist Schöner without offending the Augsburg council, he will do so and remember Bullinger's request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Hopefully, Welser has never failed to be helpful to Haller. He also wishes to do good to him in the future. May God thwart the devil's schemes and enable Haller's return to Augsburg! As far as Welser can judge, Haller is a God-fearing, peace-loving child of God. He is neither conceited nor envious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger will have already heard that England has subdued Scotland, resulting in about 14,000 deaths, and that Piacenza has submitted to Emperor Charles V.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] That's all for now, for Bullinger knows that Welser is always ready to help him. Let them pray in Zurich for him, as he will do for the people of Zurich, for the time of trial is coming. May the Lord strengthen the faith of His own to the end and protect them from evil!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings to all who love God's word in Zurich.</p>

      <p>May the grace of Jesus Christ be with you, gracious and dear Lord Bullinger, and with us all at all times. Amen.</p>

      <p>I received your Christian letter, dear Lord, dated July 26, quite some time ago and have since been at the baths in Pfäfers. But since the pious and faithful servant of the Gospel of Jesus Christ does not wish to stay any longer, but rather travels to you, I wanted to respond to your letter, dear brother in Christ, and write with this faithful servant, this pious man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I confess that we have brought God's punishment upon ourselves for our sins, as we have tried to uphold His word and all claims for personal gain and honor, which have been used under the evangelical name, with the sword. For what would Christ have died if one could maintain or make evangelical through war? The Lord wants to have the honor! All who are called to the new birth will not be lost. Therefore, it is right and well-deserved that this has happened to us! For I have never believed that one could uphold the Lord's Gospel through alliances and the sword. The Lord will preserve it through the Holy Spirit and the new birth in every chosen one by grace, and in such a way that He will rightly have the honor (and not those who seek otherwise)!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have had to endure much in the war. Once I almost fell away, but the Lord has and will preserve me by grace, better than the loudmouths! If the disciples of Christ and also of this world want to be, even though Christ clearly showed His members that His kingdom is not of this world. What need is there then for many cannons and gunpowder? Even if one wants to justify it to the authorities, they should do so, but I do not believe that it is fitting for a ruler who also wants to be a Christian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As for Schöner, whom I [...] admonished, he left here without any necessity, [...] behaved improperly towards the lords, as is fitting, not accounting for it. [...] should have thought better! The matter is very contentious, [...] than writing. If I could help with anything good, that might come to a respectable council acceptably, I would show myself as a Christian, remembering your request.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What I could have done good for Lord Haller should not have been lacking with me and still not. I hope the Lord will break the devil's schemes, grant grace, that he may return to us. He is a child of Jesus Christ, godly and peaceful. I give him (as far as a human can know) testimony. I have neither sensed pride nor envy in him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>As England has defeated Scotland, killing about 14,000, and Piacenza has submitted to the imperial majesty, you will have already known all this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>And now no more, for you have me always ready for your service. Pray to God the Lord in your community for me. I will do the same, for all things are shaping up that they might come to the test. The Lord strengthen our faith, preserve us to the end, protect you and us all from evil! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Dated October 3, 1547. Greet all your brothers for me, who love the word of the Lord. Your willing brother, Hans Welser.</p>
