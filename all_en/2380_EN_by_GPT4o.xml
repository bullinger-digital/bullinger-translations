      <p>S. D. Mr. Burcher has given you, dear son, a good testimony both for your diligence in studies and for your frugality in making expenses. Continue in this way, my son, to surpass yourself in your diligence and frugality; for in this way you will greatly please both me and your mother and you will adorn yourself.</p>
      <p>I am still expecting the expense sheet up to the first of September, so that I may infer from it what you have spent and what remains for you.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for my brother, that He may deign to grant him health; for he is suffering from very great pains. However, we have great hope that he will be cured by Mr. Felix Wirz.</p>
      <p>He sends you his singular greetings.</p>
      <p>Our confederates from Graubünden have been defeated in Italy; all their leaders fell except for two, who did not participate in the battle due to illness, and they lost all their banners. More than 300 were killed, 450 captured, but soon released very kindly by Müssio.</p>
      <p>The Germans, who enlisted with the French and served under the leader Reckenrat, were largely destroyed; for the Italian infantry and the French cavalry did not provide any proper support to the Rhaetians and Germans, but soon took to flight themselves. I mean the French cavalry, which was gathered under the French banner in Italy. Otherwise, I have no doubt about the valor of the French, if the French themselves had been present with the Rhaetians and Germans, they would have fought bravely with them without a doubt. We must pray to the Lord to settle these grave disturbances. Siena is currently besieged by the Emperor, with its citizens and the French defending it bravely. Strozzi is recruiting a new army, the first of the French in Italy. Your mother greets you, your sisters and all of us greet you. Johannes Esslinger, a noble surgeon, passed away this night from a sudden death and departed religiously to the Lord; for I was present at his death. Farewell. Zurich, 1st of September 1554.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the house of Mr. John Burcher, an Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger in Strasbourg.</p>
