      <p>Greetings. The present messenger saw that I did not have the leisure either to write at length or to read the book written by you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. I have dispatched the business entrusted to me by you with the utmost faith and diligence. I give you the greatest thanks for the book sent to me. I hope you have handled the matter of the Lord's Supper in such a way that there is nothing we could wish to have been handled differently. However, I will read it carefully at the earliest opportunity. I have been ill for several days, bedridden for some, and have not yet fully recovered.</p>
      <p>This greatly hinders my plans. But who can resist the Lord? His will and governance of things are always the best. I will send to you in return whatever I have published.</p>
      <p>Ochinus has also written against Westphal. I have not read everything, but only certain parts: it is now being printed. You think that the undertaking of war against you has brought us a truce. But I know the rage of these men so well that I promise neither truce nor peace for us.</p>
      <p>What comforts us all the most is that we are fighting the Lord's battles. It greatly distresses me that all efforts to renew the covenant have failed or fallen in vain. For I fear far worse things. I pray to the Lord that, with enmities and hatreds removed, He may sincerely unite those neighboring cities. Farewell. Greet all the fellow ministers, the most esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>All my fellow ministers greet you. May the Lord bless you and all yours, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 27, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Johannes Calvin, pastor of the church of Geneva, his venerable lord and most esteemed brother.</p>
