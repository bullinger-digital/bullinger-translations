    <p xml:id="regest1">A first letter [No. 873] has already been delivered by Erasmus [Schmid]; sends newly drafted expositions on the sacraments and the Eucharist from the still unfinished complete edition of his Paul commentaries [HBBibl I 84]. Requests forwarding to Gryn√§us and possibly to Bucer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I had sealed the previous letters and handed them to our Erasmus when it occurred to me that it would be fruitful to send you from our still unfinished work on Paul what I wrote about the nature of the sacraments and the Eucharist. I have enriched this with a new copy; in the others published a few years ago, you will not read these in their entirety. Therefore, read what I wrote from folio 41 to 45, and again from folio 204 to 216. I cannot speak more clearly and better on this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell and also share this with Grynaeus or, if you please, even with Bucer.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 4, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Myconius.</p>
