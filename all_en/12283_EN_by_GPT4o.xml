    <p xml:id="regest1">Pincier thanks for the hospitality shown to the Marburg resident Lorenz Blankenheim, who is full of praise for Bullinger. May the words and deeds [of the Zurichers] become even more well-known! - Pincier has read the [“True Confession”] with great pleasure, not because, like many, he would rejoice in the discord, but because this writing refutes the disgraceful quibbling in Luther's [“Short Confession”] with restraint and based on facts and serious [argumentation]. - The Marburg theology professor Theobald [Thamer] appeals in his lectures and sermons to Christ to prove his physical presence in the Lord's Supper: What blasphemy! Pincier can only distance himself from such theologians and align himself with Bullinger. - Pincier commends himself to Bullinger's prayer. He [and the like-minded] live according to the words of Jesus like sheep among wolves. Yet God strengthens them and has given them a not too bad prince [Landgrave Philipp of Hesse]. A secretary known to Pincier at the [Hessian] court [Simon Bing] has reported that the Landgrave not only responded kindly to the Zurichers [above No. 2138], but rather, when the [Elector] [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony demanded a ban on the [Zuricher] writings from him, he demanded from him and his chancellor [Gregor Brück] to resist another attack by Luther on the [Zuricher]. Consequently, the enemies do not dare to openly proceed against Pincier [and the like-minded]. - Greetings, also from Decius [Dietmar Fuhrmann].</p>

      <p>[Greetings] through Christ.</p>
      <p>I could not help but be greatly delighted and congratulate Lorenz Blankenheim, a citizen of Marburg and our friend, for being received, honored with so many services and honors of hospitality and all generosity by you, and finally even dismissed with the greatest honor; hence, with his natural judgment and character, he recognizes your virtues and praises your humanity, modesty, innocence - and what not? - so that those who are either unjust or unwilling are forced to hear these praises about you. For we, as many good men as we are, wish and hope that the cause of truth becomes known about you among all men, not only through just reasons of words but also through right and excellent deeds. For this reason, it seems to me that I should rightly rejoice and have great gratitude to you, because you do not omit to win over not only others but especially our own with benefits (although most of us return no or certainly bad gratitude), but you seek not your own, but the glory of God alone, who will repay you for this faith, as you do not tire of the slanders of the envious and ungrateful in doing good.</p>
      <p>We have most gladly seen and read your apologetic booklet against the insane desire to revile and condemn, which is in Martin Luther against you; not because the evil of discord delights us (as some are wrongly curious, who love nothing but perpetual quarrels and contentions), but it seemed useful, beautiful, and pleasant that to his vain, atrocious, scurrilous, and obscene logomachies and arrogantly spoken words, you oppose true and solid, serious and grave, chaste and holy, and finally all modest things, so that your innocence may easily appear to fair judges, whether learned or common people. As for the wicked buffoons, unless they somewhat impede the course of truth, I think they should be little cared for, for nothing will satisfy them, even if Christ himself should give a voice or sign from heaven to pronounce, confirm, and persuade the truth.</p>
      <p>I say this because a certain Theobald, a professor of sacred literature in the Marburg school (if it pleases the gods) most acute, is accustomed sometimes publicly in his lecture and disputation, I think even in a sermon before the audience, to challenge Christ and demand a sign and to imprecate some evil upon himself, if not the whole Christ, as great as he is, body and soul, divinity with humanity, is present there before his eyes: A horrendous blasphemy and excellently suited to establish error!</p>
      <p>What madness has blinded him so that he would drag Christ down from heaven? But what do those men not dare and devise for the assertion of their opinions, who are so shameless to lie and invent, both in boasting of their secret revelations of some spirit, and in slandering the writings and opinions of others who hold otherwise! By what right or what wrong? Therefore, I willingly and voluntarily separate myself from such theologians and join myself to you, in whom, if nothing else, I have always found and perceived greater candor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I want you all to be asked with one voice, Bullinger, my revered teacher in the Lord, to have me commended to you and your prayers again and again, and never to fail us with advice or comfort. For we truly live here almost as Christ predicted, like sheep among wolves. But God makes us magnanimous in his business and constant, so that we do not falter or despair. He also gave us a prince not so morose or unjust as some of our people would wish. For I have learned from a good man, who is our prince's secretary and still resides daily at court, that, most kindly disposed towards you, he has responded to you no less kindly than prudently; which indeed I received with the greatest gratitude as I should. He also said that the Duke of Saxony tried to persuade our Landgrave to ban your books in these regions, but the prince did not consent or comply; rather, he demanded from him and from Pontanus, his chancellor, to resist Luther with all their might, lest he should again plot against you.</p>
      <p>What he has achieved, I do not know. From this, however, you will gather about the benevolent mind of the prince towards you, which many of the adversaries know, and especially those who sometimes cause us trouble, therefore they cannot wage open enmities against us. However, they undoubtedly foster clandestine ones as much as they can. But may God forgive them and unite us, so that in him we may always be one and think alike. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ and love me, as you do. Lord Decius, my singular bishop and patron, greets your humanity. Greet all others from us.</p>
      <p>Given from Wetter, around the Nones of September in the year 1545. Your entirely, Johannes Pincziger.</p>
      <p>To the theologian Heinrich Bullinger, of utmost integrity both in doctrine and life, the leader of the true religion in the church of Zurich, his lord and teacher. In Zurich.</p>
