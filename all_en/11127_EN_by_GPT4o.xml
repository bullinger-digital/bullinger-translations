    <p xml:id="regest1">Has been removed from his office by the decision of both councils, as he was not willing to lend his name to Bucer's catechism; fears that the corrupt councilors will cause even more harm. Since [Bullinger and Jud] can no longer do anything for him - apart from advising Erasmus [Ritter] - he renews his request, in view of his return, to assist him [in finding accommodation]. That Ritter, even if with reservations, wants to sign, puts the Bernese church in a difficult position; therefore, he asks to influence him, to perhaps avert the evil after all.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Having now obtained a certain messenger to you, I decided to inform you briefly of my situation. Today, I have truly experienced what a cunning adversary can achieve with his machinations and plots. For when Megander refused to lend his name to Bucer's catechism in all respects, he is compelled to set off, even towards Zurich. By the decision of the council and the people, he was dismissed due to his refusal to subscribe, yet, so to speak, he was granted a stipend until Lent. Christ could do no more, which no pious person does not greatly lament, mourn, and deplore. It is certainly to be feared that some greater evil may be established by the plans and efforts of these men. Many indeed are aspiring to the favors of princes and other such things. As far as I am concerned, I see that nothing else is to be expected, nor should you even attempt anything in this matter except by advising Erasmus, I will hasten my return home. I again beg and request you to look after my affairs.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 24, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Erasmus, mentioned above, promises to subscribe, but under conditions, which has left our church somewhat suspended and doubtful. If anyone had refused submission with me, I do not doubt that our church would have attempted or would still attempt today to counteract this evil. Therefore, advise the man on what is holy and sincere, and that as soon as possible. This is certainly the only means by which this evil will be removed from us if he is to refuse subscription by your counsel.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the word of the Zurich church, Bullinger and Leo, most vigilant, dearest brothers in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
