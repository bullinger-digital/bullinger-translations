      <p>S. P. I cannot express how gladly I received and read your letters, truly learned and wisely written about everything, and I wish that the Germans, who have experienced the Emperor's goodwill for so many years, would finally become wise. I always fear the end; for I know, having been raised with them for ten or twelve years, how easily everyone is deceived, whether by some evil fate or because of mutual hatreds. However, it has often happened that the Christian republic suffers inconvenience, so much so that other kings and monarchs do not dare to entrust their faith to them. Nevertheless, our king has decided not to abandon German liberty, provided that they, as they daily signify to his majesty, have some spirit. That tyrant Margrave ruins everything; having entered, as I have heard, the city of Bamberg, he ordered some canons to be hanged and does the same with priests in the villages, truly a remarkable praise. But as the master is, so is the servant; the Emperor first favored the Protestants, then others, now he ruins both; such is his paternal affection for Germany. I have been written from Strasbourg that a diet of all the princes has been summoned in Frankfurt on the 16th of this month, where the Emperor promises to send his envoys. Meanwhile, he seeks peace through the Pope, but he will not obtain it, and we know all these things are done in deceit; for he first tried the king, wishing to enter into an alliance with him against Germany. Meanwhile, the king sends a strong army into Piedmont and prepares other things for war.</p>
      <p>The Sienese are well; the Imperial army has been besieging a small castle named Monteriggioni for a month now. I cannot help but have gladly read what you wrote to me about the Florentine envoy; I see your council is wise and perceives the Emperor's schemes; for these things, as you write, are done at his instigation, to divide you among yourselves and us from you; for there is nothing that vexes him more. I had warned your people and how the Emperor, after the German seditions, absolutely urges the Margrave to transfer the war towards Burgundy on your and our borders. Write often, I beg you, and hold me dear. Farewell, excellent and good man. Given in Solothurn on the 3rd of May. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaneus.</p>
      <p>Your letters come through the post without any danger. To the most illustrious lord and friend, Mr. Bullinger, an excellent man.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
