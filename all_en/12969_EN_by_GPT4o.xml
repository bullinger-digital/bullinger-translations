    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received], in which he wrote about his spa treatment in Urdorf, the resulting accumulation of work, and the recall of Johannes Haller [and Thoman Ruman] to Zurich. The latter did not please Frölich, as he believes it will cause offense. Hardly anyone will consider this recall as innocent as it actually is. Most will see it as a disapproval of the Augsburg council's policy, especially since Haller has an enormous following [at his services]. Moreover, this could greatly harm the church. Hopefully, the Zurich council will comply with the Augsburg council's request [from May 24]! Bullinger should advocate for this. No harm will come to the two Zurichers, and if they are no longer safe in Augsburg, timely provisions will be made for them. Frölich personally vouches for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He has not written for a long time. This is solely due to the difficult times. He remains deeply connected to Bullinger. Nothing could ever separate him from him and from God. He wants to remain steadfast until his last breath.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Augsburg, there are rumors of an imperial war plan by Emperor Charles V against the Confederates. Frölich does not believe it, but he cannot rule out that the Emperor might dare, as it is known what so many unexpected victories can do to people: An excess of fortune often becomes their downfall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is certain that the Emperor and Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony have reached an agreement. However, the people of Augsburg do not know its content. Presumably, Duke Maurice of Saxony will soon receive the electoral dignity. Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel are said to have reached good peace agreements with the Emperor. How shameful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, to Rudolf Gwalther, and all colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your letter, in which you mentioned your spa treatment in Urdorf for several days and the resulting accumulation of work, as well as the recall of Brother Haller, etc., to the homeland, was entirely pleasing to me, except for the recall, which seems to me to be a cause of offense, as it is untimely at this moment. For who, in such a large crowd of people and amidst these movements, when everything is especially taken negatively against the authorities, will easily believe that Haller's recall is as innocent as it is, without suspecting that our council has given occasion for the recall? From this suspicion, a great offense to the gospel of Christ could easily arise! Therefore, I hope the excellent Zurich council will comply with the prayers of our council. I implore you to also strive for this. No harm or injury will be inflicted on those good men. But as soon as we sense that the place is no longer safe for them, we will make timely provisions for them. Laetus, however, should see how he can extricate himself from these snares!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have rarely written to you for a long time. I ask you to attribute this to the difficult times and the dangers arising from them. I am and will remain entirely yours, and there is no person on earth who possesses a greater part of me than you alone, my venerable Bullinger, nor will any storm, however fierce, ever tear me away from you, much less from the truth, which is God himself. But you will hear and see that Laetus is and will remain steadfast until his last breath and into eternal bliss, which the Lord will grant you and us to enjoy forever! Farewell.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Rumor is spreading here and there that a war is to be waged against the Swiss, which, although I do not believe it, I am not unaware of how titillating unexpected and excessive victories can be to the spirits, so much so that even an abundance of fortune sometimes overcomes itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is certain that an agreement has been made between the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony. However, the conditions are unknown to us. I believe, however, that Duke Maurice will attain the electoral dignity. The Landgrave, along with Duke Henry of Brunswick, are already in the Emperor's camp and are said to obtain grace under good conditions. I am ashamed to say more!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell again and again. Give my regards to the mayors, my dear Gwalther, and the entire college of excellent men. June 1, 1547. Yours, G. Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., Zurich. To my especially gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
