      <p>Most excellent Bullinger, I had written these letters, which I am sending along with this, a few days ago, when I had hoped to be able to send them through a certain messenger; but it did not succeed. You will read them there, so I am not compelled to repeat myself here, but to write other things. I am well by the grace of God; everything here is safe and intact. Only our Molinaeus (Du Moulin) disturbs himself and prepares to leave, certainly without cause; he has no enemy except himself, this I solemnly assure you. If I advise him, he rages, indeed yesterday evening he came here from dinner and in the presence of many openly said that the professors of this school are dogs. God knows how unwillingly I hear these things; but what can I do? He could have greatly advanced the cause of the gospel; but he should have retained his reputation. Let us pray for him. I wish I could cure the man with my own blood. The Count of Annau recently left Volmar's house, where he lived for a year with a tutor and three servants, complaining about the food and drink, whether justly or unjustly, it is not for me to judge; I only know that Volmar's reputation has been wounded by this, and not slightly; for the Count and his people are considered by all to be most modest and indeed they are. Our Josias knows why he is not considered to complain in vain. Our Theodor says he has a right to complain and wishes to be elsewhere. He is indeed progressing, as it seems to me; but care must be taken that he does not lose too much time serving there.</p>
      <p>I wanted to tell you a few things about the state of the school. The rest is as usual. Our Duke is preparing a journey to Bohemia to the Roman king, to settle old disputes and receive investiture, although he will deal with other matters in the meantime. You will know the rest later.</p>
      <p>A most severe plague has invaded my homeland so that 20 die daily; it has already taken from me my closest and dearest ones; I sent Aurelius there to conduct business; thus he is in that fire. May God preserve him.</p>
      <p>See in the enclosed note what Brentius wrote to me about the English. Before the prince departs, I will urge again; for I myself am going to him again. In his absence, who knows if I will come, so that I may live there for a month? For there are many things to discuss with you about certain books. May God inspire me to do what will be good in His eyes. The brothers from Geneva wrote to me that our Lelio could not contain himself, but spoke out and said many things against our doctrines. I wish it were not so; I hear he went to Basel. If so, he seeks his own; but indeed this evil is growing. I dealt with Massario in Strasbourg, who seemed to me to have departed from us and to be entirely intent on insinuating Servetian ideas to others. I would not affirm this about a very dear friend unless I knew for certain, indeed I hear he has already prepared disciples for himself and is accustomed to say that the people of Basel think this way. It is indeed to be lamented that such men are taken from us. I wish we could call them back; but I scarcely hope, rather I fear worse. I pour out these things into your bosom alone with great sorrow; I know you will not share them with others.</p>
      <p>Jerome Donzelinus, a physician, is now with me, recently expelled from Venice for the gospel, a prudent man who knows many things happening in Italy. He affirms that the Servetian plague is spreading excessively and that he has often been tempted, especially by Gribaldo, to join him in opinion. It is certain that there is a conspiracy of some people in Basel with some Italians; unless this is suppressed, it will bring us some great evil. You should consider all these things favorably according to your candor.</p>
      <p>I have incurred some extraordinary expenses these days, not insignificant ones. Therefore, I am sending Julius Morus of Brescia, my acquaintance, if perhaps Mr. Bassafontaneus has sent to you (which he himself promised me) fifty crowns, you should give them to this Julius; for you will have given rightly. If he has not sent them, I have instructed him to approach him. Therefore, if you perhaps have them, count them out to him; if you do not have them, inform the messenger where he might find the man, whether in Solothurn or Baden. I have instructed him to return through Zurich and settle some matters. You will give letters to him upon his return; especially write what is being done about our Locarnese. Now farewell, most excellent brother. I bid your sons-in-law and my dearest sons to be well. Pray for me with them; I often pray for all of you. God has placed you there in a certain watchtower; therefore, be vigilant and watch that heresies do not corrupt the harvest of the gospel for us. TÃ¼bingen, September 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I pray you send me the catalog of the previous year along with your letters, which you wrote to me about it; again I pray, do not fail.</p>
      <p>From the letters of Mr. Brentius on the 21st to Vergerius. And concerning the English exiles, I do not doubt that the most illustrious prince, in his clemency and piety, will decide what is worthy of a pious prince and most honorable and useful for the exiles of Christ, whom you have so greatly commended.</p>
