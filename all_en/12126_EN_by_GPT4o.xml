    <p xml:id="regest1">On [January 25], Bartholomäus in Neuburg received Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“] through [Wolfgang] Musculus from Donauwörth. In Donauwörth, Musculus is quite successful in introducing the Reformation; on January 1, they decided [there] to sing psalms in German following the Augsburg model; images and the multitude of altars are also being abolished. - The second copy of the [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“] intended for [Johannes] Cochläus was immediately sent by Bartholomäus through a personal messenger [...] to the [comital] chancellery to Cochläus in Eichstätt. Bartholomäus will soon send Bullinger another book [„De sanctorum invocatione... liber unus“] by Cochläus, which is even more convoluted than [Cochläus’ „Kurtze Replica“ or „Replica brevis“], which Bullinger has now refuted [with the „Brevis ἀντιβολή“]. - Bartholomäus cannot marvel enough at Luther and his [„Kurtz bekentnis“], especially since he also admits that the body and blood are not contained in the symbols of the Lord's Supper. Melanchthon has rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation in the „Loci [communes]“. Essentially, there is almost no difference from the teachings of the Swiss churches, and Bartholomäus remains with his previous attitude [towards the Swiss]. - The [local] Papists are rejoicing over the council that is to be opened [on March 15]; they will be even more delighted about the conflict between Saxony and the Swiss. This newly rekindled dispute pains Bartholomäus. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and the others.</p>

      <p>Greatest greetings.</p>
      <p>On the Conversion of Saint Paul, most learned and pious man, a few days ago through Musculus of Augsburg, my most dear friend, those paper gifts were certainly most pleasing to me, brought from Donauwörth, an imperial town, all the way to Neuburg. For there now Wolfgang Musculus is very busy overturning the papacy and again establishing the true worship of God according to the prescription of the word. Thus far, the seed of the word of God has been sown quite successfully into the previously stony hearts of the people of Donauwörth as if into good soil. For on the first day of January, they bid farewell to papal chants set to music and began psalmody in a language known to all, following the form of the Augsburg church, and, as I hear, images and the multitude of altars are in danger; for against these, he strives to fight, equipped with all armor. May the Lord be at his right hand.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the second copy, as I might say in the old manner, or the copy addressed to Cochläus, I immediately arranged to be delivered to Eichstätt through a certain and personal messenger from the prince's chancellery, Archytas, whom you once called Cochläus. It remains that I will soon send you another, much more intricate Repplica than the one you have now most learnedly refuted; for the proverb "τρυγόνος λαλίστερος" (more talkative than a turtle-dove) has its proper place in Cochläus alone.</p>
      <p>Regarding Luther, to tell the truth, I cannot marvel enough at what came to his mind, that he is inclined to spread these things, especially at this time, in such a state of affairs, even among these people, especially since he also admits that the body and blood are not contained in the symbols of the supper as wine in a jug or, as he more coarsely puts it, like straw in a sack. Melanchthon in his "Loci" has quite learnedly and briefly put the previously accepted doctrine of transubstantiation in order. If the doctrines of the Swiss churches are compared with this, I do not see how they conflict with each other. Therefore, you should not hope otherwise of me than you have been accustomed to until now.</p>
      <p>Our papists are mocking us with their ecumenical council to be celebrated on Laetare Sunday; their joy will be greater when they see the Saxons and the Swiss contending with mutual writings. I am therefore exceedingly grieved that the controversies, especially now when it was most important to be in agreement, are being rekindled.</p>
      <p>Greet most learned and upright men, συνεργούς (the collaborators), Pellikan, Bibliander, Gwalther, and the others, etc. Farewell greatly.</p>
      <p>In Neuburg on the Danube, in the year etc. 45, on the first day of February.</p>
      <p>Adam Bartholomäus, minister of the word, your co-worker and brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the divine word among the Zurichers, my most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
