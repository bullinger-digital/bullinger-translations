      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, has been delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I know that you are very busy, and I do not write to expect a reply from you, but to fulfill my duty. However, I will be brief now.</p>
      <p>I did not approach the envoy himself; what I wanted him to know, I conveyed through a note. He sent his secretary to me, who wishes to greet you respectfully.</p>
      <p>He firmly and solemnly asserts that the Turkish fleet has departed; he recently told the same to the consuls and added that there is a certain ruler who has so far inclined towards the French side, who has suffered this loss from the Turks.</p>
      <p>The envoy denies knowing anything about the ships, some of which were captured and some sunk. The secretary added that a battle is expected daily, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending German letters from Milan to our fellow citizen about the execution of two brothers, whose full story you are eager to know; read these until more complete ones arrive, and return the read letters. It will be appreciated to inspect your books, which you promised; for we are not certain about the subject of the book. But if only we had something with which we could reciprocate your kindness.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as you bind us entirely with your benefits, you will have perpetual debtors. I cannot say more; but even this is hastily written, as you see.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, with all your family, as happily as possible. Master Philipp and our Pontisella have instructed me to send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Chur, 29th of August, in the year of our Lord 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Church of Zürich, his lord and most esteemed patron. At the Grossmünster in Zürich.</p>
