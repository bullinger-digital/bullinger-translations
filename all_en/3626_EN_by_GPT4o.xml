      <p>Greetings and best wishes. From the time when Stanislaus departed for Poland in October of the previous year, I have not sent any letters to you, most illustrious and esteemed lord and dearest brother. For I think it better to write none than to entrust frequent letters to people not well known, and indeed, during that time, no one was presented to me to whom I could safely entrust them. In January of this year, someone came to us who claimed to be English, but in truth was Scottish, as those who know better call him. He came from Poland bringing letters from Philipp Melanchthon and from Mr. Johannes Utenhovius, speaking much about you, and was heading to Geneva. I entrusted letters to him for Calvin, for I thought he would be a faithful messenger.</p>
      <p>I also entrusted other letters addressed to the ministers of the Bernese church. However, he neither went to Bern nor to Geneva.</p>
      <p>In May, I learned from Mr. Hyperius that a certain Englishman hurried to Saxony, claiming to carry the mysteries of the enthusiasts. But he carries nothing of which I would be ashamed.</p>
      <p>I recount this story so that you may be cautious and not trust just anyone; I myself will also be more circumspect in the future or less frequent in writing.</p>
      <p>I could safely trust this one, and therefore I now write more freely and extensively. Laelius Socinus of Siena is here, to whom I have entrusted these letters, which he offers to you.</p>
      <p>He is the son of that great jurist Socinus, who for a long time taught law in Italy with great praise and admiration from all and became known to all the princes for giving counsel in more difficult matters. He is noble, as you know, born from a most noble family; he lived with us in Zurich for many years; for the sake of purer religion, he left Italy, his parents, brothers, and very ample means and migrated to us. He lived with us blamelessly.</p>
      <p>He devotes remarkable diligence to letters, and thus he is not commonly skilled in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages. He loves true religion, hates superstition; but I would rather you know him from conversation. Moreover, he is prudent and industrious, truly worthy to either teach publicly or be joined to some prince and handle his arduous affairs. He himself will explain to you the danger in which the affairs of his family and his own are.</p>
      <p>I beseech your faith, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, that you do not fail this excellent man, but assist him and have him most faithfully recommended in all things; for if I know him rightly, you will not regret your effort and diligence. He knows all our affairs exactly.</p>
      <p>I am therefore briefer in writing, for he will report everything more exactly. I will touch upon the sum of certain matters, at least those which it is very important for you to know. You have undoubtedly heard that a great danger was prepared for the faithful brothers in Piedmont last year. To avert this, a delegation was sent to the Swiss churches, from which it was easily obtained that envoys were sent to the King of France to plead for the safety of the faithful in Piedmont, and they achieved something with the king. The mission was undertaken by Mr. Beza and Farel, who, having obtained from the Swiss what they wanted, went down to Strasbourg, then proceeded to the Palatinate, from where they were sent to WÃ¼rttemberg, objecting that the Piedmontese brothers were laboring under the sacramental error. To appease him, they left in his hands a confession as if common to the Swiss and Savoyard churches, a copy of which I have attached here. When we learned from elsewhere and saw that such a confession did not agree with the doctrine of our churches, we remonstrated with Mr. Beza, urging him never to attempt anything like that, etc.</p>
      <p>He generously promised to explain more clearly if anyone wishes to draw away from the genuine sense or the one he holds and presents before us, and to ensure that he does nothing of the sort on his own judgment without consulting the brothers. I briefly noted down what I desired in that confession, which I also share at present. Furthermore, since there is incredible freedom of churches in France, in Paris itself a congregation of over 500 gathered on September 5, but it was betrayed by the enemies of Christ; over 80 faithful were captured. Therefore, those two envoys are again present, asking that a delegation be sent again.</p>
      <p>A delegation was sent to the king and indeed very quickly. However, before they arrived, some faithful had already been burned.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the king's mind was somewhat softened by our envoys. Those two envoys then went straight to Worms, where, as you know, the princes and orders of the empire had sent their learned men and envoys for the sake of a colloquy. Those two conferred with the learned men of the princes and orders.</p>
      <p>Soon they drafted a new confession, which they again left in their hands, so that they might find the princes more ready to send envoys to France, which in the meantime I hear they have not yet accomplished, etc. I send here a copy of the confession: they again speak implicitly about the supper and explain the place of Paul 1 Corinthians 10 differently than they should. We also doubt whether the French churches will in all respects acknowledge the Augsburg Confession, especially in auricular confession and the mass, etc. We write to Mr. Beza and explain what seems to us about the confession and the colloquy. Meanwhile, at Worms, with the protestation offered, the colloquents of the princes and orders among other things condemn our churches. We have placed some words of the protestation in a letter written to Mr. Sulzer, which we have also attached here.</p>
      <p>Our Laelius will report more copiously about the colloquy.</p>
      <p>In January, Mr. Sulzer wrote to us seeking our opinion, if perhaps we are called to a colloquy, whether we would be willing to come. What we replied to him, you will understand from our letter attached here, and as far as the colloquy is concerned, this could not be obtained. The reason is obvious: the most illustrious prince and some orders of the empire offered the Confession with the Apology to Emperor Charles in 1530; but in the previous and indeed recent years, peace was made between King Ferdinand and the Catholics, as they call themselves, and the Protestants. Peace was given to them on the condition that they adhere to the Augsburg Confession; for no peace is given to those who do not subscribe to that confession, and therefore the princes urge that confession and do not think it convenient to put it in doubt by any colloquies, through which they can enjoy peace. Therefore, when the princes gathered in Frankfurt in February and March, after they created Ferdinand emperor, they immediately consulted about religion and preserving concord in their churches. What they concluded or decreed is declared and testified by the Acts or Recess, of which I send here a summary, otherwise verbose. You will see that more is now attributed to the Augsburg Confession than has ever been attributed to any confession; the Apology is also explicitly joined to this. In this, it says: "The tenth article is approved." By whom, I ask? By the Emperor and his learned men? What do they approve? Merchandise of their kind.</p>
      <p>But soon in the same Apology, it follows that they acknowledge a corporeal presence, such as the Roman church and the Greek canon acknowledge. We can never accept that.</p>
      <p>I know you have labored much here and wished to show a tolerable sense of the Confession. But if anyone examines what the times were like when the Confession was published, what acts of the Augsburg Diets came forth, what the Saxons testify about the sense of the Confession with the writings of Luther and Sleidan's history, I prefer to leave this to others, etc.</p>
      <p>You also know what is contained about auricular confession and private absolution and the mass, etc., in that Confession.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would prefer that it not be imposed on all churches with such authority, nor do I doubt that among you some may attempt something unknown. Therefore, I have discussed these matters more copiously so far, so that you may pray more ardently and watch more diligently and be present in all things with a ready mind. Johannes Burcher, an Englishman, a very good man, who was with you in Poland and wished to obtain the privilege of the art of heating, der Holtzsparkunst, from the most serene king, prays and beseeches that you take care with all effort and diligence that the privilege be granted and sent to him, as he requested from you in person. What I now have in hand, soon to be printed, Laelius will tell you.</p>
      <p>I dedicate the work to the most illustrious Palatine prince of Vilnius, whom I beg you to commend me to. You will pray for us to the Lord and love us in Christ; for we love you from the heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Your fellow ministers and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 24, in the year of our Lord 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Johannes a Lasco.</p>
