    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer has not written about a statement from Luther or Philipp [Melanchthon] regarding the Zurich Confession of the Lord's Supper [No. 482]; it might not satisfy Luther, but there is hope for concord if the people of Zurich approve Bucer's "Ad Monasterienses." Inquires about Bullinger's assessment of the opinions presented by [Ulrich Chelius]. Greetings. Blarer has called preachers expelled from the Swiss Confederation to WÃ¼rttemberg. Zwick sends gifts for the children; further greetings. Thanks for the cheese; needs a lot of healing plasters.</p>

      <p>Grace and eternal life through Christ.</p>
      <p>You wish to know what either Luther or Philipp [Melanchthon] respond to your confession, but Bucer has not written anything to us about this. When he writes back, I will inform you. Your confession indeed clearly states "truly present, given, and distributed the true body to the faithful," but you explain this "distribution and eating of the body" as "nothing other than believing that the body of Christ was given up to death for us." Although this is truly said, I fear it may not be sufficient for Luther. For he continually accuses us of holding only a general eating of the body in the supper, while he always insists that there is a peculiar presence in that place. If it could be proven by you, as Bucer wrote to the Monasterians, I would hope for solid concord with Luther and with your churches. Not that you should use unfamiliar terms - for the most careful consideration of your churches must be taken - but so that Luther would understand that you approve of that solid presence and exhibition of Christ. May God grant this matter a good year, that it may not come to an end.</p>
      <p>But now I wish to know from you whether my recent letters have been delivered to you, in which I indicated what I replied to that Frenchman, and then with what mind you received his plans. Certainly, the serpent was once more cunning than all the animals and has not ceased to be cunning. I wonder if it seems to you a suitable way to promote the gospel in France, and then whether you approve of that papal authority in ecclesiastical matters. If there were worldly young lords (nobles), it would go better. Furthermore, what kind of preaching of the gospel do you think it will be, which is done only with the pope's authority? Whether you approve or disapprove of such efforts, I earnestly ask you to inform me of your reasons. I will then write back about what troubles us here in this matter. Certainly, the Lord must be prayed to, that we may not turn to the right or to the left without consulting the Lord. But I will hear from you, if it can be done conveniently.</p>
      <p>Thomas Blaurer and my brother greet you most earnestly.</p>
      <p>We have nothing worthy of writing from the duchy, except that Ambrosius has called some brothers expelled by your people. Otherwise, all matters are entirely safe.</p>
      <p>Your dear mother and wife send me many, many, many, many good things, and in this little box (Schachtel) is some children's work, which you should give to your children, and may God keep you all in His love. I wish Theodor a thousand times well.</p>
      <p>Oh woe, how good is your cheese! God thanks you a hundred times. I thank you, however, as often as I eat from it. Let me know if it is available with you, or where it is made, for I am quite in need and must have many healing plasters.</p>
