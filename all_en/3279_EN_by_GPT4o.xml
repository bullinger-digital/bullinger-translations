      <p>A hundred letters would not suffice to write about the monstrous and unheard-of difficulties of the situation; but at the same time, the presence and departure of the courier did not allow for more. Let this one thing be enough for you, from which a notable calamity is to be predicted, which threatens us and you. The King of France or the Constable wanted to fortify Saint-Quentin with a new garrison and supplies. The English King's army learned of this at the time, and struck down those leaving Saint-Quentin, affected by wounds, so that several thousand infantry and cavalry of the French army were destroyed.</p>
      <p>The Constable, the Count of the Rhine, Rokgrad, and many from the greatest nobility of French families were either captured or killed. Three thousand German infantry were captured and released under the condition that they would never allow themselves to be hired against the Austrian house. The priests raise their crests, not because the Frenchman favors the Gospel, but because, with his forces broken, the Englishman can more conveniently defend the papacy. Polwiler, having become more spirited, will act on his own; Germany will feel again what is to come from this massacre. This calamity will cause many hidden crimes, which have so far remained concealed, to emerge. Our only salvation was from this, that the French and the Spanish withdrew each other from their intentions. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, August 20, in the year 57.</p>
      <p>G[ereon] y[ours].</p>
      <p>The knights, whom they call black, serving under Ernest of Brunswick and Eric of Brunswick, obtained the most significant part of this victory. To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious man, dearest lord and brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
