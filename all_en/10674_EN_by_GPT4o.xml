    <p xml:id="regest1">He has decided to write, even though he knows that the [ZÃ¼richers] have a bad reputation among the [Wittenbergers]. He sends, as proof of the scriptural basis of their doctrine, his commentary on four of Paul's letters and affirms the agreement in the principles of faith. He sends greetings to Luther, whose friendly remark was conveyed to him by Gereon [Sailer] through [Capito]. He asks for a response.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You may wonder, most learned Melanchthon, at my audacity in daring to address you with my letters. However, your renowned humanity, which all good people praise in you, has encouraged me to finally dare to write to you, something I have attempted for several years. I know, alas, how poorly we are regarded by you, but the negative suspicion conceived about us has not deterred me. For unless all your writings deceive, you cannot help but embrace us with pure love, once you learn that we rightly and according to the divine scriptures think about the authority of the holy scripture, about the triune and one God, about Christ as true God and man, about justification and the remission of sins, about faith and works, about law and sin, about sacraments, the church, sacred rites, about promoting and transmitting literature, and about holy governance. You have a sample of these matters in our commentaries on the four letters of Paul, which we offer to your humanity as a gift through Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer, beseeching you to accept this gift, however humble, from the bearer, and not to believe any slanders. Indeed, we are not as we are painted to you: sworn enemies of God, sacraments, good literature, political laws, and all Lutherans. Truly and from the heart, we love Jesus Christ, true religion, good literature, honest and sacred governance, and we wish to promote and confirm them with you, even at the cost of our souls. Therefore, do not reject those who are most loving of God, religion, public honesty, and yourselves. For we too are members and ministers of the same Lord Christ with you.</p>
      <p>I wish salvation to Dr. Martin Luther, about whom Dr. Gereon, the envoy of the Augsburgers, has reported to us through intermediaries how kindly he mentioned us. May the God of peace and concord grant us all, that with all enmity and evil suspicions set aside, we may with united prayers advance the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ against the pomp of the antichrist. Let it be so, let it be so!</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 31, 1535.</p>
      <p>If the love of Christ has any influence with you, I beseech you to write back, my brother in the Lord, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
