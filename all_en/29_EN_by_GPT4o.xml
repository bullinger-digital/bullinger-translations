    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius is absolutely right: He has already written three letters [hbbw XX, No. 3100; 18012. 18027] and Bullinger has not responded for at least two months. However, this silence is not due to a disagreement between them, as Myconius suspects. Rather, Bullinger's tasks are accumulating in an overwhelming manner day by day. Ecclesiastical, political, educational, familial, or even financial duties occupy the exhausted Bullinger daily to such an extent that he cannot find time to write, but only sends greetings when a messenger offers to deliver a letter. Moreover, he had no special news in the past that Myconius would not have already known. Thus, Bullinger's silence is sufficiently excused!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">When answering the letters, Bullinger does not proceed in order, but only addresses the last letter [18027 from February 3, 1548]. This contains the important topics from the previously written letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">People from [the old-believing places of the Confederation] are currently very friendly with the people of Zurich. And the latter can also perceive their good intention to protect the common fatherland during their travels to those places, regardless of one's faith. During his trip to Kappel am Albis last month, Bullinger could not hear of any discord [between the old-believing and the evangelical places] during extensive conversations with people from Zug. When Captain Roman Erb, [Heinrich] Troger, and their companions [N.N.] from Uri were in Zurich, it was the same. However, there are said to be quite a few influential men [N.N.] in [the old-believing places] who are devoted to Emperor Charles V. However, they were publicly threatened with punishment should the Emperor undertake anything [against the Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Many places are now negotiating the questions discussed at the Diets in the Landsgemeinden, so that not just a few [delegates at the Diets] decide on them at their discretion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[The Lucerne] Captain Jost von Meggen, formerly the governor of Baden, will soon set out for Rome with two or three hundred mercenaries to serve (in the devil's name!) in the papal guard. Pope Paul III is very afraid of Charles V and is trying to resist him. Meggen had previously formally asked the Zurich councilors for permission to recruit mercenaries from the Zurich area as well. They rejected the request, citing their statutes. The fact that the people of Lucerne approve of this approach clearly shows their anti-imperial sentiment! If it had been up to the [pro-imperial] Heinrich Fleckenstein, Meggen's recruitment of mercenaries would not have happened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">There was no hostility among the envoys at the Baden Diet! There are captains [N.N.] who want to bring about the division of the Confederates. They will not succeed, God willing. From the Zurich envoys [Mayor Johannes Haab and Councilor Hans Bleuler], Bullinger knows that the delegates at the Diet were completely united on all points. Only the negotiation about Joachim Mötteli von Rappenstein was contentious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The long proposal from [Albert Rosin, the interpreter of] the papal envoy [Girolamo Franco] was included in the resolution. The Basel envoys [former mayor Theodor Brand and Councilor Beat Summerer] can report on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">As always, the beast [Paul III.] flatters those who are useful to it like a courtesan. Since the Emperor [with the murder of her son] Duke Pièr Luigi Farnese has treated her badly, she is now looking for another submissive one she can exploit for herself. Therefore, [the beast] now combines heavenly [interests] with earthly ones. God will punish these wicked fellows [Paul III. and Charles V.]! Perhaps these bandits have conspired with each other to be able to divide the Confederates. However, only a few share this opinion. Perhaps God wants to incite the Roman Emperor Tiberius [Paul III.?] and Lucius Aelius Sejanus [Charles V.?] against each other again today, in order to avenge the blood of the believers shed by them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">The envoys sent by King Henry II to the Diet of France [Louis Daugerant, sieur de Boisrigaut, and Claude Bombelle, sieur de Lavau] are annoyed by the baseless financial demands of the [Confederate] captains [who had served France]. The demands have long been settled. They are also displeased that the imperial ambassadors [Giovanni Angelo Ritio and Giovanni Domenico Panizzone] are still staying in Lucerne. They should be sent away. The decision on this was postponed to the next Diet on March 12, 1548.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">The [two] imperial ambassadors continue to press for a treaty between Milan and the Confederates. However, it is not believed that this will happen. If Charles V agrees, an agreement with neighboring Milan might be reached. The matter was [taken home for consultation] and the decision on this was set for the Diet on March 12. The Uri envoys simply stated that they do not want to enter into treaties with foreign princes, which pleases the people of Zurich very much. [As far as the Diet is concerned].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Cardinal Charles de Lorraine (Guise), who traveled from Italy to France through Zurich, invited Bullinger to his inn. Since he had no time for this (it was already late on Saturday, January 28, 1548), Konrad Pellikan followed the invitation. They talked about the intercession of the saints and such outdated stuff. From the cardinal's entourage, it was heard that the Council of Bologna or Trent was over. Caution is advised! Perhaps these rumors are being spread with deceitful intent. However, Bullinger is sure that [the opponents] will not be able to shake God and his truth. The cardinal is a persecutor [of the believers] in France, just like his father Claude de Lorraine! Whoever trusts him also trusts Charles V.! Therefore, one should entrust oneself to God alone and beware of all princes. The Confederation does not need princes and was established in resistance to the princes! Without princes, it will endure, with them it will perish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">As Johannes Haller reports, the Roman-German King [correct: Archduke] Maximilian was once accused by his tutor [Obersthofmeister Pedro Laso de Castilla?] of being reluctant to go to mass. Once, when he attended mass, his bear followed him. But when it saw the fire of the candles on the altar, it jumped (in fright because of [the similarity to] gunfire) onto the altar and knocked down candles and everything else. The priest [N.N.] fled with the chalice and the whole mass became a laughingstock!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">Boys from Hemmenhofen and Gaienhofen came over the ice of the frozen Untersee towards Steckborn and Feldbach while playing, where they got into a quarrel with the boys from there, who were also playing with sleds on the ice, as naughty boys do. The Swabian boys challenged the Confederates to a fight. On January 22, about thirty boys armed with sticks marched over the ice from the Swabian side to the sound of drums. The Thurgau boys, especially from Feldbach and the surrounding area, were only about thirteen. When they realized they were outnumbered, some suggested retreating to gather more boys. However, the son [N.N.] of the [Feldbach monastery] bailiff [Rudolf] Maad from Glarus reminded them that [the Battle of Ceresole] in Piedmont was also won by only a few Confederates [and] God would help them. After all, they were in their territory and had done nothing to the others! Then the Thurgau boys decided to lay boards over the spots that were not yet completely frozen and confront the Swabian boys. When they tried to attack them, they retreated [over the boards] and beat the Swabian boys on the Confederate side of the lake. They insulted them as "cow mouths!" but then fled badly beaten. One [N.N.] of them died. The Thurgau boys also got some. All of this would have been better not to have happened! Bullinger's information is based on a letter [18017 from January 24, 1548] from Constance and what was told about it in Zurich. The story is likely true. The [Zurich] bailiff in Thurgau [Leonhard Holzhalb] inspected the site and found that the brawl took place on the Confederate side. There may be a legal dispute. Bullinger fears that this event is an omen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">The city of Constance has not received a response [to its reconciliation request] from the Emperor. It is suspected that Charles V will pressure the city to voluntarily submit to all his conditions. For if he accepted their demands to remain independent and not have an imperial garrison in the city, the people of Constance could refuse him passage [through their land] into the Confederation and possibly give the Confederates reason to come to their aid. Without passage, the Emperor could achieve little. But if he is in possession of the city, he can station a mounted garrison there. If the Confederates then intended to come to the aid of the Pope, the Venetians, or the French king, he could prevent them by ordering a [passage] blockade through Constance. So he would not have to wage open war against them. And if the opportunity for an attack against them arose, [the war preparations] would not be difficult. That is the situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">With this detailed news, Bullinger believes he has made up for his previous negligence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">It is assumed that Charles V will attack the Hanseatic cities and from there Denmark to help [his brother-in-law] Christian II of Denmark regain the throne.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">In addition, the Emperor is said to be making preparations to reinstate Duke Charles III [in the Duchy of Savoy].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">However, Bullinger believes that Charles V is attempting something entirely different, namely to create some sort of religious mixture through his mediators. But what if such a mixture resulted in something like a Samaritan religion or heresy, where God is worshiped and the Bible is not contradicted, but various gods and cults are retained, just as reported in the Second Book of Kings [2 Kings 17:24-34]? Bullinger recognizes the dangerous times: The Antichrist is trying to bring about the end times through cunning, compromises, wars, and betrayal. Blessed are those who follow only Christ and the Gospel and do not pay attention to this filth of humanity. They can count on the Redeemer Christ, who says: "In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart and be confident. I have overcome the world" [John 16:33]. "He who endures to the end will be saved" [Matthew 10:22].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">Greetings, also to the Basel pastors. Myconius should tell Johannes Gast about the brawl of the boys on the ice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">Greetings from Rudolf Gwalther, Johannes Haller, Theodor Bibliander, Pellikan, and the others.</p>

      <p>S. You speak the truth, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, you are writing for the third time. I have not responded to those letters and have remained silent for at least two months. However, there is no reason for you to suspect that there is something in you that displeases me or that I am silent out of stubbornness. The tasks, which increase more and more each day, distress, oppress, and overwhelm me: Ecclesiastical, public, scholastic, private, or economic matters exhaust me to the point that, when messengers occasionally present themselves, I cannot write, but only entrust them with verbal greetings. Moreover, during this entire time, I have had nothing singular to report that would be of great interest to you and that I did not assume you already knew. Thus, my silence is sufficiently excused.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will not respond to each of your letters in order. I will only address the most recent ones. They seem to contain and renew all the important matters from the others as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The people from the cantons are currently very friendly among us. Our people travel to them in Uri, Schwyz, and Zug. They find nothing but a very good will to protect the common fatherland, regardless of each person's faith. I myself was in Kappel a month ago. I spoke with the people of Zug about various matters. Captain Erb from Uri, Troger, and a company from Uri were here in Zurich. I did not hear of any discord, except that among themselves they have some influential men (though in very small numbers) who are suspected of being somewhat pro-imperial, and they are also publicly trusted, should anything arise from the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Some communities have arranged that the decisions of the Diets should be made entirely before the assemblies, so that few people cannot decide what they think is good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Jost von Meggen, the former governor of Baden, will soon set out with 200 or 300 soldiers, of whom he is the captain, to the papal guard in Rome (in the devil's name). For the Pope is very afraid of the Emperor. He intends to oppose the Emperor, etc. He has publicly written to my lords (von Meggen), asking if my lords would also allow him to recruit some soldiers. My lords have replied: No, they want to let princes and lords go idle and remain by their good, honest statutes. But from this, you can well see how pro-imperial the people of Lucerne are, who let this happen publicly! If it were up to Fleckenstein, it would not happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>At the Diet in Baden, it is not as you think, that the envoys looked at each other unfavorably. There are captains who want to divide the Swiss. They will fail, God willing. I have understood from our people that they are remarkably united and that there is no discord among them in any matters. Except that they do not all understand each other regarding Mötteli, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Pope's envoy has submitted a lengthy proposal, which has been included in the resolution. You can learn about this from your people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The beast maintains its old ways and excludes with meretricious manners the one it once loved, and receives the one it had previously expelled. It loves or pretends to love those who either satisfy its lust or help to satisfy it, who solidify its seat. It can no longer love the Emperor, not because it wishes ill to the papacy, but because it wishes ill to the brothel and dung heap Farnese. It desires another subject. Therefore, heaven and earth must be mixed. All great villains, whom God will find. Perhaps the robbers conspire in this way, if they can divide Switzerland into different factions. However, this can be persuaded to only a few. Perhaps today God also commits Biberius Meron to Sejanus in vengeance for the blood of the saints.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The French envoys are not satisfied with the unfounded demands of the captains. However, it is also settled. They are even less satisfied that the imperial envoys are being detained in Lucerne, thinking they should be sent away. It will come up again on the day of Letare.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The imperial envoys would like to have a helpful alliance with the House of Milan. It is thought that nothing will come of it, but (if he wishes) a neighborly capitulation. This has also come to a decision. Uri has submitted a very good national admonition, for all lords and princes to go idle. We like it very much here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Here is Cardinal de Guise, the first of the French, Bishop of Rouen, who traveled from Italy to France. He sent for me to come to him at the inn. And since it was not possible for me (as it was late on a Saturday, now 14 days ago), Pellicanus went. They debated about the intercession of the saints and such outdated rubbish. And as it was understood from his child, the council in Bologna and Trent is over. To arms, to arms! Perhaps all these rumors are deceitful. But I know well that they must leave God and his truth. The Frenchman is a persecutor just like his father! Whoever trusts him, trusts the Emperor. Therefore, it is wise to rely on God alone and let all princes and lords go idle. The Confederation was established without the princes and against the princes! Without them, it will endure, through their actions it will be destroyed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Haller says, King Maximilian does not like to go to mass, for which he is sometimes accused by his tutor. Once, when he went to mass, the bear ran after him. And when he saw the candles on the altar (as he is very averse to the fire of the artillery), he jumped onto the altar, knocked down the candlesticks, and everything on the altar. The priest fled with the chalice, and the devotion turned into laughter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>When the Untersee was frozen, the boys from Hemmenhofen and Gaienhofen ran over the ice to Steckborn and Feldbach to play, and our boys also ran onto the ice and started their games with sleds and skates. When they came together, they pushed, fought, and quarreled, as naughty boys do. The boys from the other side of the lake challenged ours. And on January 22, the boys from the other side of the lake came with a drum, armed with sticks and clubs, about 30 in number. Ours, especially from Feldbach and the surrounding area, were about 13. When they saw the many, some said: We will retreat and gather more boys. But Vogt Maden's son from Glarus said: "No, we are enough. In Bemund there are not many either. Our Lord God can help us well. We are on our own and have done them no harm." They then made a plan to lay boards over the ice where it was not yet frozen, to cross over and, when the boys from the other side of the lake came at them, to retreat over the bridge and beat them here. This happened, and they beat each other badly. The others screamed "cow mouths," but they fled. One of theirs was killed, the others badly beaten. Ours were also badly beaten. And it is a matter that would have been better avoided. I write this to you as it is said here and as it was written to me from Constance. It is likely that it happened just so. The bailiff is said to have inspected the lake and found that it happened on our side. Perhaps there will be a justification. I fear it is an omen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Constance has no answer, as they hoped from the Emperor. It is thought he will take them or force them to submit freely to his mercy and disgrace. For if he takes them, so that they remain lord and master, take no servants, as their desire is, and he then wants the pass against the Confederates, he gives reason for the Confederates to step in at Constance. If they do not give him the pass, he can achieve less. But if he has Constance, he can place few horses in it, and if the Confederates then want to help the Pope, Venetians, and French and draw them in, he begins to rig from Constance, so that he keeps the Confederates at home, and yet does not have to wage open war against them. If he wants and can, it will not be necessary. Thus the situation stands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I think I have now sufficiently filled in with these writings what I have neglected until now.</p>
    </div>

      <p>It is assumed that the Emperor will wage war on the maritime and Pomeranian cities, then move into Denmark to restore the expelled Christian.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, he will prepare everything to also restore Savoy.</p>

      <p>I believe he is planning something entirely different, especially since he is now trying to create a mixture of religions through his mediators. What if such a composition resulted in a Samaritan religion or superstition, which worships God and does not contradict the word of God, but nevertheless retains various gods and cults, as indicated in the 4th book of Kings. I see that these are the end times and the Antichrist is trying to attempt the end with arts, composition, wars, betrayals. Blessed are those who adhere solely to Christ and his gospel and despise these human filths; they will be secure in the world's redeemer Christ, who said: "In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart and be confident: I have overcome the world." "He who endures to the end will be saved."</p>
