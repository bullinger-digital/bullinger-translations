      <p>Greetings. I received your letters and those you directed to Calvin, I took care of them and I thank you greatly for both of your booklets sent to me. In return, I am sending the translation of what Vergerius published in Latin about fleeing the Council of Trent. He wanted me to translate it so that the Germans could also understand it; therefore, I complied. You can give it to any of your friends who do not understand Latin. However, since no other writing material comes to mind at the moment and I have nothing new, I wanted to send you this little book of mine, in which I have collected some sacred prayers from the Psalms, so that I would not be idle, for you to inspect and to let me know your judgment on it. I collected it last year when I was free from consistory business and I had collected it for my private use, so that I could speak with the Lord God using the words of the Lord God himself. However, the brothers who saw it with me wanted it to be published, and since I certainly recognized not a small amount of its fruit with me, I hoped it could also be of use and consolation to other simple Christians, especially in this most afflicted age. No one will be able to blame the material; they are nothing but words of scripture collected here and there from the book of Psalms and adapted to various situations. In order, something may easily be desired. Therefore, I wanted you to inspect it first, and if it seemed to you not unworthy of publication, I would commit it to the press. So that the order does not disturb, you will observe the register placed at the end, according to which I thought all those should be divided into 3 books, one containing prayers, another containing consolations, and the third containing praises and thanksgivings. I will be able to give the reason for this order and also of other [...] which I have followed here, through a preface.</p>
      <p>You will easily see with what zeal and labor I have collected these, you will see what the marginal number means, from which Psalm each verse is taken. Therefore, do not disdain, I beg you, to inspect and freely judge, criticize, change, delete what seems to you. I know you are occupied with other things; but since the work is of a few hours, I beg you to devote yourself to me, and if it seemed worthy of being published, I would like it to be printed in Zürich either at Froschauer or Wißenbach; Apiarius strongly asks that I give it to him to print; but since, as he himself is sordid, so he also has unclear letters and types, I would prefer it to be printed there. I did not want to add the title and preface until I know your judgment on it.</p>
      <p>It could be of use to both the Papists and our people, since it contains nothing but pure words of scripture; it could strengthen ours and attract them to true piety. But I will say nothing about this; if there is to be any use of it in the church, you will easily recognize it from inspection. Nor will anyone be able to object that we are tearing apart the scriptures, since this is their solid and unique use, to apply and accommodate them to our needs. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet from me and mine. Musculus and the others greet you. Bern, November 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and compatriot, to be uniquely honored. Zürich.</p>
      <p>"Received November 16."</p>
