      <p>Greetings. The cessation of our actions in the case against the bishop was somewhat suspicious to me, as well as to the best of us; but this delay was corrected not by some chance, but by divine providence, which has so far kindly looked upon us and always turned our greatest efforts for the better. Now is not the time to say with which monsters we had to contend.</p>
      <p>The assemblies are imminent, in which magistrates in Valtellina are placed quite profitably; but as each one has most eagerly sought these magistrates, so they have particularly opposed us.</p>
      <p>For until now, many have observed the bishop in this regard because they sought his votes; but now, finally, after many labors and even the greatest expenses, the matter has been brought to a point that the bishop would never have believed possible. But I too, when I saw the laziness of many, was forced to despair of the whole matter. If only we had found foreigners unfaithful, and not also our own people.</p>
      <p>If, therefore, you wish to know how far the matter has progressed, know this: On the 10th day of January of this current year 1561, the following envoys appeared here in Chur with full authority from their communities (who previously gave sealed departures to ours here as they rode around), namely two from the Bergell of Lower and Upper Port, one of whom is Junker Baptista von Salis (for this happened in the morning, as they rode to Baden in the afternoon), four from the Törfers, two from Tumlesch of Fürstnau, two from Buschlau, three from the Münster Valley, two from Avers and Stallen, and also the envoys from Oberfatz.</p>
      <p>These, on the aforementioned day, sat with our gracious lords, both mayors, both city bailiffs, along with the senior guild master and city judge, having united completely unanimously and sworn together (all of this later documented and sealed) regarding the following points and articles, to handle and ensure they are handled, etc.: Firstly, that the bishop's lawyers and officials shall never again sit in councils and assemblies, etc. Secondly, that the next or most recent church assembly, irregularly convened by the bishop, shall be null, void, and dead; also, that henceforth a common church assembly shall appoint a steward every two years. Furthermore, a common church assembly shall henceforth appoint a captain at Fürstenburg and a bailiff at Ramosch at the castle Steinsberg. Also, the bishop shall be obliged to give an account to the church assembly or the commissioner appointed by it, from the first year of his administration to the last moment, and thereafter every two years an account shall be taken from him. These articles, though with other and more words (for the departure has not yet been able to reach me; I write this only as I have heard from the lord mayor and other lords), these communities have bound themselves together and promised each other with hand and mouth to stand together with life and property. If you ask whether it is now at an end and thus settled, know that it has only just begun; for in the church assembly there are other communities that depend on the bishop. However, we now have the majority and hope that others will stand with us. A great resistance is expected; but since the matter has been taken in hand with such great seriousness, a change must occur. If these articles could be maintained, a bishop in Chur would no longer have such great power, nor would those from the great families be so eager for it. However, much will depend on how the Glarus affair ends.</p>
      <p>Now you hear how far the matter has progressed. If I were with you for half an hour, you would hear wonders.</p>
      <p>For a long time, it was balanced on the scales. You would have heard wonders.</p>
      <p>They already began to articulate against me, and as the two leagues laid into each other so fiercely and the city stood in concern for its freedom, on which the clerical servants relied, God willed it so, to whom I attribute it alone, who also revealed it to me especially and unexpectedly, as now our councils have acted in such a way that they did not know where to go, I proposed a plan, which was read before small and large councils, unanimously accepted, through which ours came out of all concerns, the other envoys from the two leagues were caught in their plan and were not well received at home by their communities. Those from the courts have since promised that they will no longer take up the cause of the priest. If they keep their promise, it will be well; yet I hope they will do it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, honorable lord and father, you can partly understand in what concerns we stood. In all this, the best thing was that neither Dr. Philippus, my colleague, nor I were ever frightened; for we knew well that if the common man rightly understood the matter, it would not be necessary. Dominus Philippus stood honestly; but they, the bishop's people, did not complain as much about him as about me, although he spoke much more coarsely from the pulpit than I did; you will hear the reason another time, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, now a burden is off my neck, let it go as it will, now it concerns the majority of the communities, and no blame can be given to us anymore. These aforementioned envoys have otherwise taken further instructions to bring to their communities: 1. Whether those who are bound by oath to foreign lords should be sent to assemblies and used in the land councils. This concerns the d. d., namely the lords of Rozins, who are now envoys to Baden, who are the greatest enemies of religion and the pontiff N., otherwise appointed by the Roman emperor. 2. That a proper investigation should be made regarding those who buy offices, to punish them henceforth in life, honor, and property, according to the nature of the cases.</p>
      <p>These two points, these envoys are in agreement; but they have not received any instructions from their communities to act on them, so they have taken it in departure to bring it back. How it stands with d. Beccaria, you will understand from this enclosed letter, which you will kindly send back to me. As soon as the letter reached us, which happened on the 11th of January, the church assembly was still fortunately gathered together, so Dr. Philippus and I turned to it and revealed the whole matter to them with a humble request that they would kindly remember the matter at the next assembly day, to which we received a friendly response. Therefore, it will be very important that you, for the good of the matter, urge your and my gracious lords of the city of Zurich, by the current council envoys to Baden, in their return, in the manner and measure as you know. For if your senate also seriously intercedes, I hope we will achieve something; but that one of Rozins d. d. is ill-disposed towards this cause; but one must not pay attention to him, etc.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
