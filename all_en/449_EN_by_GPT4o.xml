      <p>ALTHOUGH I had no doubt about your benevolence towards me, knowing that you were constant and firm in all matters, especially in maintaining friendships; yet know that your letters were most delightful to me, especially as you thought it necessary to assure me of your perpetual love for me: for wherever I turn, the traces of your love for me appear expressed in the gentlest and most loving words, so that I think no letters could have been more numerous or illustrious. However, as I now first respond to them, do not think it was done out of negligence or forgetfulness of your merits towards me; but partly because three days before I received your letters, I had written most copiously about almost all matters which I thought it was in your interest to know; and partly because I was not unaware that D. Treherne, a man altogether most excellent in every kind of literature, and endowed with incredible integrity and constancy of mind, had sent you the council of this [Greek]. Therefore, I wish you to excuse me for your humanity and usual benevolence.</p>
      <p>Now I come to your letter. It is certain that the Queen of Scotland has been carried off by her own people to France: but know that what the French boast of their glory and the proclamation of their virtues, and sing that 2000 Englishmen were overthrown by their arms, is the greatest and most impudent lie and most unworthy of France; for it is clearly known that no more than 200 soldiers perished. But to understand briefly what has been renewed in Scotland by the English, take this. These are the castles, fortresses, islands, promontories, and towns that have been captured by the English by war and deceit: Gedworth, Kelsey, Rukensburon, Hum, a fortress most fortified by nature and location, which the Scots again recovered by deceit and treachery; undoubtedly, however, due to the long and protracted siege and lack of provisions, they will be forced to surrender to the English.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, while they are held besieged in iron and fear by the English at Burtenkrag, Dundi, Duglass, the islands of Saint Comisi, from Arwick, a castle surrounded by English walls and ports, all the way to Edinburgh, the metropolis of all Scotland, everything has been captured and handed over to English power. Last year, on the Ides of October, the Scots with a French army, a great multitude of men, besieged a town named Hedington, most vehemently attacked by the English and scarcely fortified by them, very violently, in which siege 4000 Scots and French were cruelly and harshly slaughtered and killed. You can safely believe this for certain and without any doubt.</p>
      <p>As for the religion they have spread, namely that there is a great dissimilarity of minds, we do not deny that it was very great; but now by the grace of God, we assert that the minds of all good men are established in peace and agreement. For the cause of these discords existing in this council has now been removed, [Greek] have been relegated. I would write to you here what was done and established about the supper of Jesus Christ, if D.</p>
      <p>Treherne, a most excellent man and most loving of you, had not already narrated it to you in detail: therefore, from him, you will learn the details more subtly, these few things from me summarily. The Archbishop of Canterbury, a man endowed with singular virtue and learning, spoke about this matter beyond all men's expectations, learnedly, rightly, orderly, and clearly, and easily brought all listeners to our opinion by the weight of his virtue, the force of his words, and the majesty of his sentences. [Greek] he had the Bishop of Worcester, Cerberus [Greek] and several others, [Greek], knowing nothing but certain quiddities, and those vain and false.</p>
      <p>Peter Martyr, on this very day on which I give you these letters, publicly proposed to us all what he thought about this opinion, and was seen by all not to dissent from your opinion even by a hair's breadth; indeed, he defended and protected Zwingli, a most courageous man, with the testimony of his voice against adversaries falsely objecting bare signs; moreover, he says that all those who make the body of Christ [Greek], and other things of that kind, are delirious: the rest you will learn from the courier himself.</p>
      <p>This one thing remains, of which I want you to be a part; that by the work and zeal of Cox, a most humane man, I was admitted and received into the King's College on the Calends of January. Furthermore, to this way of my life is added the highest munificence of the Prince of Dorset, a man endowed with singular humanity and prudence, who at the very first meeting ordered eight crowns to be counted out to me, and has faithfully promised to give me an equally large or larger sum of money every year: how this happened by a miraculous or rather divine chance cannot be explained in words at present: I only ask you to give singular thanks to Almighty God in my name, which I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to do. The last thing will be that you also signify immortal thanks to D. Cox, the King's instructor, on my behalf through your letters, for extending his faith to me so promptly and openly. Therefore, ask him, since he has of his own accord received me into his faith and friendship, if not for the sake of our studious life, at least for the sake of his own plain constancy, to persevere in that inclination and will to love me.</p>
      <p>For I will ensure that no zeal or duty in cultivating the greatness of both of you is ever required of me: indeed, I will certainly give my effort, so that no one may justly desire it from me at any time, and that in the best and most perpetual way. Farewell, most learned man, and have this Englishman diligently commended to you for your usual humanity. Farewell again and again. 1549, March 2.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you, Joh. VON ULM</p>
      <p>To the man of utmost piety, endowed with the knowledge of the best arts, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Zurichers, his esteemed teacher. To be delivered to Zurich.</p>
