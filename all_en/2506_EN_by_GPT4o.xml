      <p>With friendly greetings and willing service, and whatever I can do, dear and good, at any time, especially to you, gracious and well-learned sir. I have received your recently sent letter and understood its contents well, namely concerning the students from my gracious lords. I am displeased with their excessive behavior and unnecessary actions, and when they were with me, I scolded them severely and told them what needed to be said. Regarding the rumors that have been encountered by some, I have said nothing about it, considering it to be trivial talk that should not be followed, and I have indicated to them not to make anything of such matters; for such talk could not bring much good. Be assured that no one is accused because of such talk. Therefore, my friendly request to you and to all schoolmasters is that you do not let these boys pay for their youth and foolishness, but rather protect them, as I trust you will do, for I do not believe they will offend anyone. I have spoken to them in such a way that if anything should happen to them, from whomever it may be, they should report it to you, trusting that you will create peace and quiet for them, so that they are well satisfied. I am thus hopeful that they will act accordingly, and if they do not, I know well that my gracious lords will not be pleased with them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as you have written to me concerning the Lucerne affair, I cannot do otherwise than to entrust it to God and all understanding Christians, without helping or hindering either side. I had indeed thought it would remain as it was when I, as a stranger, was with you and took my leave, but it could not remain so; I must commend it to God, who will have mercy on the poor people. Then, gracious sir, since my gracious lord, my uncle Dangel, has appointed me to a position in Bruges as a provost, he has informed me that you have shown him much kindness. For this, I thank you on his behalf for all the good deeds you have shown him; if I could repay you and others who have done him good, I would not spare any effort.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to the protection of Almighty God, wishing to greet Mr. Walthart and all other brothers in Christ. Given on Wednesday, the 19th day of December in the year 1554. Your always willing servant,</p>
      <p>Vincentz Pfister, steward at Königsfelden. To the well-learned, pious, prudent, and wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zürich, my dear and honored lord.</p>
