      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on December 8th, in which you mention what many are saying about the Valley of Angrogna, which the Duke of Savoy wants to invade, and that soldiers are being gathered in some places. But the source is uncertain.</p>
      <p>They also report that a port in Corsica has been captured by the Turks; I am waiting for more certain information, as well as about the news from Lyon, where many have written to me that the king is dead, although I received letters from him at the end of December. The Lord knows what is best for His people and by what means He wishes to assist His church.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters at any moment; I will inform you of what I learn. Farewell; greet all friends and keep us in your affection.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 11th.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
