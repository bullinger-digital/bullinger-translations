      <p>Greetings. I commend this young man to you as much as I can. He was a priest in Ensisheim, came to Seckingen, and married an abbess; therefore, he is expelled, while she is detained in the monastery guarded by four men. She has brothers who are almost driven mad against the poor woman. Meanwhile, the young man came here and was enrolled in the academy, but I don't know what he intends, he fears for himself. Indeed, I have worked somewhat on his behalf with the consul, where I certainly soon learned that he was reported to the magistrate in such a way that he was not considered fair. It seemed, therefore, that he should leave for a time, so that in the meantime, if the anger subsides, he might find a more convenient place here to excuse himself; for he offers no other reason for his departure, nor is he alone, but also his relative, a goldsmith from Mulhouse, who came to me on behalf of the young man, to see if there could be any way to help him. You will hear the rest from him; I commend him to you so that he may not have to fall back into papacy, provided he wishes to be good.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I was delighted beyond words by your latest letters. I have also spoken with the consul, who will act as an envoy on behalf of our senate; I found him to be such that I very much hope for a harmonious response. As for the confederates, regarding the middle article, I have some foreboding; it is clear that both the leaders and the common people are so incensed against us by the Five Cantons that they could not be more so. The reason is that they are convinced we assert that we will remain in our faith against the council, the Emperor, the confederates, and all, and would rather lose our lives than this religion.</p>
      <p>What I say is true, so we may see what kind of spirit it is that knows nothing of the word of God; it would not be surprising if they were to break the alliance made with us. Good God, how ignorant people are of both God and all that is honest. They say the Emperor is again dangerously ill. I am of the opinion that, after he recovers from his feigned illness, new afflictions will arise. For so it has happened thus far; unless the Lord alone looks upon us, it is over.</p>
      <p>Ten days ago, the Bishop of Strasbourg sent his senate to the people of Strasbourg in the name of the Emperor and the metropolitan; he simply acted on receiving the Interim.</p>
      <p>The envoys received a response that made them leave indignantly. Farewell in the Lord with all the brothers, and, as much as you can through the Lord, keep the young man commended.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, December 8, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
