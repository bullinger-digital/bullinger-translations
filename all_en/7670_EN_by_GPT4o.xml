      <p>Greetings. The news I received from Geneva, I recently sent. Meanwhile, they write more, that Cond√© has taken a certain fortified place not far from Bordeaux and also holds Limoges. They also mention Brussels being captured by Orange, but they do not affirm it for certain. The people of Basel and Strasbourg have sent many and various letters to us, which they received from here and there.</p>
      <p>When I was given a copy of these, I noted down on this sheet what was most important. You may also show it to my brother, if you please.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing now, except that I pray to God to keep you safe. Our consuls and treasurers, the Zehenders, my father-in-law, mother, and wife greet you. Greet all yours also in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th of November, 1568.</p>
      <p>This slipped my mind, what I wrote about Anguissola in my brother's letters; there you will find what he also did here and by what deceit (for our people interpret it no other way) he acted.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>[To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest father-in-law.]</p>
