      <p>Greetings. I received from you, brother, the previous letters dated November 23rd, along with the proceedings completed with Gantner, which I return enclosed and thank you for. Above all, I thank God, who has brought this deceitful man into the light, so that the most honorable magistrate, if he wishes to see, can see what kind of person he is and what to expect from him. I pray to the Lord to cast out this most corrupt man, so that he does not bring harm to the church of God. For I constantly fear that, due to the inconsistency and slipperiness of these associates, he might insinuate himself again under false pretenses, with lying promises and contagious simulation, and find people who would persuade others to tolerate him. May the Lord be with His church!</p>
      <p>I now receive the later letters dated the last of November and some new things from Lentulus, as well as some additions to the previous ones, for all of which I give the greatest thanks I can. At present, I have nothing certain to repay. There are various rumors. I am ashamed to recount things so contradictory and diverse. I understand that letters from your magistrate were sent to the Bishop of Como regarding political jurisdiction and tithes; however, there is another ecclesiastical matter, of which I see nothing being restored to the bishop.</p>
      <p>Such a concession would lead to the overthrow of the church, as that good man writes, whose letter you send, which I am now beginning to read, etc. Nor do I doubt that Borromeo, the Bishop of Como, and all that dregs would very much like to be restored in full. As for the monks, everyone should strive to ensure that those troublemakers and seducers are not received.</p>
      <p>There are many good men in the magistrate who understand that the swarms of monks are a plague to the republic and the church; these men should be encouraged and urged to do their duty. That Rhaetian envoy of the king, while passing through here, sent an interpreter to invite me to dinner, wishing, as he said, to establish my friendship and familiarity. However, I thanked him and indicated that I would not come.</p>
      <p>But for several days I have not left the house due to the weakness and pain in my head, which I feel too much in my left hip. I only enter the temple, otherwise, I remain hidden at home. Old age weighs me down, and my strength, weakened, indeed broken by constant labors, fails me; so wills the Lord, whose will is good and salutary.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally with your household and friends and our brothers, whom you will greet individually in order. December 4, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
