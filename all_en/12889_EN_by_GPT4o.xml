    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In Bullinger's letter [not received], it was stated that Enzinas should return [Bullinger's] writing [„De sacramentis“] within 14 days. Enzinas received this letter eight days ago. Now he has the writing ready for return, but no reliable messenger has yet been found.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Only Enzinas has read the writing and compared it with the treatise by Simon Grynaeus [„De coena domini Simonis Grynaei dictata in cap. XI. 1.Cor.“]. Here now, in all brevity and openness, is his opinion on it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The notes of Grynaeus testify to a sharp and philosophically trained mind, however, his line of thought is complicated and consequently unclear. Perhaps this is due to Grynaeus' nature, who was unable to present difficult, contentious questions in a clear manner, or perhaps it is due to the subject itself, which is so subtle that it does not tolerate explanation. Possibly Grynaeus also wanted to reconcile the conflicting parties [among the Protestants], which leads to ambiguous or inappropriate statements among the scholars, causing only confusion. For even if one may grasp the syntax of their statements, one does not yet understand their meaning, and this only creates even greater problems.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The writing [„De sacramentis“] is quite different. In it, Bullinger formulates his concerns clearly, and one reads what is meant. However, Enzinas does not presume to act as an arbitrator in this difficult controversy. He also does not feel called to settle such a long-standing dispute, which even the most learned have not been able to appease. He believes, however, that those who advocate the omnipresence (πανταχουσίαν) of the body of Christ corner themselves because they assert things that are not only absurd but also contradict each other. There is hardly anything more absurd than the notion that body and spirit are the same! It is equally contradictory to say that Christ is present with the body, and immediately after, that he is spiritually present! And those who claim that the body comes down from heaven again, or that the Son of God has a body as intangible or arbitrary as air, and thereby deny that he is like us in everything (except, of course, in sin), as the scripture itself testifies, they thereby deprive us of the greatest hope and become slanderers. They could not clear themselves of the accusation of being blasphemous!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enzinas will advise [Katharina, née Lompart], the widow of Grynaeus, to keep the writing with her and not to publish it at this time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Regarding the elderly exile [Bernardino Ochino], Enzinas awaits the decision of the Zurich authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He is also waiting for the response from the printer [Christoph Froschauer] regarding the desired paper. He would like to know how much and when Froschauer can deliver. If he already needs the money, Enzinas is ready to send it to him upon request. Bullinger should provide more details.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Enzinas has gently explained to Francesco Stancaro what Bullinger instructed him to convey. Stancaro gratefully accepts Bullinger's efforts alone, as if he had actually helped him to a position.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. D. You granted me a period of fourteen days in your letter to return the writings; but behold, it is now the eighth day since I received your letter, and I have the writings ready and am only waiting for a messenger who will faithfully deliver them to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I alone have seen and read them, and I have also compared them with the writings of Grynaeus. I will briefly and candidly tell you what I think of both and how I was affected by reading each.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In the notes (Aufzeichnungen) of Grynaeus, I observe the thoughts of a very sharp and well-trained mind in philosophical discipline; but I see these very matters shaded by obscure and difficult language, whether this is due to a flaw of nature, which did not seem equally apt for explaining difficult controversies in clear language, or because the matters themselves, which are so subtle, thin, and refined, do not admit the clarity of expression. Perhaps there is also the effort to reconcile dissenting parties, which often deceives even the most learned men, so that they sometimes express ambiguous opinions or less appropriate words. Hence the obscurity in the speech is so great that you can hardly hunt for the meaning of the writing. Then, when you have grasped the author's meaning from the significance of the words and the context of the speech, even greater difficulty arises in weighing the opinion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In your writing, however, you indeed say clearly what you mean, and I read plainly what I understand. However, I do not presume, most learned Bullinger, to wish to interpose myself as a judge and arbiter in this very serious controversy, nor am I one who hopes to reconcile what the most learned men have not been able to do for a long time, as I am in no way comparable to others. Those who wish to establish the omnipresence (πανταχουσίαν) of the body are, in my judgment, reduced to such straits that they not only affirm an absurd thing but are also clearly refuted by speaking contradictions to themselves. For what is more absurd than to contend that body and spirit are the same thing? What is more contradictory than to confess that what you just admitted to be a body is immediately after affirmed to be something spiritual? Again, those who attribute to the Son of God flesh that has descended from heaven, whether airy or fantastic, or deny that it was in all respects like ours except for sin, as the scripture testifies, not only deprive us of the best part of our consolation but are not free from the charge of slander and cannot be acquitted of the crime of sacrilege in the judgment of those who think rightly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I will indeed advise the woman to keep the writing with her and not allow it to come to light at this time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Regarding the migration of our excellent old man, I await a response from the governors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I also await the response from the printer regarding the paper I requested from him; for I wish to know for certain how much and when he can provide it, and if money is needed, I will send it when he requests. I wish to learn something certain about this matter from your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have informed Stancaro with moderate words of what you wanted to be indicated to him; he gives you great thanks for your labor and did not take your intention otherwise than if you had procured for him the most ample condition.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell with your whole church.</p>
      <p>Basel, 7th day of March 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
