      <p>In the year 50, on the 26th of September, from Cologne.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I could not respond through Mr. Froschauer from the fair due to my occupations.</p>
      <p>I took care of sending the letters to England along with others entrusted by Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Florian was in Heidelberg 8 months ago; where he went afterwards, we do not know; he deceived many pious people. I give your lordship immense thanks for the effort undertaken for Mr. Hooper; I do not doubt that he will do and take care of everything in your name. I myself am preparing to depart as soon as possible. Our senior archbishop of the Church of Zurich commends himself to you and your prayers, as you will understand from these letters to you; if only it were possible for you to visit him; he gives thanks for your book.</p>
      <p>I conveyed your greetings to Mr. Caesarius. He resides in Cologne near the Widenbachs, close to St. Pantaleon, and is now completely deaf; he could not write, but at the first opportunity, he will send some poems to you. Your commentaries on the New Testament are read to him daily; he prays for all joy for you and all the learned. Caesar is acting more mildly in Brabant. What good the Queen of Hungary, who has gone to the Emperor to mitigate the Spanish Inquisition, will bring, we do not yet know; we hope for better things.</p>
      <p>I will take care of sending the letters to Friesland. I expect booksellers from Groningen and Emden at any moment; I will entrust them. I received the wooden box and letters of Mr. Rudolf Gwalther; I added them to my things sent to England; I offer him my service. Mr. Gesner gave the letters to be read to Mr. Echtio and Mr. Bernard; both will stand for the sent items. Mr. Hermann Petri read Calvin's book "On Avoiding Superstitions" with the utmost diligence; he gives you the highest thanks. I had instructed my servant to deliver new books to Froschauer for Mr. Gesner; which I found out was not done.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all whom you know to be my friends. I will write more extensively shortly.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Birckmann the Elder.</p>
      <p>I do not write to Mr. Froschauer; I wish he would take care to print the Bible of the two translations and the Psalter of Leo Jud. One volume of your Decades is missing, which I wish to be printed. Furthermore, your work against the Anabaptists and Mr. Zwingli's Passion and the Catechism of Leo Jud are eagerly awaited. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of Zurich, to the most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
