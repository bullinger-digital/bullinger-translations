      <p>Greetings. I know that pious and studious people are always commended to your humanity, my esteemed lord and brother, and most beloved to me. However, because many vagabonds often deceive good men by posing as scholars when they are actually scoundrels, I wanted to give this Mr. Gerhard Frisius a faithful testimony, so that he is not counted among the vagabonds. He is born of an honorable place and noble family, a Frisian by nation. He came to us in Zurich for the sake of piety and letters. He stayed in the house of Mr. Pellikan. He is pious and learned. However, before returning home and to his homeland, he wished to see you and your church and city. He is wealthy.</p>
      <p>He does not need support. Therefore, I beseech you to receive him as he is worthy. By this, you will do something worthy of yourself and most pleasing to me; for he is greatly loved by all of us because of his piety, candor, and learning.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell!</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 16, 1545.</p>
      <p>I received the letters of Mr. Laetus attached to yours and I thank you. I replied to Mr. Laetus and Mr. Welser. A certain messenger of our city carried the letters to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, minister of the church of Constance, his dearest brother. Constance.</p>
