    <p xml:id="regest1">The entire Schwenckfeld affair is now resolved. - The Brunswick War is over, as the fortress [Rietberg] has now surrendered. After his victory [over Duke Henry of Brunswick], Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] hurried to the fortress and demanded its surrender, building ramparts and bringing in artillery. In the absence of the lord of the castle [Count Otto IV of Rietberg], the enemies requested three days to consider, but had to provide four significant men as hostages. As no submissive response was given, the Landgrave had the hostages brought before the castle and demanded surrender; otherwise, he would hang the hostages and take the castle by force. It eventually surrendered. Among the hostages was also (Bullinger should not laugh) Ruff von Reischach. The artillery was returned to Kassel, and the army was dismissed. Myconius knows nothing about the war agreements yet, as the Strasbourg warlords, who participated in all the consultations, have not yet returned. Before December 5th, the [Schmalkaldic] Bundestag is supposed to take place in Frankfurt. Allegedly, Ruff [von Reischach] has passed through Neuenburg [am Rhein] in recent days. - The Protestants have mediated between [King Francis I of] France and [King Henry VIII] of England, but [Charles V] has taken over the entire matter. He is expected by the people of Antwerp, where the French and English envoys are also supposed to arrive. - A Spanish bishop or cardinal [Pedro de Malvenda], sent by [Charles V] to Italy, traveled through [Basel]. His secretary [...] told [Johannes] Gast that Pope [Paul III], the King of France, and the Emperor had formed an alliance against the King of England; furthermore, the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] discussion is not to be taken seriously. Six of [Malvenda's] servants are imprisoned at Gösgen Castle in the Solothurn dominion because they mistreated two carters and nearly killed one of them. It is said that the Spaniards refused to pay the carriage fee. Matthias Held is said to have been reinstated at the [imperial] court. Shortly after Easter, he reportedly said he knew he would soon be in favor at court again and that [Nicolas Perrenot de] Granvelle would be removed from office. This prophecy, partially fulfilled, bodes ill for Granvelle. - Myconius wrote, if he remembers correctly, about the truce recently refused by the Turks. Now it is heard from Austria that it has been concluded for five years. If Bullinger has heard anything certain from Swabia about this, he should share it. [Charles V] is said to intend to free [Duke Henry of] Brunswick, with auxiliary troops from [Francis I] and [Paul III]. Additionally, according to the [Basel] council, 1500 Neapolitan riders, intended for Brunswick, have passed through Württemberg at the instigation of the Pope. Now they are heading to the Emperor. - What Bullinger wrote about the Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos] of Milan is unheard of! Myconius would like to know what is in the delivered letter. - The [Protestants] are deviating from their path! Myconius just declared [from the pulpit] that faith has cooled as never before in 14 years. How is it in [Zurich]? May Christ grant his Holy Spirit!</p>

      <p>S. Let us therefore send forth the entire Schwenckfeld affair; indeed, I enjoy good peace in Christ, the true God and true man.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the end of the Brunswick War is at hand. For that very fortified fortress has been surrendered with almost no trouble. The matter was conducted in this way: After the victory given by the Lord, the Landgrave, with all possible speed, hastened to the fortress due to the still trembling enemy and the very opportune time; for the fortress lies in marshes, and therefore is inaccessible, especially to cannons, in rainy and snowy weather.</p>
      <p>Therefore, after he arrived, he immediately demanded that they surrender, unless they wished to suffer more severe things. At the same time, he built ramparts and fortified the way for the artillery to be brought in.</p>
      <p>The lord of the fortress was absent, and the enemies did not trust their own affairs sufficiently. Therefore, they requested three days for consultation. Hessus indeed granted these, if they would give four hostages of not the least note. With these accepted, peace was negotiated during that time.</p>
      <p>Now the time elapsed, no somewhat peaceful response; therefore, Hessus moved the hostages with the executioners and the hangman, with nooses placed around their necks, closer to the fortress, unless they surrendered, these would be immediately hanged and the fortress taken by force.</p>
      <p>Among the hostages was Ruͦff de Rischach (do not laugh). Thus, they were compelled to surrender by the appearance of their own and the danger. Therefore, the fortress did not even feel a blow from the artillery, and it was surrendered! The artillery was brought back to Kassel from the journey, the army dismissed. I have not yet learned about the conditions, as the Strasbourg leaders, who were present at all the councils, have not yet returned. The assembly for the entire Schmalkaldic League has been announced for Frankfurt on the day before the Nones of December. I have someone who says that Ruͦff passed through Neuenburg in recent days with a white staff, otherwise almost naked. Thus far about the Brunswick War.</p>
      <p>The Protestants had intervened between the French and the English and had begun to hope well; but the emperor has achieved so much that, with them rejected, he has taken the entire matter upon himself, as I hear: Entirely Spanish! He is expected by the people of Antwerp, where the French and English envoys are also said to be arriving.</p>
      <p>A Spaniard passed through here. I do not know if he is a bishop or a cardinal. He is great with the emperor, by whom he is also sent to Italy. His secretary said to Gast that the pope, the French, and the emperor have entered into a league against the English. Six of his servants are held captive in the fortress of Gösken in the Solothurn dominion, because they treated two carters very badly; for one was almost beaten to death. It is said that the Spaniards refused to pay the carriage fee, etc. The same secretary said that the Regensburg colloquy is mere nonsense; which I indeed easily believe, for I neither favor nor trust the Spanish character. It is said that Matthias Held has been received again at court. About whom I heard this, not long after the Easter feast, he said: "Indeed, I know that I will soon be most dear at court and Granvelle will be hanged." The prophecy is partially fulfilled; let Granvelle beware! Thus, they play in the courts of emperors and kings. May the evil one take them, so that peace may come, how much it would benefit the church of the Lord!</p>
      <p>If I remember correctly, I recently wrote that the Turks denied us a truce. Now it is reported from Austria that it has been made for the fifth year. If you have anything certain from Swabia, make sure to inform me. There is a rumor that the emperor intends to free the Brunswick, not only that, but together with the aid of the French and the pope. The same rumor carries that 1500 Neapolitan horsemen, stirred up by the pope, have passed through Württemberg in these days. The journey was to Brunswick, but they delayed on the way, and now they are heading straight to the emperor. This last is from the mysteries of our senate; therefore, I ask, if you have perhaps heard anything, report back.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about the Marquis of Milan, I have never heard in my life! Therefore, I am very surprised, what the entrusted letters contain.</p>
      <p>It is ours not to deviate from the begun journey in the Lord and to continually pray that the Lord may protect his church, and more and more to exhort the people to repentance. I do not know what you experience among yours. I cried out today, as much as I could, that the fear of the Lord has not been more lukewarm, indeed almost none, than today in our city. May Christ grant his Holy Spirit! So be it.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. On the Kalends of December, in Basel, in the year 1545. Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the best and most learned minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
