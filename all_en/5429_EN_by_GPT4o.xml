      <p>Greetings. Our consul has returned, asserting that nothing at all can be known about the council.</p>
      <p>In the company was a provost of this college, a papist, who claims that the abbot of Einsiedeln has returned home (about which I doubt, although he asserts it; you may know) and that this is evidence that nothing noteworthy is currently happening, especially since the abbot boasted that he would return there if church matters were resumed; for he departed under the condition that he would be recalled by them. Dietägius says (but he says many vain things, yet others also affirm this) that the Emperor is considering resigning the empire to his son and thinking of usurping for himself the house he built in Innsbruck for the Jesuits, following the example of his brother Charles, etc. Others say he is expected in Nuremberg, not Augsburg, and that due to the Frankfurt fairs, matters are somewhat delayed; for from there he will proceed to Frankfurt. These are the things being said; but I am beginning to believe nothing; for you know what Hercules wrote. Later, at the same time, all the merchants who came from Italy consistently affirmed the same; now there are those who deny the castle was captured, but say there is a quarrel and contention between the Ferrara and Florence over the borders towards Tuscany. It is written that in Bologna the citizens have rioted against the pope, whom they accused of tyranny. Please, write what the Pagici are planning; perhaps this is the reason why the Bernese do not want their people to advance further. I hear that French envoys have come to you, whether from Guise or indeed from Condé, I am uncertain.</p>
      <p>Condé is said to have distributed his troops in the castles and to be awaiting reinforcements.</p>
      <p>Please, free us from these doubts. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>On the day when the rest.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Consul Tscharner greets you respectfully.</p>
