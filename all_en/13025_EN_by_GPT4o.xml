    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger should communicate how the people of Chur should behave in light of the following two issues. First: The French King Henry II wants to renew the old mercenary alliance with the Grisons (as presumably also with the Confederates) that was agreed with his father Francis I. On August 15, the communities are to deliberate on this at the specially convened Diet in Chur and provide an answer. Bullinger can probably imagine what arguments will be made for or against it! Even good, peace-loving people are of the opinion that renewing the alliance would curb the power of Emperor Charles V.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Now to the second concern. [Niklaus Maggio], the Podestà of Traona, unexpectedly arrested the preacher [...] from Caspano after the sermon in July and unlawfully tortured him so severely that he was forced to confess to having helped destroy the crucifix in the church at night. Additionally, he imposed a fine of 140 crowns on him and banned him from staying in the Three Leagues. Consequently, the preacher went to Chiavenna, from where he was sent to Chur. The case was presented to the deputies at the recently held assembly. After confirming that the Podestà had not received orders from the deputies to treat the preacher in such a manner, he will now have to answer for his actions at the upcoming Diet. However, some people claim that the currently Zurich-studying [...] Paravicini from Caspano destroyed the idol. If Paravicini were to confess the act to the people of Zurich, he would be assisted through mediation. This would benefit everyone, especially the [innocent, wrongfully punished] preacher. Many idols have already been burned in Graubünden, but never has there been such an outcry. In a year and a half, a new Podestà will be appointed, which is favorable for settling the matter. So if Paravicini is the perpetrator, he should admit it without having to fear the slightest disadvantage (unlike that preacher). His response is awaited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Mayor Johannes Haab will probably report himself on the honor he received in Fideris. The country folk gave him an ox.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Should Bullinger have a concern, Blasius will take care of it immediately. Regards.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings and mercy from the Lord, etc. Dear brother, our earnest request is that you, if possible, provide us with guidance on the following two points, on how we should conduct ourselves in these matters, etc.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the King of France is seeking to renew the old alliance with the Grisons (and presumably also with the Confederates) that was made with his father years ago! On the 15th of August, a significant day will be held here in Chur for the communities to respond to this. You can probably imagine the arguments that will be made for and against it; indeed, even the well-meaning and peace-loving believe that this would curb the power of the Emperor, etc.</p>

      <p>Secondly, the Podestà of Traona unexpectedly arrested the preacher from Caspano after the sermon in July and unlawfully tortured him so severely that he was forced to confess to having helped destroy the crucifix in the church at night. After the confession, the Podestà judged him and fined him 140 crowns and banned him from the Three Leagues, etc. When he came to Chiavenna, they sent him to us in Chur. We brought this matter before the recently held assembly, hoping that our gracious lords had not given the Podestà the order to treat the preacher in such a manner. The Podestà is cited to the upcoming common assembly day to answer our complaint.</p>
      <p>Now, some well-meaning people think that Paravicini from Caspano, who is currently studying in Zurich, committed the act against the idol, which, if he confesses to you (as he is obliged), would be well resolved in the meantime, greatly helping the good brother and all of us. Many idols have been destroyed and burned in the Grisons; none has caused such an outcry. In a year and a half, another Podestà will come. The matter is already helped. If he did it, he can confess freely and without lesser disadvantage (than this brother). We desire a kind and Christian response from him, etc.</p>

      <p>What honor was shown to Mayor Johannes Haab by our people in Fideris, he will probably report himself. The country folk gave him an ox, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, 2nd of August, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Blasius.</p>

      <p>And if you ask anything of me, consider it done. Farewell.</p>
