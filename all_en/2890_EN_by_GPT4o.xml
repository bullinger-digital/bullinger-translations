      <p>James Spaler, about whom I wrote in the previous letter, unless it was intercepted or you did not receive it, has been freed from the tyranny of Caiaphas, and that without any fine except for paying five crowns for what they call fiscal sustenance. He sent a brief note with these words: "Margret, if you want your husband free, then send five crowns." Good God, those foolish blind ones openly admit the marriage of a good man, and why was he brought to prison? In MÃ¼lhausen, he is ill due to the filth of the prison and starvation; for he was sustained for almost half a year on bread and water. Shortly, I hope, we will receive him. Then we will hear from him what he has suffered from the ministers of Satan, etc. Farewell. April 11, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
