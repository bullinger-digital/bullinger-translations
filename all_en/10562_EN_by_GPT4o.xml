    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer defended the opinion that he, like Philipp [Melanchthon], drafted for [Ulrich] Chelius against the criticism of the people of Konstanz. They forgo a response, but Thomas Blarer travels to Ambrosius [Blarer] [in Tübingen] to negotiate with Bucer there. The opponents in Überlingen, including Ambrosius [Eigen] and others, are already mocking the fickleness [of the Protestants]; Bucer's concessions are not suitable for paving the way for the Gospel, but only lead to new discord. He requests the opinion that Bullinger gave to Chelius [No. 514] and promises to send Bucer's letter. He recommended the pastor [Johannes Ritter], who was expelled from Weinfelden and is staying with him, to Ambrosius [Blarer].</p>

      <p>Salvation through our King Christ.</p>
      <p>Bucer has already written back to us, my dearest Bullinger, and he absolutely insists on his opinion that he, together with Philipp, has given nothing contrary to the word of God. For we wrote to him that the advice given to Chelius is not at all approved by us. Now he not only affirms his position but also wants to know from us by what reasons it is not approved by us. However, to avoid providing material for future contention and tumult through writing and rewriting, we have decided - Thomas, brother Konrad, and some pious men - to simply not respond. For with a just code, we could not encompass how many evils we foresee arising from these counsels. Therefore, at our expense, our Thomas Blaurer, a man of exceptional faith, is traveling to Ambrosius. There he might find Bucer, with whom he will discuss our opinion clearly and extensively. If he does not find him, he will deal with Ambrosius, so that he may argue our case with Bucer in our name.</p>
      <p>The adversaries are already triumphing in Überlingen and everywhere; for they have the articles of Philipp and Bucer's counsels and accuse us of the utmost inconsistency, claiming it will soon get even better for us. Furthermore, Chelius himself also shared these counsels with Ambrosius, the captain of St. Gallen, whom I do not know. But I do know that after Chelius's departure, he spat many dire things against us, such as: that we have lied a lot, and we want to lie again, etc. Others say we are all scoundrels, as many of us as there are, etc. And what do you think will happen, my brother, when our people understand that we defer so much to the authority of the pope[!]? Also, that it is given to restore, however severe, what was healthily observed by the fathers, etc. Bucer boldly defends these things, a man so great in the kingdom of God, but we learn more and more not to trust in men. If charity is to be pursued on one hand, as it certainly is, it must be observed not to harm it on the other. Now, for uncertain hope and for the favor of some stiff-necked men, finally with unfair means, he consults in the pursuit of charity, not considering how many disturbances he is about to cause and how he will offend the consciences of the most elect with the worst suspicions. "Christ," says Bucer, "is not only ours but the King of the whole world; hence the interests of other nations must also be considered." And no one denies this. However, I would believe that our constancy will build us up more among any foreigners than such suspicious endeavors.</p>
      <p>We know by what order and means the Lord has promoted His gospel in almost all of Germany, so that you could swear it was promoted by no human counsels; through weakness, this mustard seed has grown. Now Satan devises another rule, just as he also devises another gospel. For the gospel of Christ, a certain security of the flesh is born. Instead of the way and means, a pact is devised with the unworthy, not to say enemies. But the outcome will prove how deadly these counsels have been. In the meantime, however, we must be careful not to bite each other for these reasons, and we must anxiously pray to the Lord that we do not commit anything unworthy of the gospel of Christ, nor that from one concord a hundred discords are born.</p>
      <p>I beg you to fulfill the promise of sending the advice given by you to this Chelius. I will also send to you what has been written back to us by Bucer.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>February 11, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>That almost slipped my mind: The parishioner from Weinfelden was expelled and barely escaped the hands of the officers. He is now with me until Ambrosius, to whom I have recommended this good man, writes back. I wish your people would come to their senses sometime!</p>
      <p>To the most pious man Heinrich Bullinger, who teaches Christ most sincerely in Zurich, the most esteemed brother.</p>
