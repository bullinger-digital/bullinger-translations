      <p>Greetings. The bundle of letters, which I thought you had already received, was delayed by the sworn Zurich messenger, Hoffacher. Although he was preparing to leave in the past few days and claimed to be ready for the journey, he was unexpectedly detained by the bishop; for nothing certain has been decided by the lords in the episcopal matter so far. This is what the bishop's brother, my godfather, told me today; if anything is done by noon, I will make sure to find out. I presented your last letters, which we received yesterday, November 15, to Mr. Charles and the councilors; they will also inform me if they receive any news before the merchants depart.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will write down what I learned in public today. The domestic turmoil that the insane papists in Paris have stirred up is interpreted by our adversaries and the French as if the Swiss and Parisians had erupted and unexpectedly attacked and suppressed our large crowd, among others, that Admiral was injured and his leg was pierced and broken by bullets; this is what Captain Hercules von Salis reported. Mr. Frederick confirmed at the very hour I went out to gather rumors in public that the king with his people had broken out of the city and 400 of Condé's men were slain, and it was a close call for the prince. But everything seems to be false, and our people do not believe it, just as the adversaries do not believe ours. Mr. Charles says it is well known that the Pope is sending 3 tons of gold and 5000 arquebusiers.</p>
      <p>Yesterday at dusk, Mr. Caspar von Salis, Frederick's brother, said he heard from a certain merchant who came here directly from Lyon: the king and queen have been captured.</p>
      <p>It is also said for certain that the Pope and the King of Spain initially intended to start the game with us; they were advised against it, that the beastly council should first be raised in Gaul; it would have a reputation and bring terror to the whole world, etc. Mr. Consul Willius reported yesterday that on the same day it was discussed in the senate to send a delegation to Baden to inquire from the Confederates about the situation and to want to go to France immediately. So it was understood (as I was with Pontisell today) from someone from the Engadin, who also sat there, that it was decided to punish those who withdrew; yes, if they return. The royal envoy is not here himself, but has ridden away (but not far) where the messengers gather; everything is done through an interpreter. Mr. Charles said today in his house to me that he had not seen such disorderly conduct as this envoy's; he departs when he should especially hurry. The interpreter has conveyed: the king means that according to the union, one must let the servant, as it concerns his person and land. But others say there is something else: if a foreign army were to do something, one would be obliged; but since they separate themselves and attack the faith, one is not obliged there. Yet while they insist on the union, my lords have not yet sent themselves; he is said to be ill, so he cannot come. The lords have appointed 6 men to admonish and urge him to appear himself so that it can be judged whether it is against the union or not. And yet it seems (in my opinion) no oversight is needed, as the matter is public; but the pensioners try everything not to lose the king's and royal money's favor. For our French frighten and scare many so that he lets it slip away, lest he be deprived of his stipend. I had diligently warned the magistrate of Davos, exposed the enemy's tricks; Mr. Ammann Ardüser, my godfather, has done his best so that no more than 2 men have been drawn from the whole land.</p>
      <p>Now, when he comes here, he cannot complain enough to me how the interpreter has played tricks on him: namely, he is young, the king has accepted him as a young man, shown him much good; now he lets himself be instructed against the king by the priests and is the most heated against the move. And yet he may well have told me this now so that he is less reprimanded by his pastor; for the people are exceedingly heated against the pensioners, and one might easily whistle at him, the union would be shattered. - In the episcopal matter, nothing has been done yet except (as Mr. Frederick, also the envoy, reports) that some insist strongly that it be handed over to the Confederates; but they do not want to do it. He is very surprised that he receives nothing from you, although he does not ignore that you are very busy and therefore easily forgives it. - It is spread here, not without infamy, how honorably Mr. Remigius von Schauenstein and others, who are most disobedient to their magistrate, thirst for innocent blood, were received in transit in Zurich. This is very badly received by many here. I do not dare to write about the matter of recruiting soldiers, from where and who; but God willing, soon in person. - Mr. Brunner from St. Gallen writes to me and humbly asks to be helped elsewhere under any condition. For he received no response from the people of Maienfeld; they do not add anything to the stipend (as he requested). It would be advisable if they would amicably grant what is arranged. They dismissed him without any gift; indeed, there were some who doubted whether he could even understand and speak Latin. Such is the barbarism here. Now I know of no vacant place that would suit Brunner. The black parsonage in Maienfeld did not please him; but there is a little schoolmaster, a Faber from Ulm, who will be happy with it. - Mr. Hercules von Salis thinks that the prophecy of Burgos, the parliament lord, will be fulfilled, who foretold all these things to King Henry, that the crown of France would come from the right line; therefore he was secretly strangled and thus burned to death. The captain also thinks that the move of the Count Palatine will encounter the Italian power, to prevent or strike with them, so that the king's court does not come together. November 17, 1565.</p>
      <p>All good men greet you, Mr. Consuls, Pontisella, Gantner, and especially Mr. Charles.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news from Italy besides. An Italian pastor said there is a common saying among them that Condé is rebelling, etc. Farewell, most esteemed man and father most revered by us all.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>As I was sealing this letter, nothing certain has been done in the episcopal matter; this is what I learned from Frederick himself; something will be done today, but the merchants will leave before. Hoffacher will carry the rest, which I wrote before this; I do not know when he is ready; if he does not leave today, I will repeat the letters.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father. Zurich.</p>
