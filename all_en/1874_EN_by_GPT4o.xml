      <p>Greetings. Your letters were pleasing to me, honorable man Calvin, and because they mentioned that Mr. Farel was restored to us from the dead, thanks to God, and because they testified that you are entirely the kind of person towards me that I hoped for. However, they would have been much more pleasing if they had not mentioned something about our Bibliander, our teacher, a certainly pious and learned man, whom I do not think is your enemy, even if not everything of yours is approved by him. Not everything pleases me in the writings of the ancients, yet I do not consider them enemies. And you also write in your letters to me that we did not meet your expectations in the Hieronymian controversy: yet the bond of union and charity is not torn by this matter.</p>
      <p>Nor do I think our Bibliander has any hostile book against you in his hands. Perhaps some report things to you more harshly than they should for the sake of prudence and charity. I know indeed that words are thrown back and forth and uttered by shameless people on both sides, which almost separate or alienate minds, especially when the enemy of holy concord also gladly pours cold water. I indeed think that minds should be tempered, and I consider my Bibliander to be endowed with such humanity that if you were to write friendly letters to him, he would not reject them as if they came from an enemy. May the Lord Jesus bless us, so that we may faithfully spread his glory among all through our ministry. Farewell with all the fellow ministers and brothers, the honorable lords. But I hear that the works of Mr. Oecolampadius are being printed with you in Geneva. See, my brother, that nothing is removed or changed in the works of this holy man, as I know happened in Strasbourg with his Jeremiah and Ezekiel. You will perform here a most holy and useful service for all the pious and the entire church. The Lord will repay you on that day.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell again and again, in ZÃ¼rich, May 22, 1553. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
