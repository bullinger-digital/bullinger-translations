      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not received any letters from you for two whole years, I believe, is that my letters to you have not been delivered or your letters, if you sent any to me, have been lost. I received your last letters, in which you sent a silver coin to my wife, to which I had responded, and my wife in return sent you a small gift for the present sent to her; however, I doubt that it reached you, since you have not replied. Some of your booklets were delivered to me, such as the "Antithesis," along with some others, which I do not fully recall now, but some, which you mentioned in your last letters, did not reach me.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for your great kindness towards me, I will always be most grateful as long as I live, and I will preserve your booklets as an eternal memory of your name and your affection towards me. Hence, at present, I can write nothing new to you except the common miseries and the frequent devastations of this kingdom of Hungary by the Turks. Thus, the heavenly Father usually afflicts a rebellious and stubborn people. The word of the Lord proceeds more successfully under the rule of the Turks than in these places, where the Pope and bishops reign; we hope that God, in His immense mercy, will one day turn the efforts and plans of the wicked to His glory. I have written these few things to you to testify that I live by divine grace and remember you. Farewell forever and write back. In Pressburg, July 18, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and eager servant, János Fejérthóy, Hungarian.</p>
      <p>I will write more on another occasion.</p>
