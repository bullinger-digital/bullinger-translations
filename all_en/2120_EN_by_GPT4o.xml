      <p>Greetings and blessings. Philippus Gallicius, an outstanding man, a faithful and singular minister of Christ, recently wrote to me, proclaiming your readiness for a solid and sincere reformation. Since that time, I have not ceased to pray for you, most esteemed man and dearest brother, asking the Lord to increase and strengthen your spirit in all good things and to lead your efforts to the desired end, so that His name may be glorified, many holy souls may be moved to holy imitation by good example. Continue, my lord, to walk in the way of Christ; depart from the ways of the Antichrist. If anywhere the desolation of abomination shines forth, it shines forth most of all in the mass. For the entire institution of Christ is horribly corrupted by the mass, so much so that I am amazed that there are still some learned men who do not utterly detest the mass with all their hearts. Christ ascended to heaven, where He wishes to be worshiped at the right hand of the Father: the mass presents Him to be worshiped under the appearance of bread, which the Lord Himself predicted would happen in Matthew 24. Christ suffered and was offered once, He is not offered again; for His offering is effective for all eternity: yet in the mass, it is said by the most wretched of mortals to be sacrificed daily. Christ gave bread and wine and commanded to eat and drink with thanksgiving in His memory: priests eat and drink for the faithful, indeed when they offer the sacrament of bread to be eaten, they snatch away the cup. Christ said the faithful pass from death to life: the mass priests offer for the faithful dead not only without God's command but against God's command. There are many other horrendous things in the mass. Therefore, continue to overthrow that ultimate blasphemy against Christ, restore the most holy supper. I have given two sermons on it here, which I send to you here in printed form as a New Year's gift, praying to the Lord that this year may begin for you and yours with happy auspices and end with much greater happiness.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ preserve you and yours forever. ZÃ¼rich, December 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, Johannes Travers, lord of Zuoz, his most sincere friend.</p>
      <p>To be delivered to Philippus Gallicius.</p>
