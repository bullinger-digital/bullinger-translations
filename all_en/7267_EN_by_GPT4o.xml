      <p> Greetings. What I have from other places and from my many friends, I share here. I beg you to strongly urge everyone to repentance and prayers. For I hope that a not insignificant storm is about to break. May the Lord have mercy on you! Greet the councilors and Lord Karl. Since things are as they are, and faith and the faithful, as well as the French and the nobles with the princes, must be fought, they would not act unwisely if the Rhaetians did not grant soldiers unless they were first informed of the good purpose and plan of the war. Karl also, when he oppressed the princes of Germany with war, always had on his lips: "It is not about faith, but about the disobedient." He has many disciples who now also echo the same. If only they would live peacefully and not listen to the cardinals and bishops, among whom there is no faith nor peace. May the Lord have mercy on you and keep you! </p>
      <p> Zurich, 17th of October, 1567. Most hastily. There were more things to write, especially about the prefect of Thurgau, who holds Mauritius Schneewolf captive; but there is no leisure. </p>
      <p> Seriously urge everyone to repentance and prayers. Your Bullinger. </p>
