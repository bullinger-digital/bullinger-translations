      <p>S. D. May this year be happy and beneficial to your kindness and all yours, most illustrious man and father in Christ, and especially to the Church of Christ and the republic, through Christ I pray with all my heart. I received your last letter written on December 19th on the 23rd of the same month. I would have gladly responded sooner, but the difficulty of the matter that needed to be resolved and especially the journey was an impediment. Since I could not safely deliver the letters of the French exiles, which I now return, and was daily expecting more certain news about our contribution, everything has been delayed until now, so that I am both ashamed and regretful to use a longer excuse with you. However, what is to be expected from your intercession and that of the brothers, you will learn more fully from the writings I send than from this little letter, from which you will also see our faith and diligence. As soon as your letter was brought to me, we convened three of us brothers and met with both consuls, showing them the letter and the one from the French exiles, which we translated into the vernacular language. Both were read to the senate along with our supplicatory petition on the day we indicated, and what you see from our exhortation to the churches was decreed. However, the contribution has not yet been made, about which I do not doubt, if the magistrate is reminded, there will be no delay. Your kindness, with your prudence, can add a spur to me and the brothers, which I can also direct civilly to the pious and good men. For he who gives quickly, gives twice.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Rabshakeh writing, I can say nothing else now than what I indicated in the last letter sent to you. The difficulty of the journey has hindered many things, and since Dr. Peyer lives in the countryside, I rarely know what he is doing, except that I hear he is daily expecting a messenger from Basel to come to him, through whom perhaps what we seek will be brought. Otherwise, I know him to be Socratic in his zeal for religion and the salvation of the country, where it is needed. I have read in passing the most deplorable nonsense of that rascal, the French envoy, as I call him, Bell-Laferer, his most vain and futile apology. However, how much the silence of our people, not only that, but also, as the response of the assembly publicly shows, the consensus of all pious and country-loving hearts is pierced, cannot be said. We see, therefore, degenerate Swiss bearing arms against the noble ones in France and the new Swiss.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to the poem I recently sent, so that the prophecy may be complete, I may add this little prayer: Lord Christ, protect the flock, The wolves raging with might; No help is otherwise on earth. Overthrow with your power, Those who are utterly rejected;</p>
      <p>With Paul, you will convert, Those who ignorantly resist, Forgive their sins. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and all the brothers, whom all our brothers, the consuls, Doctors Peyer, Burkhard, Holzach, Beatus Leo, Benedict Stocker junior, and other friends reverently and dutifully greet with you. January 15, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, to be highly honored.</p>
