      <p>Greetings. The courier is in a hurry; I too am in a hurry, called to one and another sick old man.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in a few words, you should have this: Kolmar presented his business to the senate today, and at the same time offered a public document. This matter was greatly displeasing to all the best people.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he was received back into his position, which he held when he was called away from here. The most honorable magistrate does not want to send him now, but grants a month's time; if during this time the people of Davos recall him with letters to the magistrate, it may be granted to them; otherwise, he will be retained with us; for we are now in a situation where we do not have more than three unmarried men, and none of these would be sent to them. Therefore, unless they seriously request him and promise a safe defense, and also somehow compensate for the damage, I do not think anyone from our side should be sent. However, if they conduct themselves in such a manner, you should approve of the honest and faithful, perhaps this Kolmar will be returned to them. I received and read your letters.</p>
      <p>Thank you; you will tell Mr. Legate that I have also received his and am presently sending back the catalog and giving thanks; I will write again when there is more leisure; you will greet him.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland was only feverish; there is no danger to his life. Yesterday I received news from Poland, from someone who left Krakow on January 10: everything is well; the word of God is progressing.</p>
      <p>The bishops strongly resist, but they can do nothing. The Queen of Hungary is safe and sound; her son is also unharmed; but Babek, who wanted to betray her to Ferdinand, has been cut down with his men. The Turk is on a major expedition.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg was shaken by an earthquake on January 8. I am forced to break off here.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your people.</p>
      <p>The book of Mr. Philipp is ready; I have it; I am waiting for someone to whom he will entrust it, so that he may receive it from me. May Philipp, Pontasella, and both consuls, all the best people, be well. February 11, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger to the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, his most esteemed and dear compatriot and brother. Chur.</p>
