    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot promise anything regarding a meeting yet. Thanks for Melanchthon's writings, but would prefer not to take a position on them. Is unclear about the church reorganization sought by Capito and opposes a concord with the Catholics, as mutual recognition is out of the question and the Kingdom of Christ grows even without such an agreement.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding the meeting at present, esteemed Capito, I cannot promise anything certain. The matter concerns many, and I am only writing private letters. You may perhaps receive a more certain response shortly. However, I promise nothing, lest I be accused of inconsistency later for disappointing my own hopes.</p>
      <p>For Philipp's booklets, I give you the greatest thanks. Since I have not yet read them with judgment, I pronounce nothing; I have read them quickly. However, I learn to pronounce more cautiously day by day.</p>
      <p>Regarding the establishment of church governance, I do not understand what you mean. The plan for entering into concord with the Catholics is not pleasing. They will not accept us, nor are they such that they can be accepted by us. The monarchy of the Pope is the kingdom of the Antichrist. Through the Mass, they lose the blood and redemption of Christ, they overturn the institution of Christ. They misuse idols for idolatry. The worship of saints is contempt for Christ and God. But in these matters, they will not accept any moderation, nor will they allow us the freedom to speak and teach about these things as we have done so far. The Kingdom of Christ has grown so far without such concords, and it will grow much more strongly, unless we wish to be as we have been so far.</p>
