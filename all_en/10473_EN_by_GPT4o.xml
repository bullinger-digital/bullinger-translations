    <p xml:id="regest1">Received a letter from the Zurich authorities, in which he is requested to appear immediately before the council in Zurich. Since this is difficult for him during the ongoing grape harvest and he does not know the reason for the summons, he asks to investigate the matter and obtain a postponement. If Erasmus Schmid is not at home, Bullinger should take up the matter in this sense.</p>

      <p>Brotherly loyalty and all good things beforehand, dear brother, M. Erasmus.</p>
      <p>Knowing that we are all in good health, praise be to God. It would be a great joy for us to hear the same from all of you, especially now from the sister, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brother, today, Saturday afternoon around 3, I received this letter (which I am sending to you herewith) from my lords and superiors in Zurich. Crista Wangner brings it to me and says that Hans Asper gave it to him in Zurich, and he should give it to me, etc. It frightens me quite a bit, and I cannot imagine what I have to do for my lords so urgently. I cannot know whether it has a bad or good intention, now in the great unrest; because it will be the grape harvest with us on Wednesday, and I have no one to take care of my things, as it is tight to go to Will. And I have lent out a lot to the common man, and if God wills that I accomplish something, I must be at home; I would remain silent if I were not at home. How it will go, anyone can imagine. Because very little wine will be made. Moreover, I cannot and do not know how to get a horse; the reason is that everyone is in great unrest during the harvest and sowing, and there is no greater unrest throughout the year than now with the horses. So I cannot go on foot, because of my thigh and knee, as you well know. And my opinion would be (upon your improvement) that you quietly inquire about the matter, perhaps with a trusted council friend, if you could learn the reason for my writing and request, what the intention and nature of the writing is, etc., as you could then better inform me than I could write to you. After you have learned, good or bad, you would act accordingly. Because the writing is quite difficult and partly large for me, and I cannot imagine or think what it might mean. Because I do not know of anything I have to do for my lords that would warrant such writing and request. Therefore, dear brother, do your best and make an effort. And it seemed to me, if you already let a trusted one or two notice, or to the mayor himself (if you would advise it), that my lords and superiors have written to me to appear before them next Wednesday. Now this would be quite difficult for me, because of the unrest mentioned above, and I would have written to you about it, to learn the matters in the best way, if the day could not be postponed by 8 or 12 days, and the harvest would be over, it would be a great service to me. But if it could not be otherwise, I could recognize and understand that I should be obedient to my lords and superiors, and rightly so, and should and must appear. It would come to me as badly as it would, so I must and should be obedient, etc. Such an opinion you or Master Heinrich would understand very well, to advise and help me in the best way, so that if I must or should go now, I could or might get a horse, etc. I request your advice and written response as soon as possible, along with the message. And as I ask for your help and advice, so, if you are not at home, I ask in the same way to the utmost from Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>With this, all are commended to God.</p>
      <p>Dated in Il, on the 13th day of September 34.</p>
      <p>Felix Schmid.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and learned Master Erasmus Schmid, canon in Zurich, my dear brother, and in his absence to the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the cathedral in Zurich, my kind lord.</p>
