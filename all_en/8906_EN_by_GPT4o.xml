      <p>S. D. I received your letter, dear brother, along with the documentation of the history or acts... I am glad that this assembly has finally been dissolved, and I hope it has been dissolved successfully and that nothing worse follows! We have in Switzerland a bitterness that makes everything bitter; may the Lord be pleased to purge this bile with the salvation of the country! You understand that I am speaking of those about whom the prophet Obadiah prophesies, unless you prefer the Moabites, etc. I thank you for your labors; it is scarcely possible to read what you write with such ease. Recently, I think I wrote to you about our fire, in which the roof of our church tower was consumed, with the greatest danger to all of us, yet again with the greatest grace and protection of God. If I have not sent the history, I will send it another time, if you remind me; however, I think I have explained the essence of the matter to you. Let us pray to the Lord that these portents are not signs of greater evils; if they were brought by the Lord, he could not be accused; such is the wickedness throughout Switzerland. I fear, I fear, it is not far from the end and from retribution.</p>
      <p>It is written from Antwerp and Heidelberg that the exiled Belgians have occupied the island of Brielle in Holland and almost all of Zeeland; they have support from Denmark and, as some suspect, from France, under the pretext of Louis of Nassau; certainly, they are said to display the banners of Orange on their flags. Alba, on the other hand, is gathering soldiers and making efforts. What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>It is written from Augsburg that the Emperor of the Turks has passed away and his son, a prudent and moderate as well as very warlike prince, has been appointed in his place. From France, we hear that peace is being maintained inviolate and that the churches are growing. Just now, a citizen from Basel was with me, who inquired about the letter and money of Stupanus, and when I answered that I had sent it down piously, I had to note and write how it went, as if I had nothing else to do. He asked me to write to you, that you should instruct someone, who sent you the letter and money, to inquire diligently and ensure that he faithfully follows up, etc.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you and with your entire family. Zurich, the day after Ascension Day, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet all our lords and friends in order. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor of the church in Chur, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
