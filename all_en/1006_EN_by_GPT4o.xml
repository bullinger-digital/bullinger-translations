      <p>S. Our Heurusius recently delivered your most loving letters to me, along with your sermons, a very excellent and most welcome gift, which I received with open arms and reverence, as I should. My mind is very impatient with the delay caused by the binder's work, as it eagerly desires to devour their reading. Meanwhile, ah my dearest Bullinger, I am exceedingly troubled, as often before, because I feel so unequal to the accumulated benefits and services you have shown me, that wherever I turn, there is nothing with which I can even slightly express my gratitude for your perpetual generosity. And if only I had done this when I still had more favorable fortune, I would certainly be less tormented by this now. As for you, your gratuitous munificence shines forth more clearly and sincerely, as it is bestowed upon one from whom you can expect no benefit in return; regarding myself, I can solemnly assure you of only one thing, that if you wish to estimate my mind by my love and zeal for you, and could look deeper into it, you would find it no less than your own towards me. May Christ grant that what I can truly swear by words, I may someday prove to you in reality, and I implore Him with humble prayers, since He knows well that He is loved by you in me, that He may also kindly fill your heart with the supreme fruit of this love, with an abundance of heavenly blessing, and what my poverty cannot supply, may He most fully make up with His inexhaustible goodness, giving you a shaken and overflowing measure both here and especially in the resurrection of the just... In which also, farewell forever, my soul, with your whole household, to whom I uniquely wish to be commended in sacred prayers. Greet all the brothers and friends in Christ who love me there. The faithful ministers of the church of God here, with great reverence, bid you farewell in our solid salvation in Christ, which my wife also diligently does. Farewell again. August 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>I will now describe what I received from Augsburg, which you will also share with Buttler, so that I do not have to write to him there with double the effort. I earnestly beseech you to remember the boys of Lazarus when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, I have been written to by a very credible man that on August 12, a sermon was preached at St. Jacob in the suburb of Jacob, with some Spaniards also present in the church and three German guards of the prince, and when the sermon concluded with the prayer, one of the German guards said that the priest did not pray correctly, that it was false, etc., which caused everyone to look around. But no one said or did anything about it, and the preacher, along with everyone, left the church. In the meantime, a Spanish nobleman was struck by God's hand, so that he suddenly died and remained dead there. The Spaniards wanted to remove the preacher and the people, so that no preaching should take place at this location; for the place was assigned to them.</p>
      <p>Then on August 14, some Spaniards took over the preaching house at St. Ulrich at four o'clock in the evening and plundered everything, broke open the poor box, and stole everything needed for the supper, tore down and broke the pulpit, smashed the windows, and shattered the chairs and benches in the preaching house with axes, hatchets, and bars; it lasted for about two hours.</p>
      <p>The city bailiff of Augsburg, whom they always have, came to this matter, wanting to stop and prevent them; but they stood against the bailiff and his guards, so that there were about 100 bare weapons there, and the city bailiff was in great danger, with four of his guards badly wounded. This was immediately reported to the imperial majesty; he sent the provost with servants, who stopped it, but most of the real perpetrators escaped, though some were captured.</p>
      <p>On the same night, the church wardens quickly made a new pulpit and benches in the same preaching house, so that on the 15th day, early in the morning, preaching took place there again; this angered the Spaniards so much that immediately after the sermon, another group came, tore down the pulpit again, and began the uproar as before. But this time, they were caught in the act, and over 20 of them were captured; they are in the power of the imperial majesty; what will be done with them will soon be known; for it is certain that the imperial majesty is greatly displeased with this and is very dissatisfied; it is believed that it is all nothing but priestly practices and instigations, and it is hoped that God's word will serve more for advancement than hindrance. But everything has been restored in the preaching houses, and immediately thereafter, on August 17, the supper was held in the six parishes.</p>
      <p>The pious, dear preachers earnestly desire from me and all Christians a faithful prayer, that the Lord God may give them a fruitful spirit and courage, so that they may stand firm and do and suffer everything as God wills; for they are in great danger. Therefore, let them also be dear to you along with your church.</p>
      <p>The electors and princes are said to have proposed three cities in their council, namely Regensburg, Mainz, and Worms, in one of which the council should be held. Likewise, they have decided in their council that in the meantime, before the council is held, no war should be undertaken in Germany because of the disputed religion, and it is confidently expected that the other estates will also agree to this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God grant grace for this!</p>
      <p>The pope's envoy has let it be known in Augsburg that they have the authority to arrange with the Roman imperial majesty to hold the council at the end and place of the German nation, wherever it is most convenient for their majesty, where everyone will also be given free, safe conduct in the best form.</p>
      <p>It is reported from Augsburg, but I have no writing about it, but it has been written from Nuremberg that the French in the Netherlands have taken a large city named St. Thomas, which is no smaller than Nuremberg, through great treachery. It will soon be known.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus Heuru√ü was here with me yesterday, riding to Lucerne; there he will find Marsum and ride with him to Milan, etc. He hinted to me how the imperial majesty is in great preparation against those in Magdeburg; this will now be the first thing that their majesty will undertake in terms of war and will punish those of Magdeburg as an example to others.</p>
      <p>He also informed me that the Spaniards in Barbary have besieged an excellent city, whose name has escaped me, and have bombarded everything for the assault, so that it is generally believed they have taken and conquered it these days.</p>
      <p>I have also received a letter from Bufler in Isny; he is written from Nuremberg about how the Duke of Brunswick has besieged the city of Brunswick, but has mostly used the local people, noble and common, forced there with great reluctance, but at the risk of life and property. But those of Brunswick have shot away the duke along with his people, and in his retreat, they made a great sortie on horseback and on foot, inflicting great, excellent damage on him, and the innocent, unwilling to the matter, had to suffer just as well as the guilty.</p>
      <p>To the very venerable and most faithful servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable brother and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
