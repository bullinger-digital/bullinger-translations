    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer was very pleased with Bullinger's letter [not preserved], especially with the friendly offer to grant refuge to him and his family. Blarer offers the same to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is easy to believe that the people of Zurich are as dismayed by the reconciliation of the people of Konstanz with Emperor Charles V as the people of Konstanz themselves. Unfortunately, nothing else could be done. It is not possible for the people of Konstanz to resist the Emperor's 20,000 men with 10,000 men. That would only test God! May He grant the people of Konstanz the strength to remain steadfast until death if demands are made of them that go against Him and their conscience! Thank God, the majority of the population still shares this view. And if the people of Konstanz have to suffer damage to their earthly goods, they have deserved it. If only they remain with [God and His Word]! He alone knows whether the promises made to the people of Konstanz will actually be kept. And perhaps He will soon show mercy and put an end to this misery. The people of Zurich should pray for Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The people of Konstanz have indeed felt the concern of the people of Zurich. May God Zebaoth protect them from a similar misfortune! In view of the deceitfulness prevailing everywhere, caution is advised! God will nullify the wisdom of this world with the foolishness [of His Gospel]. He has done so many times before. May He fill His own with love and obedience so that they may conquer the world. His will be done! May His children remain His forever and ever! Amen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings from Blarer's brother Thomas and cousin Konrad Zwick. They and especially Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff] ask for Bullinger's prayers. Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], their children, and other relatives are warmly greeted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer will have Bullinger's letter to Sabina Schöner [not preserved] delivered by Georg Frölich. Enclosed is a letter for Johannes Haller, which Blarer forgot to include in his last letter [No. 3059] in his haste. Greetings to Haller, about whom much good is reported from Augsburg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] According to a letter addressed to Thomas Buchmann from Nuremberg, the Emperor is preparing for a new campaign and recruiting captains. An attack on the Confederation is considered likely. This is also heard from elsewhere, including from a well-traveled man [...] from Isny, who passed through Konstanz. A Thurgauer [...] recently said that the Bishop of Konstanz, Johann von Weeze, bought boards worth 1000 or 2000 guilders for his animal park in Öhningen last summer. However, it is believed that the boards are intended for a bridge over the Rhine. This is for Bullinger's information. In these times full of deceit and lies, unpleasant statements and assumptions keep arising; which advises caution.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Frölich is still in Konstanz and is waiting for the arrival of his servant [...] from Augsburg to conclude negotiations with Sebastian Schertlin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] A letter arrived from Augsburg yesterday. It only stated that it is dangerous to write letters, and the plague is claiming more and more victims. Almost all the wealthy are fleeing the city. Leonhart Stöcklin, with whom the old Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is staying, has fled to Memmingen with his wife [Apollonia, née Wägelin] and children, leaving his house entirely to the Elector. The Reichstag will probably not be concluded in Augsburg. Perhaps the Emperor will be content to initiate the Council of Trent, commit everyone to obedience, and thus enforce his claims. Everything is entrusted to the Lord! He can prolong the [so far tolerable] state in various ways.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Council of Trent poses the greatest threat to the German churches, as no just resolutions in favor of the truth are to be expected from there, especially since they are passed by ignorant people who have long been prejudiced against the [Protestants]. May the Lord judge and defend His cause Himself!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [P.S.:] Blarer has the impression that Zwick would like to negotiate with righteous councilors of the [Swiss Protestant] cities about his war machine (which should only be used in an emergency).</p>

      <p>All good through Christ and God! I express my possible thanks for your friendly, brotherly letter, as it, as is fitting, brings me heartfelt joy, especially your Christian greetings towards me and mine. I would also truly, if the occasion arose, do the same towards you, you should trust me completely and in all things.</p>

      <p>That it is equally distressing to you that we must seek the emperor's grace, we also trust completely. But how could one have done otherwise? Non potuimus cum 10000 millibus occurrere illi, qui cum 20000 millibus venit. It might be interpreted as a temptation from God. May He alone grant grace, so that if something improper against God and our souls is demanded of us, we remain steadfast and rather go to ruin over it - as indeed the majority, praise be to God, is inclined. If we must otherwise suffer some temporal harm, we have indeed deserved it. If only we could remain with the true chief good, we would not have managed badly. What will be held for us, only dear God knows. He might soon have a merciful satisfaction and put an end to it. Amen. Oh, pray always and persistently for us, so that we may be preserved by God and in His protection and not be led into too severe temptation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have well understood your compassion. May the Lord God of Hosts graciously protect you from such and the like. For truly, human calculations have far to consider in such cases with such great cunning and deceit, of which the whole world is full. But dear God, if we keep Him rightly before our eyes, would soon bring all the world's wisdom to shame and nothingness with His foolishness, as He has often powerfully demonstrated and shown to His own. May He give us hearts that fear and love, diligently seek His will for the best, submit to Him, and stand firm in His obedience. Then we will indeed be too strong for all this world. But may He do with us as He wills. Here in this vain time and transient life, may He let us be His eternally! Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>All mine, my dear brother and cousin, send you all much, much good and greetings. Desiring your faithful intercession, especially also my dear wife. May you convey all Christian faithfulness and love with all good to your dear wife, children, and all dear relatives from me.</p>

      <p>Your letter to the Schönerin in Augsburg I send to her through Leto. Herewith a letter to our Haller. Should I have sent it earlier. I was quite overwhelmed that I forgot. Please greet him very friendly from me. They write to me so much good about him from Augsburg, which brings me heartfelt joy, etc.</p>

      <p>It has been written to our Thomas Buchmann from Nuremberg that the emperor is appointing new captains and preparing for a new campaign, and it is believed that something is being planned against the Confederates. So it is also said and written elsewhere. And a good man, who travels widely and is from Isny, has also said here today that it will now concern the Confederates. Likewise, a good man from Thurgau has said here today how our bishop bought two brothers for a thousand guilders or two this summer for his animal park in Öhningen. That has a bad appearance, for it is being arranged and prepared so that one can cross the Rhine bridges with it! I now report this to you, for what concerns me concerns you, I do not want to conceal. It brings some bad talk and insinuation, a great pondering in these times, which are full of cunning, deceit, and treachery.</p>

      <p>Laetus is still here. He waits every hour for his servant from Augsburg, so that he can finally conclude with Schertlin.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>From Augsburg, I received a letter yesterday, but nothing special, except that it is written that it is not safe to write, and that the plague is breaking out more and more. The rich are fleeing almost all out. The old elector's servant, Lenhart Stöcklin, has fled to Memmingen with his wife and children. He has left the house entirely to the elector. It is not believed that the Reichstag in Augsburg can be concluded. It might be enough for the emperor for now to initiate the council and demand obedience from everyone and thus seek and find support where he wants it, although dear God can well intervene in various ways for the extension of peace for His own. To Him be it all entrusted!</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I see no greater danger threatening the churches of Germany than from this council, where neither the person of the judge nor the form of judgment can be expected to be such that truth will emerge from it, since the unlearned and most hostile to our cause will vote, who have long since condemned what we feel from the Spirit of Christ with their prejudices. But the Lord Himself will judge and mightily defend His cause. In Him, my dearest brother, farewell eternally. Constance, November 2. Yours, A. Bl.</p>

      <p>Regarding my cousin Conrad Zwick, I cannot perceive anything else about him than that he would now gladly deal with both townspeople for the sake of his art, as might be available, that it might be a rescue in case of need.</p>
      <p>To my most beloved lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
