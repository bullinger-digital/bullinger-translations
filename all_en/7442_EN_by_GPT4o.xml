      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ and a diligent commendation of my and my followers' services.</p>
      <p>From your letters, which you sent to me through Mr. Christoph Thretius, most reverend and illustrious man, Lord Bullinger, most esteemed friend, I am filled with manifold and varied joy and delight of the mind. For they are filled with the greatest benevolence towards me (for which I give you immense thanks) and with prudent and many duties and advice, especially in this matter of refuting the heretics who are rampant in our region, both of which I highly value, as my conscience bears witness. For you insert explanation and admonition in your letters with such grave and ornate words that nothing more pleasant or better could have happened to us. In this matter, you certainly do a most pleasing thing to God, and I would not want you to think that you have labored in vain or washed a brick.</p>
      <p>Your previous admonitions, sent here to our Mr. Thretius, have had great impact and have shown their efficacy in a remarkable way, as many, having rejected their error, which they previously defended with obstinate mind and tenacity, return to us and have embraced this true confession of ours concerning the most holy Trinity, among whom is also our magnificent Lord Zupparius of Wieliczka, a man of great authority among the Poles, whose life is so connected with piety and religion that he refers his mind, his thoughts, all his plans to promoting the church of God. If you should ever wish to write to him on occasion and exhort him to constancy and defending the truth, the church will reap excellent fruit and great benefit from it, and it will be very advantageous for us. For such is the impudence of the heretics that they do not allow a religious man to be at peace; but they attempt to drag him back into the abyss of impiety with marvelous arts and schemes, and they are so powerful in their pertinacity and wickedness that they would rather endure anything than be torn from their opinion. And not only do they creep in many places here in Poland, but they have also penetrated into Transylvania with their horrendous errors, where they are growing more and more.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, without regard to any losses and dangers, we resist them and are determined to embrace and defend to our last breath the doctrine of the prophets and apostles concerning Christ our Jehovah, which is comprehended in your confession, to which we have also subscribed. In this matter, assist us with your prayers to God and enroll me in the number of your friends, as you promise to do, and have the old Schadkovius, who has been most observant of you for many years, commended, I earnestly beg you, my most illustrious Bullinger and most esteemed father, who have always been and will be not only a supporter but also an amplifier of your dignity and piety, which I judge I owe both to the church of Christ, which is dearer to me than my life, and to my observance of you. Fare most happily together with all your colleagues, whom I greet reverently and dutifully.</p>
      <p>Given at Wieliczka from our salt mines on the 12th day before the calends of May 1568.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and most observant of you, Andreas Schadkovius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and reverend man, most pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, etc., lord and friend to be revered.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Andreas Schadkovius, a Pole.</p>
