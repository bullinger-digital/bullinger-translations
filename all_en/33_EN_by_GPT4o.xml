    <p xml:id="regest1">The [bearer of the letter, N.N.] is by no means a bad pastor from the Basel region. He is recommended to Bullinger due to the matter for which he is coming to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Bullinger simply leaves Myconius' letters unanswered! To calm him down, he should convey the reason for this through the pastor or another letter bearer. Myconius does not need to repeat his concerns, as he has already explained them in detail in his two letters to Bullinger [hbbw XX, No. 3100; 18012]. There is nothing to add to that. However, he is greatly worried that there will soon be bad news about the [corruptibility of the old-faithful] neighbors of Zurich. It is hard to believe, but since the rumor persists, Myconius simply has to be afraid.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Not a word from the Diet, except for the news from some captain [N.N.], according to which the Diet envoys have been glaring at each other fiercely. This has frightened Myconius and given him some restless nights.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Bullinger will undoubtedly know everything about the Council of Trent. Some believe it will not continue in Bologna or Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Everything that Emperor Charles V says or does points to a war. His ambition and success spur him on! The Confederates will fall prey to him if they do not practice unity and fear of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The pious fear King Henry II of France, but due to the unfavorable situation, they are forced to align themselves with him to some extent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">According to the report of a traveler [N.N.], who crossed Italy coming from Sardinia, Rome, Florence, and the Venetian cities are teeming with soldiers to defend the borders in case of an invasion by Charles V. And an attack is to be feared! However, under the current circumstances, everything seems suspicious to Myconius. Perhaps the Emperor himself spreads such deceitful news to lull the Confederates into a false sense of security and then destroy them unprepared.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Regarding the incident with the bears of [Archduke] Maximilian, about which Johannes Haller knows more, Myconius would like to learn more. Likewise about the Steckborn [lads]: Did they fight with the Swabians [from Hemmenhofen] on the ice of Lake Zell [correct: Lake Rhine] and drive them away?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. This man is by no means the worst among the rural brothers. Ensure that he is recommended for the matter for which he is sent there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You allow me to write, yet you do not respond. Through this man or another, indicate why you do not respond, so that I may be more at ease. There is no need to repeat what I have requested. You have my two letters, which I believe explain it sufficiently. There is nothing to add, except a strong fear concerning your neighbors, about whom worse things are continually reported. I do not easily believe such astonishing things. However, since the rumor is so persistent, I cannot help but be afraid.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Not a word from the Diet, except that a certain captain reported: The envoys of the Confederates glare at each other fiercely. This word, though uncertain, has so terrified me that I have had several restless nights.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You undoubtedly know everything about the council. Some think neither the Bologna nor the Trent council will progress.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Whatever Emperor Charles V says or does, he is entirely focused on waging war. His ambition and the present favor of fortune spur him on. We will be his prey unless unity nourishes our spirits and fear of the Lord occupies us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The pious fear King Henry II of France, yet they are compelled by the malignity of the times to incline somewhat towards him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>A certain man came from Sardinia through Italy, who reports that in Rome, Florence, and the cities of the Venetians, everything is prepared for the soldiers, but only to defend their borders if the Emperor arrives. And there is fear of his coming. Yet such are the times that everything seems suspicious to me. Perhaps the Emperor sends such messages, as he is deceitful, to render us secure from his arms, and then destroy us unprepared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding the bears of Maximilian, about which Haller knows, I wish to be informed. And about the Steckborn people, whether they fought with the Swabians on the ice of Lake Zell and drove them into flight, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all the pious. Basel, February 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, O. M.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
