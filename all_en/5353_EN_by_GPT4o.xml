      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, I wrote to you very hastily about not overlooking the Rhaetians and greeting them through the most illustrious Prince of Condé, as well as about the departure of the Five Cantons towards Dijon in France. Today, a man experienced in many matters came to me and among other things briefly said: "I wish," he said, "that the faithful in France would be vigilant and not easily believe. I know that the Guise family is merely stalling for time, so that, having become better prepared, they might suddenly oppress all the faithful with force and deceit. I wish, I say, that they would be vigilant; for it is certain that a great evil threatens them from Marseille.</p>
      <p>Let them beware, lest Lyon becomes another Calais.</p>
      <p>The Guise family unexpectedly seized Calais; what if the Swiss troops pretended to be leaving for Dijon and suddenly invaded Lyon? Let them be vigilant, vigilant, lest they suddenly lose Lyon." He seriously expressed these words to me and left, adding these words as he departed: "You wouldn't believe, Bullinger, how remarkable the betrayals, deceits, and schemes have been concocted. Therefore, I repeat: let the good be vigilant and pray diligently to be delivered from evil.</p>
      <p>Delay gives rise to evil schemes." This he said. However, I could not rest or be at peace until I wrote this to you promptly, so that you might promptly warn and urge our people, if they have not already been advised. It is certain that Captain Frölich is being remarkably pressured by the Guise, so much so that he himself has gone to Lucerne these days, where (in Lucerne, I say) and elsewhere, they are urged to act for the salvation of the ancient religion and their pensions; unless they promptly extricate themselves and bring help, all will be lost. Therefore, they hasten. Meanwhile, various delays present themselves; Abbatiscella, as I hear today, is said (although Solothurn agreed with the Five Cantons) to have severely prohibited anyone from going to war in France; whether these lost men will accept this mandate, I doubt. The constant rumor is that the Five Cantons will depart on June 8.</p>
      <p>Would that the iniquity of the Amorites were finally fulfilled! Our good cause, which is Christ's, has no graver and more truculent enemies today; therefore, I pray to Christ, our Lord and King, to hear those who call upon Him and deliver us from these wicked and bloodthirsty men. Amen, amen. Mr. Coignet is utterly despised by the Cantons, and I hear a great evil is being plotted against him; if the Guise wins (which may the powerful hand of our God avert), it will be over for Coignet. I ask you, my brother, to inform me by the first messenger whether my letters have reached you. I write this on the evening of June 5; yesterday I sent you another letter about not neglecting the Rhaetians, which I only hear today was taken away in the early morning. Farewell with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. June 5, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. John Calvin, most faithful pastor of the Church of Geneva, esteemed lord and my dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
