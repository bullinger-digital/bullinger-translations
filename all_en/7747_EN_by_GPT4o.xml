      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you wrote on January 10th. In it, there is nothing to which I should respond; for not a word is heard here about the battle in France, nor do I easily believe that a battle took place, although I cannot affirm anything; I leave it to time. Angusola denies and strongly denies that there was a battle in the Netherlands with the loss of Alba, whose army is intact. Different reports come from Antwerp, Cologne, Strasbourg, Nuremberg, and Augsburg; time itself will also reveal that.</p>
      <p>It is written from Augsburg on December 28th that the most illustrious prince, Duke Christoph the Elder of WÃ¼rttemberg, has passed away, leaving only one son behind; if he also dies, the duchy will return to the House of Austria. May the Lord prevent this; for if this were to happen, the preachers who have so far defended ubiquity will be everywhere, not imaginatively, but essentially and corporally, which I certainly would not want. May the Lord forgive them, etc. They say, with what faith I do not know, that huge forces are to be conscripted in Germany shortly, but it is unknown for whom and for what purpose, and also that ten thousand soldiers are to be gathered in Italy. May the Lord grant us peace and avert the barbarian nation!</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you with all good things. Greet the honorable consuls, Ganthner, Pontisella, and all our friends in order, especially Gregory.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 14, 1569.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>If you can certainly report to me what happened in the assembly, indicate it, etc. I wish the Venetians would abolish the inquisitorial tyranny among themselves!</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Tobias Egli, the most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
