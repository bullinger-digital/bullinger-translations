      <p> Greetings. Johannes Sidler brought me (most esteemed lord and father, whom I hold in the highest regard) the books published by you through your great effort and diligence, for which I give you my greatest thanks. And indeed, to speak frankly about what I feel, your kindness and generosity towards me should always be remarkable to me, with which you have pursued me not only from my tender years; you also now and frequently provide me with the most evident proofs of the same. And although the greatness of your kindness can hardly be expressed in words with due dignity, I will diligently ensure henceforth that I am neither slower nor more negligent in returning the favor. But why say more? Let your kindness take it as confessed that I will always be most devoted to you and yours and most ready to serve, etc. Johannes Sidler will bring the piglet, not yet sufficiently fattened, at the time when it seems fit to you and the dear mother; for I will reserve it for the most opportune time, which Johannes will easily recognize for that reason. A rumor is spreading in our free province that a certain man from the district of WÃ¤denswil has been unjustly imprisoned by the people of Schwyz. Whether this is the case, I would not dare to assert.</p>
      <p> Nevertheless, I wanted to inform your kindness by letter that many among us who love the fatherland are consumed with great sorrow, not because they fear the enemy (for they are most ardent in the defense of religion and the fatherland), but because they fear nocturnal and unexpected plots from the enemy. The sorrow is now also increased by a new rumor about the unjust conditions of a certain peace.</p>
      <p> These conversations are heard everywhere: I would rather perish in battle than live in a shameful peace. All are ready to fight for religion and the fatherland, but they utterly reject the unjust terms of peace. But what the conditions of peace are, what was done at the Baden assembly, and who finally are the fabricators of this pacification, is entirely unknown to me; therefore, when asked by the people, I can give no answer. You would hear, O most esteemed lord, the disturbance of souls because of this, etc.</p>
      <p> I pray to our Lord Jesus Christ that he may soon overturn the plan to extinguish the fire of the gospel, and that for the glory of his name. But let all things be done according to the will of the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p> Farewell in God, the best and greatest, who may preserve you for us for the conservation of the church for a long time. Given in Ottenbach, April 10, 1561, hastily.</p>
      <p> Your most devoted Johannes Bluntschli. To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord and Master Heinrich Bullinger, my ever most esteemed patron. Zurich.</p>
