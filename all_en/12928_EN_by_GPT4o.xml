    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The fact that the Schaffhausen pastors only write when they need the help of their Zurich colleagues is due to their simplicity and nothing else. Since they also know how accommodating their Zurich colleagues are and how often they have been helpful to them and their church, they are now turning to them again. They only disturb them because it is a matter of Christ's cause, i.e., their common cause.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Yesterday, a councilor [Hans Stierli or Alexander Offenburger] came to Pastor Sebastian Grübel and told him under the seal of secrecy, first that at the last Baden Diet it was unanimously decided that the authorities of every city and place must summon their church servants and forbid them to damage the reputation of any city or place in their sermons in the future, so that a devastating civil war does not occur.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He also said that Rudolf Gwalther is to be forced by the Five Places to recant before the Small and Great Zurich Council, even to swear that his writing "The Antichrist" is not aimed at the Five Places.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If this is true, then the Schaffhausen pastors would be extremely affected. For this would mean that the pastors would have to proclaim the word of God according to human guidelines.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The reporter also revealed that next Wednesday, April 13, all pastors from the city and country would be summoned to submit to this federal decision!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Schaffhausen pastors already know that they are to exercise their office for edification and not for destruction. However, they do not want to be unfaithful to the word of God because of human decrees; they also do not want to give cause for criticism of the doctrine or their behavior. It would be dangerous if they no longer dared to denounce the misdeeds and wrongdoers they are confronted with in prophetic and apostolic freedom, to warn the Lord's sheep against the wolves creeping in, to duly rail against the papal abuses and the filth of the priests and monks, and to contrast the unchristian doctrine with the Christian one, especially if instead, the exercise of their office is impaired by federal decisions!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Since they are well aware of their simplicity, they would like to follow the judgment and intention of the Zurich scholars. They should therefore communicate what they intend to do, especially since the Schaffhausen pastors have no doubt that the Zurich Council will also present this decree to the pastors of Zurich. The Zurich pastors should also communicate how the Schaffhausen pastors should position themselves towards their councilors, so that it does not appear that they now have an opposing view.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] All this should remain secret so that no measures are taken against the reporter, or the Schaffhausen councilors do not accuse their pastors of malice and stubbornness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Heinrich Linggi and Sebastian Grübel send their regards. Greetings also to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolf Gwalther. Bullinger should please respond through the letter carrier [...].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc. The fact that we never write to you, dearest and most esteemed brother in Christ, except when we need your help, should be attributed to our simplicity rather than any other reason. For, relying on your kindness and openness to all brothers, and because you have often offered your assistance both to us and to our church, we confidently write to you, having experienced your goodwill and diligent care towards us. We would not disturb you, occupied with greater matters, unless it were a matter concerning all of us, indeed of Christ himself, whose common ministers we are.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Yesterday, a certain man of senatorial rank came to our fellow pastor Sebastian, indicating under the seal of secrecy, not to be publicly disclosed, that the Swiss at the recent Baden Diet unanimously decreed that the authorities of all cities and regions must summon their church ministers and forbid them from publicly mentioning the name of any city, region, or others in their sermons, so that neither side may sound the trumpet for a civil war to resume and devastate the homeland.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, our Gwalther is compelled by the Five Places to recant before the senate and dioceses, and under oath to clearly state that in his writing "The Antichrist" he did not mention any of them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If these things are true, it cannot be expressed how gravely they affect us. For if this is how things are conducted, we will eventually be forced to manage the word of the Lord according to human whims.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>He indeed told Sebastian that it has already been decreed by our senate that on the coming Wednesday, which is April 13, all ministers both in the city and in the countryside will be summoned and asked to comply with that Swiss decree!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are indeed well aware that our authority is for edification and not for destruction. However, we would not want to adulterate the word of the Lord by human decree; nor would we want to give anyone a reason to slander either our doctrine or our actions. We fear, however, that some snake may lie hidden in the grass, as we do not dare to denounce the vices and wrongdoers with whom we have dealings, in prophetic and apostolic freedom (of which we have examples), to present the wolves attacking the Lord's flock in their true colors before the eyes of Christ's sheep, so that they may better guard against them, then to inveigh against papal abuses and the execrable filth of priests and monks as is fitting, to faithfully propose Christian doctrine in contrast to antichristian doctrine, but to have our function enclosed within the limits of the Swiss decree.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>We are indeed well aware of our simplicity in this matter, and we would gladly use the counsel and guidance of the learned of your church in this matter. Therefore, for the sake of your kindness, which we have experienced thus far, we earnestly ask you, since we do not doubt that this will also be proposed to you by your senate, to inform us by letter how you intend to act in response to such a demand, or what seems to you the way we should respond to our senate, so that it cannot be considered that we have completely opposed it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>However, we would now wish this to be kept entirely confidential, so that those who narrated this to our Sebastian do not incur envy with danger, or that our people, if they learn of this (since they do not wish to be wise according to another's prescription), do not seem to be conciliating malevolence with obstinacy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell well in the Lord. Lingkius and Sebastian send their greetings to you. Greet in my name Mr. Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and all the others. I wish you would respond through this our letter carrier. Schaffhausen, in the year 1547, on the fourth day before the Ides of April. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine, candor, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church. Zürich.</p>
