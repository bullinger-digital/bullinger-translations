      <p>Greetings. The most esteemed man Pellizarius delivered both your letters and those of the illustrious man Martinengo to me.</p>
      <p>You will excuse me to Martinengo; at another time, when there is more leisure, I will write and give thanks for the book by Reginald Pole on Councils; please greet him most kindly.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you those written to you, as you wished. On the 8th of October, both Calvin and Beza write from Geneva, but they have nothing except that the affairs of the faithful in France are going very well; the king is strongly restraining the adversaries with edicts.</p>
      <p>They complain about one thing: the Guise family does not cease to exercise hatred against some pious princes, from which some movement is to be feared, if they are not restrained by the king, which is nevertheless hoped to happen.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Nuremberg report that Wilhelm von Grumbach, not without the favor of the younger princes of Saxony, has expelled the bishops of WÃ¼rzburg and Bamberg from their seats, and they have fled to Nuremberg; they are gathering soldiers.</p>
      <p>I report this to you as I heard it, I affirm nothing; I have nothing certain about this matter; but the devil likes to make noise everywhere, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I know you are busy with your Spanish conversations. 15th of October, 1563. Greet the friends.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my most esteemed and dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
