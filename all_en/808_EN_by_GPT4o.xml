      <p>I consider it pious and humane, most excellent Bullinger, to remove the innocent from slander and to counter the recklessness or treachery of informers in any way, so that truth is not oppressed by lies, piety by impiety, and the good by the wicked.</p>
      <p>After I recognized Balthasar Alter as a brother, I saw or heard nothing about him that was alien to true piety or contrary to an innocent life. Indeed, I confess openly that I have not yet seen anyone in Italy who has exercised the zeal for spreading the gospel with greater care, effort, diligence, and labor, nor who has faced graver dangers for this cause. May God grant that such a good advocate of Christ be restored to us, even though the wickedness of the impious strives with all its might to have this man expelled beyond the Sarmatians. From your letters, which I read not without sorrow, I saw how bitterly false brothers persecute him, accusing that his wife fled from him, which is utterly false; for I testify that both of them, with their child, passed through here and stayed with me for a full four months, until letters from Florence confirmed their safe passage; but now they are in a nearby small town, where they live with all piety. Regarding the accusation of bigamy, I have often heard that the other was justly dismissed for adultery. Therefore, do not believe what these informers have so falsely reported, but consider it well and love this brother, and also be willing to use me if I can gratify you in any way. Farewell in the Lord always and pray for us.</p>
      <p>Given at Calcinato on the Ides of January 1550. Most devoted to your charity, Giovanni Andrea de Ugonibus.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and learned minister of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, and to the other members of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, esteemed lords.</p>
