      <p>S. I received and read all the letters you sent, most kind Mr. Bullinger, and as I have always given thanks until now, I still do the same, asking that you continue in the future for your kindness, if you have any leisure. For I know that you are pressed by the storms of business.</p>
      <p>The insolence of the Five Cantons (Pagicorum) is certainly tending towards the destruction either of themselves or of us together. But perhaps the Lord will raise up strong men, who will act bravely and steadfastly at the next assembly and will reproach the violated Swiss Confederation (foedus Helveticum). However, my mind remains in doubt.</p>
      <p>The impious continually prevail.</p>
      <p>The war of the Duke of Savoy against the Waldensians clearly shows what will eventually happen or be hoped for. But the Lord holds the hearts and all the plans of the princes in His hand; may He be kind to us and have mercy on us. I have not yet received any more certain news from Württemberg; if any are reported, I will inform you. I am grieved by Brunner's circumstances; but the church, which he presided over, is perhaps more bitter than it should have been; if the leaders had appealed to him earlier, etc.; es liegt viel am Schieben (it depends a lot on pushing). Would that there were none who favor the Five Cantons more than the Zurichers and prefer the papacy to the gospel! Many are often oppressed by false accusations. But let these things be and farewell, etc.</p>
      <p>This, my dear Mr. Bullinger, is why I am especially writing to you now, kindly understand.</p>
      <p>An old and most faithful minister of our churches for many years, who will deliver this letter, has agreed with you. He earnestly requested that I give it to him. The reason is: He has been afflicted with a certain very bad and most dangerous disease in the tongue, indeed incurable according to the opinion of some; for they judge it to be cancer; but no one has yet openly confessed it, lest the good old man be too saddened. Therefore, when he heard that a famous surgeon from Locarno lives among you, he decided to go to him; but since he is not familiar with anyone in Zurich and wished that someone would faithfully present his case to the surgeon, he immediately thought of your authority, which is certainly very great with him; then he often heard your kindness commended by us. Therefore, so that he may have the opportunity to approach you, he requested this letter, at the same time enjoining that I ask you in his name as well as ours, that you show him kindness and go with him to the surgeon and explain his case to him; for thus he hopes to make more progress. We therefore ask that you perform this service for the old brother; we hope that as a result, the doctor will more diligently consider the matter or disease. We add this, however, even if he suffers from cancer (which we indeed fear), that neither the surgeon nor you pronounce it, but designate the disease by another name, which other surgeons have also done, and encourage him to commit the matter to the Lord; that the disease is incurable, and that this member does not easily receive medicine. But if there is any hope of healing, we pray that you encourage the doctor to provide all faith and effort and not be concerned about the fee, however large. Therefore, my dear Mr. Bullinger, do what we trust you will do, and always have this old man commended to you along with us as you have hitherto. We have no news, except that the most constant rumor is that the Emperor of the Turks is dead and that a certain vicar or successor of his is seeking Ancona with a very heavy army; if he captures that port, the way to Italy is already very wide open. Meanwhile, while we meditate on war, dissensions, the Turk will break in.</p>
      <p>May the Lord graciously avert what harms His church. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Simpertus greets you.</p>
      <p>Greet all our supporters in our name.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, December 2, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, most venerable.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
