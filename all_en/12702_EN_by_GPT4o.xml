    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Here are once again the promising young men [Johannes von Ulm and Augustin...] recently recommended [with letter no. 2644]. Bullinger's charming letter [not received] makes a renewed recommendation by Blarer, his brother [Thomas], and the cousin [Konrad Zwick] completely unnecessary! Blarer writes from Griesenberg, which he reached late at night today. The young men want to set off for Zurich early in the morning. Bullinger's study and lecture plan, which he enclosed with his last letter, is liked by everyone because it neither overburdens nor underburdens the young men. Bullinger, the host [...] or whoever may wish to advance money to the young men if needed. All expenses will be conscientiously reimbursed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Upon Blarer's departure from Constance, there was nothing new except for the skirmish on Saturday or Sunday [30th/31st October], in which [the Schmalkaldic League] initially, despite being fewer in number, gained the upper hand and killed many enemies. Among the victims were also three nobly dressed men.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is reported that Emperor [Charles V] broke camp in the fog. His exact destination is not yet known. He seems to be heading towards Regensburg. He has had several pieces of artillery transported downstream on ships. Bullinger will probably already have been informed about this by the letter from the Constance council [dated 3rd November] and otherwise. The foreign troops at Bregenz are also withdrawing. Oh, if only we could soon be rid of this enemy! Where will he appear again?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] On the 5th of November, Blarer returns to Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer's brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm] and his wife [Barbara, n√©e Blarer] send their regards.</p>

      <p>Here, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, are once again these young men of great promise in everyone's judgment, whom I would recommend again, if you had not already closed that matter with your most loving letters to me and thus to my brother and cousin, so that now we must not further recommend them, but (because you have valued our previous recommendation so highly and made it so effective) we must rightly give you the greatest thanks; which we have diligently done otherwise. For I write these things from Griesenberg, where I arrived late at night today, and the good young men affirm that they will leave at the break of dawn. In short: We do not doubt that they will be like sons to you. The plan of studies and lectures there, which you wrote to me about in your last letter, is pleasing, and I do not doubt that you will manage everything according to your judgment in this matter, so that these excellent talents, adorned with a rare piety, are neither overwhelmed by the multitude of lectures nor become barren by their scarcity. I also very much wish to ask you that either you or that good man who will provide for their sustenance, or someone else, will pay on their behalf if they need anything, as they certainly will for many reasons. For it did not seem right to send them off with money for many reasons. Everything will be repaid to you in good faith as soon as you inform me or my brother what has been spent on their behalf.</p>

      <p>There is nothing new since I left Constance, except that there was a skirmish on the last Saturday or Sunday, in which our people reportedly held their ground excellently, even though they were initially much fewer than the enemy. They killed many enemies. Among the slain enemies, three noble and costly garments were found. Some they took away.</p>

      <p>Also, news has come that the Emperor has risen in a fog and broken camp. But it is not yet known exactly what he intends, except that it seems he is heading towards Regensburg. He has had some artillery transported down the Danube, but you will probably already know about this, as you have written about it from my lords and elsewhere. The foreign troops stationed at Bregenz are also withdrawing. Oh, let us earnestly pray and call to God that he may remove this enemy from us! If he leaves the land, all matters might be well again. We are now waiting every hour for certain news of where he will appear next.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On Friday evening, I will return to Constance, God willing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My brother-in-law and his wife, my sister, send you their most respectful greetings. Greet your household and all friends.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most observant and dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
