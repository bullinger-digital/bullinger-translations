    <p xml:id="regest1">Last night [Konrad] Hofherr arrived with letters (one of which was addressed to Blarer [not received]) and with writings from Bullinger. The letters intended for Augsburg will be forwarded by Blarer at the next opportunity. The bearer of this letter [...] will want to depart soon, before Blarer has written anything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Georg] Frölich has repeatedly expressed criticism about [Hans] Welser. With his faint-heartedness, he would have conceded everything to the Emperor [Charles V.]! Like Bartholomäus Welser, he was also one of the first in Augsburg to secure his property, his wife [Barbara, née Adler], and his children. However, in his letters to Blarer, he admits his fear but hopes that God will not abandon him. Accordingly, Blarer continuously encourages him. Only God knows Welser's true nature. Therefore, it is left to Bullinger to decide whether he wants to dedicate [his commentary on Luke] to him or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger's [“Response to the Pope's Summons to the Council”] is well-liked by Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria was supposed to announce yesterday whether he would be a friend or foe. The [Schmalkaldic League] threatened to attack him first, as they have to pass through his territory. However, Ingolstadt has been well-fortified in recent years...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- As all [Schmalkaldic] troops are moving northeast towards Regensburg, there are concerns about [the Lake Constance region and the Allgäu]. The [Catholic] neighbors could now easily raid Ravensburg, Kempten, Isny, and other places.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- In great haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] Hofherr only arrived after Blarer had written the [preceding] letter [No. 2522].</p>

      <p>Last night Curio arrived with your other letters and writings, for which I am most grateful. I will send the others to Augsburg at the first opportunity. This one wants to leave, so I have nothing to write.</p>

      <p>Frölich has informed me several times that Welser is in a very weak position. He is faint-hearted and deeply aligned with the Emperor. He has sent his wife and children away in time, and secured his property, just as Bartholomäus Welser was one of the first to leave Augsburg. However, in his letters, which he continues to write to me, I find very good Christian words. He writes that he bears the cross with difficulty, but hopes that God will not abandon him. I have written to him a lot and strengthened him as much as the Lord God has granted me grace. But Frölich thinks there is no good foundation there, and if it were up to him, he would have conceded everything to the Emperor. But I do not know and cannot judge. God knows all hearts. To Him it is entrusted! Regarding the dedication, do as you see fit. I cannot firmly set my judgment in this matter.</p>

      <p>Your response concerning the council pleases me very much.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, the Duke of Bavaria was supposed to give an answer whether he would be friend or foe. If he chooses to be an enemy, they will attack him first, as they must pass through his territory. However, Ingolstadt has been very well fortified in recent years and is not easily conquered.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We are concerned that the land up here is being left completely exposed. It is not necessary to move everything down, as our neighbors might easily raise a force and overrun Ravensburg, Kempten, Isny, etc. Truly, not everything is being considered carefully. God must make it better than we handle it. Pray earnestly for us.</p>

      <p>Given on the 9th of August in great haste. A. Bl.</p>
