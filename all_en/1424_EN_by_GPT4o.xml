      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have not yet received the bundle of letters enclosed in Oporinus's vessel; otherwise, I would share with you what the brothers from Saxony would write.</p>
      <p>In what state the people of Magdeburg are, you may ask from our Theodor. Would that they were freed with the impious enemies laid low, so that they may never return. I do not doubt that you know what the Turk is doing now.</p>
      <p>Breslau, a very fortified town with a citadel, has been captured and now has the safest access to Austria and Bavaria, and thus the Christian world will soon be overturned by the enemies of the faith; indeed, God will humble the enemies of the gospel with this rod, if they are worthy of the Lord's favor; for I do not believe they will return to the Lord after many plagues.</p>
      <p>Two bishops, the Archbishop of Mainz and the Archbishop of Trier, were received at a meal by the Bishop of Strasbourg, and during the meal, they spoke variously about the council. The Bishop of Strasbourg said: "What if the papists admit no reformation of the church, indeed, they will scarcely confirm the Interim of the Emperor?" The Archbishop of Mainz replied: "If they do not want to reform the church, to reduce both prayers and songs to another order, then I will soon depart.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans do not come, as they are proscribed by the Emperor everywhere in Germany. A year ago, they consulted about expelling the preachers; but they did not dare to execute it."</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Trier interrupted the conversation, saying: "We are spending great expenses in vain, and nothing will happen. The Turk will negotiate with the Emperor, whom the French have armed," etc.</p>
      <p>Joachim Camerarius was elected by Maurice, to whom a new confession of faith was given, subscribed by all the learned in Saxony, Denmark, Breslau, and other maritime cities; for they do not want to commit themselves to the papists. Perhaps you know more about these matters.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you not to send me Peter Martyr's Annotations on the Epistle to the Corinthians, as I can buy them for less in Basel; but if you have bought them, send them and write back which books you want me to buy, and I will diligently take care of it.</p>
      <p>Soon I will send a list of new books.</p>
      <p>Why did your people not want to attend the assembly in Baden? Be strong, I beseech you through Christ, and do not give occasion for war; for the pseudo-evangelicals are not to be trusted, and the morals of the people are so corrupt that nothing healthy is to be hoped for from them. Farewell. October 7, 1551. Write back.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
