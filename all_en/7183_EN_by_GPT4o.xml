      <p>To D. Théodor de Bèze, Bullinger and Gwalther send greetings.</p>
      <p>We received with all the kindness we could muster these Englishmen commended to us through you, dearest brother. They presented us with certain writings, which we had already seen, asking for our advice and assistance, as we have considerable influence with the bishops of England. We replied that we had already done what we could, and that we could do no more; but the bishops themselves responded in such a way that it seemed their cause was not passive. We recited to them our letter to the bishops written on this matter, and the response given to us by the bishops in return. They truly claimed that it was not written in good faith by the bishops; for the matter was far different. We, who ought not to entirely discredit the bishops, men otherwise pious and upright, did not wish to fight and contend with them in the manner of blindfolded gladiators, and so we left this matter unresolved. What more is needed? It seems that from the very beginning there was an error due to excessive rigor, and as it progressed, disputes and tempers flared on both sides, so that now both sides are at fault, and it is difficult to find any remedy for this evil. Certainly, from their conversations, it appears that their minds are most hostile to the bishops, as they report almost nothing about them that is not seasoned with bitter sarcasm and reeks of Vatinian hatred. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord, that He, the moderator of hearts, may heal this miserable cause. We would be greatly pleased if they could also be persuaded by what you write among other things, that it seems to you that this evil should be alleviated by patience rather than by any accusatory complaints. And indeed, while we cannot command the bishops, we do not wish to be adversaries to those who are defending their cause and themselves plausibly before us, nor to join with their accusers, and thus we do not wish to be involved in this controversy.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, with pious compassion, we promised these our brothers that we would write to the bishops and intercede with them on their behalf: which, God willing, we will faithfully do at the upcoming Frankfurt fair. We can do nothing else at present. They also showed us a petition prepared to be offered to the most illustrious Elector Palatine. We did not deter them from this plan, if perhaps the Lord might wish to settle those unfortunate disturbances by this means. These are the things we have done with them, although we had resolved among ourselves to no longer engage in this contention with anyone either in words or writings; as we have now firmly proposed to ourselves: so if any others are coming here, let them know they are coming in vain.</p>
      <p>You would do us a most pleasing favor if you would diligently write about French affairs, about which the most astonishing rumors are being spread, especially concerning the queen. We are doubtful about these matters, and therefore we pray to the Lord to overturn the cunning and violent plans of the impious, and not only to preserve the churches from evil but to reconcile them to Himself through true faith and amendment of life. Otherwise, we fear not without reason that grave things are impending for us. I will soon take care to faithfully send the letters addressed to Zanchius through you.</p>
      <p>Balduin, about whom you write, in a public lecture in Paris, as a certain student from Paris writes to me, reproached me concerning human traditions, citing a passage from my Apocalypse, chapter 2. He also added a foul lie to his reproach, that he had discussed this matter with me, and that I had almost nothing to respond at the time: when he had only once greeted me in passing, and never discussed anything with me. But these men will not advance further, as the apostle says, for their folly will be evident to all. Farewell. Master Gwalther greets you. All the other brothers greet you. Greet also our brothers who are with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 5th August 1567.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger the elder, in the name of Gwalther and myself.</p>
