      <p>Especially trusted, beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>My dear cousin Konrad Zwick had a letter read to me, which came to him from your lord mayor Haab, about which the man is exceedingly and beyond measure distressed. Therefore, he also writes to him and urgently advises and requests him to let both matters, namely the military preparations and the negotiations regarding the accession, rest, since he has handled all this on his own without anyone's knowledge, as one rightly believes, based on his high reputation.</p>
      <p>He also diligently asked me to write to you on his and my behalf and to most diligently request you to intervene with the two lords mayors, and to ensure that neither through the secret councils nor through them, any mention of the matter is made at any Diet among other confederates, but since they want to let one matter rest, that the other also remains still; for my dear cousin is very concerned about it. And it could lead to great harm and disadvantage for him, as no one from our lords has heard any will to engage in such conditions, but my dear cousin proposed this himself as a preparation for future things, as you, being wise, can further consider.</p>
      <p>So now do the very best according to our mutual trust, so that further conflict is prevented and my dear cousin, who means everything so well and faithfully, is not brought into any trouble because of it, as it would indeed be unfair if what he handled in the best way should turn out to be the worst for him. With what is dear and serviceable to you, we ask the Lord God, with faith for us.</p>
      <p>Given, the [...] of September 1545. Your faithful brother in the Lord</p>
      <p>Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his esteemed and dearest brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Bucer wrote to me, September 7:</p>
