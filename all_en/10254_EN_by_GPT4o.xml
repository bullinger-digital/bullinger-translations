      <p>Honorable, pious, prudent, wise Mr. Mayor and gracious dear gentlemen, our friendly greetings, willing service, and whatever we might do to honor and please you, be yours beforehand.</p>
      <p>As the honorable and highly learned Dr. Martin Bucer has asked us to provide testimony regarding this letter's bearer, Mr. Beat Gering, a native of Münster in the Aargau region, and has highly recommended him, we have acknowledged to him in our loyalty that we know nothing but honor, decency, goodness, skill, and virtue about the aforementioned Mr. Beat; that he is especially graced by God, presenting His word clearly with decency; that he also taught and lived in a Christian and righteous manner in Dietikon in the County of Baden, where he was recently a preacher. From there, he has not come due to any dishonor, as the honest people of Dietikon would still prefer no one else, if it were not for the Schönbrunn bailiff's situation, than this one, etc. And since the highly learned Dr. Martin Bucer has requested this testimony, that we write to your honorable wisdom, we are willing to do so. Also asking that your wisdom will have this pious, honest man recommended, who will also (if you are not satisfied with this) bring sufficient testimony from our gracious lords of Zurich. With this, we commend your honorable wisdom to divine grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 14th day of May in 1533.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's willing servants of the word of the city of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, etc.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and wise gentlemen, Mr. Mayor and council of the city of Schaffhausen, our gracious, dear gentlemen.</p>
