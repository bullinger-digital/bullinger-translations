    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his silence. Thanks for the books dedicated to the [brothers Blarer and Zwick]. Prays to God, although the plague is to be accepted from His hand, for the preservation of the Zurich preachers. Does not want to hide anything concerning the concord; does not know if a document related to it is being printed in Augsburg. Luther is planning a theologians' convention; the people of Strasbourg also wish for a discussion, but Zwick, despite Capito's urging, does not want to participate. Supports the desire of the people of Strasbourg that the people of Zurich should now refrain from publishing a defense document. Recommends postponing the meeting [of the Swiss, Strasbourg, and Konstanz] until the return of the Konstanz envoy from the Bundestag in Schmalkalden. Asks not to write harsh letters. The people of Strasbourg are not ill-disposed towards the people of Zurich, but Bucer accuses Bullinger and the people of Konstanz of having withdrawn their approval of his document "Ad Monasterienses." Zwick assures Bullinger of his sincerity. Warns against division among the Swiss, advises a meeting with the people of Strasbourg, and asks for a quick response. [Edward Fox], envoy of [Henry VIII] at the [Schmalkaldic] Bundestag, has reported pleasing news from England in Strasbourg, but the Emperor is said to be increasingly embittered against the Protestants. Greetings. Zwick approves of the Zurich church service order, except for the Angel's greeting.</p>

      <p>May the grace of God the Father through Jesus the Son be with us.</p>
      <p>I am still alive, and I wish to live a life worthy of Christ! What I should do, the Lord knows, even the examiner of the most secret thoughts. There are several reasons for my silence, especially since I have been waiting for the opportunity to encourage you and the other brothers about certain matters, about which I am not yet as certain as I would like to be.</p>
      <p>We received the books dedicated to us and sent as a gift some time ago. Our thanks have been delayed until now, not without our embarrassment, but now we express our most abundant gratitude, and as far as I am concerned, I am completely unworthy of such praise and such a gift.</p>
      <p>What are you doing about the tyranny of the plague? We must await and endure the hand of the Lord. All the plagues of God, my brother, are nothing else but the blessing of God, for the pious, while the world perishes utterly due to impiety, we alone, devoted to Christ the Savior, will be preserved from destruction. I call upon that Father who dwells in the heavens to preserve you and the most learned and pious brothers unharmed by His goodness, lest the churches, deprived of their pastors, also perish, especially in this age, where it is to be feared that men speaking perverse things may arise from among us. We will not cease to bend our knees to that merciful Father of ours, aided by prayers, that He may not forsake you, whom He has appointed over the churches redeemed at such a great price.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding what you write to me about concord, be of a secure mind. I will hide nothing from you of those things which I consider worthy or necessary to know, provided that I am not unaware of what is being done. Whether there is any plan of concord being printed in Augsburg, I do not know at all, but I understand that the matter stands thus.</p>
      <p>Luther desires a meeting with the principal ministers of the churches. The people of Strasbourg also lean towards this matter; they think on both sides that a discussion about establishing the church will be beneficial in many ways. Capito asks that I do not avoid the trouble of the journey. But I am not one who can or wants to attend a gathering of learned men. I simply strive for the truth and do not understand those subtle thoughts about establishing the church. But let the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg also write to me that they fear nothing so much as that you might disturb Luther, who has become more favorable, with some untimely apology; then, that you might refuse the meeting if called to counsel. Therefore, they ask that I fulfill the duty of a brother towards you and obtain your mind in this matter, which I have promised to do. Hence, I urge you again and again to withhold any apologies you have conceived for a little while, until you hear what the outcome of the congregation will be. Then I pray as diligently as I can that you do not absent yourselves from a friendly meeting, if you happen to be called. And I wish I could promise those two things to the people of Strasbourg in your name! There will always be time to write apologies when those others have noted you and given just occasions. We will also encourage the giving of an account of your faith. Do not start and let private letters and other useless things not move you. Endure and watch and hold yourselves in the matter as it goes, so that the honor may be on your side, and whatever you do afterwards, that pious people may say you were necessarily compelled to do so.</p>
      <p>Hence, if you are going to hold a meeting, I beseech you to examine this matter diligently. I wish you would indeed postpone this meeting of yours for a little while, until our envoy returns from Schmalkalden! For the princes and cities of the Christian league will meet on the sixth of this month, and something new will certainly be brought to us. Among other things, the renewal of the league will be discussed, if falsehoods are not being told. After the return of the envoy of our city, I promise either myself or my brother will be present with you. But if that expectation seems unwise to you and there are reasons to hasten the meeting, make sure that the appointed day does not escape me. For it will be in the interest of both your cause and the whole evangelical cause that I know. I anxiously ask that you do not undertake anything in the meantime without our knowledge. We are sincere towards you and do not ask anything from you with deceitful lips, but we would wish everything to be done with benefit.</p>
      <p>Also abstain from harsher letters; for many things are written that do not contribute to the matter, which finally lead the minds of the brothers into I don't know what suspicion, and not all are trustworthy to whom it is written, and certainly not a few are found, some of whom, through zeal, some through imprudence, cause dissension among the brothers.</p>
      <p>You might suspect that others wish you less well. But I hear nothing of the sort from the people of Strasbourg. They testify how far they are from all enmity. Bucer is only somewhat offended that you, Bullinger, in a letter written to him, commended a book dedicated to the people of MÃ¼nster to many, because it expressed your mind in it, because it bore witness to your spirit, but later you either dissimulated or even denied it. This inconsistency is also reproached to us by the good man, although there is no lack of means to wipe away this stain.</p>
      <p>They also earnestly urge me to guard you from all disdain towards them, then to make you more ready for conversation, and finally to delay the apology for a time, by which the pursuit of unity might be offended. Therefore, I trust that you will not unwillingly comply and I promise myself that I have already obtained everything from you, since I am as far as possible from all deceit and whatever I do, I do with the best faith.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I want to remind you of this: Beware that the people of Bern and Basel do not disagree with you. For there are those who think that the brothers of Basel have gone with all their feet into the opinion of certain concords. Vadianus is also suspected by others, they say we alone oppose. Now if the arguments for concord are such as can be accepted by the people of Basel, certainly they can also be accepted by you. If they cannot be accepted, prevent them as well and ensure that you agree as best as possible among yourselves. Resist Satan, who will triumph greatly if he sows coldness among you. Hence, some think it would not be unwise if you were to hold a meeting in Basel, having called the people of Strasbourg to you, from whom you would understand all the plans of concord, and they would have no reason to complain about you, as if you were avoiding the opportunity for a conversation.</p>
      <p>But to say it in one word: First, Bullinger, respond to this letter as quickly as you can. Then do not attempt anything without our knowledge. What I ask is not out of arrogance, but out of my trust towards you and your exceptional goodwill towards me.</p>
      <p>I add to these things what has been reported to me from Strasbourg about the envoy of the King of England. He conferred with the learned for three days. He is a learned, sharp bishop and, as he appeared to good men, also pious. He has a mandate to the princes and cities of the Christian league, but he did not indicate about what. He testified that by the common opinion of all the leaders, the tyranny of the Roman pontiff has long been and is completely eliminated. He spoke very sharply with the people of Strasbourg about the papal monarchy and complained heavily that the ecclesiastical matters seemed to be handled by them more inconsistently, on whom, however, his king looked as the leaders of religion. He also produced some writings of Philip and Bucer to them. Just as these happy things are reported about the Englishman, so some sad things are reported about the emperor; for they say he is becoming more and more embittered against us.</p>
      <p>Hence it would be in the interest of the evangelical cause if we could come together in the Lord without offending the truth.</p>
      <p>Share this with Pellican, Theodor Leo, the most trustworthy brothers. May the Lord preserve you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>December 3, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>In the matter of the church rite, nothing displeases me. However, I would wish the Angel's greeting to be omitted, since it contributes nothing to the prayers and even provides a cause for superstition.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
