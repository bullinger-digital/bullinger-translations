      <p>Greetings. I would have gladly responded to you last week, dear brother, if I had not been suddenly almost overwhelmed by a very severe cold and thus hindered. Now, although I am not yet fully free, since our Ruinella has indicated that he will return to you tomorrow, I am writing this to you this evening to be delivered along with those things you sent to be returned. However, I pray that you do not take offense that I did not allow this sooner. First of all, I thank the Lord, who gave you victory against those pernicious enemies of yours. I pray to the Lord to stir the spirit of the magistrate, so that he may uphold the well-established statutes and not be deceived by the tales of scoundrels, and thus new troubles may not be doubled for you.</p>
      <p>But I hope the Lord will never fail you in his good cause. The cause of the Rhaetians is most pestilent and most worthy to be reduced to ashes, and indeed, the papal minion should be restrained. It is most disgraceful for him to join the papal thief against his country and church, nor are the ways, plans, and wickedness of the pope unknown to him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he has sinned more grievously, who offers himself to be led by our common enemy. Certainly, the matter of the salvation of both the church and the country is at stake. Therefore, nothing should be overlooked, and it should be dealt with most severely, so that the safety of the church and the country may be preserved and unharmed. Regarding the rest, if the Lord grants life, we will discuss it at another time, and we hope you will come to us soon. I write these hastily and send back what needs to be returned. May the Lord bless you and yours and keep you from all evil. Please diligently greet the honorable councilors and the rest of our friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, December 9, on which day the fortieth year of my calling and ordination to this Zürich church is completed; for by the common votes of the ministers, the senate, and the deacons, I was appointed in place of the blessed memory of Zwingli on this very day in the year of our Lord 1531, having previously delivered my first sermon to the people in the great temple on November 23. May the Lord bless my ministry and guide me according to his most holy will!</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the Chur church, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
