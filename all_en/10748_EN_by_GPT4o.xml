    <p xml:id="regest1">Of the last three books of his chronicle, he can only send the last one [Book 9]; he would like Bullinger to procure some documents that he is missing for the completion of the seventh and eighth books. He has bound the first six books into a large volume today with Matthias Hirzgarter. He requests to hand over the enclosed pages to Hans Füssli and to assure him of the possible printing of an abridged version of the chronicle.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, as you have requested in the past, to send you the last three books of the chronicles, I am sending you only the very last one, for the reason that the other two, namely the 7th and 8th, are not yet completely finished, as I am still missing something: In the 7th, the Battle of Marignano, also the uprising of the Zurich communities, and the Emperor's campaign in Milan. Therefore, in the 8th, I am still missing the Pope's campaign, also the Battle of Bicocca, also the Yttinger legal case and therefore all the alliances of the Christian city, etc. Now I would like you, as much as it is somehow possible for you, also at times when you are most at leisure, to negotiate with the city clerk for the copies of the citizenship letters and for the Yttinger case (if it is possible to do so), then I would come to you upon your invitation (request) or writing and transcribe the things. Also, I am missing the entire Solothurn affair, etc.</p>
      <p>The first 6 books I have noted so excellently that they are no longer the same in many places. I have now, at the date of this writing, handed them over to Matthias Hirzgarter and helped him bind them. It is the largest book I have ever seen. Now, however, I would also like to bind these; given the difficult times currently at hand, they are not yet complete, and without your and others' help, they cannot be advanced to binding. When they are ready, they shall always serve you before anyone else.</p>
      <p>I am also sending you herewith several pieces with Hans Füssli. You should hand them over to him and discuss them with him in a friendly manner, indicating that we have bound the first books and have not yet brought anything of this time to an orderly conclusion, etc. If it should happen that we would publish another copy in print, then we would also share with him the content of the last books, according to the content of that extract, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Given at Töss, January 3, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Io. Stumpf has signed.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of Zurich, his brother in the Lord.</p>
