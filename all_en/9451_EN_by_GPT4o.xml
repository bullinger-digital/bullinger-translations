      <p>Greetings. Since in your letter, dear brother, received today, you make no mention of the letters I sent to you and to Mr. Campell eight days ago, I am in doubt whether they have been delivered in good faith. I believe they were entrusted to a certain citizen of yours; perhaps they were delivered after your letter was written.</p>
      <p>Again, I pray for a blessing from the Lord for you, your wife, and children, that your bath may be healthy and most fortunate for you. With your letter, I also received Mr. Lentulus's collection of various things, which he has from Naples, Rome, Milan, and the city of the Venetians; I am greatly delighted by them, thank him very much for his effort, and wish him well. May the Lord bless him. At the same time, I also received the diligent description of the certainly horrendous prodigy from heaven by the most distinguished Mr. Jecklin, along with the picture of the same and your and our Campell's poems. I sent all of them, as you ordered, to our Haller, who has now returned them to me; I immediately sent them to our Gwalther. Whether it can be printed, I will not say now; for we are waiting for Froschauer to return from the Frankfurt market by Michaelmas. I will deal with him diligently. If he agrees to print it, it will be shown to the censors; but if he refuses, as he is indeed difficult, I will inform you, in case you might like to send all of it through me to Basel to our Johann Baptist Müller of Rhaetia, who can arrange for this prodigious Rhaetian history of yours to be printed in Basel.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news either from France or from Belgium or elsewhere. The king's pacification mandate has been printed in French in Lyon, which you have undoubtedly seen long ago; for your envoy could have had it early. If you have not yet seen it and remind me of it, I will send you its German version.</p>
      <p>Greet your family, Mr. Campell, Mr. Victor; the consuls, Mr. Gregor, Mr. Belinchet, Mr. Pontisella father and son, and all our other friends. Farewell with all yours. I will ensure that your relative Aerni understands your goodwill and stable friendship towards him.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 18th September 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I wonder why you signed your surname as Götz. Until now, I thought you were called Egli from your family; but now I finally understand why you are called Iconius; perhaps Egli is an acquired name, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Iconius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To the pastor Mr. Tobias at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
