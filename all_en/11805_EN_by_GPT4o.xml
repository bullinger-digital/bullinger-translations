    <p xml:id="regest1">Has transcribed Oecolampadius's sermons on the Lamentations of Jeremiah into German, but the Basel printers lack German letters; asks Bullinger to inquire with [Christoph] Froschauer about a possible publication; during the review, Bullinger would also gain insight into Capito's emendation. Today [on July 4th], Philipp von Hertenstein was promoted to Doctor of Medicine with great pomp; thunder and lightning showed God's displeasure over the infidelity [of the former pastor]; no wonder the clergy are falling into disrepute! Theodor [Bibliander] should also be informed of this; regards. Bullinger will soon receive the anatomical work [“De humani corporis fabrica” by Andreas Vesalius]. [Postscript from July 12th:] Today, Cellarius [Martin Borrhaus] wants to defend himself against the accusation of Anabaptist heresy before pastors and the university; he hopes for a theological chair and is supported by the relatives of his bride from Basel; similarly, Karlstadt has already tried to dissemble, but [the councilors] will exercise caution as once bitten, twice shy. Gast sends the “Epitome” [by Vesalius] and soon the entire work. Vesalius sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have transcribed Oecolampadius's sermons on the Lamentations of Jeremiah into German, but our printers lack German typefaces; therefore, I would like you to speak with Froschauer on my behalf to see if he would be willing to print them; and it would be even more appreciated if you could review them as well. In these sermons, you will see the spirit of Oecolampadius.</p>
      <p>You will also see what Capito has corrected. They would not exceed 16 or 20 pages.</p>
      <p>Today, Philipp von Hertenstein was created a Doctor of Medicine with the applause of our masters. He wore a silk garment adorned with precious furs and a gold ring, though I do not know if he wore silk shoes, as I stood at a distance when he emerged from the college. He had three trumpeters preceding him, continuously playing in praise of this doctor. Following was the beadle with a silver scepter, then the doctors in silk and purple, delicate men. The Lord God also applauded from heaven with thunder and lightning so frequent as never before this summer, surely reminding the man of his infidelity. What do you think he aspires to? This is to go from horses to donkeys. This is to deny the poor Christ and to want to please the world. It is deeply regrettable that he was made a doctor so quickly. Our people love the money that poor man spent. He is now a doctor of medicine, but not of divine scripture, a servant of the sick, not of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>These things happen in the school of the evangelicals! O God, forgive us our sins! It is no wonder that the ministers of the churches are accused of greed, pride, arrogance, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Share this with Theodor as well, whom you should greet in my name. July 4, 1543.</p>
      <p>You will soon receive the anatomical work.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Today, Cellarius wants to clear himself before the brothers and the leaders of the academy of being the author of any perverse doctrine, not attacking paedobaptism, and that he is ill-reputed among many for I don't know what sects and perverse doctrines.</p>
      <p>The theological lecture is vacant, and he has added his soul to this, and for such a reason, he has established it, so that he may be supported by his friends, whom he has from his new bride, who is from Basel. Certainly, we must be cautious here. Karlstadt imposed on us in the same way and with the same words. They know how to simulate and dissimulate until their wings grow. But I commit that matter to the Lord and our fathers; the burnt child fears the fire very much. I am sending you the epitome, and soon I will send the entire work with beautiful illustrations selected from all.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. July 12.</p>
      <p>Dr. Andreas Vesalius sends you his most respectful greetings. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
