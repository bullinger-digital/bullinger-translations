      <p>War is the mother of all misfortune, I have always said. I am so unbelievably busy; thank you for all your loyalty and love. I cannot and do not know how to proceed in a few hours, which is why I did not want to delay your messenger; I will write you the history later; for I have so much to run, to hurry, and to comfort, that it is beyond my ability.</p>
      <p>We are in severe trials. My dear brother and the other envoys have not come, and their departure is based on the letter that our lords, both small and large councils, along with the entire community, have sent to His Imperial Majesty, namely: His Imperial Majesty sees well that those from Sostentz do not need reconciliation; therefore, His Imperial Majesty suspends all proceedings, and they should ride home under the protection that His Majesty has given them. Thus, they have departed; however, they have asked the Bishop of Arles to be a faithful mediator with His Imperial Majesty; for they desire to do and bear everything that may be seen with God. He has graciously accepted, but they are poorly comforted. Praise be to God in eternity, that all is well! For dying and perishing is less to me than having such grace as those who have been reconciled.</p>
      <p>When our envoys were not far from Memmingen, they encountered a Spaniard who had soldiers with him from Ravensburg. The last among the soldiers recognized the guild master Labhart, one of the envoys, and whispered to him that our suburb Petershausen had been burned and many of our good people had perished; he had to ride ahead quickly so that he would not be suspected, and thus they were warned by God to ride to Lindau (where it still stands upright and firm); otherwise, they would have ridden to Meersburg, where we then worry that it would have been a trap for them, since the emperor's protection for our side did not sound different to the other estates than that they should let our envoys come to them (but not from them) in peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Today someone from Strasbourg, one of our citizens, has come and brought a...; it is said that a strong force is moving up here. I cannot write, for I must go. Everything is in turmoil and upheaval. Many pious confederates would gladly help us if they could. Oh God, I fear that your punishment and rod are also at the door. The measure of us all has become full; the hour of visitation is at hand. May God grant us to fight valiantly and to overcome all adversity with patience!</p>
      <p>Oh, how full is my heart! But I cannot. I am sending you a list of those who have perished, but not completely; I am constantly learning more; they have fought valiantly and have killed more than have perished, including their leaders.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I will write more; bear with me. I have not been able to speak to the young man as I would have liked. Praying, begging, watching over us and you with care; surely it is closer to you than you believe. My heart is firm; I also earnestly desire to die and to be with those who have overcome in the Lord. Greet all people. August 9, 1548.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
