      <p>Greetings. I earnestly beseech you, my most esteemed and dearest Bullinger, that when you first write to Geneva, you ensure that the packet, which I am sending here, is delivered to our Calvin or Beza along with your letters; and to the messenger, who serves us more diligently here, you will give the two enclosed notes here; for I absolutely do not want them to be lost or intercepted, as they contain not only my own, but also the entrusted letters of other friends.</p>
      <p>There is no news, except what I send here, copied from the letters of some friends. You, in turn, share with me in your usual manner what you have, especially from France. For the carriers from Constance, returning from you to Constance, usually spend the night at the village of Felben, from where anything written or sent from either Zurich or Winterthur is brought to me without difficulty.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable soul in Christ, whom I ask to be present with your faithful patronage.</p>
      <p>Greet your household with all the brothers and sisters. My dearest wife, sister, and children greet you with great reverence.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you have already learned from friends about the miserable fate of Heinrich von Ulm, whom all who knew him deeply mourn.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
