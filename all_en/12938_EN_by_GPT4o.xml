    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Thamer is heavily occupied with his work in school and church, but he takes the opportunity to respond to Bullinger's friendly first letter [HBBW XVIII, No. 2675] with these messengers [Johannes and Justus Vulteius], so it does not appear as if he has forgotten the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] So far, God has allowed the enemies of the cross to prevail widely and unexpectedly due to the failings of the [Protestants]. Hopefully, this will soon come to an end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is also the question of why the church ministers are so disreputable among the people and are pursued with the "hatred of Vatinius." Thamer is often told to his face that the situation will only improve when all the priests are hanging from the gallows! To these critics, he counters with the story of the High Priest Caiaphas and the Jews (who called for the execution of Christ, killed him and the apostles, but then lost [Jerusalem] and their temple), warning them that something similar might happen to them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Currently, the rich are moving their possessions to neighboring towns, to the territories of the Archbishop of Mainz, Sebastian von Heusenstamm, and are being naturalized there for a lot of money, without Landgrave Philipp of Hesse knowing anything about it. For this reason, Thamer has written the enclosed small treatise, showing that a true Christian should not flee, especially not to the ungodly followers of the Pope, who might be led to believe that the defectors have changed sides not only with their feet but also with their minds! Bullinger should openly write his opinion on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] God's spirit has seized the Landgrave again, so that he is now preparing. Allegedly, he is going to the [Rhine] bishops, the envoys of the Antichrist, next week. May this serve the edification of the church! We humans can prepare the horse, but God alone grants success. He will not abandon His church. He chastises it in this world to then provide it with comfort in eternity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Apart from the sad news about the expansion of power by Emperor Charles V, there is nothing new.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] These two young students are recommended to Bullinger, even though they would probably recommend themselves to him through their piety and good conduct.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther and Otto Werdmüller, to their wives [Regula, née Zwingli, and Magdalena, née Gessner], as well as to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler]. If appropriate, also greet Theodor Bibliander and the other colleagues unknown to me.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Although I am currently occupied with various and indeed serious matters both in school and church, most learned man, your kindness, which I recognized as remarkable from your first letters to me, and the opportunity provided by the messengers, compelled me not to neglect writing to you for the sake of friendship, lest you think I have entirely forgotten you and your brothers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>God the Father has so far granted the enemies of the cross a triumph as broad as it is unexpected (unerwartet, unvermutet) due to our sins, which I hope will soon be reversed and indeed perish even sooner. Amen.</p>

      <p>Thus, we ministers of Christ's church are poorly regarded by the ignorant masses and suffer from Vatinius-like hatred. I am often confronted with this reproach: "Things will not improve unless all the priests are hanged," etc. To which I respond with the story of the Jews, that Caiaphas and the rest of the Jewish crowd plotted against Christ; however, just as they lost their place and temple for killing Christ, the Son of God, and the apostles, so it will be with you if we are destroyed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The wealthiest among us are not only moving their possessions to the nearby towns of the Archbishop of Mainz, but are also buying citizenship there at great expense, unbeknownst to our prince. This has moved me with zeal for God to write a treatise on fleeing, in which I argue that Christians should not flee, especially not to the impious papists, who celebrate a triumph over us and our arrival, as if we had conceded to them not only with our feet but also with our minds; may God avert this from us for a long time! I send you this treatise, asking you to freely write back your opinion, as nothing could please me more.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The illustrious prince has been stirred again by the spirit of God the Father through Jesus Christ and is arming himself with weapons. I hear that next week he will be going to the bishops, the angels of the Antichrist. May God grant that this serves the edification of the church and the glory of His name. Amen. We prepare the horse, but God grants the blessing. Yet I firmly believe that He will not abandon His church. He afflicts us for a time here, so that He may comfort us in eternal ages.</p>

      <p>There is nothing new here except sad news about the tyranny of the Emperor.</p>

      <p>I commend to you these two young men, although I have no doubt they will commend themselves to you through their piety and natural conduct.</p>

      <p>Greet Walther and Otto and your and their wives. If it would be pleasing to Bibliander and the other brothers, convey the same from me, though unknown to them, in my words.</p>
      <p>Given in Marburg, on the 27th of April, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Theobald Thamer,</p>
      <p>your brother in the Lord with all my heart.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and doctrine, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, professor of sacred theology and Antistes of the church in Zurich, his most beloved lord and brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
