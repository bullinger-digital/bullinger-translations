    <p xml:id="regest1">Heinrich Bullinger learned from the Zurich envoys [Werner Beyel and Kaspar Nasal] that [at the Basel meeting on March 27] the [First Helvetic] Confession was agreed upon and it was simultaneously decided not to publish it; furthermore, the recognition of the Tetrapolitan Confession was considered. Bullinger approves of this as far as he has read it, but he does not yet know [Bucer's] Apology [of the Confession] and wishes for a copy. Pope [Paul III] is said to have planned the capture of Emperor [Charles V], which is why he remained in Naples and is preparing. The envoy of the French King [Francis I] [Louis Daugerant, Lord of Boisrigaut] is displeased with Zurich's refusal to allow mercenaries to pass through. Kaspar [Nasal] and [Itelhans] Thumysen were dispatched to Aarau to judge the matter of the [Solothurn] "bandits." Bullinger sends greetings to Grynäus and intends to write to him. [Thomas] Platter is to send the remaining part of the volume with letters [from Oecolampadius and Zwingli].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hear, my Myconius, that our confession has pleased everyone, except that the people of St. Gallen and Schaffhausen have proposed something, I know not what. Furthermore, it has been decided by all that it is better not to publish the confession than to let it go public. Here, significant and numerous reasons have been brought forward, especially that many other confessions already exist. Moreover, the opponents might seize upon this abundance and variety as an argument for discord and slander. Finally, it seemed most religious, advantageous, and useful for the cause and for all of us, and indeed the safest, if our churches declare that they are pleased with the confession of the four cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau, which was presented to the Emperor at Augsburg. This has been sufficiently weighed, defended by an apology, and also accepted by the Elector of Saxony. Thus, the whole matter will be taken care of. You have what our envoys have reported. Copies of the confession and the German apology are expected, which will be read in the senate of our cities.</p>
      <p>The confession, as far as I have read, is not displeasing; I have not yet seen the apology. Hence, I ask you to send it by the next messenger, or even by this one, if found at the printers. See that you do not neglect my request.</p>
      <p>It is said here that the Pope has prepared chains for the Emperor, with which he intended to bind the poor man if, as was expected, he had come to Rome, but being timely warned, he has remained in Naples and has equipped himself with soldiers and arms.</p>
      <p>The French envoy has asked our people to allow mercenaries to pass through the countryside and the city; however, this was denied by our people. This he took badly and withdrew with great indignation. For he saw that there was no hope left for him with us.</p>
      <p>On the day towards Aarau, messengers were sent, Master Kaspar, who is with you, and Master Thumysen, to judge the matter of the bandits, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with yours. You will greet Grynäus, my very dear brother, a thousand times, to whom I will write shortly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 4, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Tell Platter to send me the remaining part of the letters with this messenger; the last letter I have is n, fol. 52.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the first preacher of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
