      <p>Greetings. In your recent letter, my dearest godfather in the Lord, there was a gift included, which you sent to Johann Heinrich, your son in Christ. For this, we give you great thanks and pray to the Lord that through good health and a long life, you may someday demonstrate the duty of a faithful godfather towards him. As for me, you would not believe how this winter I have been worn down by the discomforts of old age beyond what I have been accustomed to, from which I am gradually returning to myself. I acknowledge, however, that it is a sin due to my own negligence; I neglected myself at the beginning of winter, for which I later paid the penalty of negligence.</p>
      <p>I have heard about your health from others; I sympathize with you, your church, and your household. And unless I am mistaken, what happens to many wise and great men has also happened to you: unremitting labor weakens not only the body but also the strength of the mind and consumes in one year what could have sufficed for many, and thus it inconveniences not only you but also the church. We know there is a measure in things; however, no matter how learned we are, knowing better, we do worse. I hope, however, by the grace of the Lord, that there has been a turning point in your illness and disease, and I believe the prayers of the faithful there are very effective in the sight of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that He may soon restore you to His church. It would be most welcome if someone from your family or friends would write a few words about the hope and state of your health.</p>
      <p>I commend you to the grace of God. Greetings to your entire household; my wife and children greet you all. Bern, January 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Zürich church, his dearest lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
