    <p xml:id="regest1">Ulrich Eckstein's return from Murten to Zurich occurs without his own fault, but because the sick pastor of Murten, Hans Sebastian, was assured support from Bern. Haller requests a response to his letters and Bullinger's notes on the rhetorical structure of the Pauline letters. Bullinger's writing "De studiorum ratio" is being copied by Christian Danmatter; it should be returned to Zurich at the next opportunity, perhaps by the cloth merchant Burckard. The punishment for adultery was set at only 3 days, not 4, in Zurich's letter to Bern on September 8, 1533; Haller regrets the disagreement between the two cities. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>That Ulrich Eckstein returns to you, dearest Heinrich, is not his fault, but because Sebastian, who has been ill for several months and is certainly exhausted both financially and physically, has been assured support by the brothers, who are called capitulars, who have a deacon, and Megander has obtained from the Murten council that he no longer needs anyone's help in the ministry of the word. Furthermore, Sebastian's means of living are not so great that he could support either Ulrich or anyone else. Therefore, we commend him to you again, so that it will never be to his detriment with you that he is sent away by us at this time.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am eagerly awaiting a response to my last letters. For nothing could ever be more pleasant to me in this life than when I see you present in letters and books. How I wish you would share with me what you have compiled on some of Paul's epistles, namely the arrangement of Paul's speech!</p>
      <p>Your booklet on the method of study is now being copied by Christian Danmatter, the parish priest in Gerzensee, who is truly a pious and learned man and holds no other opinion of you than I do. I often urge him to write to you, but out of modesty, he does not dare.</p>
      <p>Make sure that you never leave me without your letters and books. I certainly feel the progress, even as I am growing old, which I owe entirely to you.</p>
      <p>Some of the archers have traveled to your city without my knowledge. There are certainly among them those who will not refuse to bring something to me. Also, Burckard, the cloth merchant, will come to the Martinmas fair, whom I also inform you about. For I will send the booklet back with him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the letter about the punishment for adultery was written not for four, but for only three days. I have no doubt that if it had been written as it was supposed to be, it would not have been necessary. I write this on our behalf, for the disagreement between these two cities pains us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Heinrich, with the health of both mind and body, which I pray for you daily from the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Leo, and all the colleagues.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 18, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, his dearest brother.</p>
