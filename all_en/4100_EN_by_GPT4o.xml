      <p>Greetings. I have not written for a long time, reverend father in Christ, because nothing new has been brought to us in the meantime, and because we were daily expecting your letters, in which we would be informed about the state of Germany. I know indeed that you have written to the honorable orator, but with great haste, since we had previously heard that the Scots had been reconciled to the King of the French, yet with religion preserved. However, that reconciliation was not so pleasing to Cardinal Lorraine, because he thought it was a bad example; nevertheless, he received a response from the king that he does not usurp authority over minds, but over bodies and fortunes, and since the Scots offer these two, he would be content with them for the present. This was recently reported by the legate, but he seemed to have some doubts, as he had not received this information from the court, but only from a rather obscure rumor. From Italy, it is written that about a thousand men were drowned in the Tripolitan expedition due to a storm. Cardinal de Guise (I think Tournon) protested in Rome in the assembly of cardinals that his king would not consider the election of the pope valid unless they awaited the arrival of the French and would reclaim the church's goods in France.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's orator urged the cardinals to elect a man of proven life, who, before taking possession, would agree to hold a free general Christian council as soon as possible in Germany, under the very laws that the Protestants demanded; if this is not done, he foresees and even predicts the ruin of the papacy. Meanwhile, it is announced that the pope has been created, Cardinal of Milan (the brother of the deceased Castellan of Meaux) from the Medici family, and his creation will be considered valid only if he renounces all civil jurisdiction, content with ecclesiastical and spiritual authority, and thus this creation was proclaimed to the Roman people by a herald. However, the cardinal is said to refuse to accept the papacy under these conditions, although he is reported to have anxiously sought it. These things are currently being reported.</p>
      <p>The messenger of Mr. Gesner came to us at a time completely unsuitable for his purpose; for who would now gather herbs in the mountains, when their peaks lie covered with snow and frost? He will return to Zürich through us and then deliver our letters along with some sods to Mr. Doctor. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, for as long and as happily as possible. All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>These things hastily.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 9, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zürich, his lord and patron, always to be respected.</p>
