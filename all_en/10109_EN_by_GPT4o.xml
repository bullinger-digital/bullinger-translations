    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the sent works of Bullinger, provides an account of Gryn채us' view on church discipline; however, aligns with the Zurichers on this issue. Bonifacius Amerbach rejects the Eucharist. Schuler is eagerly awaiting Bullinger's commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I gratefully received the gift of rekindling our old friendship, dearest brother, and I hold it in such high regard that whenever I look at it, I seem to see you in person. For in this gift, which you send according to your estimation, you greatly assist the efforts of my studies; you so cheer my spirit that I seem to myself to be truly blessed. Since you certainly act as one of my foremost supporters, how can my spirit towards you grow weak? Therefore, continue, noble man, to pursue your Gervasius with your former love and to support my modest efforts with such delightful encouragements, and thus make me strong among the crowds of people.</p>
      <p>Moreover, know that I am not at all weary of my duties, especially as I faithfully consider that all things are governed by inevitable fate and that God will raise His glory in ways completely unknown to the flesh.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding your request to know Gryn채us' opinion from me, take this briefly, brother. We believe that those who abhor public thanksgiving and thus are a stumbling block to the church, after sufficient admonition, should be excluded as far as the rule of charity can bear, and that ecclesiastical censure should be applied to them as to those who, either out of malice or hypocrisy, disturb the order of the church, like the disorderly. This is our opinion. On the other hand, Gryn채us argues that such people are not bound by the rope of our church, provided that no one can be expelled from the assembly, communion, unless they were once registered in it. Hence, he concludes that the ministers of the church have no right to excommunicate them. For my part, I do not see how it can be that these, I mean the papists or even those who profess our religion, can be separated by the church minister. Bonifacius Amerbach, otherwise a man of remarkable learning, agrees with the truth, yet stubbornly opposes our institution of the Lord's Supper, perhaps because he is an Erasmian, and thus he is a stumbling block to the church. We have gathered some reasons for our opinion along with scriptural passages, which we believe support our stance. Meanwhile, I am not at all reluctant to send to your charity what I have conceived, from which you can more clearly see the opinion of our Gryn채us through contrast. Our dearest brother in the Lord, Bucer, wrote to us these days about this matter, what the Lord had given, certainly not alien to our views. I eagerly await what the Spirit of God will suggest to you. Therefore, write, if you have the opportunity anywhere.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am so anxiously awaiting your laboriously restored Epistle to the Hebrews that I almost do not dare to promise myself that I will have enough life to be given the opportunity to read it to my satisfaction. You have certainly made my spirit eager, when you recently sent a specimen of your charity towards me, the Epistle of John, refined by your diligent study, so that from this I am persuaded that I hope your letters to me will return not without interest.</p>
      <p>Do not hesitate to greet your father, who has deserved well of me, your brother, and especially your wife in my name. The brothers greet you. May the Lord keep you safe in good work for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the 23rd day of March in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Scholasticus, devoted to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Erasmus Fabricius, and other brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, most faithful brother in the Lord.</p>
