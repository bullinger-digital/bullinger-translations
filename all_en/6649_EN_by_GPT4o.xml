      <p>The grace of God be with us all, Honorable and beloved lord and brother, you should not think that we have undertaken this action without your prior knowledge and good consent, indeed without informing you of all things, and have proceeded and acted alone. For when our dear lords and brothers, the servants of the church in Geneva, first brought all this matter to us with the writing of a confession, we responded to them, as you have partly read in the letter itself, partly in the brief narration, which we are sending to you herewith. We gave some response and entrusted it to a citizen of Geneva, named Tuscheron. Besides, we also gave him a letter to you, which I wrote to you with my own hand and in which I informed you of all our good intentions, to deliberate and await your approval and your counsel. Additionally, I wrote a small letter to my godfather Hans Heinrich Müßlin, to whom I sent a silver coin for the New Year, etc. But now we understand well that the letter did not reach you, although we do not doubt Tuscheron, since he delivered the letter faithfully to Geneva; it must have failed with those to whom he entrusted your letter. And we are not pleased if it has come into foreign hands. And we did not foresee the haste of our lords and brothers in Geneva. However, we can well imagine that they did it and are doing it out of good heart, for which we do not blame them. But as we have understood your and their opinion in the letters sent through the current messenger, we can and should do nothing else but inform our gracious lords, who gave us the answer today, which you will understand in the narration enclosed herewith. We are writing to Geneva about this and informing them of our lords' response in the manner you also have here in the narration, indicating that we assume you will also let them know your lords' response, so that they see the consensus of both authorities, who have not yet discussed it among themselves.</p>
      <p>And since both authorities agree that we, the three church servants, should secretly and quietly attempt through writings to establish a single, short, correct confession, we would now like to hear what they have answered to the Count Palatine, what they think of the confession included in Luther's response, and also of the confession made in Basel in 1536. They should send that to us; you and we also want to give our decision on it. And you will faithfully prepare the letters, so that we also trust you and ask you for it. This is all the matter for which we should earnestly pray to God, that He may grant us His spirit for it, etc. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, January 16, 1566.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger in the name of all other servants, etc. [?]</p>
