    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Calvin's letter [above No. 1957] and the six crowns; unfortunately, contrary to Calvin's wish, it could not be kept secret from the boy [...] that the money came from Calvin; the requested account is enclosed, the boy will report on everything else; the books from [Christoph] Froschauer cost nothing, as the librarian [Konrad Pellikan] purchased them; for the boy's support, Bullinger gave the city clerk [Werner Beyel] four crowns, and the boy two for debt payments and travel provisions; additionally, Bullinger gave [Werner Beyel] from his own funds five Zurich pounds, which corresponds to 40 batzen or two crowns less ten batzen, which Calvin or the boy's father should reimburse him; the boy would prefer to stay [in Zurich], was not very diligent in school, but has started to learn German; Calvin would do well to continue to care for him. Thanks for the good reception of the [son of Erasmus Schmid] recommended by Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through Christ our Lord. I received your letter along with six crowns from you, my most esteemed Calvin, through the public courier of our city. And I would have gladly obliged you if the courier had not handed them to me in the presence of the boy, displaying the crowns.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the boy is not unaware that six crowns were sent to me by you. Indeed, before he came to me, he had turned aside to the scribe, to whom he said again in the boy's presence that he was bringing six crowns from Calvin to Bullinger. So if anything was done amiss here, it was not my fault.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the account, which I have written on paper, as you requested. The boy will report on all other matters. Nothing was spent on the books.</p>
      <p>For through my intercession, it was arranged that the minister of the bookseller and printer Froschauer received the books for money. Furthermore, I gave four crowns to the scribe, and two to the boy for settling debts and for travel provisions, as he himself will report. Additionally, I gave from my own funds five Zurich pounds to the scribe, which is 40 batzen or two crowns, less 10 batzen. You owe me this, or the boy's father does. I gave it to the scribe so that he would not be angry, etc. Therefore, my dear Calvin, you will ensure that I receive that money at some point. There is no need for me to write much about the boy. He would have preferred to stay here. He was not very diligent in attending school. Those who know German understand what he has achieved in the German language. However, I think the boy is not otherwise bad and is rather inactive. You will do well if you do not abandon him.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write, except to thank your kindness, who so diligently takes care of the affairs of the young man recommended to you by me.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you. Greet all the brothers for us. Zurich, September 12, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful minister of the church of Geneva, dearest brother by far.</p>
