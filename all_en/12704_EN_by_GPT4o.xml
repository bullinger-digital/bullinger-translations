    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas wrote to Bullinger yesterday [No. 2656] and entrusted his letter to Myconius. He had enclosed a letter to [Hieronymus] Sailer, whom he still presumed to be in Lindau. However, he then received a letter from Sailer, through which he learned that the latter had moved to St. Gallen, which Bullinger might already know. Bullinger should therefore forward the letter to Sailer as well as the enclosed letter to [Joachim] Vadian to St. Gallen. Otherwise, Enzinas is still waiting for the decrees of the Council of Trent and for Diazâ€™s [confession of faith].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He cannot report anything for certain. Everyone tells whatever comes to their mind and what corresponds to their assumptions or expectations. It is known that lies are profitable. But such foolish talk can only be spread by excessive and terrible people! Hopefully, more pleasant news will be heard from Zurich, especially the death of this terrible ruler [Emperor Charles V], whose audacity cannot remain unpunished!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I wrote to you and entrusted the letter to Myconius. I was sending a letter to Sailer, whom I thought was still in Lindau; but later, after receiving a letter from him, I learned that he had moved to St. Gallen, which I do not doubt you already knew. Therefore, send those letters along with these to Vadian in St. Gallen by the first messenger. Furthermore, I am also expecting from you the sessions of the Council of Trent and the writing of Diaz, which I previously requested.</p>

      <p>I have nothing worthy to report to you about public affairs. Many things are thrown around in the common talk of people, but all of such a kind that neither is it pleasing to hear nor to write. Everyone spreads those talks according to the opinion they have conceived in their mind, and they think the outcome of events will be as they have imagined. To lie skillfully is praised; but to spread such foolish talk is the mark of an intemperate and monstrous mind. We hope to receive some joyful news from you, than which nothing could be more joyful than to hear for certain about the death of that most cruel tyrant. Certainly, I do not believe that this giant audacity will remain unpunished; I pray with all my heart to God that we may soon see it removed from our midst.</p>

      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 4th of November, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of God, which is in Zurich.</p>
