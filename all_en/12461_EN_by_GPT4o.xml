    <p xml:id="regest1">Once again, [Johannes Travers the Younger], the son of Johannes Travers the Elder, is coming to study in Zurich. Blasius recommends him at the request of his father, who could not write due to his many duties. Bullinger should ask Otto [Werdmüller] if Travers the Younger could be taken in as a boarder again, as both father and son greatly desire this. Bullinger should inform what [Werdmüller] demands for this. If Werdmüller cannot accommodate Travers the Younger, Bullinger should find another place for the young man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- From Italy comes the rumor that Marchese [Alfonso d'Avalos], Governor of Milan, has died these days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Greetings to Bullinger and his family. [Johannes] Comander, Mayor [Luzi] Heim, and [Johannes] Pontisella send their regards. Blasius may soon contact Bullinger again [with a letter].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [P.S.:] As Blasius was about to close the letter, Francesco Negri, who has earned merit for the Gospel, came along with his son [Giorgio?], whom he is accompanying to Zurich, and also asked for a recommendation for him. Negri will explain himself that he cannot cover the costs of this study and will outline what he expects. Bullinger should help if possible.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Greetings, most esteemed man. Behold, once again Johannes, the son of our Travers the Elder, comes to you for the sake of studies. His father asked me to recommend him to you with my letter, so that he does not return to you entirely without a letter - for he was so occupied with business that he could not write to you - although we do not doubt that he is already most recommended to you even without my letter. Nevertheless, he wished these few words to be written to you by me, therefore it will be your task to speak with Master Otto (if he wishes to receive him again as a boarder); for both the father and the son earnestly desire this; and what they will have to pay for expenses, it will be your task to declare. If not, ensure that he is joined to another from the number of students through your efforts, etc. Farewell.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>No news from Italy, except that an uncertain rumor reports that Marchese Alfonso d'Avalos, the Governor of Milan, has passed away these days. Again, farewell with your most honorable family through God, who may deign to preserve you all for a long time. Amen. Comander, Mayor Luzi Heim, Pontisella, and all good men greet you. I would greet you in my own name, but I think I will address you shortly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In haste, Chur, 7th of April, 1546. The same yours from the heart, etc. As I was about to conclude this letter, Francesco Negri came along with his little son, whom he also asserted he would take to Zurich, earnestly asking me to write to you on his behalf, which I could not refuse. For he is a man (as you know) both learned and pious and has greatly deserved in the evangelical cause; however, he does not have the means to support his son in Zurich at his own expense, as he will explain in person (and what he wishes to be done for him). Therefore, we ask you by the Lord to deign to assist him, if it can be done in any way and conveniently, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious Heinrich Bullinger, the most steadfast defender of the Catholic religion and the most faithful overseer of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
