      <p>S. P. How furiously Satan rages against the gospel of Christ can be easily and sufficiently inferred from the continuous disturbances and tumults that England itself has experienced for a year now and still continues to experience. For we can promise ourselves no end to our troubles when we consider the power of our adversaries combined with their intolerable rage. For although their conceived plans have been thwarted and hindered thus far, they do not cease to continually weave new plots to promote their stubborn intentions and bring them to fruition, so much so that the end of one evil seems to be the beginning of another. But blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has delivered us from those evils that Satan had already devised against us, and for His paternal favor, with which He pursues the king, a boy of great promise, and indeed the kingdom itself. For nothing has been so violent that it has not been timely detected; for which reason, we certainly have cause to give thanks to God Almighty, whom I earnestly beseech from the heart, that He may so strengthen us with His Spirit that we may recognize His benefit and walk in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life, lest by our ingratitude we provoke His wrath against us.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of London is now most strictly and even most sordidly detained in the most contemptible prison, where he shares a common table with the most criminal men and lives on public alms; this was done to curb the man's unspeakable arrogance, which, since it could not be restrained by these means, he is now compelled to sleep on straw, his bed having been taken away.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that he may finally come to his senses. However, he has long since been deprived of his bishopric, as I do not doubt you are aware. The Bishop of Winchester is also now more tightly constrained. May God destroy all who plot against the glory of His name. As for Master Hooper, a friend of both of us and a great admirer of the people of Zürich, I will write nothing else than that he promotes the kingdom of Christ here with the greatest zeal, which he does with the utmost faith and diligence, greater than his physical condition would allow. Do not believe, my dear Bullinger, with what benefit and with what applause from people of all ranks he conducts his ministry; for many even from the wealthier classes have been converted to faith by his preaching, and all who favor the truth, even the nobles themselves and the bishops, embrace the man.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God be with him by His Spirit, without which he could not easily bear such a great task for long, which is certainly greater than he can comfortably sustain; for he is so disposed that he can deny nothing to any mortal.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, your wife for me, Master Bibliander, Master Gwalther, Master Zwingli, Master Wolf, Master Gesner, Sebastian, and Phrysius, if you see any of them, so that in the meantime I do not omit Master Pellican, the good father, Master Butler with his wife, and our Lelius; you will also greet Master Otto in my name. Farewell, most distinguished man and revered teacher in the Lord, to whom I commend you and your ministry from the heart. The innocence of our protector, Duke of Somerset, has now begun to be evident to all, whom I hope will be more useful to the church after this chastisement than ever before.</p>
      <p>Your letter dated the last of August was delivered to me, which was most welcome to me for many reasons, and I will keep it with me as a pledge of eternal friendship between us. You, if ever leisure permits, as long as it is not burdensome, do write to me occasionally about your affairs; for in no way could you perform a more pleasing service to me. Farewell again. In London, where I now maintain a household, January 20, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours truly and from the heart, Jan Utenhove. Master Hooper sends you many greetings along with his wife, who would gladly write to you occasionally in place of her husband if she were more proficient in German.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered teacher, among the most faithful ecclesiastics in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
