    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Zeißler is not known to Bullinger, he asks Bullinger to advocate for the stay of the bearer of this letter, Lorenz Meyer [Agricola], in the country [Palatinate], in accordance with the letter from the governors and regents in Neuburg [an der Donau] to the council of Zurich, in accordance with the request of the Neuburg court preacher Adam Bartholomäus to Bullinger, and in accordance with a letter from Elector Ottheinrich of Heidelberg. By doing so, Bullinger would not only promote the improvement of the Christian community and do a favor for the authorities of Neuburg, but also help spread the evangelical truth.</p>

      <p>Worthy and highly learned, gracious Mr. Bullinger, your reverence, my special willing service, unreserved diligence prepared beforehand.</p>
      <p>Although I am neither by name nor person in acquaintance or recognition with your reverence, I have nevertheless, out of Christian love, due to the particularly high reputation and disposition, so that you should be inclined to all benevolent in Christ, could not refrain from troubling you with this my writing and at the same time to most earnestly request and plead, in the matter for which the gentlemen of Zurich, through my lords lieutenant and regents in Neuburg and then your reverence from my particularly gracious lord, Mr. Adam Bartholomäus, licentiate and court preacher in Neuburg, etc., are written and requested by Master Lorenz, the bearer of this letter, to help, promote and be involved, so that the aforementioned Master Lorenz - who has so far conducted himself in the edification of the word of God and in other ways so Christianly, honorably and well, that my gracious prince and lord, Duke Ottheinrich, Count Palatine, etc., has not only had a particularly gracious favor due to his good conduct, but has also written up from Heidelberg with earnestness to seek a way for Master Lorenz to remain in the country - may obtain and receive permission and favor. For your reverence would not only, through your promotion, accomplish and create the honor of God, the acceptance of the gospel and the improvement of the Christian community, but also do a particularly high and great agreeable favor to my aforementioned gracious prince and lord, as well as to the lieutenants and regents. Your reverence should also, not only in the indicated case, but in all other ways, as the newly and unpracticed in Christian religion and yet zealous and benevolent to plant and expand, have the evangelical truth in Christian love and command and show and prove yourself in all this, as I do not doubt your benevolent and highly reputed disposition. I desire to owe, reciprocate and earn this with my unknown services, with special willingness and all diligence.</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th of March, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Hans Ulrich Zeißler, steward in Gundelfingen, etc.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zurich, my particularly gracious dear lord.</p>
