      <p>Greetings. I am scarcely able to respond to your letters due to my relatives who are guests.</p>
      <p>Firstly, regarding the people of Saanen, Biel, and the military preparations here, I have written a few things to my brother, who will share them with you. As for our students, I will do my best to have them recalled shortly; however, I would like you to write to Mr. Haller, the treasurer, about them at some point. I do not know how many people are suspicious of everything that comes from me; as the minds of people are varied, so they interpret many things differently, according to their own inclinations. I would like them to be sent elsewhere, as I see they are providing material for discord rather than harmony, contrary to my expectations. I have always hoped well for Hofli, but he has completely disappointed me; the same goes for the other, Herlin. I still have hope for Rago, but less for Sapidus. However, I hear nothing here about you being slandered by Hofli; you will easily have him excused. I wish the dismissed doctor would not fabricate many things to cover his disgrace; but the wise easily understand the truth of the matter.</p>
      <p>I wrote recently about what happened with Zebedee and Angelus. Meanwhile, the doctor was recalled and reinstated without our knowledge.</p>
      <p>The ministers of Geneva also sent one of their number here again last week, to urge the senate and request that they be allowed either to defend themselves and their cause in person before Zebedee and Angelus or that a synod of churches be convened, in which the doctrine and the whole matter could be discussed. But neither option pleased the senate for certain reasons; a letter was sent again to the classes, urging them to cultivate peace with the Genevans. Beza was also forced to clear himself before the senate of the slander cast upon him because of some rather obscene poems he had published long ago before he came to the knowledge of the truth. Having been cleared, he was reinstated. Thus, everything is in disarray.</p>
      <p>May the Lord mend everything and grant us pious concord! Nothing has yet been decided about the collection for Locarno; I think it will be postponed until we know for certain how their affairs stand. This matter also distresses me beyond measure. This is written in great haste. You will learn the rest from my brother's letters.</p>
      <p>May all of yours be safe. Musculus, Haller, Hagius, Trempius, Die√übach, and Giron send their greetings to you in return and express their greatest thanks for the copies of the sermons sent. I have not yet received what you wrote you sent through Ampelandrus. Farewell. February 27, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your brother.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you the letters sent to Mr. Thomas Sampson; after they arrived in Lausanne, he had already departed for Strasbourg with Mr. Emanuel; I received them back from there.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
