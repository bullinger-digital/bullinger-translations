    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich thanks for Bullinger's letter from July 1st [not received] and for the support provided.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [Schmalkaldic League members] have about 40 companies, including many Swiss. However, Frölich fears that both their recall by their authorities and their high wage demands could have dire consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- All information about the war was communicated to the Zurich authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The 40 companies belong to Württemberg, Augsburg, Ulm, and other [Swabian] cities. The small cavalry is to be reinforced by joining the strong troops of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] in [Swabia] in 14 days. Then they will march against the enemy [Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [The Schmalkaldic forces] yesterday, under Colonel Sebastian Schertlin and Ensign Hans Wilpert Zoller, captured the city of Füssen belonging to the Augsburg Bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], after the enemies stationed there fled towards Regensburg the night before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Frölich cannot write more due to his many duties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], and the scholars.</p>

      <p>Most beloved lord and brother, your letter from July 1st has reached me well. I thank you for your manifold care, diligence, and effort in this Christian work to the highest degree. We will also benefit greatly from all this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Initially, we were concerned about the people (not unreasonably). However, if God wills, we will not lack in this regard. We have nearly 40 companies of good people, among whom are many, many Swiss. And many more are joining us daily. Just be concerned that the demands of the authorities and their high wages might lead to discontent. However, we will conduct ourselves appropriately towards them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your lordship in Zurich has been informed of all the circumstances of this war, both past and present.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the 40 companies of soldiers, you should understand that Württemberg, Augsburg, and Ulm, along with other Swabian cities, have as many. There is still little cavalry, but the Elector and Landgrave will be mightily strong and, God willing, will be in our lands within 14 days, ready to march against the treacherous enemy wherever he may be found.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our military forces, under Colonel Sebastian Schertlin and Ensign Hans Wilpert Zoller, captured a small town belonging to the Bishop of Augsburg, called Füssen, along with the castle yesterday. The enemies, numbering up to 7000, were stationed there but did not resist; instead, they fled towards Bavaria, to Regensburg, during the night before we reached them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>At this time, due to many duties, not more than this: may the grace and strength of the Lord remain with us. To Him alone be praise, honor, and glory forever. Amen. Greet the mayors, the city clerk, and the scholars diligently for me. July 11, 1546.</p>
