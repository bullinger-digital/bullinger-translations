    <p xml:id="regest1">Happel described his circumstances and his studies in the last letter and asks Bullinger to inform him whether he approves of them. - He urgently asks Bullinger to recommend him to the prince [Landgrave Philipp of Hesse] for a university position in Hebrew. [Konrad] Pellikan can confirm Happel's advanced knowledge of Hebrew. Paul Fagius and Bucer will also do this in letters of recommendation, so Bullinger is not advocating for an unknown and uncertain matter. - This would not be necessary if Happel did not have some envious and superstitious theologians against him, who denounce him as the worst heretical Zwinglian, trying to hinder his progress, but who are not able to refute his writings [...], and who imitate their teacher, the German Pope Luther. Only the authority of the pious prince and the fear of a public scandal deter them. Therefore, Happel and his kind are ostracized by these theologians not in public, but in private. The young people [from Zurich] who were [in Marburg] know how Happel behaved towards [the Marburg theologians]; he only achieved, through private negotiation and under the threat of being provoked into a public defense, that they refrained from public slander against [the Zurichers]; he strives for harmony, but if the [opponents] do not come to their senses, he will intervene with the help of significant men with [Landgrave Philipp of Hesse]. - Happel commends himself to Bullinger and assures him of his gratitude. - He will do what Bullinger recommends to him.</p>

      <p>S. In my previous letters to you, I explained my circumstances and studies, which I am very eager to know if they are approved by your kindness. Therefore, I humbly and earnestly beseech you to take the time to write to me briefly your judgment and advice on these matters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I also, again and again, earnestly implore you, relying on your benevolence towards me and your exceptional humanity and faith towards all, to diligently recommend me to our most illustrious prince and to show him that, among other things, my work can be of great use to his university, especially in the profession of the holy language, if needed. You can learn what I have achieved in this from Mr. Pellikan, an excellent man, and the letters of recommendation from Mr. Paul Fagius and Mr. Bucer to the same excellent prince will testify to this. Therefore, most humane man, there is no reason for you to fear that you are giving testimony about an unknown or uncertain matter. Moreover, such writings can be tempered in such a way that they are not harmful to anyone, and I have always resolved to conduct myself in such a way (as I seem to have done so far) that I do not disappoint your expectations of me and that I am judged worthy of your letters.</p>
      <p>There would be no need for these (letters of recommendation) if certain envious men and superstitious theologians, who cannot bear to look at me with fair eyes, did not exist. They, having nothing with which to brand me or bring me into disrepute, harm me by proclaiming me to be a most zealous Zwinglian heretic. If they cannot suppress or convert me, they at least believe that my progress should not be promoted and should be hindered by all means, so that I do not emerge. Meanwhile, they cannot respond to my writings or refute or confute them, and (to put it in one word) they imitate their teacher or the German Pope in this matter, unless they are moved by the authority of the pious prince and deterred by the scandal and disturbance of the people. I believe that for me and those like me, for that one reason alone, they would perhaps prohibit us from water and fire, not publicly but within private walls, as has been agitated with them so far. Your young men know what kind of person I have shown myself to be in that cause; I would like you to learn everything from them if it is in your heart.</p>
      <p>I have never publicly nor even in gatherings (as many do) raised or boasted about that cause, but I have privately discussed it with those who would publicly slander you or even undermine my reputation, biting me not obscurely; and finally, I have brought the matter to the point where they refrain from public slander against you, unless they want to provoke me to a public defense, which I am still prepared to do, unless they finally wish to return to some maturity and sanity of mind from that bitterness. Although I am most devoted to peace and concord, which if I can foster and preserve - I wanted to say first, recall, erect, and gradually confirm - I will do so with all my strength; if not, with divine help and the counsel and assistance of some great men, I will at least ensure with our most illustrious prince that those whom they cannot convict of heresy or error are not accused, slandered, or made odious.</p>
      <p>But I am carried further by the indignity of the matter than I intended. I will add this one thing: I am entirely yours, your honor, name, and reputation are far most commendable to me, and whatever benefit you bestow upon me, you will bestow it upon a man most devoted and grateful to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household, and command and instruct me in anything, and consider it done.</p>
      <p>Given from Strasbourg, January 21, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, my true lord and teacher, to be revered most sacredly. Zurich.</p>
