      <p>May the Lord of all strength strengthen us in this time of need and increase our faith. Amen.</p>
      <p>O Bullinger, unknown to me at this time, if God allows it, as His humble servant, I shall see you. At this time, I wish to warn you, as I am obliged before God and without falsehood, as I desire salvation, so take heed, against false brothers and spirits, who flee from all crosses and seek after temporal fame, desires, and greed, and when the staff is placed in their hands or does not go according to their desires, the cross comes, from their foolish heads - as is evident - spewing raging poison, lying about those who have loved them, and previously were full of glowing, false love, which, thank God, is breaking out everywhere; and truly no brotherly love is in them, but they devour each other until they are consumed. O Karlstadt or Bodenstein, God will strike and reveal them, etc.</p>
      <p>That you understand, dear brother, how Lienhardy Wirtt, the faithful, true, good witness, entrusted to you some articles, and I have sent him to you to warn you. From this, you should hold firm, for my desire, and also his and others', is to warn all brothers, especially a pious city like Zurich, etc. The Lord knows it, I speak without hate. Truly, truly, take heed. O Martin Luther, you have given them many ways without doubt!</p>
      <p>Dear Bullinger, I am currently regarded as a hostage, but hope not for long. The city is also - thank God - well, though with paternal trials. Greet the unknown bailiff of Bremgarten for me and others whom you trust. May God preserve us! I desire to know any news or how things stand, etc. My lord and brother, Doctor Fadian, has written to me that recently Strasbourg, Ulm, Constance, Basel - as he said - were in Bern, etc.</p>
      <p>Praying to God for me and for us all. I wanted to write to my lord and brother, the city scribe, for the sake of the spirit and warn him; I do not know any better way, but what you and Lienhard and also Master Hans Briner, to whom I have also written, do, as if it were contained herein, also others.</p>
      <p>May God protect you, dear Bullinger, and encourage you to rightly lead His word, to build. Amen.</p>
      <p>I wonder in which house you are.</p>
      <p>Done in the land of Appenzell, on Wednesday after St. Sebastian's Day in the year 1531.</p>
      <p>Your humble servant Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>For the sake of brevity, I have referred Master Hans Briner to this letter, to hear from you, to warn, etc.</p>
      <p>To my beloved in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the community of the city of Zurich, my gracious lord, etc.</p>
