      <p> Greetings. This woman wished to be commended to you through Herr Markus and me; although it was not necessary, since she says she is known to you, a man most ready for all acts of charity, we nevertheless commend her to you to the extent that, as much as your more serious occupations allow, you may assist her with your authority in the matter, which she will explain in person; for with such piety, you will bind both of us even more than before. Farewell with all your family. Basel, May 2, 1554. </p>
      <p> Today I received that the military leaders conscripted by the confederate princes have again been dismissed, which itself is evidence that Germany will be free from a more serious war even this summer. Meanwhile, soldiers are being conscripted by the Emperor in Trento to be led into Italy, I believe. In the province of Narbonne, it is reported that about 1000 families are preparing to emigrate, choosing voluntary exile to avoid the increasing persecution. I received with pleasure that Bernardino Ochino will go to the Rhaetians, as I hope the ministry of this excellent and most learned old man will be effective through the spirit of the Lord for the expansion of His kingdom. But you surely have already known this more correctly and fully. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> Yours, Sulzer. </p>
      <p> Markus, your fellow theologian, greets you respectfully. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and fellow theologian. </p>
