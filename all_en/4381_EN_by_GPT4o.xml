      <p>So that I may not send you nothing, my venerable and dearest brother, it seemed fitting to send the writing of our Schenck against his Ubiquitarians, and I would also send their defense against him, if that Christophorus, the shifty one, with very cunning counsel, did not continually refuse to present it. But it will soon be brought to light, from which, as it should, it will be very clearly refuted.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the letter of our Jung, which was returned to me yesterday, so that you may read it, in case there is anything in it that is still unknown to you (which I hardly believe); once read, you will return it when you have the time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, commending us diligently to Christ. Winterthur, 5th of August, 1560.</p>
      <p>Soon I will send back the supplication booklet.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Ambr[osius] Bl[arer].</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
