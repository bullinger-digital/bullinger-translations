      <p>S. D. I have long been expecting the letters I sent, written by my hand, about Polish, Italian, and English matters, my esteemed Myconius; but I have seen nothing yet.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you entrusted them to an unreliable person for delivery, or perhaps you have not yet found a suitable courier. I am expecting letters from Augsburg and Italy any day now, as well as from England. Dr. Vadianus wrote to me the other day in these words: "On the 25th of October, an honest man reported to me, who recently came from Augsburg, that at the Reichstag neither matters of the empire nor of religion have been resolved, that the princes are not coming, and those who are there are leaving again; for they say the Reichstag will be postponed until spring. Meanwhile, His Imperial Majesty is constantly ill and burdened with many ailments, so much so that the doctors are very surprised that he prolongs his life so long, etc. It is also believed that the council's discussions are mostly about how to proceed if His Majesty should pass away, and therefore much is being discussed at this time about a marriage alliance between Philip, the prince, and Ferdinand's daughter, whom he is supposed to take as his wife at Christmas at the Etsch, named Caninae Verecundiae; for since Philip and Ferdinand do not wish to see each other well for the sake of the empire, they want to make a friendship through this means, but it will turn out just as a bad matter can turn out. May God have mercy on His church." A special friend writes from Paris that a son was born to the king last summer, whom the legates of the kings of Spain, Scotland, and Ferdinand lifted from the sacred font, and the boy was given the name Charles Maximilian; thus the French king seeks the friendship of these kings, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, my most esteemed lord and brother. Zurich, 4th of October, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the Basel church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
