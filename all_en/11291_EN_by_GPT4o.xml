    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like to write more, but the messenger is in a hurry. Sends a report given to print by Bedrot about the end of a canon from Mainz [Wilhelm von Bicken]; after the death of this opponent, [Landgrave Philip] of Hesse now lives in safety. The English [King Henry VIII] seeks to join the [Schmalkaldic] League, while the Emperor [Charles V] acts against him; Gwalther expects letters from England and will soon be able to report more from there. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, most kind father, I have come across this messenger, through whom I would indeed like to write much, if he were not hastening his departure. I am sending you here the story of the canon of Mainz, which is very true; for it was sent from Frankfurt to Strasbourg and printed on Bedrot's advice, which Bedrot then sent to me. These are indeed the attempts of the priests, and these are the outcomes they receive by divine providence. Hesse now lives securely, freed from such a cruel persecutor, if it pleases the gods.</p>
      <p>Bedrot also wrote that the Englishman seeks to join the league of princes, acting against the Emperor's envoys to exclude him from the league of Christian princes. Meanwhile, the Emperor prepares to wage war against the Englishman. The Scots are urged to help. May the best and greatest God protect the king and all of England with His patronage. I cannot write more now, but I will write more abundantly and certainly more accurately through Froschauer; for he (as I hope) will bring me letters from the English.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest patron, and love me as you do. Greet in my name your wife and mother with the whole family. In Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, the day before the Nones of April 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
