      <p>Greetings. Since nothing has been brought here from our Macarius, either by letters or by rumor, I was very glad to have this messenger conveniently offered to me, through whom I might elicit something from you, if it suits your convenience. From such a long silence, we infer that nothing has been done. However, why it seemed right to cease, it is difficult for us to guess. Recently, our neighbors have threatened us more fiercely than is likely for them to remain quiet and peaceful for long. No letters now except those filled with insults and threats. Since our people are already held in anxiety by the long delay, and these new provocations are added, I would like to ask you, venerable brother, again and again, to inform me what the three cities have consulted among themselves, what they have experienced, what state the matter is in, what outcome is to be hoped for, and how long the action will be prolonged. There is no need for more words with you.</p>
      <p>Your only concern will be that this messenger does not return to us empty-handed, whom I have burdened with a book not yet completed, not to be a heavy and troublesome reading for you, but so that you may see how much leisure our printers have, who are free to publish this: also so that Dr. Peter Martyr may learn, when he sees my premature works brought to light, to release mature offspring.</p>
      <p>I do not know when you will come to us: I am indeed persuaded that you will come, and the time is already approaching, unless perhaps you prefer to delay until April. But I would not want that month to pass by. Then we will also have something from the fair about which we will have to deliberate among ourselves. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be honored by me. My colleagues and other friends send you many greetings. In turn, you will give many greetings to your fellow ministers. May the Lord protect, guide, and sustain you all.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 17th February 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and fellow minister.</p>
