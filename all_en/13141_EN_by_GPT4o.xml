    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Everything went smoothly with the forwarding of the letters. The treasurer [Gabriel Arnold] and K[onrad] Z[wick] express their thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer congratulates all the Confederates on the invitation [addressed to them by King Henry II of France] to become godparents [of his daughter Claude]. May God grant that this godparenthood benefits the Confederates and brings them good fortune!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The interesting and versatile "Swiss Chronicle" by Johannes Stumpf is extraordinarily appealing! However, it is questionable whether it will also please the people of Inner Switzerland, especially since some matters, particularly regarding religion, are addressed frankly. How much does this work cost in Zurich?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer urgently wants to know from Bullinger whether, in the matter of the Thurgau cousins [Hans Rutishauser and Dorothea Diethelm] (about which Blarer has already written and reported that the young woman was impregnated by the young man), the Zurich councilors would make an exception and allow them to marry or have a church wedding, and if so, whether the other Confederates [who, together with Zurich, administer Thurgau] would allow the couple to continue living in Thurgau. If so, the two would go to Zurich and seek permission from the Zurich councilors so that the young woman does not fall into disrepute. These young people come from good families.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] If [Joachim] MÃ¶tteli is not appropriately punished, it will become clear to everyone that the judges appointed in this matter have received bribes from him! This godless man has already managed to bribe some people with large sums of money and even boasts about it! God will appropriately punish the arrogant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On Wednesday, some councilors from Lindau came to Konstanz. They reported that they too have received a mandate [from Emperor Charles V] directed against Konstanz and are very sorry to have to comply with it because there is no way out. Consequently, the people of Konstanz must now also forgo trade with Lindau and [the income from] shipping traffic to Lindau. They are thus being increasingly cornered, despite their reconciliation request [to the Emperor], for which they are still waiting for a response daily. There are probably all sorts of machinations going on!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is confirmed that the Emperor was recently seriously ill, the doctors no longer knew if he was still alive, and therefore placed a feather on his mouth [to determine if he was still breathing].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blarer would like to know if anything further could be learned about what was said to the merchant [Andreas] Gessner [the Elder] regarding Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] He must now deliver the sermon. Enclosed is a letter [addressed to a] confidant [...] of the old Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony's chancellery, which he sent to Blarer along with a small letter he wrote. It reports that Elector Maurice of Saxony has left Augsburg for unknown reasons. However, it is heard that the Magdeburgers intend to invade his territory. The correspondent further reports that Maurice is so hated that he does not dare to look up while riding or walking.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings to Bullinger's household as well as the Zurich councilors and friends! Pray wholeheartedly for the people of Konstanz, as something dangerous is being plotted against them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [In Augsburg, they are] hourly awaiting the return of Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo, Bishop of Trento. [The response he brings back from Pope Paul III] will determine whether there will be a war between the Pope [and the Emperor] or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] May God restrain his wrath! Bullinger should send the [letters] back [again]. Blarer's people wish all the best to the people of Zurich.</p>

      <p>S. It is well with the letters you ensured were delivered, and the treasurer and K[onrad] Z[viccius] are grateful.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I heartily congratulate all of your people on this royal godparenthood (as they call it), and I pray to the Lord with all my wishes that, whatever it is, it may be happy and fortunate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The chronicle printed there, due to its delightful variety of matters and the incredible diligence of the author, is exceedingly pleasing. We are somewhat surprised that it could have pleased the people of the Five Cantons, due to some more freely written parts, especially in matters of religion. I ask you to inform me how much it can be bought for there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the marriage matter, I wish to hear from you, since the persons reside in Thurgau, about whom I have written to you, how the good daughter was impregnated by her cousin, whether your lords in Zurich would take up their case and, upon request, etc., dispense with them and allow them to be together or permit them to go to church, and if your lords agreed, whether they might remain in Thurgau for the sake of the other Confederates. For if that were the case, they would both go there and seek permission from your lords, so that the good daughter would not have to come to such shame. They are two honorable families and good, dear people on both sides. I earnestly ask you, if it is possible, to inform me of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The case of Metelli is such that if he does not receive the punishment he deserves, everyone will understand that everything is for sale with these judges. That impious man has made great expenses to corrupt some, and he openly boasts that he has succeeded in what he attempted with some. But the Lord knows how to repay the proud, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On Wednesday, some of the council from Lindau were here. They reported to our lords how they too have received a mandate, etc., showing neighborly compassion, and that they are sorry to have to do this and know of no way to avoid it. Thus, we can no longer use the market and trade to Lindau! And the longer it goes on, the more they seek to press and force us despite our fair and honorable offer, for which we still await a response every day, and yet we are punished in the meantime. There is suspicion of all sorts of machinations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is certain that the Emperor was recently so very ill that the doctors themselves thought he was dead, and they placed a feather on his mouth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We would like to know what further has been learned and how it stands regarding the speech, with which Gessner, the merchant with you, was addressed concerning Marcell Dietrich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I must preach. Keep well. I send you a letter from a confidant in the old Elector of Saxony's chancellery, who also writes to me in an enclosed note, among other things, that Duke Maurice has left Augsburg. The reason is not known exactly. However, he hears that those from Magdeburg intend to invade his land, etc. He writes that this Duke Maurice is so entirely hated by many that he, whether riding or walking, does not dare to lift his eyes or look at anyone, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Greet your household and all good lords and friends. Praying to God earnestly and with seriousness. There are many strange and dangerous practices, but the Lord knows how to send it for the best.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Cardinal Bishop of Trento has been expected every hour. He is supposed to bring peace or unrest between the Pope and the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Oh, earnestly praying to God that he may hold back his wrath longer and not pour it out completely! Send me the letters back. My people send you many kind regards and good wishes.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and greatest friend of all.</p>
