      <p>Greetings. I would have wagons full of disturbances to write to you about, most esteemed lord and godfather, if only there were messengers to carry them. The reason I have not written for so long is solely due to the lack of couriers. On the tenth of March, Mr. Calvin and Remundus Calvetus, his associate, came here, along with two syndics of the Republic of Geneva, who hold the highest office there. They had three main matters to address: the first concerned Calvin personally, the second involved both him and the church and republic of Geneva collectively, and the third pertained solely to the republic.</p>
      <p>The first issue was that Calvin was pursuing grievances against Zebedee, Angelus, and Hieronymus the physician, who had wronged him and his doctrine. I believe I have already written to you about this. Zebedee had severely criticized his doctrine of predestination in a public sermon, though without naming him. However, he secretly accused him of heresy.</p>
      <p>[Zebedee also said: The French fire has defeated the Spanish fire (alluding to Servetus), but the fire of God will defeat the French fire]. Angelus, in a public debate, taking occasion from the exposition of the words in Hebrews 5 (And he was heard for his reverence, etc.), openly called him a heretic because in his exposition he seemed to diminish the divinity of Christ too much, or, to use his words, make him too much of a man. Hieronymus not only called him a heretic but also the Antichrist and other things I do not know. He came to complain about these matters to the senate.</p>
      <p>The second issue was that a letter had been sent a few days earlier from our senate to all the governors of the Savoyard territories, instructing them to observe those who, on the days when the Lord's Supper is celebrated in our churches, leave their own churches and go to Geneva to partake in communion with that church, thus offending those with whom they live, as if the supper there were better or more complete than ours. If they found any such people, they were to exile them if they were foreigners, or send them to our senate if they were locals. Although this policy was not bad in itself, it was somewhat influenced by emotions, as among other things, Calvin's name was mentioned, and the ceremonies of the Genevan church were called Calvinistic.</p>
      <p>All these actions, like many others, were taken without our knowledge. The governors, upon receiving the letter, also indulged their emotions, depending on whether they were well or ill-disposed towards Calvin and the Genevans. They proclaimed it as a general edict, and each added whatever words they wanted. In many places, it was proclaimed in such a way that Calvin's name was severely criticized, and all were indiscriminately forbidden from any communion with the Genevan church. Elsewhere it was read from the pulpits, and elsewhere publicly posted in the forum. The minister at Tonon, who suppressed Calvin's name and did not want to read it, almost incurred serious danger. After these proclamations, the whole region began to burn with contentions and outcries, with Calvin's enemies becoming insolent and his friends grieving. This seemed intolerable to the Genevans, as they appeared to be excommunicated by us, and more severely than the papists, since those who hear a papist mass are only fined ten pounds, but those who commune with them could expect worse. Therefore, the syndics also came here to complain about this injury.</p>
      <p>On the same day, delegates from the Lausanne classis, Viretus, and Johannes Tornacensis came to complain about these and some other matters. Delegates from the Tonon classis also came. Christophorus Faber came on behalf of the Neuch√¢tel church to also offer his support to Calvin.</p>
      <p>There was a great commotion and a very serious matter. Regarding the latter, the senate's letter, the senate excused itself: this was promulgated against their will, the governors were at fault here, they only wanted to avoid the offense that would be given to the locals if foreigners left their churches on solemn days to go to Geneva to receive communion there: for on other days, when the supper is not held in our churches, they do not prohibit any of their people from participating with them, etc. This was indeed the response given to them, but in the meantime, the governors' license went unpunished and was only corrected by another private letter. The Genevans had four different versions of the edict promulgated from four prefectures, differing greatly among themselves, as I mentioned above, depending on how the governors were disposed towards them.</p>
      <p>As for the former issue, since Zebedee and his accomplices were not present, they were also given a day to appear here at the end of March.</p>
      <p>So on that day, the aforementioned Genevans returned. Zebedee and Angelus also came. The senate appointed a special day to hear and discuss this case, namely the second of April. There was a serious debate, and what I always feared happened. I could easily foresee what would happen if both sides were heard together, and the whole thing could have been easily averted if our advice had been heeded. However, before the contest began, the senators' minds were already inflamed against Calvin by the opposing party, so everything was conducted with the greatest prejudices. After both sides had fought enough, this sentence was pronounced: that all injuries should be mutually forgiven, each should remain a good man, and henceforth refrain from such accusations. Calvin considered this unworthy, as it was not just about private injuries but rather about doctrine: that should be examined, either by us ministers, or by a synod of the Swiss churches, or in some other way. Therefore, not content with the response given, he wanted to return to the senate with his people. We, however, were urged to take up this case before the senate, which was difficult for us.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we approached the senate and carefully explained the whole case to them, reminding them of their duty not to allow such a man to be suppressed by those slanderers. We also undertook to write to all the classes for concord in doctrine, etc. And the senate seemed inclined to our opinion. However, when Calvin and Farellus (who was present at this latter battle) were later admitted, they aggravated the senate more than ever before. Thus, letters were brought forth in which he had once called Zwingli's doctrine false and pernicious. Other letters written by him to Mr. Fallesius were also brought forth, in which, as I hear (for I have not seen them), he criticizes your confession against Luther, and many other things. Extremes were attempted on both sides, and a harsher sentence than before was finally pronounced against Calvin. The other two were almost justified. The Genevans requested a written response: which was granted to them. But it was written much more harshly than the sentence given to them orally by the consul. Therefore, returning to the senate for the third time, they obtained some mitigation, but not without great displeasure did they leave here. The others, however, applaud themselves as victors.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus the physician did not participate in these battles: he came only after Calvin had left, or when he was already preparing to leave. He has not yet been heard as I write this. I do not know what will become of him. If the matter stands badly and Calvin is expelled, he is driven out here. I fear worse things are to come now. Our people indeed write to the classes and urge peace: but they achieve nothing as long as those plagues are not removed, but rather promoted. As for us, we treated Calvin and his people kindly, and not deceitfully, so that he left in our good graces, and this was his only consolation. What will happen next you can easily imagine yourself. If you have any advice, please share it. I fear that eventually even your churches may become involved in this evil.</p>
      <p>The third matter the Genevans dealt with here is the continuation of the alliance; nothing has been concluded yet. As for the collection, it is proceeding. Please advise the pious exiles in our name not to bear this delay impatiently; the territory is vast, as you know, and the contribution is being collected from both the German and French parts, and the amount of money will grow considerably. For the faithful contribute generously according to the nature of this matter; we will have, I hope, more than a thousand florins or crowns; the Lord blesses this endeavor. The senate also asks that you inform us where they are and what their number is and how their affairs stand; therefore, write to me as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>I have no news of recent events. They affirm that the Pope is dead; a certain English count passed through France with a large retinue, who is going to Rome to seek absolution for the entire kingdom in its name, which Cardinal Pole reserved for the diabolical seat.</p>
      <p>They affirm that Margrave Albert is again serving the French, and that a large cavalry is being assembled in Saxony, a battle proposed to the Emperor by the French in Piedmont, and other things I do not know.</p>
      <p>I am sending back Mecardi's confession, which you will see from the annotations added whether it pleases Musculus. There are remarkable Proteans who can adapt to everything, and although some of them do not think badly, yet while they want to defend their quirks, of which there are many in the Augsburg Confession, they fall into what you see.</p>
      <p>We would have a simple and clear matter if we did not entangle it with our imaginations.</p>
      <p>I fear that Calvin himself may be somewhat stuck in this mud as well. For although his defense is good, it seems very forced in some parts. After he left here, he went to Biel, where Farellus awaited him. Thomas Grynaeus also came there, but by chance as I hear. Others draw different conclusions from this. I interpret everything in a good light.</p>
      <p>Some prodigies are reported here, heard in Zurich around the beginning of February, namely drums sounding in the air and the roar of cannons and other such things; I am surprised, therefore, that neither you nor your brother write anything about these.</p>
      <p>As for our students, we will make an effort to recall the first two shortly. Berrinus does not have a regular stipend; he will be free to leave when he wants.</p>
      <p>For only 6 months were assigned to him, during which he would remain there. I fear he will not obtain anything more from our senate; however, I will write to him myself.</p>
      <p>Although I do not doubt that you would like to know how things are going in Valais, I must report to you further, as much as I have learned. Someone from Valais, through the request of good friends, sent some Bibles, about 12 as I think, from Zurich and had them transported through the lands. When they came to Unterwalden, where they were to be loaded onto the pack animals, they were too heavy, and it was overlooked in the packing that they were not divided in Zurich, so that they could have been brought back. When they had to be unpacked, the Bibles were found, and the authorities became aware of them and were displeased, keeping one copy and sending the others to Valais with added commendation, so that unrest arose in Valais, and the books were sent to Sion to the bishop and chapter for examination, where very strange judgments were given. Finally, however, the Bibles were declared false and burned, which many were very displeased with; it caused much talk. In the meantime, 307 men in Valais have banded together, declaring that they will not tolerate the Lutheran or Zwinglian faith in their lands, and have presented a vehement writing to the bishop and the head of the land, as well as the common people, in which they request that more diligence be taken to prevent these beliefs from coming among them; they also complain that there are already too many in the land, writing several articles, and among other things, reporting that the 7 Cantons must not always remind them to remain in the old faith, which always happens at great cost. They fear that strange things will happen if the matter is allowed to break in like this. A copy of this writing has come to my lords (perhaps it has also come to Zurich), and there is great unrest in the land; especially the Goms district, which is the chief in the land, is said to be very restless. What God will work, I do not know; may He grant that it serves for the good and advancement of His holy kingdom. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most dear and esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
