      <p>Greetings. I presented your letter, written to me on June 24, to our Basel friend. It cannot be expressed how much joy the excellent old man felt upon reading it; for he has long loved and revered you sincerely for your unique learning and piety. He is now entirely absorbed in his British writers, having transcribed 12 centuries, and we are still stuck in the third, which is yet to be printed by our presses. Otherwise, he would have written to you himself. However, he asked me to excuse him to you and to commend him to you with the best, as they say, of intentions. He also asks again that if you can spare Theodoric of Nicea's writing on the Roman pontiffs or the schism of the church, you lend it to him for a few days; it will be returned shortly. I wrote the same to you yesterday in another letter through Peter Perna, from whom you might also receive this one, along with several gatherings from o to s inclusive, which I sent to you of your Apocalypse.</p>
      <p>Farewell and diligently work in cultivating the Lord's vineyard. Basel, June 26, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus, sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
