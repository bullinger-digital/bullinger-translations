    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius has sent two letters [No. 2671 and No. 2672] together and previously took advantage of every messenger available to him. So why does Bullinger complain that he writes rarely? And how is he supposed to know whether he has received all of Bullinger's letters or not? This should be evident from the responses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He regrets having spread false information about the Pope [Paul III] and the Emperor [Charles V]. He thought that all news from Constance (the source of his information) was credible...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger's report about the treacherous [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony] is truly terrible. Myconius would never have thought this of Maurice! Less frightening is the withdrawal of the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony] from the [Protestant camp]. For a long time, some have thought that he would have been better off staying at home. A good man [...] recently wrote that the best riders in the army are the Hessians and Palatines; the [Saxons] are as they are known. If the Elector had not participated in the war, it would probably have already ended. Allegedly, the imperial army [was delivered to the Schmalkaldic League] three times; however, the Elector is said to have prevented these opportunities from being used. Nevertheless, God will probably continue to care for His own as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Quite a few imperial mercenaries are passing through near Basel. They must have been dismissed from the imperial army or fled from there. Therefore, good news is expected soon from [Zurich]. Also, the Swiss mercenaries are returning from Strasbourg and elsewhere. So, a few months of peace are anticipated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [Antoine] Morelet [du Museau], the envoy of the French [King Francis I], traveled to France for two months these days, with royal permission. Some are pleased about this because they think that Morelet will instruct the King in the common interest [of all Protestants]. Myconius, however, places his trust in God alone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The mercenaries returning from the imperial camp to the vicinity of Basel remain silent! Only their sadness reveals that they have been mistreated. When asked about the course of the war, one [...] from the village of Landser replied that those who want to know must go there themselves. In the village of Grenzach, an experienced soldier [...] said that under no circumstances would he want to join the Emperor again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The messenger [...] has just arrived. Myconius must close. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. I have recently sent two letters together and previously did not burden any messenger, as far as I know, with my letters. Therefore, I am surprised that you complain about my infrequent writing. However, I am unaware if I have received all the letters you sent, as it should be evident from the order of the responses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It pains me that falsehoods are being spread; I had thought that nothing from Constance was written that was not entirely true, for it was from there that the news about the Pope against the Emperor was narrated.</p>

      <p>Regarding Maurice, indeed, you report badly. I would have sworn he was a good man! I am very grieved by his treachery. However, the fact that the Elector goes to liberate his own does not greatly terrify me. For as far as he is concerned, I know that some have long wished he had stayed at home. A good man recently wrote: "The best riders are the Hessians and Palatines. The Saxons are as they are known." If he had been absent, some think the war would already be over. For it is known that the Emperor's army was delivered into the hands of the enemy three times, if he had not hindered the matter. Come, the Lord must be invoked as before, and it must be firmly hoped that He will give what He has given thus far.</p>

      <p>Many imperial soldiers are passing by our city. No one thought otherwise than that they were either dismissed by the Emperor or escaped by flight. Therefore, we expected some joyful news from you. The Swiss are also returning from Strasbourg and elsewhere. Therefore, we have persuaded ourselves of tranquility for a few months.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The French envoy Morelet has departed for France these days. For this, the King granted two months. There are those who rejoice over this. They think that the King will be instructed by the envoy in the common cause. But the Lord is my helper; and I will not fear what man can do to me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Those returning from the Emperor around Basel are more silent than fish. Only their sadness shows that things did not go well with them. In the village of Landser, someone was asked by his people: "What do you say? How did it go? Speak even a word!" He responds with nothing but: "Go and find out as well as I." In the village of Grenzach, there is one who said: "It goes equally well or badly for me, I will never go to the Emperor again!" And he is a soldier from youth.</p>

      <p>The one who wants to take this letter is here. I am forced to stop. Farewell through Christ Jesus. Basel, hastily, November 17, 1546. Yours, Myco.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his most venerable lord. Zurich.</p>
