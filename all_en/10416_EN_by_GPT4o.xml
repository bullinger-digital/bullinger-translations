    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian showed him Bullinger's letter, which the young Appenzeller had delivered, and asked him to reply on his behalf in secret, as he did not want to do so himself for various reasons. In the case of the prisoner from Wil in Zurich, on whose behalf some from St. Gallen have spoken in Zurich, Vadian is of the opinion that all righteous people would disapprove if the wrongdoers were released so easily. The three petitioners from St. Gallen - Kaspar Vonwiler, Ambrosius Eigen, and the city bailiff Albrecht Schlumpf - acted as private individuals. Zurich should reject their case, so it does not appear as if they want to do St. Gallen a favor. He strongly urges that the wrongdoer should not be spared unjustly and emphasizes that the city of St. Gallen has nothing to do with the matter. Vogler is surprised that Bullinger is not better informed about Duke Ulrich of Württemberg's campaign. Greetings. Bullinger should admonish Vadian regarding Sebastian Appenzeller.</p>

      <p>Dear confidant, yesterday, Saturday, I was at the house of the faithful Doctor Vadian. He also showed me your [letter], delivered by the young Appenzeller, etc. He asked me to inform and write to you in secret. He would have liked to do it himself, but it was not appropriate, as the Füessly and others in Zurich are related to his wife and other matters. Regarding your report about the prisoner from Wil, for whom some from St. Gallen have petitioned in Zurich, he informs you that he is entirely against it - though in your heart without informing the honorable authority and city - that all righteous people would not approve, nor would they be pleased, if the wrongdoers were released and given a place, especially the people from Wil. He says: your people in Zurich, your citizens, often oppress and still do, if it does not improve; for the three from St. Gallen were not sent by a solitary council, nor have they ever petitioned for intercession or messengers, hoping that if it pleases them, they would request it, etc. In his opinion, Zurich should carry the matter before the authority and reject it, so it does not appear as if one honors or sends to a respectable city. Meanwhile, it is said by some that someone said: Has a city like St. Gallen not deserved more from a city like Zurich, etc. And so you know the three petitioners, the old mayor Vonwiler is the greatest friend and hope in this city; Captain Brosin is known to you; the city bailiff due to kinship. He asks me to inform you of all this in secret, as a sign that he writes to you in his letter, to pay attention to me, is therefore, so that the wrongdoer is not unjustly protected, as he does not hope. Yet it seems as if your city of St. Gallen greatly pleases, but it is unproven and unacknowledged. Act according to his trust. I ask you, tear up the letter.</p>
      <p>And if you have used the matter of Rinthal and drawn from it, as you feel good, I might suffer if you would return it to me; it might be good or necessary for me in the future.</p>
      <p>I have written this in haste at his request. I am surprised that you write to him in your letter, that he should let you know whether the Duke is or breaks all things more thoroughly. For he, and I, assumed you had such confidential knowledge.</p>
      <p>Greet the three women in your house for me.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Sunday, Pentecost, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your willing H. Vogler.</p>
      <p>[It is m]y request, you should admonish my lord Doctor [in] your writing regarding Bastion Appenzeller; although we have held a meeting, it seems necessary to me in the future.</p>
      <p>To my especially trusted lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
