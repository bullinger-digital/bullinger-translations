      <p>To the most excellent servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, renowned no less for piety than for letters, a brother and fellow minister most dear.</p>
      <p>Greetings. May the Lord Jesus bring about what you touch upon in your letters, that we may serve Him more diligently and fervently, which I trust is being done in you, and may it be done more and more each day, as I pray to God, and I ask you, as a father of mercies, to pray more earnestly for me, that having mercy on me, He may grant this, and for this grace, you may diligently remind me, since indeed this donkey which I carry around needs a whip, lest it cause so much trouble for the new man, and is always delaying, lest we do what we desire. Since I can offer nothing else, I desire this one thing, and for this grace, I would wish to devote myself entirely, that the churches which are purer in doctrine may come together most holily among themselves, and remove every opportunity for slander from the adversaries, who condemn us entirely, as the papists, who arrogate not a little to themselves from this, and not only these, but also others, who could somehow be tolerated, if they did not so savagely rise against the pious, and act so shamelessly in all things by word, writings, and all means, and we could more confirm those entrusted to our faith, and bring not a little to the good who act among the wicked, indeed I do not doubt that we would gain not a few from the adversaries.</p>
      <p>I thought that a holy and pious conference would be most expedient now, nor do I think I am alone in this opinion, nor was I the first to see it, since I knew you alone to be most loving of peace and edification, and whom I know to be more capable than others, I wished to ask you for this grace. But your letters so satisfied me as I was asking, and from them, I judged that nothing more should be attempted: but as you wrote, the matter should be commended to the Lord in prayers, and if anything should be done, by letters.</p>
      <p>But after I more fully received what happened to Laski and the pious in Denmark, and in what state things are with the adversaries, and I saw another pamphlet of Joachim Westphal, in which he strives to overthrow the pious doctrine we profess by all means, and almost in all things makes a pretense, to more and more turn away from the pious doctrine and strengthen in error and make all more hostile to us, under the specious name of the word and faith in the word fully believed, as it is true: it seemed again, as far as I gather, necessary to ask you, to strive for what I was asking before, and to accomplish it through the Lord.</p>
      <p>Things can be done by letters. I confess that many things can be accomplished by letters, as the apostles' epistles testify, not only of one, but also of others. But we see how much Paul preferred to act in person with words, rather than by letters for the concord and peace of the churches, and although the multitude condemned from the prejudice of the law, yet to Paul and other assertors of the truth was given a mouth and wisdom, by which the mouths of others were stopped, and for the truth it was pronounced, who doubts that the Lord will grant what we ask, which He will do for the glory of His name, and from which the enemies can be more powerfully defeated, and meanwhile, while the appointed day is awaited, you and those who are strong in the gifts of God in writing, will be able to gather what will more fully serve the cause. I think Calvin will not be in delay. As he is ready even to force himself, and sometimes more importunately urging what I was asking, I extorted from the unwilling, although it did not turn out otherwise than he had said before it would, and I would say it would not turn out otherwise, yet neither regretted having acted, as in the Geneva matter, not to mention others. Therefore, for Christ's sake, apply yourself: I am sure you will not regret the work. If others would strive, they would either accomplish little or nothing, or rather hinder. You can, only use the means which the Lord provides. Provide such necessary work for the present and consult for posterity. You will do a work worthy of you: but what is first and foremost, pleasing to Christ and very useful to the churches.</p>
      <p>Spirits will be encouraged and increased among the pious who act with us. The ferocity of the adversaries, who now exult as victors, will be tamed, and the princes, almost driven mad by the adversaries, making many decisions preposterously, will return to a better mind, with the Lord willing. Indeed, if anyone knows how to expedite this, you yourself know. Your Germany is troubled by no cause as much as this. If the salvation of Germany should be dear to all for the light of the gospel, what should it be to you, to whom it almost happened to taste the gospel in it before being born. And you were almost a youth taken into such an august office. You did not have to seek abroad, as others did. Christ granted you at home what was to be sought far away by so many. France, thrice miserable, when oppressed by innumerable evils, is affected by nothing so much as by the boasting and conflict of such contrary opinions about the Lord's Supper, and since the wicked are not only papists, but also others whom we would wish to embrace as brothers, and fully satisfy concerning what we believe and teach, that they might think more rightly, so wickedly affirm that we think so differently, and thus destroy innumerable, I think there is no other way to conveniently meet such a great evil, than by a holy assembly, which I do not see can be obtained by anyone else, than by you alone. Therefore, I beseech you by Christ, to assist the churches in such a necessary matter, and to help according to the grace given to you by the Lord for the afflicted matters. I do not wish to go before your prudence.</p>
      <p>For I do not arrogate anything to myself. But pressed in spirit, I am compelled to ask for a friendly hand. I know this care also bites you and I know you will not overlook what will contribute to restoring the matter. But that does not deter me from dealing freely with you, and more earnestly asking what I feel is useful. You will consider all things well, and through other things that are to be done by you, you will not neglect this, as the Lord has given you the ability, to know how to expedite and be able. And the less hope there seems to be, the more we ought to rely on hope, and try everything, according to the good will of the Lord who will give success. Farewell, most upright man, and perfect what you do, labor for the glory of the Lord. May Christ keep you long for His church and the edification of all. I wish your colleagues well and the pious old man Pellican, not to pass over Habius, both the father and Jacob. A colleague bids you well. Neuchâtel, June 8, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Farel.</p>
