      <p>S. D. The consul faithfully and promptly delivered your letters to me.</p>
      <p>I was invited by the people of Glarus, but I went to dine with the Rhaetians. The consuls and I had a very friendly conversation.</p>
      <p>I also met Lord Planta of Rezun. I had many conversations with him.</p>
      <p>I was trying to find an opportunity to discuss current affairs in conversation; but he kept changing the subject. I see the man is cunning.</p>
      <p>Finally, he asked that I give him my books on the councils, and that I consider him a friend. I promised to give the books as soon as they were printed, and that I would write to him sometime, provided he proved himself a friend. I spoke privately with the consul about the Glarus matter; he promised to do all the duties of piety.</p>
      <p>But I wrote nothing before eight days, because I was overwhelmed with business and could do nothing. Shortly before, I handed over two copies to a young man from Chur, copies, I say, of my sermons on Jeremiah, one for you, the other for Philipp; I no longer remember his name. I also gave letters; now I begin to doubt whether he delivered them.</p>
      <p>He was at the inn "Stella"; he was a merchant, he boarded a ship. If he is not faithful and does not deliver it to you, then it is just a pure chance on my part; for I no longer know what he is called, although he told me. He is a tall, young, black-haired fellow; he always sent half a batzen for drinks to the "Sternen", he came back and said nothing was done; I gave him another, asked him to take good care of the books and letters, etc. I gave your letters to the widow of our blessed memory, Matrona Leonis.</p>
      <p>She responds, and here you have the letters.</p>
      <p>My Ludwig himself responds.</p>
      <p>From Baden we have nothing more at this hour, except that all the envoys of the Confederates are there, also from Valais, from Rottweil, from Mulhouse, and other allies, that they will proceed on Tuesday and demand an answer from the five places. They promised to give it yesterday.</p>
      <p>But nothing is heard, how and what.</p>
      <p>They say they are somewhat more inclined than before.</p>
      <p>Of the envoys from Augsburg, I know nothing at all, except that one came with the city books from Augsburg the day before yesterday, brought me a letter, given on January 8 in Augsburg. I asked if his lords had sent envoys to Baden, etc.</p>
      <p>He knows nothing from anywhere, etc. Your lords asked here if the envoys from Augsburg were not staying here and waiting for the day; we knew not a word of it. The Senate of Augsburg is almost papist, it will not act with them for the disgrace of the courier, etc.; yet I cannot know what will happen. The same rumor is with us about the city of Metz; but I received letters from Strasbourg, but in these not a word about Metz; however, much smaller things are mentioned in them. From Augsburg, I hear that on December 13 a terrible storm arose in Vienna, and in Austria, the sky burned, the sounds of thunder were heard among the lightning, lightning struck the tower of St. Stephen, an earthquake shook the city, etc. Everything was very terrifying.</p>
      <p>But no one thinks of repentance.</p>
      <p>The world is knowingly insane.</p>
      <p>Yesterday at dawn, many saw lightning, etc. To inquire with Coignetius whether the bishop has dealt again with the one from Constance, etc., seems to me to be unfruitful; for he will have little information about it. I was very pleased to hear of the bravery of those from Schams, I also want to ensure on my return that what you desire happens and that the request for Beccaria is made to your envoys.</p>
      <p>I am sending back the copy and Beccaria's letter here, thanking you kindly. Now also pay good attention that all access to the Jesuits is decided on the day of the meeting. I still find it hard to believe that the matter with the bishop will be thus concluded, unless I hear the decision; for I have learned from many times how this people has such a broad footing. However, nothing is impossible for the Lord; may He do what is good in His eyes! The articles, as they are set, do not displease me, if they can now be maintained. The Pope sent a bull of the continuation of the council to Easter in France.</p>
      <p>The states of the kingdom were gathered in Orl√©ans; but it was rejected. They want a free council, in which the Pope himself is present; they do not want a continuation in which only legates are present, and therefore the assembly called for the 20th of this month has been postponed to May, to consult on what to propose in the council, etc. A comet stood over the city, in which the king and the nobility of the kingdom were, for 28 continuous days.</p>
      <p>Coignetius recently wrote to me about this, who is very hopeful that the word of God will be promoted in France. Let us pray to the Lord to be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I wrote this in great haste.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Write whether you have received my Jeremiah.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Philipp, Mr. Tscharner, Pontasella, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 17, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
