      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, for which I give the greatest thanks I can, and I ask you to thank Diet√§gius, an illustrious man, in my name for his writing. I have also received your excuse for your silence; for when I reflect on my own, I learn to believe others as well; and now I am so exhausted by business and yet entangled in unfinished matters, that I ask you to be content with these brief words. The news we have, I have enclosed here. A diet is being held in Solothurn due to the king's demands, who requests a Swiss legion of 6000 men to be sent to him, as if it were not enough to have lost so many thousands, unless even more are to be sent to perish likewise.</p>
      <p>Our people and the Bernese, with the addition of severe penalties, prohibit this military service to their own. The people of Glarus neither sent a delegate to the diet nor will they give any soldiers to the king, and the same goes for the people of Basel and Schaffhausen; they too strongly prohibit military service, as it is considered impious. Therefore, continue to do your duty, just as we do here. The Bishop of Constance is said to spread the news that it has been reported to him that there was another battle in France and that the king won a bloody victory. I await the limping messenger. Let us pray to the Lord, the guardian of the church, to keep us safe in these turbulent times.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Greet the honorable councilors, Gregory Charles, Pontasella, Ganthner, Ruynella, and our other friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 19, 1569.</p>
      <p>Greet your household. Mine also send greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, the most faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
