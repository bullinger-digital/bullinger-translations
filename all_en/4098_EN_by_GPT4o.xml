      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my perpetual honorable lord and godfather. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I would have written to you long ago, honorable lord godfather, if I had had a reliable messenger. Now that I have one of your people, I will write somewhat more extensively.</p>
      <p>First of all, I give you immense thanks for your sermons on Jeremiah sent to me. I have delivered the remaining copies to Mr. Musculus and Mr. von Diesbach.</p>
      <p>They also give you great thanks. We are waiting for you to complete that pious work.</p>
      <p>For indeed, this prophet is especially suitable for our times. As for our journey to Savoy, I recently wrote a few things about it to my brother, which I do not doubt he has shared with you. We found everything in great turmoil and manifest and astonishing schisms among the ministers. For some are still disputing about predestination, and insist on these and those expressions, which, when the others refuse to accept, they complain of corrupted and insincere doctrine, and almost accuse the rest of errors or heresy. Others fight for ecclesiastical discipline, asserting that they cannot minister with good conscience in churches where they do not have the power to discern between the pious and the impious concerning the administration of the Lord's Supper: therefore they demand private examination and the power to excommunicate the impious and ignorant. They are armed with the example of those who have departed: unless they follow them, they seem to themselves not to be ministers of Christ, nor do those who have left cease to pour cold water, calling those who wish to remain belly-servers and ministers of the belly. There are also others on the other side who are excessive, who rejoice that they are rid of those who have left, and bitterly cut and pursue them as deserters of their churches. Satirical and biting epigrams are written on both sides, like that of someone: Bern cannot bear schisms, nor protect vile seditious people, but sends them to Anticyra.</p>
      <p>And many other such things.</p>
      <p>You can easily imagine how difficult it was to deal with such people, in whom you find nothing moderate, but everything extreme. However, we restrained them as much as we could, and proposed to them the moderation they should follow both concerning the doctrine of predestination and ecclesiastical discipline, and we removed those bitter and immoderate words with which they were cutting each other, and prescribed with what modesty judgment should be made about those who remain or have departed, and by the grace of the Lord, we achieved that many who seemed about to leave remained, and others who were disheartened by these dissensions were strengthened and regained their spirit. What will happen next must be entrusted to the Lord, and He must be prayed to grant peace to His church, and kindly and mercifully remove those dissensions and schisms which are such a stumbling block to unbelievers. I greatly fear that these disturbances are a presage of the truth being taken away again from this people. And I think there are many who now riot more petulantly for this reason, so that they may seem to depart under the guise of piety, whom, however, fear of impending dangers rather than piety of heart draws away. We only had lunch in Geneva, and that day we had a long journey to complete.</p>
      <p>For we had spent the night at Gex, had lunch in Geneva, and then had to proceed as far as Thonon. Mr. Gwalther knows the layout of these places.</p>
      <p>Hence it happened that we spoke to few in Geneva. And although we intended to speak at least to Mr. Calvin, it happened that in the street Mr. Beza met Mr. von Diesbach, who was one of the envoys with us, and although he saw him, he passed by without greeting him, although he had once been not only a friend but also a roommate in Paris, and whom he had always used very familiarly in Bern. Because of this, Mr. von Diesbach was very indignant and did not want us to approach any of them, especially since they did not deign to meet us, whom they knew were present. Mr. Hieronymus Emmanuel was also with us, who always thought very well of Viret and his party, a man of good judgment and moderation, but they did not deign to greet him either, nor did he want to allow us to meet them. Four senators indeed had lunch with us: but there was no mention of the ministers. So, after lunch, we departed.</p>
      <p>I write these things more extensively because I know they are displeased that we did not speak to them: but we are no less displeased that they did not deign to speak to us. If they write to you about this, here you have what you can use to excuse us.</p>
      <p>They are learned men and, as I judge, also pious, but they bear such an air that they cannot but be burdensome to many good men. Nor did we leave here without using the advice of our people on how we should conduct ourselves if we came to Geneva. It pleased most that we should not intrude upon them, but if they approached us, we should deal with them kindly. But the matter happened as I wrote.</p>
      <p>I suppose you have heard about the decision made by the Basel arbitrator against our people. The Genevans are very jubilant about it.</p>
      <p>Our people are displeased and assert that it was done against the agreement with them because the Genevans placed a man among their assessors and judges who was neither from the greater nor the lesser council, as they call it. But this is of little importance, now at last the substance of the matter will be litigated.</p>
      <p>I do not see the end of this controversy unless some third and common enemy comes who will unite these republics again. The envoy of Savoy also requested the same thing here as with you, except that he added something about a friendly settlement, from which it happened that a day was set for meeting in Neuchâtel. The envoys have not yet been chosen.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Our people will try whatever they can to see if the matter can be settled amicably, and I wish this could be done without the detriment of religion. I fear that what I see happening everywhere will also happen here, that private matters will be considered more important than piety and religion. Pray to the Lord with us for a good outcome.</p>
      <p>The people in Savoy are silent.</p>
      <p>The nobles murmur.</p>
      <p>Everyone is waiting to see what the outcome will be.</p>
      <p>The Genevans are establishing an academy, but only for their own.</p>
      <p>For it will hardly happen in such a state of affairs, especially with the high cost of living there, that it will be frequented. Most of the ministers who left us have been sent to France, except for Viret and Beza, with a few others excepted. There, with confidence gained from the king's death, they acted more boldly, from which a new and more fervent persecution has arisen than ever before.</p>
      <p>In Bern, October 8, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
