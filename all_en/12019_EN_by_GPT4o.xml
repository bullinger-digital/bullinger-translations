    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Hardenberg's letter, which pleased him; Hardenberg misjudges Bullinger because he praises him and his scholarship too much, as Bullinger is only concerned with the Holy Scripture; he considers his [commentaries] on the Holy Scripture as an exercise, and the success granted by God encourages him to write about the Gospels; more learned and profound things can be found with others; with him, as he hopes, piety and sincerity of the apostolic teaching can be learned; may the Lord preserve him in the simplicity and purity of the word of the cross against the world. He gladly wrote to Hardenberg's abbot [Johannes Reekamp] at the request of the esteemed Joseph [Macarius], eagerly awaiting his response; he does not take it amiss that Hardenberg read the letter intended for Johannes a Lasco, especially since it was agreed upon; may Christian love unite them even beyond death. He was very pleased with Hardenberg's historical description, in which he described his connection with a Lasco and his activities in Leuven, what he had to suffer from the theologians and how the Lord freed him, for which all [Zurich] brothers thank God; they pray for the protection of the church in Brabant; Hardenberg also acted wisely and piously in promising his help to the abbot [Johannes Reekamp], who should also leave monasticism and continue to reform the churches of Christ. Bullinger understands that Hardenberg shies away from court life, but he cannot advise him to reject the offer of the Archbishop of Cologne, because Hardenberg could further advance the reign of Christ there, especially since the prince allows sobriety, moderation, and justice to prevail at his court. Bullinger fears that virtue and piety are not to be found at any diet and that religious matters cannot be advanced there; but this is not the place to talk about it. Megander, Gwalther, Pellikan, Bibliander, and the other church servants and professors have learned about Hardenberg from the letter to Bullinger and very much wish to speak with him in Zurich about the dogmas and Hardenberg's related fears; Hardenberg could stay with Bullinger or the others; [the Zurichers] know exactly what Luther and some others think about them, but they leave the decision to God and above all to posterity, for the judgment of many is today corrupted by the zeal of factions; therefore [the Zurichers] continue in their mediocrity and simplicity in enduring injustices and ask the Lord for mercy and protection for the churches. Should this exchange take place through letters, Hardenberg is asked to draft future writings without ceremonious diminutions and courtly formulas, as Bullinger also deals with simple people; he acknowledges Hardenberg's brilliant eloquence and his religious scholarship, but today many scholars entangle themselves in the simplest theological questions, from which they can no longer extricate themselves; therefore, may Hardenberg entrust everything to him freely and artlessly as to a brother, especially since he sees how familiarly Bullinger writes to him, who does not want to recommend himself to him through winning rhetoric, but through humanity, striving for piety, and true brotherly love. Thanks Hardenberg for taking such kind care of the Zurich youths [Joachim Forrer and Hans Zart], who are now being called back home for important reasons. Greetings to Georg Cassander and Cornelis Wouters. What Hardenberg has done for the afflicted, unfortunate blind man, he has done for Christ himself, who will repay him. He could read Hardenberg's letter well and easily, keeps it as a memento, and urges him to write more; all brothers send greetings; greetings to Hardenberg's host [Martin Bucer] and the other brothers; they should pray for [the Zurichers].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your most welcome letter dated August 6th on the first of September, and indeed I received it with great joy of spirit. Therefore, what you laboriously preface and seek pardon for, you do so without necessity, most pious man, so much so that I give you immortal thanks for writing to me so familiarly. You indeed lower yourself too much, and again you exalt me and my scholarship too much. I am not, most learned Albert, the person you think I am. I am a student of the Holy Scriptures, a minister of the word, and a servant of Jesus Christ, if only I were faithful and wise. What I have written on the Holy Scriptures, I have written through exercise. Friends and brothers have finally compelled me to write them. But I give thanks to my Lord Christ, who has blessed my exercise so that it is almost universally approved. This matter has finally stirred my spirit to dare to write the evangelical history. Everywhere I strive for simplicity and clarity; more learned and profound things are found with others.</p>
      <p>For as I hope that piety and the sincerity of apostolic doctrine can be learned from my writings, so I know that certain learned and profound mysteries are not found. I have never promised nor learned them. Therefore, I gladly confess our simplicity. I do not acknowledge the other things attributed to me. However, I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may always keep me in the simplicity and purity of the word of the cross before the world as a fool.</p>
      <p>Most gladly indeed did I devote my effort to you at the request of my beloved Joseph, and I wrote to your abbot. May he read our writings with much fruit! Certainly, I eagerly await his response. I wish you had read my letters to the abbot, so much do I not take it amiss that you read those addressed to the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, especially since I understand it was agreed upon between you. Mr. a Lasco is a friend and brother; all who are friends and brothers of my Lascani are friends and brothers. I love you no less than him, since in both of you the cause of love is the same, faith and piety in God. Come now, let us love one another mutually, so that the Son of God Himself, called love and charity by the apostles [1 John 4:8, 16], may be in our midst, so that, I say, in this age, we may be bound together by an indissoluble bond of charity among ourselves. Finally, when we depart from here, may we be united with our supreme head and most loving good and live together in glory forever.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express how pleasing, delightful, and sweet your historical description was to me, in which you explained how you came together with Mr. a Lasco, what familiarity you had with him, how pleasantly you lived with a man both pious and of all hours; what you did, or rather what the Lord did through your ministry in Leuven, what you suffered from the theologians, how the Lord delivered you from the bloody hands of persecutors, and indeed how the power of Christ drew you out of the cowl, out of hypocrisy and Pharisaism, out of Egypt, I say, the workshop of pleasure and impiety, monasticism. For all these things, I and the brothers, as many as have read, have given great thanks to God, praying in the meantime that He may protect and comfort the church founded by you in Brabant in those severe persecutions, and that what He once began in you, He may confirm and bring to completion. For we are not ignorant of the battering rams with which your spirit is shaken. But remember in all these things the most faithful servant of God, Moses, of whom Paul said: "By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt" [Hebrews 11:24-26]. For he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.</p>
      <p>What a great reward indeed has been promised to you, who, though He was equal in glory with the Father, yet became poor for your sake, that you through His poverty might become rich. Therefore, you have done excellently in renouncing monastic delights and abominations. Again, you act prudently and piously in promising all your effort to Mr. Abbot. May he also cast off monasticism and proceed to reform the churches of Christ according to the word of the living God. May the Lord grant to both of you what is salutary for you and the churches of Friesland.</p>
      <p>Nor do I greatly disapprove that you so abhor court life, as it is dissolute and long ago censured by our Savior in the Gospel for its excessive luxury and splendor. However, I could not advise you, if the Prince of Cologne offered you an honorable place at his court where you could promote the kingdom of Christ, to disdain it, especially since I hear the prince is most zealous for piety and probity. For it follows that he strives, driven by faith, that there may be less luxury, more sobriety, temperance, and justice in his court. Isaiah did not shun the court of Hezekiah, nor did Obadiah from the service of the most impious Ahab, and they greatly benefited the saints through their ministry. However, as virtue is always pursued in the world after money, indeed not even after money, so I fear that in no diet will virtue and piety have any rightful place. For what else are diets, as they are held today, but the dregs of the world? To expect anything pure and sincere from them is to expect living and clear water from some sewer (pardon, I pray, the somewhat unclean parable), when it pours forth urine, filth, and I know not what other impurities. Indeed, many good men have experienced with the greatest loss of temporal things, and also with the loss of time, that matters of religion cannot be advanced by any councils and diets. Through the evangelical preaching announced according to the apostolic rite and custom, the kingdom of God and the saints is planted, preserved, promoted, and expanded. But this is not the place to speak of these things now.</p>
      <p>All the brothers and fellow ministers, whom you wish to see and greet in person, Mr. Caspar Megander, Rudolf Gwalther, Pellican, Bibliander, and the other ministers of the church and professors, have begun to know you from the letters sent to me, and they desire nothing more than to see you in Zurich, to join hand to hand, and to receive pleasure and joy in the Lord through mutual conversation. Therefore, come to us, most illustrious man and most honorable and beloved brother. Come, I say, if in any way your affairs allow and permit. I offer you my house. Others also offer theirs. We will gladly hear you discuss certain doctrines, as you say, and those things that trouble your mind. We are not ignorant, most learned and holy man, of what Luther and some others think of us. But we have committed that to God the judge and His holy church, and especially to posterity and the following age. For who does not know that the judgments of many today are corrupted by the zeal of factions? Meanwhile, we continue in our mediocrity and simplicity, bearing and dissembling many injuries. We also pray to the Lord that, having mercy on us, He may keep us from evil and preserve the holy churches for His holy name's sake.</p>
      <p>Now, if you are going to continue in truth through letters, I ask you to refrain from those ceremonies and diminutions - I remember I am not always dealing with learned men, pardon my ignorance - and other formulas of that kind more than courtly. They will not be necessary. I do not care for Ciceronian style. I do not care for all-encompassing and most complete learning and knowledge, which, unless some have attained, they think they should have no place in the church. You have a clear and evident style. And I understand you to be learned in piety and the Holy Scriptures. You undoubtedly live a holy and pious life. You wish to benefit all. It is well. Would that the world had many such eloquent and learned men, but very few of whom it is commonly said, not in vain, "the more learned, the more perverted"! For we see some in our age, puffed up with learning, so entangled in plain and open divine matters that they further entangle themselves, so that in the end they do not know where they are or what they are doing or what end they are seeking. May the Lord Jesus enlighten us all with His Spirit, that we may think on those things which are profitable. Therefore, omitting those formulas, if you love me and consider me a brother, freely and rudely pour out what you have into the bosom of a brother, and use me as a brother. For you see how familiarly and unrefined I write myself. I do not wish to commend myself to you and the brothers by flattery and eloquence, but by humanity itself, zeal for piety, and true charity.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I give thanks to your humanity for receiving the Zurich youths so kindly and instructing them with your counsel. We now call them back home, and that for certain and great reasons.</p>
      <p>Greet most dutifully on my behalf Georg Cassander and Cornelis Wouters, most pious and learned men. They too are excessive in proclaiming our humanity. Indeed, we have a great zeal for doing good to guests and brothers, but we lack many things, we lack resources, we lack prudent counsel, etc.</p>
      <p>What you have done for the miserable and unfortunate blind man, you have done for Christ Himself, who will undoubtedly repay you on that day.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I could read your letter most easily and quickly. For you do not write badly. Therefore, continue, and write more. I do not discard them, but keep them as most dear and coming from a most select brother. Love me in Christ in return, and write me in the book of friends. The whole chorus of brothers greets you most dutifully. You will greet your host and other brothers for us. Pray to Christ for us. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 5th, in the year of our Lord 1544. Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Albert Hardenberg of Friesland, now in the house of Mr. Bucer in Strasbourg, most esteemed and beloved brother.</p>
