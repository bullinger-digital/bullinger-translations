    <p xml:id="regest1">Sebastian [Guldibeck] demands 6 guilders from Johannes Blasius for the accommodation of those boys whom he - also in the name of Travers - recommended; Bullinger has offered to write to Travers and asks him to influence the parents. Blasius will report what news they have; Emperor [Charles V] is negotiating in Speyer with the estates about the defense against the Turks and the subjugation of the French [King Francis I] and his allies, but there is hardly any talk of religious peace. Bullinger has written a response to a work by Cochläus in the past three months [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“], which will probably count 20 pages; as soon as it is printed, he will send it to him. Travers’ son [Johannes] is doing well; despite inquiries, he has not indicated that he needs anything. Greetings to Anton [Travers].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. The honorable Lord Johannes Blasius will report to you, a man to be esteemed in every way, what Lord Sebastian, the tutor, has demanded from him as a guarantor, 6 guilders, if I remember correctly. For he complained that the same amount is still owed to him for the accommodation of those young men whom Lord Johannes Blasius had recommended in your and his name. And because there had been some dispute between them over this matter, I intervened and promised to write to you and ask you to assist Lord Johannes Blasius, so that the sum may be paid to Sebastian. The condition was accepted by both parties. Therefore, my lord, kindly consider this my duty and ensure that the parents of the young men send the money. Blasius himself will report more. There is no news with us, except what Lord Blasius will explain. The Emperor is staying in Speyer and consulting with the estates of the empire about repelling the Turks and attacking the French along with their allies; divine, whom he understands. There is no mention or very rare mention of asserting the glory of Christ and restoring true religion, or it is associated with malicious intent. May the Lord graciously be present with His church.</p>
      <p>For three continuous months now, I have written a response to the booklet of Johannes Cochläus on the authority and most absolute perfection of the Holy Scripture, and since he has burdened us and our churches with many insults, abuses, and slanders, I have asserted our innocence and removed his insults. The book will have, if I am not mistaken, 20 pages. You will have a copy from me when it is completed; for there are still some pages missing, which have not yet been printed. - Your son is behaving well and is dear to his teacher and companions. I continually advise him to inform me if he needs anything; but he has not indicated anything yet. For I wish to serve you and all yours. Farewell. March 6, Zürich, 1544. You will greet Lord Anton.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
