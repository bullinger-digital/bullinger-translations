      <p> Greetings. Even if I were to attempt to send many cartloads of letters there, I could not respond with the dignity your many most loving and Christian letters deserve. Therefore, I consider it much better to refer the duty of giving and returning thanks to the one God, the best and greatest, the author of all good things, rather than to exhaust myself by trying beyond my strength and yet achieve nothing. Thus, consider me and all mine entirely bound to you as if anew, so that we address no mortal more, and we pray continually to the Lord of heaven and earth, that He may eternally protect you and yours under the safest guard of His wings, keep the angel of destruction far away from your house, and preserve you imbued and strengthened with heavenly blessing. Our house now seems cleansed from that deadly plague since the death of our little son, which we willingly recognize as the hand of the Lord and rightly kiss with reverence, knowing that by His nod alone we either stand or fall, and that we will stand because He is able to make us stand, whose wrath is so brief and favor so long-lasting that, even if weeping endures for a night, as our prophet says, joy comes in the morning. Thus, we rightly commit ourselves, however small we are, to Him who kills and soon calls back to life, who sends down to the underworld and draws up, about whose immeasurable favor towards us we have no doubt at all, being taught by so many clear arguments and confirmed by so many excellent pledges, so that, if we had to die a thousand times, it should rightly seem light, since His mercy, as the same prophet sang, is sweeter than life itself, especially since any life, however pleasant it may seem, outside His favor is death itself. I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ, who alone is our life and resurrection, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, and has been made everything by God, in whom I wish and hope with all my heart to be found living and dying in true and solid faith. May He, my soul, my dearest and best brother, support and preserve you, growing in faith with your domestic church. </p>
      <p> May all your ministers in the work of the Lord, along with other friends and brothers, greet you and earnestly and diligently make prayers at the throne of grace for me and mine, that we may endure firmly to the end. My dearest wife sends her greetings to you and yours, whom I commend diligently to the Lord. Farewell. </p>

      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
      <p> Regarding the Magdeburgers, I prefer to write nothing but uncertainties to you; they firmly assert that their affairs are entirely safe and that they will never agree to unworthy conditions of peace, sooner losing their property, life, and everything. </p>
      <p> The Premisch crowd is said to have completely dispersed and scattered, although others assert the opposite. However, a loyal old servant of the Elector of Saxony has been stabbed by his Spanish guard; but no one wants to admit it. The king is moving from Augsburg this week, as they write. The emperor is supposed to delay until the calends of May, when the council is announced, and then move to the Netherlands. There is constant talk about the Turk being in preparation. The Abbot of Weingarten is supposed to change the authorities in Ravensburg, Isny, Kempten, Biberach, and perhaps also Lindau in the name of the imperial majesty; for now, people are known, who everyone is. Everything is shaping up for Germany to become a peculiar, sold-out people and to be tormented in harsh servitude; if they do not want Christ, then let them have the antichrists as the Jews had their Titus and Vespasian. O Lord God, have mercy on this misery! </p>
