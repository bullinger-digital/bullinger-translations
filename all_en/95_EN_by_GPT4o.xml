    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian received Bullinger's letter [not received] along with other documents only twelve days [after their dispatch from Zurich]. He thanks especially for the report from the Baden Diet [of March 12, 1548] as well as for the letter with the news that Bullinger received from friends. He sends the documents back enclosed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">There is hope that Emperor Charles V, through the disgusting guaiac wood tea he drinks [during his cure], will not, as if bewitched by a magic potion (like a madman!), crave even more for revenge [against the Confederates]. For negotiations are already openly taking place at the Augsburg Diet about the restoration of the Duchy of Swabia, to which a large part of the Confederation once belonged!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Moreover, it is not entirely absurd that Charles V wants to regain [the territories] which the Habsburgs initially lost under the rule of Duke Frederick IV of Habsburg through the treachery of the Roman-German King Sigismund at the time of the Council of Constance and later under the rule of Frederick's son, Sigismund [the Rich in Coin].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Charles V undoubtedly wants to take revenge on King Henry II of France for several reasons, but especially because he financially supported his enemies. Therefore, there is no more dangerous advice for the Confederates than to refuse help to Henry II and thus lose him as a willing supporter, [only] to avert their own harm [by Charles V]. For if they continue to remain neutral, as it is said, Henry II will be in distress and will certainly be defeated. This would pave the way for [the Emperor] to subjugate the Confederates, who, without allies (even in the greatest harmony among themselves!), would certainly not be able to resist his wrath for long. Of course, Bullinger's wish that the Confederates, [instead of going to war for Henry II], stay at home in peace is very desirable. But for the Confederates, a war [of the Emperor] against the neighboring [France] is now equally threatening. Undoubtedly, they will suffer more harm the less they consider the situation of those who sincerely wish them well. The Evangelicals should pray to be saved in God, the Lord over all heavenly and earthly things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[P.S.:] Vadian can hardly understand that Francisco de Enzinas, who once declared he wanted to stay in Basel for a longer time, soon afterwards went to Strasbourg and now wants to move to England with his so honorable wife [Margarethe, n√©e Elter]! Surely he has urgent reasons for this... If not, this very learned man is unfortunately very fickle in his decisions. Yet, his reputation and advantage could be taken care of in some way! But he will know what is right for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Allegedly, the Council of Trent is to be continued with the approval of Pope Paul III. The old believers are so eager to affirm their superstition!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">There is a rumor that Charles V has been incited to war against Duke Albert of Prussia, which his neighboring princes do not want to support. Presumably, the Teutonic Order, now meeting in Mainz, is behind this intrigue. The desired restitution of its territories [in Prussia] would be very financially rewarding for the Order. The Polish King Sigismund I does not support this restitution [in any case]. By the way, the French King made a good agreement with him last March [1547 or 1548?] through an important embassy to Petrikau (north of Krakow).</p>

      <p>S.P.D. I received your last letter on the twelfth day after it was sent, along with other enclosed documents. I first thank you for the reports on the proceedings at the Baths, which you informed me about, and also on behalf of those whose letters you kindly shared with me. I am returning the copies to satisfy your trust in this matter.</p>

      <p>It is said that the Emperor drinks a potion of guaiac wood, and they hope it does not turn into some kind of love potion (especially in such a nauseous stomach) and incite him to a frenzy of lust for revenge, more than has been done so far. For it is now openly discussed in Augsburg about restoring the Duchy of Swabia, of which we were once a significant part.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, it is not entirely baseless that if his efforts succeed, he will repair the great damage that the House of Austria suffered from the beginning of the Council of Constance due to the treachery of Sigismund, King of the Romans, first under Duke Frederick and then his son Sigismund, who were severely afflicted.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There is no doubt that he harbors harsh thoughts against the French, not for one reason alone, but especially because they supported his enemies with money. In this matter, there will be no more dangerous advice than if we refuse aid to the French to avoid our own harm and do not stand by them with great spirit. For if we continue to remain neutral, as it is said, the French will struggle and perhaps even succumb, paving the way for the subjugation of the Swiss, who cannot long resist such a powerful prince, no matter how closely united we are. It would indeed be best if we could remain at home in peace and liberal leisure, which I see you also desire. But these are the times: And such a mass of atrocious endeavors looms over us that there is no doubt we will suffer more harm in the future if we do not join the efforts and pursuits of those who sincerely wish us well. But I acknowledge and confess that the moderation of all plans lies with the Lord of heaven and earth, whom we diligently pray to keep us in His care.</p>

      <p>I cannot quite grasp what has happened to our Driander: He initially decided to stay in Basel for a long time. Soon after, he moved to Strasbourg. Now he intends to go to England with his honorable and newlywed wife! Perhaps he has reasons that urge him. If there are none, I regret that such a learned man is so inconsistent in his decisions, although his dignity and advantage could be provided for in some way. But he will likely make the best decision for his affairs.</p>

      <p>It is said that a council is to be held in Trent with the approval of the Antichrist. The old believers are still so fiercely committed to affirming their superstition.</p>

      <p>There is a certain rumor that the Emperor has been persuaded to wage war against the Duke in Prussia. However, he finds little favor or willingness to help among the neighboring princes. I fear the German lords are complicating the matter. They are said to be currently gathered in a chapter in Mainz. They would like to be reinstated in Prussia, which would be worthwhile if their income and revenues were invested wisely. However, the King of Poland does not want to be involved, and the King of France had an excellent embassy to Peterkau (located six or eight miles from Krakow) last March, which was conducted very honorably and, as it is believed, received a good response.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, my most beloved lord and friend.</p>
