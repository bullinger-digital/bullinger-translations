      <p>Greetings. I recently recommended to you, my father, an excellent man and a very dear friend of mine, named Lusarchius, whom I believe is still there. I therefore ask that you ensure the letters I write to him are delivered, and even carried to him if he has crossed into Italy, whenever you find a convenient opportunity. You see, my father, and have long since learned, how intimately I deal with you. Please, in turn, make use of my services, and you will find me not ungrateful in deed.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new about our affairs to write to you. You have already learned from our Budaeus what the state of the Genevan church is, and I do not doubt that you are striving to the best of your ability to address these evils. There are enough enemies outside, but this is the condition of the church that it also harbors internal enemies. May the Lord scatter the plans of the wicked. For it is certain that Satan is trying with these underground efforts to gradually demolish this most noble building, and if the reins are once loosened by certain wicked individuals, either I see nothing, or it is over for that church. But perhaps I speak of these things untimely. For neither you nor the other brothers lack knowledge of the greatest matters, nor prudence, nor zeal. Farewell, my most excellent and esteemed father. I beseech you to greet your wife, an excellent woman, and indeed your entire college, most dutifully on my behalf. May the Lord Jesus continue to bless you and strengthen you with His holy spirit. In Lausanne, on the 7th day before the Ides of December.</p>
      <p>Theod. Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of God, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
