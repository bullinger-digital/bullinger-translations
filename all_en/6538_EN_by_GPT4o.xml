      <p>I have understood well how much you labor for me, and I give you immortal thanks. Certainly, the memory of your kindness towards me will never die. I need them so very much; whatever I receive, I must give in return, etc.</p>
      <p>The lord ambassador's servant has stabbed someone and did not have much reason to do so.</p>
      <p>I write about what has been done in the assembly; I will write to the consuls in 8 days and thus, as is proper, give thanks for their generosity.</p>
      <p>If this had not been my calling, which was completely free and unexpected for me, I would often lose heart; but since God has wonderfully sent me to these parts, I will labor in the Lord's harvest; He will make it prosper. - Why is there no news about Mr. Haller's health?</p>
