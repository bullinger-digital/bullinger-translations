      <p>Most learned, venerable lord and father, your reverence, I am your humble, willing servant, always ready to serve, and I wish to inform you that I have received your letter well taken care of. Firstly, we thank you for your great effort and tireless work, which you undertake with fatherly advice towards us so diligently. However, we are deeply saddened by the news from the Netherlands, which is very different and so utterly miserable and merciless in Lyon and elsewhere. May the eternal, merciful God show His grace to all people and make us recognize our sins for true repentance. As far as the current matter of the military campaign is concerned, you are now well aware of how our envoy or ambassador, while I was still with you, had a letter sent out here and elsewhere in the Grisons, similar to the king's declaration published in print, in which he wants to blame everything on the admiral and defend his king with his notorious murder, although shortly before he had given the opposite and wanted to make the king completely unaware, as if some Guise murderers were deeply sorry. Although Mr. Ulrich Campell also informed the brothers of the opposite, I found, after I returned home, that our aforementioned envoy was so blinded and confused that many believed his false report rather than the writings and stories of other honest people. And although this is against the common law and custom of the land, the aforementioned ambassador insisted with haste and intended that his thanks should be conveyed to all communities through a mayor without being summoned to a diet or assembly, so that he would not have to incur any costs, and then quickly and finally find out whether they would give him soldiers or not.</p>
      <p>And indeed, this insistence of his has not been without effect on many; for it has come to the point that his false deeds have been spread everywhere, and many of the evangelical places think nothing else than that it is as many of the papists and pensioners have presented to them from their lord's mouth.</p>
      <p>And since we have seen that many pious communities have been confused and blinded and that more and more are being made quickly and opposed, we have truly had to let the pens dance so that through the contrast of truth, the false appearance of the shameless lies would be exposed. Some have withheld our letters from us so that they can better carry out their practices.</p>
      <p>In the Upper League, there are also soldiers like in other places and very fierce papists, who not only give credence to the king's declaration but are also eager for war, God grant it does not come to that. Yet, by God's grace, they do not have so much power, for there is no unanimous agreement in their League to allow it. They have only had more because of two communities, which would not have happened if they had presented the truth to all communities. But in the other two Leagues, it is (except for three votes from the Mass villages) a unanimous decision not to allow anyone to march. Yes, the envoys from Bergell, Engadin, and some other places have been instructed to completely renounce this murderer and his envoy. However, to ensure that everything happens with proper order and appearance, our mayor has called a strong assembly for today, the date of this letter, and will not allow the answers and more to be given or sent only by the three leaders. When they sat down together today, October 13, 1572, some corrupt leaders, who would like it, have strongly insisted and argued that they want to march, as it is more in their League. But when the other envoys from the two Leagues presented their reports in writing, it was found (as mentioned above) that (except for two or three Mass votes) the remaining courts from the two Leagues unanimously rejected and abhorred this campaign. And since the League's letter requires that the minority should follow the majority, and this has always been practiced in all other important matters, the great leaders in the Upper League, who are good pagans, must stand back.</p>
      <p>And to show that it is serious, the other two Leagues have not allowed themselves to be moved at all, even though the leaders stood up and would have liked (as they saw where the majority was) to create confusion, which would have resulted in nothing, but they immediately ordered the trumpeter and a city servant to announce in all corners and ends of the city in the name of the three Leagues that this campaign is forbidden, which happened between 12 and 1 in the afternoon, and I myself saw and heard it. For when the trumpeter blew, my lord's servant called out: 'My lords of the three Leagues forbid that no one should march to any foreign lord, nor should anyone march to the king in France, under penalty of life and limb, property, and goods, and whoever disregards this will also have his wife and children sent after him and all his goods confiscated, and the communities will be informed and an impartial judgment will be set for all disobedient ones and they will be punished according to their deservedness.' Thereupon, some loudmouths will think twice before they continue their course, as it is well known what they would have deserved; but one cannot lift every burden in the Leagues, for they have too much resistance. Before they sat down together, I had previously brought the lamentable history of the murder in German, along with the miserable letter of the young Zurich citizen, to my lord mayor with the admonition that he should insist that, before any action is taken, all this should be read aloud in the assembly.</p>
      <p>I also told some leaders more about it. But when the mayor brought this up, some would have liked to block it; but they wanted to hear it once, and it was read from beginning to end with great attention and consideration, whereupon the governor of Baselga, a man and leader in debt, would have liked to belittle this history, as if one should not or must not believe every writing, to which the envoy from Bergell replied that this writing is more credible than the murderer, etc., and if he does not want to believe it, he can well go to France and experience it, etc. So it is good that not only the lyre of the legate but also the other part has been heard. Furthermore, they wanted to have the legate himself, and when he appeared, he would have liked to have the dismissal in writing; but they did not comply. Then they pointed out to him that he was acting out of order and wanted to bring his matters to the communities without the approval of an assembly, to which he excused himself: it is not peaceful in Helvetia, and he also doubted the answer; so he was not instructed to proceed further. They also pointed out to him with special emphasis that he should have spoken in court about several thousand Spaniards in Prosper's affair at Haldenstein, which he could easily bring into the country with the help of Count Hannibal, etc. This will be further investigated; for when the Rhaetian affair was in fervor, it is well known that Hannibal mustered his men and took on a large number of people, and at the same time, the traitor Flavius, who was imprisoned here but bought and released or at least requested by pensioners and now leads his treacheries to the inquisitors in Milan, as an internuncius posted day and night to Hannibal, was also at the same time in Rome with the pope. But when the Rhaetian conscii affair began and people saw how united the common man was there and how it went for one and another, Hannibal's army dispersed and nothing came of it. It is said (as the consul tells me) that the Spaniards are retreating to Milan because they want to entertain the eyes of the new duke, who recently arrived there; they want to inspect the troops, etc.</p>
      <p>But who does not see how this does not rhyme at all with these times? However, since my gracious lords of the three Leagues have no real basis for this, and yet much is being said here and there and especially among the papists in Feldkirch and elsewhere about how they will take revenge on the Rhaetians and awaken them again, and how so many new ships have been made on Lake Como, it has also been decided today to write quickly to the officials in Valtellina, expressing my lords' wonder that they have not been informed at all about such matters, etc. But, but: the prefect of this province is a true Epicurean, etc. Whatever is written and answered to my lords, I will let you know quickly. I do not trust the matter at all, and all the less because they are only now being reminded to have a faithful watch and prepare themselves, and yet many people are ignoring this and are no less cheerful, yes, many are even more cheerful than at other times. Many fear for their pension and pay even less attention to the obvious danger, yes, no attention at all, so that we may well not learn to swim until the water reaches our mouths. God protect us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the prodigy, I asked Hansen Jaule, the ensign in Schiers, myself the day before yesterday, who saw it; he said everything as I wrote, except so much more thoroughly, that he indicated that after the large leading stream or wood burr had passed, the white ribbon, which was nothing else than a white, long ribbon to which the burrs were tied, began to bend and curve like a half circle, until a complete circle and... emerged from it. I also asked the bailiff Gaudentz from Lenz myself today. He spoke precisely about the shot and also said about a long leading flame that descended and threw out other sparks and then began to shine and diminish again after half an hour and wonderfully intertwined, as if someone were making... etc., which others then saw come together like a cross. This is as much as I could understand; however, I will ask others more. We would like the history to be published in print, as it happened in Paris and Lyon. With this, entrusted to God. Salutat reverentiam tuam d. Campellus, d. Müllerus, d. Pontisella, d. Bonettus, d. Carolus et Victor et caeteri omnes etc.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Lucius Nierius, whom I would like to see progress diligently in his studies so that he may soon feed the Davosians, who currently have an idle, unfaithful, and drunken pastor.</p>
      <p>A sincere and diligent pastor would accomplish much there, but we are completely deprived of the proper work of the present one. He conspires and inclines towards the parties of Gantner and Merius, the dark ones, etc.</p>
      <p>Most quickly in Chur, October 13, 1572.</p>
      <p>My wife and children greet you and humbly commend themselves to you. May your choir and Mr. Ernius be safe.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Iconius. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his singular lord, most reverend and esteemed.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Pastor.</p>
