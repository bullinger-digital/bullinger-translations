    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If the people of Zurich did not intend to let their Andreas Karlstadt leave, why then did Bullinger recommend him so highly to the people of Basel, and why did he inquire in his last letter [HBBW IV, No. 376] what the people of Basel intended to do with Karlstadt, as if they had forgotten him? Surely, only Bullinger can be responsible for the fact that the Zurich council is not letting Karlstadt go: He must have praised him too highly before the council! Instead, he should have explained to the councilors why the people of Basel want Karlstadt and should have convinced them that they would not suffer any harm if they complied with their request! But now Bullinger and his colleagues [in the draft: But now Bullinger is] are to blame for the fact that the people of Basel have to send a delegation to convince the Zurich council to let them have Karlstadt if they want to assist with education and the church in Basel. Bullinger must rectify his mistake if he does not want the Basel colleagues to be angry with him in the future [in the draft: to be even more angry with him in the future than they have been so far].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius is not joking! In Basel, no one, including himself, doubts that Bullinger caused the rejection of the Basel request by the Zurich council. Therefore, it is important to win back the favor of the people of Basel. To do this, he must persuade the Zurich council to let the people of Basel have Karlstadt. However, it is not necessary to retract his previous statements. He just needs to make it clear to his council that he supports Karlstadt's appointment in Basel because he was asked to do so and because he cares about promoting theological education in Basel (for which Karlstadt would be very suitable). Although the people of Basel are not lacking in scholars, and all subjects are offered in the curriculum, the teachers are forced to teach a subject other than their own. So if Bullinger manages to secure Karlstadt's appointment in Basel, they will forgive him for his misstep.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He should also respond to Myconius’ last letter, delivered by Leo Jud's relative [Hans Heinrich Winkeli] [HBBW IV, No. 386].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] May he not take offense at Myconius’ justified anger. [The draft was signed as follows: "Os. Myconius, in his own name as well as in that of his colleagues"; the final version, however, with: "Os. Myconius, always yours, even when he is angry"].</p>

      <p>Greetings. If it was not your intention to let Karlstadt go, why did you recommend him so highly? Why did you add at the end of your last letter: "What about Karlstadt?" as if we had forgotten him? There is no doubt that you alone are the reason why the council does not want to let him go, because of the recommendation, which I dreamt you made and completed in person. It would have been better if you had explained our reasons for wanting him and advised them to comply with our request, as it could be done without any loss to them. Now, look, you are forcing us to send a delegation to your people to ask them to confirm what we have decided, if they wish to support our letters and church in some way. Therefore, correct the mistake by any means, unless you prefer the Basel brothers and church to be more displeased with you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You are mistaken if you think I am joking! There is no one who does not attribute the rejection to Bullinger, especially myself. Therefore, dear friend, make sure to reconcile with us here. This will happen if you ensure that Karlstadt is released. You do not need to retract anything, but simply say that you were moved by our requests and your love for letters, which you wish to see promoted more with us, especially in the area where Karlstadt can contribute the most. We are not lacking in scholars, nor in the method of teaching, but here, as each is compelled to look to his own duty, we are somewhat at a disadvantage. Therefore, if you do this, there will be nothing to reproach you for in the future.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It remains for you to respond to the letter I sent through Leo's relative.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell and interpret our anger fairly. Basel, June 5, 1534. Oswald Myconius, always yours, even when he is angry.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious Antistes of Zurich, friend and brother above all to be respected.</p>
