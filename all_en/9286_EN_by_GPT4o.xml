      <p>Greetings. Two days ago I wrote to you, and since several other letters had to be sent to different places at the same time, I perhaps carelessly forgot to include the promised note about various matters with your letter; therefore, receive it now. Yesterday it was certainly reported that the Venetians have made peace with the Turks; they allow him Cyprus and the rest that he has occupied. He who has, has; he who lies, lies.</p>
      <p>Additionally, 300,000 ducats are to be paid over many years, and furthermore, certain places in Dalmatia, in return the Turks grant the Venetians some areas in Macedonia. On the aforementioned day, it is reported from the Netherlands that they have broken out from Haarlem into the camp, they have killed a number of enemies which is not yet expressed, and brought into their city very rich or at least splendid spoils; namely 14 German flags, 15 flags of the Walloons and Spaniards, and 4 larger cannons with several captives of notable name.</p>
      <p>The people of La Rochelle are said to have killed 600 royalists in a new sortie. It is astonishing how much these reports have alarmed the papists and Spaniards, although it is not indeed surprising, since the pivot of all their safety and plans was involved here.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I pray, greet Mr. Gwalther in my name courteously and share these few, yet not insignificant, matters.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, April 13, in the year 73.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] von Stetten, most devoted to your reverence.</p>
