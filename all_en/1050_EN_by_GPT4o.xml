      <p>S. P. I received your more detailed letters along with the book against Cochl√¶us sent by Froschauer with the greatest gratitude and read them both separately and with certain others who are very fond of you, often and repeatedly. The more I reread them, the more I admire and revere your humanity, learning, and piety, even though I could hardly think that anything could be added to my love, respect, and piety towards you. I wish there could be an opportunity and ability for us to reciprocate and gratify you and yours from the heart. Believe me, I would do nothing more willingly. Although I fear that it might be somewhat presumptuous to tire your humanity by asking for more frequent letters of this kind, yet because your humanity and piety are so inclined to deserve well both publicly and privately from all, I am indeed very confident and persuade myself again and again that you will not disdain in the future, for that singular spirit of yours towards us, to respond to letters and always in full love, as much as you can amidst your many and most sacred duties, without any inconvenience to yourself, and given the opportunity, since nothing could be more pleasing or even more salutary and consoling to us all. And just as you recently explained your opinion to us about the indifferent matters most clearly, without any circumlocution, so I would very much like you not to cease helping us with your judgment and support, which will be like an oracle to us, on other matters as well. For these things will now be more and more discussed publicly, not only by adversaries but also in our republics and churches by our own people, as they wish to appear, and by certain leading figures: namely, if the Emperor and the Roman Empire or even the Council of Trent itself were to leave all the principal doctrines intact as they are mostly explained according to the Scriptures in Augustine and Ambrose, Hilary, etc., among the Latins, and in Chrysostom, Basil, Athanasius, and other Greeks, and were to recognize and amend those ingrained errors of the scholastics and monks introduced against the sense and testimonies of the ecclesiastical writers and the primitive church, whether in external rites and ecclesiastical order the testimonies and reason of those same ancient ecclesiastical writers should be received rather than that our churches should be despised as schismatics or even heretics, and overwhelmed and destroyed with their teachers and manifest wolves. For there are, as you know, and there will be some among us who say that everything should be reformed and reconciled according to that consensus, which they call, of the ancient catholic and orthodox writers, and that no schisms or innovations should be endured any longer, but that the most ancient ecclesiastical institutions should be preserved according to the Scriptures in the sound and catholic understanding of the church and the ancient doctors, from which to vary and follow certain things of one's own is contended to be schismatic. Write back copiously about these and similar matters, I beg you.</p>
      <p>If you wish to know about the Saxon war brought by Brunswick to Magdeburg, consider this: After Duke George of Mecklenburg had encamped with his army not far from Magdeburg and was ravaging the neighboring fields, the farmers of that place, who had fled to Magdeburg, obtained from the senate, despite the dissuasion of some, among whom Albert Count of Mansfeld, an exile there, was prominent, that with some citizens and hired soldiers added, with scythed chariots and light armor equipment and bombards, they would make sorties from the city against the enemy camps and engage with the collected militia and mostly rustic men with veterans and trained soldiers. There about 2000 peasants and about 200 citizens and soldiers of Magdeburg fell in battle.</p>
      <p>Our princes, especially Duke Augustus and Wolfgang of Anhalt, entered Magdeburg as peacemakers; but what they have accomplished, we cannot yet know for certain. Elector Duke Maurice, as they say, received those soldiers of the Emperor and in the name of the Empire into his protection. Unless the matter is pacified, great devastation and change must necessarily follow in these regions, whichever side wins.</p>
      <p>However, in our churches nothing at all has been changed yet; but what the conclusion of the diets and the Council of Trent will bring, we will soon find out. Farewell and love us back, as you do, and write back. Written very quickly in the midst of the noise of our autumn fair in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Devoted and dedicated to your humanity from the heart, Valentin Paceus, minister of the church of Jesus Christ at St. Nicholas in Leipzig, professor of theology in the academy there, etc.</p>
      <p>That which you sent to us recently, as if descended from heaven, everyone approves and praises to the skies: we teach nothing but what we have received as handed down in the Scriptures, which the foremost doctors of the ancient church taught.</p>
      <p>This is the way, this is the path...</p>
      <p>I will love you for your very great merit. Forgive the one improvising and writing whatever comes to the mouth to a most learned and pious friend... It is indeed a certain conversation, which, even if little or nothing is beneath it, has sweetness in the conversation itself, as he says, etc.</p>
      <p>To the man of God, without controversy in all ways the highest and most serious lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his eternal and immortal friend.</p>
      <p>Valentin Paceus of Leipzig.</p>
