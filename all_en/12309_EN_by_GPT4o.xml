    <p xml:id="regest1">In the name of their friendship, Bullinger no longer wishes to argue with Myconius about his [Markus] commentary. It is regrettable that Myconius does not get along well with Gwalther, especially since Gwalther is a faithful and pious person. - What Emperor Diocletian [Charles V] is doing to the old [Hermann von Wied], Bullinger has long known. May God crush the former in this matter! - On October 11, a diet will take place in Baden, prompted by the provocations of the Governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos]. The renewal of the alliances will also be discussed. Myconius should ensure that the people of Basel refuse to swear the alliances invoking the saints, just as the people of Bern (who have written about this) will do. - [Heinrich] Buchter sends his regards with thanks. Bullinger will deal with [Kaspar] Schneeberger according to Myconiusâ€™ advice. - In the response to this [No. 2255] concerning Schwenckfeld, Bullinger wrote on behalf of all the pastors. It is surprising that Myconius has not yet responded to it. Hopefully, he did not take the sentence "Let us continue to be at peace regarding [Schwenckfeld]!" personally, but understood it as a response from the people of Zurich to be conveyed to the applicants. Myconius should beware of Schwenckfeld and his followers! - Bullinger recommends Ludwig, the promising son of the mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater. Ludwig will study in Strasbourg. - Bullinger requests news about the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Regarding your commentaries, honorable lord and brother, I will say no more. Things are well. Our friendship remains unbroken. If you do not get along well with Gwalther, I am sorry; for I sincerely love him and find him to be pious and faithful every day. However, I hope that you will eventually judge him more favorably and that he will be more courteous and grateful towards you.</p>
      <p>The matter that Emperor Diocletian [Charles V] is causing for the good old man, I have seen, heard, and read long ago. In the meantime, I thank you for your faith and diligence. What if the impious rascal were to fall while trying to strike the head of the well-deserving old man? Let us pray to the Lord to deliver him from the lion's mouth.</p>
      <p>A diet has been announced in Baden for the 11th of this month, mainly because of the provocations of the Governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos], and also for other reasons that you undoubtedly know. The renewal of the alliances will also be discussed. Ensure that your people refuse to swear the alliances invoking the saints, as the people of Bern wrote to my lords the day before yesterday, stating that they will not swear otherwise (otherwise no one should speak of them, etc.), or that they are inclined to let the swearing be omitted this time and to keep the alliances otherwise, as the five places also think, there is no need for swearing if one keeps faith otherwise, etc.</p>
      <p>Dr. Buchter sends you his regards and thanks you. I have received Schneberger as a friend. I will treat him most amicably; for he seems to be exactly as you describe him.</p>
      <p>I wrote about Schwenckfeld, which not only I, but all the others unanimously feel. However, I am surprised that when you received the letters I sent, you did not respond. You will not take it amiss that among other things we say: "Let us continue to be at peace." We added this so that you could more conveniently dismiss those who pray and intercede with you. Watch, I pray, and ensure that this arrogant, envious, and quarrelsome beast has no place among your people! You cannot believe how miserably the church would be disrupted and you, along with all the best people, would be harassed. May the Lord keep you from evil!</p>
      <p>The one who offers this to you, Ludewychus, the son of the consul Lavater, is a young man of great promise. He is going to Strasbourg for the sake of his studies. I commend him to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Zurich, October 7, 1545. If you have any news from the Netherlands, share it. I wrote very quickly; I did not reread.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, my esteemed lord and brother.</p>
