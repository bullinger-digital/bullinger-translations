      <p>Greetings. Your letter dated the 22nd of this month, reverend sir and dearest brother, was delivered to me by your messenger on the 24th of this month, just as the sun was setting in the west.</p>
      <p>To which I had to respond with either few or no letters, both because of some private matters that were occupying me at the time, and because of the messenger's threatened departure.</p>
      <p>I understand that you are wondering why our senate does not respond to the letters of the three cities.</p>
      <p>But I am certainly not surprised; for I do not see what they could respond with, as they have nothing to say.</p>
      <p>The sequence of events is quite clear, no matter how many there are who try to adorn this crow with unknown feathers, in order to deflect blame, even if they cannot completely excuse it, as much as they can.</p>
      <p>The other matter, which was more necessary in my opinion, namely that the honor of both our city and church be restored, is not being considered by anyone; for they think they have sufficiently wiped away all injury by renewing the form of the previous confession, about which I recently wrote to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I see no hope of another response unless it is extorted by the great importunity of the three cities, and what that might be, I do not know at all.</p>
      <p>Regarding Ochino's dialogues, the same thing happened to us as to your citizens; for letters continue to come from Strasbourg, varied and many, in which we are piously admonished by the pious, but harshly accused by others, because our magistrate allows such books to be published from their city, causing great offense to many, and which are soon to be, as is entirely presumed, handed over to Vulcan by the public sentence of the Strasbourg senate as heretical and corruptors of all honesty and piety.</p>
      <p>Some of these letters have recently reached our senate, which, being moved by them, has enjoined us, as your senate did to you, to diligently investigate the whole matter, how it was conducted and whether it was admitted by our censors, after inspecting the dialogues.</p>
      <p>Therefore, executing what we were ordered, we found the interpreter of the Dialogues, Castalio, who does not deny that he did it at the instigation of the printer Perna.</p>
      <p>We have not yet found who did the censorship.</p>
      <p>Perna says he handed over the book to Basilius Amerbach, who was acting as rector at the time, for censorship according to the law.</p>
      <p>Amerbach responds that he sent it to Coelius (since it was written in Italian).</p>
      <p>Coelius admits that he inspected the book, but did not censor it or give anyone permission to publish it.</p>
      <p>Thus, the matter is entangled in such a labyrinth that I completely ignore who will ultimately be blamed.</p>
      <p>From this, another evil has also arisen, namely a rather biting writing that Beza published against Castalio, proclaiming him a heretic Pelagian and a most pestilent corrupter of sacred scripture; he also accuses our school and church, as well as the leaders of the whole city, albeit a little more gently, yet still quite harshly, for tolerating such a pest in their church and city.</p>
      <p>We are waiting daily to see with what satisfactions or what sponge Castalio will wipe away this stain that has been objected to him.</p>
      <p>However, I fear that this will be no small spark of a new fire.</p>
      <p>This reproach, this is what I wanted to write to you in the present time of distress, honorable sir and brother always to be respected in the Lord, asking Christ from the heart to preserve you and all your people and the remaining brothers from evil, whom you may kindly greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Basel, at the break of dawn by the smelly lamp, on the 25th of November, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know, Wolfgang Wissenburg, most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme theologian, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother always to be revered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
