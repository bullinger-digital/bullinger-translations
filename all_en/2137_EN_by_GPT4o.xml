      <p>The Emperor desired peace, but the king rejected it; for it is deceitful and to the detriment of the entire Christian republic and especially of Germany. You can hardly believe what kind of treaties he wishes to enter into with the king, so that he can slaughter, destroy, and, like Herod, extinguish the human race with him, if it were possible. Therefore, it is better for the war to be prolonged; for in the meantime, the Lord will provide better times, which the king, who indeed thinks of the best, has decided to do with the help of allies. Farewell.</p>
