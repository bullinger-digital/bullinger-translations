      <p>Greetings. I received your letter today, reverend father, for the first time; however, I fear that our merchants have already departed, and therefore I am writing this before I have read the letter of Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>We will have certain news about the Venetians at our fair; Mr. Friedrich von Salis is also expected, who was with me in Ilanz and promised to write himself; he instructed me to commend him to you very much; however, I forgot to do so amidst the great turmoil of affairs. Nevertheless, I have faithfully communicated all your matters that needed to be shared.</p>
      <p>I will send back the rest of your items in 8 days, if I live; for now, there is nothing new; I am attaching a note for you to read.</p>
      <p>The man from Sax has traveled through here, intending to obtain service with the Venetians; however, he doubts it; he will be here again in 8 or 10 days; then he will communicate everything. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, on St. Martin's Day, in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his ever-honorable lord and patron.</p>
