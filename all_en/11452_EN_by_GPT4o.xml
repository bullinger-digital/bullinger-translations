    <p xml:id="regest1">On the day [in Hagenau], the Protestants referred the negotiators to the Augsburg Confession. The negotiators are the bishops of Trier and Strasbourg, as well as Ludwig of Bavaria and Count Palatine Ludwig. Since they were divided on whether to first negotiate about religion or the restitution of church properties, King [Ferdinand] decided to begin with the religious question. The papal envoy [Morone] has offered 50,000 [ducats] to recruit new members for the Catholic alliance. Zwick includes a list of the participants of the day.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>At the assembly, nothing has been done yet, except that our side has presented the Augsburg or Saxon Confession to the commissioners; now we await what will follow.</p>
      <p>The commissioners entrusted with the matter are four: the Bishop of Trier and the Bishop of Strasbourg, Duke Ludwig of Bavaria, and Count Palatine Ludwig.</p>
      <p>Two of the princely commissioners thought it necessary to begin the matter with the restitution of the dispossessed, while the other two thought to start with religion; since they could not agree among themselves, the matter was referred to the king, who sided with those who thought to begin with religion. The restitution is to be discussed later. Thus, the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord. In the alliance against us, apart from the bishops, there are no princes except the Bavarian and the Brunswick; therefore, the papal envoy, who is acting here, has promised in the name of the Pope 50,000 in ready money, so that the alliance may be expanded; for some are deterred by the expenses.</p>
      <p>You have the list of those gathered at the assembly from the note added to the letter. I wanted to inform you and the other good brothers of this, with whom I wish you well, especially with Pellican. July 14.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
