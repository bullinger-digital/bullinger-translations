      <p>S. in domino. I am completely unaware of what you are doing and how you are faring. Perhaps you are so occupied with correcting your sermons that you scarcely have time to scratch your ears. However, when you find some leisure, I would like you to briefly inform me of how you are doing. We have nothing new, and it is surprising that so few pamphlets have come from these fairs and are available.</p>
      <p>The people of Wittenberg are silent, perhaps waiting for a better state of the Saxon church. From Leipzig, I have heard this: "They say the Emperor's assembly will be in Erfurt; if this happens, it will be over for the people of Magdeburg and Bremen. The Duke of Prussia is also afraid for himself.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland has married a certain noble girl whose parent has passed away, and he has made great enemies among his people because he has so offended the royal majesty.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is trying to annex Danzig and some other cities to the Roman Empire, which belong to the King of Poland; hence, I suspect there will be dreadful wars again. Lübeck, Hamburg, Lüneburg, Brunswick, Magdeburg, the Duke of Pomerania, the Danish affairs, and some other evangelical cities have conspired again with certain princes, declaring they would rather die than consent to the Interim against their conscience." So he says.</p>
      <p>In these days, a legate from the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order was with us, who is traveling to the King of France; he has the most beautiful gifts with which he wishes to honor the king. He especially has two spoons made with marvelous skill, adorned with precious stones; I think they are made from the bone of some animal, which are said to be against all poison; he will give one to the king and the other to the queen. What this prince wants to hunt with the king is almost divine.</p>
      <p>Also, a certain Pole was with me on the first of May, whom I happened to meet by chance in the Fish Market, who had come from Venice. He gave us great hope for the acceptance of evangelical doctrine in Poland; for the queen is well-disposed towards the gospel and urges the king against certain bishops who can bear nothing less than the doctrine of Christ. Strasbourg has not yet accepted the Interim. The bishop disagrees with the senate, demands that they swear an oath to restore all the old customs and ornaments as they were before; otherwise, he will not allow anyone to preach the word of the Lord in a church; he wants it to be so. See the cunning and poisoned nature of that Erasmus. Who would ever have believed that a man of such dignity would be so changed! Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 7th May 1549. Greet Dr. Theodor and Pellican along with the others in my name.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>You will find what is happening in Saxony in the enclosed letters, which you will return to me. I will soon send a catalog of books, etc.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich. Go to Zurich to Master Heinrich Bullinger</p>
