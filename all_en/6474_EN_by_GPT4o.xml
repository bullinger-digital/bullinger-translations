      <p>Greetings. I cannot express how much pleasure I derived from your letter written on the first of April, and how much I embraced you in spirit and praised God for keeping you safe for us.</p>
      <p>However, I did not receive the letters you mentioned you gave to Johann Ulrich, nor do I expect any that are entrusted to him; for he is a very ungrateful young man, to say nothing more severe.</p>
      <p>But I pray that you send your letters through those who are traveling to Lyon, to Peter Sent, whose sons are with Mr. Gwalther; for nothing can be more pleasing to me than to be informed by you about your health and matters worthy of knowing. I am glad that the disturbances in Graub√ºnden have been settled through the work of your envoys and that everything is proceeding lawfully.</p>
      <p>It is not new that our extravagances ruin many, nor that the usual remedies are of much help, nor am I surprised if friends congratulate me for having flown away from such restless regions.</p>
      <p>There are those who advise me to recall my son; for here good literature flourishes and everything seems quite peaceful, although there are still those who disturb the peace and sound the trumpet.</p>
      <p>I would gladly understand your opinion on this matter. Please convey my greetings to the honorable council and all friends, being assured that nothing is more in my wishes than to be able to do you a favor in some way. My wife also sends you her warmest greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Paris, May 20, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
