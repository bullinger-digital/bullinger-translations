    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's report on the situation of the people of Zurich, which is causing concern here. Strasbourg has reminded the people of Basel and Bern of their duty. Capito explains the Strasbourg understanding of the Lord's Supper, shows its closeness to Zwingli, and claims that the Lutheran "substantialiter" and "corporaliter" mean nothing more than "vere." He asks the people of Zurich to present Christ in the Lord's Supper to the believers in the same sense as they preach about him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is pleasing that you have depicted the condition of the republic to us in your letters. There are those here who seriously care for the cause of Christ among you. The people of Basel have been urged to their duty by our people, who have acted in a way that I believe has already been conveyed to you by the events themselves. Some have spurred the overly hesitant Bear. We do not boast of our duty, but in the meantime, we are diligent with all our strength to prevent Satan from finding ruin. We leave the rest to the Lord. Bucer will write more extensively, as he met with some people yesterday. I write this quickly before I deliver my sermon.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Eucharist, Bucer responds to you. Know that we are striving greatly to prevent the Lutherans from finding any plausible reason to attack us. I know that Zwingli never denied the presence of Christ, because with this battering ram he has overthrown all the papal machines. Christ is present to his body as the head is to the members. Therefore, he does not need a vicar, as he himself cares for his bride and imparts to her life and the sense of spiritual things. Likewise, Christ is present in the contemplation of faith, otherwise, he is bodily in heaven. Therefore, we persistently say that the Lutherans disapprove and tear down what none of us has asserted. For they claim that the signs are not mere reminders of the absent Christ, but are now spiritually consumed. Luther thinks that Christ is present to us as if in a dream and imaginatively. But the spiritual presence is the true presence of the true Christ. For there is only one and true Christ, who renews hearts by the Spirit. What is more, we and ours clearly affirm that Christ is present to the church until the end of the age. Therefore, to remove slanders, we say that the true Christ is truly present at the supper and is offered with the bread to the believing soul to be consumed. For he offered the bread and himself. Now the ministers offer the bread to the mouth, but Christ offers himself to the mind, which Augustine explains more clearly by "signifies," and Tertullian by "figure." These words others think deny that Christ is present to his church. Add that the Lutherans by "substantially" and "corporally" mean nothing other than "truly." Do these little words disturb? Here we are divided in matters. The Lutherans say all is obscure and unknown as to how he is present, while we say faith is the light, and it sees that he is present to the soul by faith, to which he either increases grace or adds it anew. Hence, we make the mystery common only to the pious, while the Lutherans make it common even to the impious, and Christ is offered, who for us is nothing but the food of life. We seem to obscure as well, because, eager for peace, we carry before us the Christian candor, accepting everything in the better part. Therefore, I ask nothing else from you than that you preach Christ most vividly and offer him as one to the senses of believers in the same way as you do in word, as ministers of the spirit, disregarding the tumults of those who perhaps pursue glory rather than truth.</p>
      <p>In these times, the magistrate is changing among us. Everything is busier than is expedient for the leisure of religion. We will ardently strive henceforth to adorn the face of the church with suitable gifts.</p>
      <p>Always write freely about what is happening there. We will keep secret what must be concealed. For the time being, as brothers, we will eagerly assist you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 5, 1533.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Theodor, Pellican, and all the professors and preachers. I will write to Leo myself later. At this moment, it was not possible.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, to be respected as a brother in Christ. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
