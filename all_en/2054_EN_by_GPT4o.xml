      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I recently received your most courteous letter along with the enclosed one from Mr. Vergerius. However, the ones you mentioned sending to me through the Leoninis, I have not seen at all, nor can I guess who that pharmacist or the Leonine family might be, so I do not complain about anyone for that reason. Your accounts of the military affairs were most welcome, and I had learned almost the same from my magnificent friend, Lord Ascanio Marso, in his letters to me a little earlier.</p>
      <p>He added that the French and Turks were treacherous in this matter, as in the island of Corsica, the only port of Saint Boniface was guarded in the name of the Genoese by the inhabitants, who surrendered to the besiegers on the condition that they would be safe in their lives and possessions. However, when they all went out, they were miserably slaughtered. The Imperialists have conceived not a small hope of recovering the island; but on the contrary, the French sent reinforcements of artillery, men, and money. But may the Lord scatter those who desire unjust wars.</p>
      <p>I believe the heresiarch Servetus is still kept in prison due to his obstinacy and unshaken arrogance. Maternus says that the Spaniards are led by an exalted arrogance. Here, it is not dissimilar; but I wish he had no supporters of his sect, both here and elsewhere, especially among those who wish to be considered most learned and excellent. I have heard some, for this reason, slandering the excellent minister Calvin, as if he were an executioner; I have defended him to the best of my ability, in place and time, for the glory of God, and I will not desist from doing so more sharply in the future, trusting in the Lord, even if I am a flea against elephants. For I desire to please God more than men. If it were allowed by the comforts of life, what painted monstrosities of opinions would we hear? But I do not wish to lead you into a worse suspicion than necessary. I briefly respond to our Vergerius, so as to relieve you of part of the labor as well. Farewell, my most esteemed doctor, and know that I and all my affairs are yours and your friends'. From Basel, on the 28th of October, 1553. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Guglielmo Grataroli, physician.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent pastor of the Zürich church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered, in Zürich soon.</p>
