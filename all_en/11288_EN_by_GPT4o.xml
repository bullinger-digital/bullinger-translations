    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter; trusts that all instructions will serve him for the best. He is willing to direct his studies towards religion according to Bullinger's wish and asks once more for guidance on Bible reading. He has received the lute, [the works of] Cicero, and the money, and Quirinus [von Leiden] will bring him the "Index" by Eliott; furthermore, he requests a copy of the Latin Münster Bible. Myconius has shown Grynäus Bullinger's letter [No. 1239] to remind him of his promise, but Gwalther fears resistance from Grynäus' wife [against his admission into their house]. Greetings. Sends back a pouch.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Froschauer delivered your letter to me, most kind father, in which you both console me and instruct me on what should be done next. For these benefits to me, I give you great thanks; I will also repay you if ever the opportunity to do so is granted. You seem to be overly concerned, as you once again explain so carefully the reason why you denied me Wittenberg; for I have long been convinced that you not only see what is beneficial for me but also advise me with well-considered counsel, so that inquiring into the reasons for your commands does not require much effort. For I have resolved to obey and comply with your orders; I gladly accept your admonitions if I err in any way.</p>
      <p>You wish that the aim of my studies be religion, which I also desire above all; for I see that this is the only goal set before me, in which I can both fulfill the divine calling and respond to the benefits bestowed upon me. I will therefore take care that you do not find me forgetful of your admonition here. I had asked you, while I was still in Strasbourg, to show me in a few words the order in which the books of the Holy Scripture should be read; I now ask this of you again (if you have the leisure).</p>
      <p>I received the lute and Cicero on the same day; Froschauer gave the money. Everything else is safe. Quirinus will bring the Index of Eliott to me. I also ask that you arrange for the Latin Bible of Münster, printed by Christoph, to be bound and sent to me through the same Quirinus, and that you pay the price from the money you have with you, unless you have decided otherwise; but you know, of course, that I cannot make much progress in theology without my own Bible.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write at the moment. You wrote to Myconius about the promises made to Grynäus for my sake; he handed the letter to Grynäus to read. He has not yet responded, but I fear that the new wife, because of the wealth she possesses, may claim authority over her husband. Therefore, I will write more extensively about this matter later.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, keep you safe for a long time for His church. Farewell, dearest patron, and keep your Rudolf recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Please greet your wife, mother, and the entire household in my name.</p>
      <p>I am sending back here the pouch in which you sent Cicero to me. Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, March 16, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Forgive, please, the blots; for I did not have the leisure to rewrite.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed patron.</p>
