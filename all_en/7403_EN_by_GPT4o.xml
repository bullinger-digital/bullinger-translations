      <p>Greetings. It is reported by certain men: An edict has been published in Innsbruck, that all who do not follow the camp of the Antichrist should quickly pack up all their belongings and move elsewhere, and not a few are now also expelled to head under another sun. - Our envoy has sent Flavius Neopolitanus (a man devoted to the study of medicine and dearest to the envoy above all others), as some suppose and he himself even let slip, to Constantinople, where our envoy's brother is, the ambassador and envoy of the Turkish emperor. What he is planning at this time is variously debated among us. Some think he carries royal letters, by which he will plead with the intercession of his brother to the Turk himself, not to attempt anything before they have achieved their desires in France. But this is a foolish opinion. Whatever it may be, nothing auspicious will come of it for us.</p>
      <p>From Valtellina, it is written by distinguished men that a man of the highest rank in Mantua has been imprisoned for the sake of religion, and because that man is related by blood to the duke himself, the duke has therefore urged the inquisitor for his release. The inquisitor denied having that power and replied that he acknowledges the duke as his lord, but the pope far excels, for whom this cause is being conducted; therefore he cannot consent and release that man. A few days later, the duke himself sent a certain nobleman to the inquisitor for the same reason, to plead and entreat for the release of that captive. The inquisitor refused and repeated that it was not within his power, but he showed the keys, if they wished to free him by force and unlawful power, they should give an account; he himself would by no means do it, etc.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago in Mantua, worthy plots were laid against all the monks inhabiting the monastery of that place; for there were those who, at nightfall, set fire to the monastery, so that if the flames grew, the monks would rush out of their hiding places and all would be slaughtered in the ensuing tumult. But they detected the fiery plots in time; only two monks, more struck than the others, ventured out a little more freely and were quickly slaughtered. The duke is diligently inquiring into the perpetrators; but he has discovered no one so far. In Rome, some are burned, suffocated, beheaded daily; all the prisons and jails are so full that they are working daily on constructing new prisons. Even the vast Rome can hardly contain and hold the number of the pious. They burned a certain distinguished man named Carnesecchi, once the envoy of the Duke of Florence. They also detained two others far more distinguished, one called Baron Bernhard von Angole, the other Count von Pitigliano, an old and valiant Roman; but often solicited to defection, they finally recanted, provided they could be freed and live freely. What happens? One of them is condemned to eternal custody and forced to pay 8000 crowns; the other is fined 1000 crowns and condemned to perpetual custody in a Jesuit monastery. Thus they gained life by disgraceful defection, more miserable than death itself. This is what I have from Italy at present; what France now harbors, I received from you at the very moment I wrote this. We all thank you, who have freed us from great anxiety and anxious concern. Our Mercury talks much about the business of peace, nor did he do so before they despaired of the main matter; thus he always spreads different things, so that he blinds his own more and more every day.</p>
      <p>These things quickly. Chur, March 2, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most devoted, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord to be honored with perpetual faith.</p>
