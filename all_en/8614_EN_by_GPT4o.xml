      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, by the grace of God, all is well with us; may God grant that it is also well with you. We have opened your barrel; for we were worried that it would all turn gray, as it happened. So we have aired it. Now the foreman is coming in haste; we have closed it again as best we can. The linen clothes are all now in the wash; they will be ready for you at another time, God willing, etc. Greet Susanna and Liseli and all your people for us. Unfortunately, it is now unbearably expensive; may God improve it. As for the game, as I fear there is no hope, let me know with a word, otherwise I will proceed with what I have; I hope it will be considered good, etc. God be with you and all of you. I would like to have the guests in 8 or 10 days.</p>
      <p>On Friday, St. Anne's Day, July 27, 1571.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son H. Hans Rudolf Bullinger, preacher at Berg.</p>
