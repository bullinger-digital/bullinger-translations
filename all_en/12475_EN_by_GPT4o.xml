    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though Bullinger had written in his letter [not preserved] that he did not know what to write, it contained valuable information. Myconius, on the other hand, writes just to write something.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The information about the Baden Diet interested him greatly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The letter from Neuburg [an der Donau] with the news of the crime committed by the Papists is also interesting. Brothers usually stick together, even if one of them has committed a crime. But here [Alfonso Diaz] killed his brother [Juan] for Christ's sake! Just now, a young, noble scholar reported that the fratricide, who had already been brought before the [land] judge [Hans Mag] twice and each time returned to prison, is making great efforts to be acquitted. Juan Diaz, who could have been very useful to the church, is now redeemed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Myconius wanted to know what the [German] Protestants would present at the Baden Diet because the [Basel] envoy [Bernhard Meyer zum Pfeil] had told him the following: After [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse was allowed by Emperor [Charles V] to express his concerns [at their meeting in Speyer], [Charles V] replied that these were unfounded. [Philip] had accused [Charles V] of preparing for war against the Protestants and having made a five-year peace with [Sultan Suleiman I] for this purpose; by virtue of the Peace [of Crépy], he could count on the support of [King Francis I]; he had incited the Council of Trent to condemn the Lutherans and plagued the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] with the harshest mandates. [Charles V] denied everything and merely stated that he had to defend his honor against those who scorned his mandates (obviously, the Emperor has not yet understood that one must obey God more than men, otherwise he would not be so devoted to the Pope [Paul III]). Therefore, Myconius wondered: What do the [German] Protestants want from the Swiss Confederates? But now he realizes that [Charles V] is a liar! Consequently, Myconius presented the suspicion recently communicated by Bullinger to the astute Bernhard Meyer, who went to Baden with this knowledge.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- It's good that the brothers in Augsburg are getting along! Myconius had feared that the arrival of [Johannes] Haller would stir up emotions. It's strange that Bernardino [Ochino] can fascinate Anton Fugger, who is otherwise always unimpressed by preachers! Hopefully, he will someday leave his wealth to God for the use of His weak ones! Joking aside: Fugger probably likes the Italian language and Ochino's mild preaching style above all.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Heini [Spät?], the bearer of Bullinger's letter and the present writing, was recently described to Myconius by [Matthias] Erb. Like many Anabaptists, he seems to adhere to this heresy more out of zeal than out of malicious intent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- What Bullinger wrote about the "Walchen" [foreigners], Myconius did not understand. These days, individual Macedonian, Italian, and Spanish military leaders passed through. [Antoine Morelet du Museau] came to Basel for a few days. He bought a house on the [Nadel]berg. There are citizens who are insatiably greedy for French gold.</p>

      <p>You do not know what you are writing, and yet you write things that have both taught me what I wanted to know and delighted me greatly. I do not know what to write, and yet I write, but not in the way you do, rather just to write something, whatever it may be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You informed me about the Baden Diet, which interested me greatly, as is usually the case with things one is eager to know.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Then the letters from Neuburg delighted me greatly because of the crime committed by the papist spirit. For what is more fitting? A brother usually covers for his brother's crimes as best as he can. Here, however, a brother killed his brother for Christ's sake. This is cruel! But at this moment, I receive from a young noble and learned man that the fratricide has already been brought before the judge twice and each time returned to prison, making great efforts to be acquitted of this crime. They say Juan Diaz was a very learned and pious man. I bear his death more unjustly because he could have been useful to the church. But since the Lord willed it so, we must yield to Him. As far as salvation is concerned, we do not doubt that it went well for him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, I desired to know what the Protestants would propose at the Baden Diet because our departing envoy told me that the Emperor responded to Hesse's objections, after obtaining permission, by saying that everything was fabricated, etc. Hesse had accused him of preparing for war against the Protestants; that he had made a five-year truce with the Turk for this purpose; that he would call upon the French for help by virtue of the peace; that he was pushing the Council of Trent to condemn the Lutherans to achieve these ends more conveniently; and finally, that he had harassed the Archbishop of Cologne with the gravest mandates, etc. In short, the Emperor countered with good words. In the end, he said, we had to defend our honor against the contempt of all the mandates we had sent. The imprudent man had not understood that one must obey God rather than men, nor does he understand it today, otherwise, he would not devote himself to the Pope in such a way as to acknowledge himself as a son of the apostolic see. Hence, I was wondering, what do the Protestants want with the Swiss? Well, you have satisfied me! I give thanks. For I understand that the Emperor is most devoted to lies and a hypocrite in his dealings, such as I have never known. I presented the suspicion you recently indicated to Lord Bernhard Meyer, who took it to Baden; for he did not reject it while I was narrating, being a prudent and cunning man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I was glad to hear about the concord of the brothers in Augsburg and the whole church. For I feared that the minds I know there would reveal themselves at the arrival of Haller. And it occurred to me that nothing more pestilent could happen to that republic because of the enormity of the luxury that is there. But it is strange about Bernardino, that he captivated Anton Fugger, whom no preacher could ever move. Well done, if he can someday convey such great wealth to heaven, so that the Lord may have something to bestow upon His own, who have been too poor until now! But joking aside: Antonio probably likes the language and the simplicity of expression without bitterness. For you know how easily tender minds, accustomed to flattery, are repelled at the beginning if you speak harshly. May the Lord be present with His grace, that His name may be sanctified.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Heinius, who brought yours and returned mine, was recently described to me by our Erb. Those who recover from Anabaptism teach me how, driven by some kind of madness, they initially went astray with no ill intent; among whom he seems to be. May the Lord preserve him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Finally, you add about the Walchen. I do not understand. In these days, Macedonians, military leaders, Italians, and Spaniards passed through, each separately, and not many. Maurus also came, but on his own. For he bought a house on the Nadelberg. Staying there for a few days, he left again. However, there are citizens who thirst anxiously for French gold, but I do not know if that thirst can ever be satisfied.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and all pious brothers. Basel, April 21, 1546. Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>Bucer has not written a jot since his return. Meanwhile, I have filled this little paper beyond expectation.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ, his most esteemed brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
