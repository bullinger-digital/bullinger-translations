      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not responded to your frequent and indeed most welcome letters, dearest brother, is not due to negligence, but rather to my absence. We have visited the ministers of the entire region in sections, and this took three weeks. We have inquired into both the negligence and diligence of the churches, ministers, and prefects, so that we can now offer our senate nothing more certain than the state of their region. All prefects are summoned to our city on November 10th. They will be advised to promote the glory of God with greater zeal and to oppose vices more than has been done so far. May both senates act according to their wishes and sincerely in all matters. We have given them in hand what, with whom, and in what order they should conduct everything. We have also found progress in the chapters as they are visited by us. We observe the doctrine, morals and life, family, churches, and prefects' review, urging with admonition and threats as steadfastly as possible, and we realize how much our previous negligence has hindered. We have advised all brothers to oppose papism with all their strength, but with solid truth and modesty, and to depict that entire religion in such a way that no one fails to understand that imposture. We have warned them to consider the turmoil of all things and people, the dangers of the times, and the impending wrath of the Lord, as the axe is laid to the root of the tree. These matters have prevented me from responding until now.</p>
      <p>I am sending back what you requested. I am displeased with the redeemed captivity of that rascal, and I wish that such kindness does not make him worse, as is usually the case with us.</p>
      <p>I sincerely wish to have Paul Rasdorfer with us, but no opportunity has yet presented itself. As soon as we can help the man, no one among us will fail him. You know yourself how the common people abhor a foreign language.</p>
      <p>There is no news with us. We await the decisions of the assemblies. Meanwhile, if anything happens with you, write to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>November 9th, the year 32.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the ZÃ¼rich church, his brother, always and in all things dearest.</p>
