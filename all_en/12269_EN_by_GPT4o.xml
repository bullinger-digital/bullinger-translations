    <p xml:id="regest1">Gerhard thom Camph has returned, [and indeed] to the joy of all, as he is seen as a future, faithful servant of the [Emden] church. He brought greetings. However, he could not deliver [Bullinger's] letter to Aquilomontanus because his luggage has not yet arrived. But since Samuel Pellikan will be traveling home, Aquilomontanus writes nonetheless. - Aquilomontanus entrusted a letter for Bullinger [No. 2145] to a Lasco. Hopefully, Bullinger has received this through Gerhard Westerburg. In this letter, Aquilomontanus had urged the [Zurichers] to moderation; however, the [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich” or the “True Confession”] appeared before the letter arrived. Aquilomontanus is so impressed by the book, especially by the interpretation of the twelve articles [of the “Apostles' Creed”], that he has his [three] sons read it in translation at the table. - Allegedly, Luther is preparing a response against the [Zurichers]. They should always be mindful of the fallibility of humans, as emphasized by Zwingli, because their restraint greatly contributed to the success of their response. For instance, Aquilomontanus’ patron [Hero von Oldersum] would not give away his copy sent by Gerhard [thom Camph] even for a lot of money. - Aquilomontanus has good hope regarding the Anabaptists. He gains their friendship by visiting them, and gradually they come to the sermon. He wishes to continue such visits, as they are more important than sermons. - More after reading Bullinger's letter. - [Enclosed] a letter from Aquilomontanus to Bullinger's colleagues.</p>

      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus to Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Gerhard thom Camph, a young man of great promise, has returned to us to the joy of all. We hope he will be a faithful minister of the Lord's church. He conveyed many greetings to us in the name of all of you, but since I have not yet received the letters entrusted to him due to his luggage not yet having arrived, I am compelled to write to you about what comes to mind, especially since Samuel Pellikan (a studious and pious young man, if he adds spurs to his excellent nature) is leaving here for his home.</p>
      <p>I wrote through the reverend Johannes a Lasco, bishop of East Frisia, whose work you have seen; I hope you will see greater things. I hope you have received [the letter] through Gerhard Westerburg of Cologne. In those [letters], I advised you to maintain modesty in your endeavors; but the booklets were published before you received our advice. But thanks be to God, who has made you more modest! I have read and reread, and I cannot read your confession enough, which I have often had my sons read at the table, translated into our language, especially the exposition of the 12 articles. How exiled by reading it! Moreover, I have given thanks to God for the enlightenment of the truth made to the church. Furthermore, I admonish you through Christ to retain the modesty you have maintained in all things up to now.</p>
      <p>I have heard that Luther is preparing a response for you. Therefore, I want you to remember that you are human and can err, and that it is human nature, as Zwingli testifies, to err, and not to reject and despise other gifts in the learned because of this error. For who among men is without blemish? Your modesty has attracted many, and your books are eagerly desired by the pious everywhere; not yet having been brought in abundance, many use one booklet. My patron was so captivated by your confession sent by Gerhard that he would not exchange the booklet for many gold coins (if there were no other copy at hand). All the pious rejoice when something is offered from Zurich.</p>
      <p>I have conceived some hope regarding the Anabaptists in our village, after I have gained their friendship through a certain kindness and on that occasion offered Christ. They are becoming more gentle and gradually listen to the sermons. Moreover, I have decided to dedicate the rest of my life to this duty, and today to visit this house, tomorrow that one, and to take the opportunity for conversation from the situation presented, so that some seed may be left. In this way, I hope to do more good than through public sermons. I regret, dearest, having slept so long in the pastoral office, when I feel that for the sheep entrusted to me, Jesus Christ the Lord, my Savior, shed his blood and suffered a bitter death.</p>
      <p>More, when I have read your letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest of friends.</p>
      <p>Emden, on the feast of Bartholomew. I have written to your colleagues, spiritual men. I pray that they may take it well; which indeed they will do, if you assist me with your interpretation among them.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his brother in Christ.</p>
