      <p>To my esteemed lord and brother, Mr. Johannes Haller in Bern.</p>
      <p>Esteemed lord and brother, your lords have sent our lords a very fine, well-composed letter, indicating therein that they intend to hold a synod on the 1st of March; requesting that I and another of my lords, as agreeable, be sent there; also explaining the reasons that have moved them to this and how it concerns 3 articles: about the examination, the godparenthood, and the ban, what the French propose in this and what is burdensome in the same, etc. My lords have given us the letter so that we should consider it; which we have done. And if the synod were to take place in these turbulent times, we are of the opinion that one should send [someone]. This will be communicated to them. Therefore, nothing can be decided now; one cannot know what will happen. And as the world is now worsening, one must consider how to act so that improvement follows. And many think that the French preachers have not a small reason for their complaint, since everything is corrupted as it is.</p>
      <p>In this matter, I am not a little concerned that you know how most of the synods have been rejected solely because the vehement, stubborn minds have never shown themselves. If one has ever had vehement minds, one has them now. And many are wonderfully prepared to speak and argue. If they are given occasion and place, it is well to think that there is no hope for an end unless one does exactly what they want. If one does not do it, it is so much worse for them, as they think that since one has heard their reasons and does not follow, one sets oneself against the truth. If one is to come together and not become one, it will soon be worse than if one had brought something together. Then one departs from each other with unfinished business, so the papists (who otherwise say we must always improve our faith) boast that they are right, we are mistaken; the Lutherans will first rejoice and say we are divided; those in France, who are just at the beginning, will be offended, and so much more, so much more vehemently they look at the church in Geneva. I am also concerned now that, since I have long sensed that Mr. Calvin has little favor among many of you, if he comes, he will not be admitted, and this will also bring much complaint, displeasure, and offense. If he is then admitted, there is then the concern that some will be even more unfavorable to the whole matter and the matter will go nowhere and afterwards become worse than it was before. Moreover, you know how many strange opinions and views there are among many. If one is to allow them to present and resolve in the synod, when will one become Greek? What a quarrel it will give! If one is to let everyone speak as they wish, you know what complaints will follow. And who is to handle this matter now? If you call many from elsewhere, some strange heads will surely be needed. If few then undertake the matter, it is an unbearable burden, etc. Therefore, it would be necessary above all that, if one wanted to proceed with the synod in these turbulent times, one should first carefully consider whom to call or not, what and why to call them, that also laws and precedents are set and other things that are known to be necessary and are used very finely in the disputation among you, etc. If one then finds that the matter does not fit, because the dangers accompany it, etc., then you might send your advice (for I understand that you have set an orderly consideration among you, of which Mr. Niclaus spoke with me) to some here and in other agreeable places, to request their judgment on it, and when you have them, make from it what serves for edification, peace, and tranquility.</p>
      <p>I have wanted to briefly outline all this to you, what I think is good regarding this matter. As far as I am concerned, I would like to do what I can, gladly come up to you and help try everything that is thought to be the best. I can well imagine that you will moderate this and other things much more appropriately for the good of the matter; nevertheless, I could not refrain from giving you occasion to think further about the matter. And understand it from me in the best way. For I desire nothing more here than that everything may lead to improvement. Therefore, God is to be faithfully prayed to, that He may give wisdom, strength, and a good end to this matter for His honor and the advancement of His word and our salvation. Amen. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 25th of January 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
