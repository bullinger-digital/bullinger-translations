    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has conveyed good news! How wonderful that [Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony is treating [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse, who is returning from the battle, so amicably and paternally! May the Lord preserve this harmony!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [imperial] Dutch army, consisting of only 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry, is on its way to the Emperor [Charles V] and is currently heading towards Rothenburg ob der Tauber. It was repelled by the landgrave's troops near Frankfurt. Some of the imperial soldiers were shot, others captured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] is moving towards Schwäbisch Hall. He wants to prevent the Dutch mercenaries from joining the Emperor or attacking the Landgrave. The landgrave's unit near Frankfurt is about 20,000 strong and is coming to Duke Ulrich's aid via the Bergstraße. This was learned by [Nikolaus] Episcopius on September 4th through a letter from a good friend [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- So that Bullinger cannot complain, as he has in the past, about not receiving [Myconius’ writings], the [“Comforting Interpretation”] is enclosed with the letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Johannes] Gast read [Bullinger's] letter before Myconius got to it. He had led the messenger [...] to Myconius, but the latter was just eating [and therefore allowed Gast to read it].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings to Rudolf [Gwalther]. The messenger [...] is in a hurry; so is Myconius.</p>

      <p>S. You have announced great joy to us! We pray to the Lord Jesus that it may turn out well. We see that divine favor is with us. Therefore, we must ensure that we do not lose it.</p>

      <p>Among other things, I am pleased that the two princes, the Saxon and the Hessian, are acting so amicably with each other. One seems to act as a father, the other as a son. Was not the voice of the Saxon towards the returning Hessian from the battle freely paternal? And was not the Hessian's response that of a son? May the Lord be with such piously concordant minds!</p>

      <p>The Dutch are marching towards the Emperor. They intended to move on Frankfurt. However, the landgrave's troops did not allow them to pass through the land, but drove them back, shooting some and capturing others. They are said to have admitted that they are no more than 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry. They have taken their course towards Rothenburg ob der Tauber.</p>

      <p>Thus, Duke Ulrich is marching with many troops towards Schwäbisch Hall to prevent the Dutch mercenaries from joining the Emperor or the Landgrave. And the infantry and cavalry (cavalry), which were lying around Frankfurt, about 20,000, are also said to have taken their course through the Bergstraße to Schwäbisch Hall to strengthen and help Duke Ulrich. May Almighty God grant grace! I have described this briefly from the letters of [Nikolaus] Episcopius, which were sent to him by a good friend on September 4th.</p>

      <p>I sent my little book for no other reason than that you might not complain, as you did recently, that I give you nothing of my writings.</p>

      <p>[Johannes] Gast read the letter in my house before I did, as he brought the messenger while I was dining. Let us give thanks to the Lord without ceasing and pray that we do not become arrogant from His beneficence.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and Rudolf and other pious ones. The messenger is in a hurry, and I must hurry too. Basel, September 8, 1546.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, venerable brother and lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
