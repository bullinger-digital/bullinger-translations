    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the illness of his brother [Konrad] and the convening of a federal assembly to discuss a council, his dispatch to Strasbourg has been canceled. He will write again soon, but first travels to Ambrosius [Blarer] [in TÃ¼bingen]. Greetings. Sends money on behalf of Wilhelm von Zell for Leo [Jud]. Asks for examples of disastrous councils.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote that I was sent with my brother to Strasbourg. But my brother's illness first hindered the mission. Then, after my brother recovered, letters came from the prince-elector, in which he summoned everyone in that evangelical league to consult about the future council. Hence, our people, taking this opportunity, decided that the mission to the people of Strasbourg should be completely postponed.</p>
      <p>I wanted to let you know this briefly. I will add more soon; for now, I am setting out to Ambrosius.</p>
      <p>Farewell a thousand times with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>January 10, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick. Give this money to Leo. There are, if I am not mistaken, five gold coins, which Wilhelm von Zell sent to be delivered to him. However, I did not receive any letters attached to the money.</p>
      <p>If only I could have some examples of certain ill-fated councils from you!</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most sincere brother.</p>
