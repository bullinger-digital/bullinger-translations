    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's generous book gifts surprise him. He spent this winter reading his commentary on Matthew [HBBibl I 144] and can hardly express his enthusiasm in words; he particularly wishes that Bullinger would also comment on the most thorough evangelist, Luke. Greetings, also to the other Zurich pastors and especially to [Rudolf Gwalther], whom Bullinger should encourage to write; asks Bullinger for legible handwriting in his letters.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>I can hardly admire enough your kindness towards me, as I experience it so greatly that, moved by it, you do not cease to send me some of your commentaries, and indeed you have certainly sent me not a few as a gift, to me, I say, who has not deserved so well of you that you should do so.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this winter I was almost entirely engaged in reading your commentaries on Matthew, the reading of which has delighted me so much that I can hardly express it in words; indeed, I was so delighted by them that I frankly confess I have gained not a little benefit from those very commentaries, both in learning and especially in piety, which is indeed wonderfully commended by you in them. Therefore, unless I knew that you could not cease from writing commentaries on the other evangelists as well, I would urge you on with spurs even as you run. And what I wish for, I would like you to do and undertake that labor on Luke, the most thorough writer of the gospel. For this your truly great kindness towards me, what could I ever repay you, since I have nothing that corresponds to such great kindness of yours towards me, I will not cease to pursue you with the greatest love, especially with that charity with which Christ has joined and united us. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Cologne, on the first of March.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to the other preachers there and especially to my dearest son, who, when he met me in Cologne, greeted me so sweetly and pleasantly and conversed with me that I cannot help but remember him, and also encourage him to write to me sometime. And I would like you, if you ever wish to write to me, to use such characters that I can both read and understand your letters from them. In the meantime, farewell well.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the man most distinguished in piety and excellently adorned with letters and the best morals, Heinrich Bullinger, his best and almost incomparable friend.</p>
