      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, dear brother, along with those you wrote to Count Martinengo; I will send them to Geneva with the first reliable courier.</p>
      <p>I am very sorry that due to my duties, I was unable to honor Mr. Gregor Carl with my presence at some banquet. I liked that man; I had never seen him before.</p>
      <p>I encouraged him, albeit briefly, to remain steadfast in goodness, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet him for me.</p>
      <p>What I received from Heidelberg and elsewhere, I share here; please return it.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Bellievre most dutifully; I have conveyed to him what you have regarding the Empseran legion. Our excellent Samuel Pellican is bedridden; his wife, a most honorable matron, is also bedridden; may the Lord raise them up and preserve them.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jodocus Brenwald's wife is bedridden without hope of life, as is his eldest daughter. Throughout the city, people are being seized and enveloped by this plague; may the Lord grant strength of spirit and true faith.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 15, 1564.</p>
      <p>Greet the lords, the councilors, and the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>All the scholars and foreign students have now dispersed; the school auditoriums are empty. To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Chur church, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
