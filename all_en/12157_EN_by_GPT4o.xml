    <p xml:id="regest1">Ulrich von Württemberg will have taken note of Luther's "Kurtz bekentnis", in which Oecolampadius and Zwingli are reviled. After the people of Zurich endured being provoked in silence for several years, they can no longer tolerate it after Luther's latest writing. Here is their response, composed with the knowledge of the [Zurich] authorities, the [“Warhaffte Bekanntnuß”], which Bullinger requests to be acknowledged. - Furthermore, he requests that the books of the people of Zurich not be banned in the principality of [Württemberg]. Luther has unjustly reviled the people of Zurich and condemned them as heretics; therefore, it would be appropriate for their response to also be read.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and most gracious lord, my humble, willing service along with the offering of all good things is always ready for your princely grace from me.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that your princely grace has seen and partly read Dr. Martin Luther's little book, "Short Confession on the Holy Sacrament" - specifically written against Johannes Oecolampadius, Ulrich Zwingli of blessed memory, us here in Zurich, and all others who do not believe that the Lord's bread is the natural body of Christ and is eaten orally by unbelievers as well as believers, and published in print -, so it is unnecessary to write further about it here. And although we, who are servants of Christ and the church here in Zurich, can well understand what offense and displeasure arise even among pious, believing people from the quarrel, writing, and counter-writing, for which reason we have also endured being provoked, insulted, and challenged for several years, and have remained silent to avoid offense, hoping for God's and a better outcome, yet Dr. Luther, with his aforementioned little book, has so grievously reviled and insulted dead and living pious honorable people, rightful teaching, and our office and innocent church, that we can no longer remain silent for the sake of honor, office, and reputation. And so, invoking Him who saves the oppressed and innocent (God), and not without the knowledge of our gracious lords and superiors, we have confessed our faith and teaching, proven how unfounded Luther's teaching on the holy sacrament is, and refuted his slanders, insults, and revilings. I humbly send such confession and response to your princely grace with a humble request that your princely grace may graciously receive such a book from your entirely willing, well-disposed servant and, if possible, read it. I also further humbly request, in the name of all of us who serve Christ and the church here in Zurich, for the sake of God and eternal truth, that your princely grace may graciously prevent this our defense along with our other books from being suppressed and forbidden in your princely grace's principality, and that we may not be unjustly insulted and condemned unheard and innocent. Dr. Luther has unjustly insulted us without our deserving and rightful cause and condemned us as heretics, indeed as the worst people who do not rightly believe any articles of faith, etc. It is only fair that our response and innocence should not be denied a hearing. And if your princely grace graciously hears and grants us this our reasonable request, we hope that God our Lord will also graciously hear your princely grace's requests and desires. If we could then also show our gratitude to your princely grace with humble, willing services, we would at all times show ourselves entirely humble and willing.</p>
      <p>May God, our heavenly Father, graciously and faithfully keep your princely grace along with all your dependents in His grace and protection through our Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich in the Confederation, on the 15th day of March in the year 1545. Your princely grace's humble servant H.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg and Teck, Count of Mömpelgard, etc., his most gracious lord.</p>
