      <p>Dearly beloved son. Did I not give you 2 pounds 1 batzen on account of Josua, to whom I owe it for the red cloth, which my brother paid and instructed me to give the money to Josua for the transport, but Josua instructed me to give it to you? I gave it to you in my room, etc., and yesterday I gave it to Josua once more. If I have given it to you now, then write it to me; if Josua gives it back to me, I will give it to him again as I did yesterday.</p>
