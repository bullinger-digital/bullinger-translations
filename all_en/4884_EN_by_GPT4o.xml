      <p>Greetings. It pains me greatly to hear that you, reverend father in Christ, are not well.</p>
      <p>I know that you desire to depart and be with Christ, which is certainly much better by far, but remaining in the flesh is more necessary for us and the afflicted church of Christ. And we are certain that you will remain for our joy and the advancement of faith.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, since everything is disturbed and so deeply troubled, we can rightly call blessed those who die in the Lord. But you, my father, since you are not well, why do you not delegate the task of writing to others? Even the letters from your sons, men who are very dear friends to me, would be most welcome. You could outline the main points to them briefly and orally; they could then elaborate on everything more fully in their writings. Otherwise, I cherish your letters and keep them as treasures; but I did not want you to neglect your health. But with what can I repay you? It is remarkable how silent it is among us; the brothers write nothing from Valtellina or Chiavenna, undoubtedly because they are not yet certain about my return to our people.</p>
      <p>A certain man came to us from Germany, a trustworthy man, who is himself in voluntary exile in Lugano for the confession of the gospel. He claims to have heard from merchants in Nuremberg that King Philip is urging the Pope to visit the council in person (as they say); if he refuses to do so, he himself will not attend the council, although he had intended to be present. Then there are others who report that the Turk has made an incursion into the Kingdom of Naples and has taken away several thousand people, and that the Genoese are in great trepidation; but I cannot confirm this last part; however, Lord Philip says he has heard it in two places. Others write that the Turk is occupied around the Safavid.</p>
      <p>The old magistrate of Capol now comes from Chiavenna, reporting that as he rode out, they spoke of good peace in the Duchy of Milan; as a sign of this, they are allowing much fruit to come to the people of Chiavenna and Valtellina from the Duchy of Milan. But I think King Philip wants to appease the Rhaetians, you know why.</p>
      <p>Thus, I can write nothing certain.</p>
      <p>Both consuls affirm that they hear absolutely nothing from Italy.</p>
      <p>If I have anything, I will not fail to inform you; in the meantime, I eagerly await the outcome of this French assembly called for July 20th; may God grant that we hear what is desired and joyful.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and may God keep you safe for His church so that you may be well for a long time. May all your people also be well.</p>
      <p>Our people are well and wish you and yours well. Chur, July 21st, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, his ever-honored lord and patron.</p>
