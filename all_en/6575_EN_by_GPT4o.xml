      <p>S. P. D. I beg you, dearest father, not to be surprised by my prolonged silence and not to think that I have completely neglected my love for you; but you will find that I will persevere in this love forever.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks for all the benefits you have provided me, and for the good advice you have given me, which will always be bound in my heart, and I ask you, whenever you have need of anything that I or my parents can provide for you and yours, to let us know.</p>
      <p>My dearest father has decided to place me together with my cousin in a college in Paris, so that we may find a good and learned teacher; for I am very eager to devote myself to literature and to persevere in this study, which I have begun, and I do not think that I will lack the good will for studies. Moreover, as you might have learned from other matters, I did not want to omit writing to you about our arrival. We have always been in good health on the journey, by the grace of God, and we also found our parents safe.</p>
      <p>I will end my writing.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to greet in my name Verit채t and Dorothea and all my good friends, whom you know I have here. My dearest father and my dearest mother send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, my dearest father, who may always keep you safe in His protection. Given in Paris, 13th of November, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most observant and obedient son Matth채us Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and erudite man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father, faithful pastor of the church of Z체rich.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
