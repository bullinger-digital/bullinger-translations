      <p>S.I.D. I am finally sending through our Burkhard all your letters to the man of blessed memory, Myconius, which I have with difficulty at last extracted from the heir, most illustrious Bullinger, because he considered them as treasures, whatever had been written by learned men here and there to such a man. In France (as far as I understand from my son, who is diligently studying the humanities in Paris), there is no war or at least it is feigned, yet treacheries are thriving, and it is to be feared that a bean (a plot) may eventually be forged against the Germans. Guillaume Postel, who had until now presented himself as a philosopher and theologian to a large audience in Paris, now yielding to the malevolence of the envious, has secretly fled; a reward of one hundred crowns has been decreed by public edict for anyone who reveals his hiding places. The only reason is that he had more sharply attacked the manners of princes and pontiffs in his daily sermons during this past Lent.</p>
      <p>However, his accusers have charged him with heresy and sedition, fabricating another pretext for themselves. Concerning Austrian, Hungarian, and other matters, you will be informed more accurately by Laz (Lazius), a most learned man. We hear not a word about the Emperor, but various reports about the furious attack of Margrave Albrecht, who is said to have recently captured Bamberg by surrender and fined the bishop a large sum of money. I am eager to know from your letters to me what certain news you have about the preaching of the gospel again in Konstanz. Farewell. Basel, in the year 1553, on the day before the Nones of May, namely on the day when Rome was once captured by the soldiers of the Emperor in the third assault, Albrecht, Duke of Austria, was declared King of Bohemia, and John of Damascus, a distinguished theologian of his time, passed away in Constantinople.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
