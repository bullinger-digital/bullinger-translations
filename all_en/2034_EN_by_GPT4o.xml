      <p>Greetings Heinrich Bullinger. I am still compelled to write because my people have not appeared, and they cannot be delayed any longer. Meanwhile, God is using my efforts here, and I do not say this in vain. The messenger from Clavenna, who had accompanied Celius and whom I hoped would bring letters from my Josias to me, went straight to Clavenna, as he did not know I was staying here, and took the letters with him. I only found this out yesterday. Therefore, I wrote to have them sent to me. I beg you, ensure that the letters pertaining to Gratarolus are sent to him quickly. I think you will not be displeased: I have had your letters to the Senate of Geneva copied and sent to many in Italy; they will certainly edify. I believe you have heard that two cardinal legates, who were sent to the Emperor and the King of the French for peace, have been recalled, and in their place, Cardinal Pole of England has been sent, whom I now think is almost in Flanders. The same has been appointed as legate in England itself, if he considers it necessary to cross over. Many think his nephew will marry the queen.</p>
      <p>Many hope for peace; Italy is entirely at rest from war. The king's fleet has returned to Marseille. Here everyone was criticizing Sartlinus, as if he had defected to the Emperor; but a prudent and pious man recently assured me that he knows he was sent by Henry as a legate to Ferdinand and vice versa. Our legate is well; I am with him daily. Philipp is ill; Comander is now bound by his own harvests as if by chains. I am surprised you have changed your mind about Rhaetian wine, as if you will have good wines there this year, which certainly will not be good even in the Valtellina; but you would have had tolerable ones. When I arrive, I will undoubtedly settle all complaints about me, and you will also hear from me in the meantime. I bid your sons-in-law and all the brothers farewell; commend me to God in your prayers. A friend writes to me from Basel that Servetus does not lack supporters there; this confirms what I recently wrote to you; but keep this to yourself.</p>
      <p>Chur of the Rhaetians, 14 October 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
