    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejects the rumors shared with him by Vadian, according to which Zürich intends to abandon the evangelical faith. If mediation in the mandate dispute does not come to fruition, Zürich is ready to submit to arbitration. The delegation for this has already been determined. The discussion will not be about faith, but only about whether Zürich is authorized to issue mandates even after the Landfrieden. Nothing will be undertaken against the will of the countryside.</p>

      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Joachim von Watt, former mayor of St. Gallen, my gracious lord, etc. Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom writes about the speech that is going around with you, how my lords have issued the mandate, thereby also confirming the papal faith, which has greatly astonished me and all the good-hearted who hear of it, as I have presented the opinion of your writing to some, and not the least, but mentioned it to no one. Indeed, it is so far from being the case that anyone among us is willing to revoke the mandate, that is, to give up our faith, that we would rather (if God wills) expose ourselves to all danger. The arbitrators have also not been instructed more than I last indicated to you and shown in previous days. So far that it cannot be and they, the arbitrators, who have offered to ride around for this, cannot be dissuaded with kindness, so a right will be allowed to prevail. For this, my lord Mayor Röist and Master Chamly have already been chosen, two faithful, honest men as associates, Master Hans Hab as the speaker, Master Conrad Ascher and Master Rudolf Stoll as advisors, and Burkhart Würtz as the scribe. There will also be no arguing about the faith or about the mass, whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, but because of whether we have the authority or right to issue mandates, even according to the miserable peace and the old alliances, while we still reserve our faith and freedoms, etc. In summary: Many honorable, virtuous people's minds are concerned, so I do not understand that anyone would give up our faith, as it is more possible to leave alliances and other things than to leave Jesus Christ and his sacrifice. May God then especially plague and shame us for our sins. Therefore, we are well comforted. One will also accept the countryside, which is very good, without and against it. Otherwise, it is not so bad. There are still many cities and virtuous people also beyond the Rhine who comfort us well. May God always be with us. Understand my writing in the best way.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich, 8th day of March in 1533.</p>
      <p>Your obedient Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The war and the trust in the war will not be able to smooth everything, as those who are considered malicious among us also unanimously say, the five places want to make war with their arrogance, which gives preference to peace, etc.</p>
