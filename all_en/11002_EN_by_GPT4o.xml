    <p xml:id="regest1">Criticizes the sudden recall of [Johannes] Fries, as the teaching position for Greek and Latin at the university, which he took over - not least due to his financial situation partly caused by the people of Zurich - can hardly be newly filled at short notice; Virbius [Melchior Wirz] is not a suitable replacement. [Johannes] Gast is waiting for the return of the [Strasbourg] report [on the agenda of the Schmalkalden meeting]. The messenger sent to Luther has returned; the people of Strasbourg will deliver Luther's response. Capito suggests a meeting to discuss the planned council and urges unity, but this is called into question by the behavior of some [Bernese pastors]. [Hans] Betz writes from Schmalkalden about the determined commitment of the princes and cities to the Gospel; 35 theologians are drafting a document on the papacy for Emperor [Charles V.], whose envoy [Matthias Held] shows different faces. Greetings. Inquires about Theodor [Bibliander] and again complains about some people from Bern.</p>

      <p>S. Regarding Fries, I say he is now being called more importunate because he is bound by the duty of teaching here, not indeed to young children, but to those who have enrolled in our academy. He teaches Greek and Latin to the best of his ability, very much to the satisfaction of his students and no less to the heads of the academy. You partly imposed this duty on him, as he was bound by debts and had no one to pay even a halfpenny for him. Do you think it is so easy now to release him from his obligations? Some time should have been given, so that both our people could have provided for their school and Fries could have better managed his affairs. For I do not understand why he should not favor his homeland, as is proper, and gratefully acknowledge the benefits of his patrons. The only thing that troubles him is that he cannot extricate himself so suddenly. Nor do we see this happening unless you provide assistance. Although nothing has yet been reported to anyone due to the shortness of time, there is no doubt that the heads of the university and the letters will hardly release him before the term. There is no one at hand who can conveniently succeed him. Therefore, it is necessary to call someone from elsewhere, which requires time. You mention Virbius, who, although he is strong in learning and talent, you know his modesty. What do you think would be easier to persuade him of at this age than to lecture publicly? (I hear he has privately explained some books of Euclid to a few.) You were mistaken when you thought Fries was only in charge of Grynaeus's children, and perhaps for this reason you mentioned Virbius. What, then, should be done now for Fries, you will certainly see. I am at a loss for advice unless a time is set in which he can prepare himself without harm to our school. I wanted to inform you of this not so much for Fries as for our youth; for this should also be a concern for us, not the least.</p>
      <p>Gast is waiting for the consultation. These days, the one we sent to Luther has returned. The people of Strasbourg will bring Luther's response. Efforts are being made diligently to ensure that concord continues. Capito wrote to me a few days ago in these words: "I know indeed that some will make an effort for us all to respond with one voice" (he speaks of the council), "for which your agreement will be necessary. Therefore, yours also seem to be called to the common assembly." And finally, he advises: "You make an effort that yours also proceed skillfully to regard the common salvation of Germany," etc. What should I do here, after I see some possess so little of brotherly charity, but much of stubbornness, which I do not see as good? We all claim to uphold the truth, for which we fight; meanwhile, so little of it shines forth that I am almost beginning to distrust words. It is clear to me that unless we stop being insolent, evil will lie at our doors.</p>
      <p>Bezius, a senator from Constance, writes from Schmalkalden that there are so many plots, so many various cunning schemes, such great power, that unless God protects, the Gospel cannot persist. Here, however, the princes and cities act so fearlessly that everyone will see the old Germany both in terms of strength and piety. He adds that there are 35 preachers together and they have been tasked with depicting the papacy from top to bottom. And the emperor will see this picture sometime, who now has an envoy in the said city, both imperious and gentle, sharp and mild, meanwhile also wonderfully arrogant; he plays the role of Vertumnus, but he is recognized.</p>
      <p>My eyes are dim, so I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children. I have seen nothing of Leo.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 6, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I would like to know if Theodor is still alive. Oh, if you knew about some of the Bernese, as we do - I don't know how to say it. These things are for your bosom. We are truly not alone. Be mine.</p>
      <p>To my dearest Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
