      <p>In haste. Welser, the mayor of Augsburg, requested three days ago in a letter to me that I send him your response to Luther's booklet as soon as possible; in the meantime, he diligently reminds me to convey his respectful greetings to you. He writes among other things: "I will soon learn where the 4000 Spaniards, who are not far from Strasbourg, intend to go. There are significant plans from the Pope and his followers; they are using Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, who is recruiting and inciting rebellion. The Turk is certainly coming, and the Pope has allowed the Roman king to move the fleet to the Danube, undoubtedly to better maintain his faith. The Emperor is bedridden in Brussels; he must have at least 8 weeks to recover his health. The imperial commissioners appointed to Worms are: the Roman king, the Cardinal of Augsburg (that is, your bishop, whom he made a cardinal), Granvelle, Count Friedrich of Fürstenberg, and von Naves.</p>
      <p>The Pope has appointed the Cardinal of Trent as his legate to the Imperial Diet."</p>
      <p>Von Homburg has now come up from Worms; he says it is certain that the Emperor is mortally ill. The Landgrave has captured Count of Oldenburg, who was very secretive and helpful to Brunswick in all matters, along with 13 other persons, and brought them to Kassel, through which one will gain experience in all sorts of matters.</p>
      <p>Frecht, in a letter to me, earnestly requests that I commend him to you. He writes that Saxony and the Landgrave are now deliberating and deciding on supporting the Elector of Cologne. I could not add anything further, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. Please convey my most loving greetings to the brothers and friends, especially Theodor and Gwalther. I give great thanks for the sent booklets, and I wish there might be a time when I can reciprocate and do the same!</p>
      <p>The German response seems excessively lengthy and will deter many from reading it. I wish some chapters of it were contracted into a brief summary! It would be more marketable and useful to more people.</p>
      <p>My brother and Zwick send their greetings to you. Farewell, my dearest soul. March 11, 1545.</p>
      <p>I have not yet read your response; when it was brought, a messenger was conveniently present, through whom I sent this to a certain special and excellent friend. I desired the last part of the German response from the 16th of October. I commend this good brother to you. Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my venerable and dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
