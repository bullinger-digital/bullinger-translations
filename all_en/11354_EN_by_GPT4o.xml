    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes to Bullinger only now because he did not want to bother him; their friendship does not require confirmation through letters. When Bullinger gifted him the book "De origine erroris," he responded with a report about the Bernese Church, but it seems this did not arrive; he values Bullinger's book - like everything that comes from him - highly. His silence is also due to his hope of coming to Zurich in person; it burdens him to have to live abroad. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Upon receiving the messenger, most excellent man, I could not refrain from visiting and greeting you with my letters, prompted by your own most delightful and gracious writings to me.</p>
      <p>But I have acted thus far out of perhaps rustic and uncivil modesty, writing to you less frequently than I understand would be pleasing to you; for I feared that I might disturb you, occupied with the most serious matters, with my untimely trifles, and that my importunity might also affect others if I were to hinder and delay you while you were meditating, writing, or teaching. And it is so far from anyone suspecting that anything of my goodwill and love towards you has diminished due to my silence, that it rather testifies more and more to my utmost obligation to you, as it trusts that nothing can intervene among the closest friends that could even slightly estrange and separate minds bound by mutual goodwill, and thus it lives in secure safety, as if it seems not to need these supports, namely the frequent exchange of letters. Let those whose minds are still warm and not burning with love maintain mutual goodwill.</p>
      <p>But because the closest relationship has intervened between you and me, no silence will ever abolish it.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as I gathered from your letters, it seems I have sent no letters to you, which I have not done, however they may have been lost; for I know that I wrote to you immediately after receiving the book "De origine erroris" about the state of our church, and it pains me not a little that the letters were not delivered to you. But wherever the letters may have ended up, I am not ashamed of my writings and fear no danger, as I trust more in truth than in the opinions of men, etc. How could your book not please me greatly, in which nothing is lacking that pertains to the treatment of its subject? Indeed, it is of great value to me and is such that I carry it constantly in my hands, examine, contemplate, venerate, and kiss it. What from my Bullinger would not delight me greatly? Since in these so hidden things lies the erudition of words, sentences, and matters, that, however you approach it equipped with any discipline, it represents the leader in that, so that it is worthy to be embraced, venerated, admired, and respected. O immense gift of God, when to such erudition is added the ease and readiness of teaching, as is seen in my Bullinger. But this is truly to live for God and the fatherland, not for oneself, and not to bury the entrusted talent in the ground.</p>
      <p>But to return again to my silence, a not insignificant reason for it was that I always hoped to find an opportunity to travel to you and to make up for the rarity of letters with my presence and conversation in person, which I trust will happen shortly, etc. O my bitter fate, that I am not allowed to stay in my homeland! No one can easily explain how the customs of others are distasteful and how the spirit and mind long for the homeland. But let the will of the Lord be done. Meanwhile, take care that your Eberhard does not slip from your mind, and always keep me recommended. I do not know where the pen has slipped. The messenger is ready to depart, so there is no leisure to review the writings; therefore, take it in good part and, if you wish anything from me, write.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Leo, Megander, Theodor, Binder, Rellican, Frisius, and also Steiner. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given hastily, in Bern, October 2, 1539. Your Eberhard von RÃ¼mlang.</p>
      <p>To the most adorned with all virtues, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most integral brother in Christ and always to be respected friend.</p>
