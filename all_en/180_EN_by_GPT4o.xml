      <p>My willing service, along with all that I can offer in love and goodness, to you, honorable, gracious, dear sir. When I returned home last night, I received your letter concerning Dominus Laurentius Agricola, who complains about some defamatory remarks from the mass priest, which truly pains me. I have also reprimanded the mass priest (who is my housemate and my wife's closest blood relative) for this. He is the son of D. Glareanus' sister, also from an honorable, well-regarded family, and otherwise an upright, respectable man, although he sometimes becomes impulsive when provoked. However, neither his reputation nor his family connections can protect him from my lords in unjust matters, as justice belongs to the stranger as much as to the local. I have never felt otherwise than that I do not fight against anyone's religion, but rather love all learned people, sharing my humble kitchen indiscriminately with preachers or mass priests. I would gladly see us less contentious with each other and, with dangerous attacks, each trying to diminish the other's religion to the utmost, as this leads to the greatest resentment and impatience, and nothing can be more unbearable, causing disturbance and incitement, and setting minds against each other; for contempt breeds bitterness. Unfortunately, we see so much indecent frivolity and vice among us everywhere, that (in my simple understanding) it is much more necessary to eradicate these through earnest efforts than to daily defend the opinions and disputes of religion on both sides. How much better could we accomplish if love and pious, decent conduct were established; the common people are naturally inclined to unrighteousness; if they are then disturbed, they become even more unrighteous. They always prefer to hear others being scolded than to punish themselves for their vices.</p>
      <p>When a preacher scolds the papacy, they raise their ears; it is well done that the religion of the opposite side is despised. Conversely, when a mass priest scolds the other religion and gives Luther and others to the devil, he has preached well to the unrighteous rebellious mob. Through this, love on both sides is completely disrupted, and surely the minds grow further apart from each other; meanwhile, the vices and frivolity on both sides increase. In this, we could well follow each other on both sides; but in religion, we cannot reconcile; for we lack love and unity for the good. Thus, God grants us less of His grace and knowledge of the truth.</p>
      <p>This simple writing of mine is unnecessary for you, my gracious lord, at this time; for you, endowed with understanding and wisdom, can assess this and many other more important matters, I ask you to forgive my ignorance. Since I have always recognized you as a peaceful, peace-loving man who gladly promotes and guides the unity and welfare of the Confederation as the fatherland (which I have also often praised to my lords and good patrons on the opposite side), I have all the more simply expressed this opinion as the foremost remedy and help, through which discord might be removed and love restored to its course. This has also been prompted by the current dispute between Herr Laurentius and Herr Heinrich, our mass priest, which (as I understand) arose from some offensive words. For Herr Heinrich perceived that Herr Laurentius, in a sermon, somewhat disparaged the old-believing religion and, among other things, spoke much about shorn boys, which, when reported to Herr Heinrich, moved him to such displeasure that he intended to take legal action against Herr Laurentius. When this became known to some notable honorable people in Schwanden, they asked my brother-in-law, Amman Bussin, and me to amicably dissuade Herr Heinrich from legal action; they would then speak with Herr Laurentius and ensure that he would henceforth maintain peace and quiet and not use such words further. This has now been done and amicably settled. After some time, my brother Melchior, also Fridli Murer, and other countrymen of ours were in Wyl in Thurgau at the May fair, and when they returned home, they reported incidentally: As they were in a tavern, where Herr Heinrich was also present, a conversation about Herr Laurentius arose at the table in Wyl, etc. They also named the persons who spread this conversation in Wyl. Then Herr Heinrich said to some people from Schwanden that if what was said about your preacher in Wyl were true, he could well leave me and others unrebuked and unblemished; for this and that, etc., was said about him there, and he also named the persons in Wyl who said it. Further, Herr Heinrich is not aware that he ever spoke, and therefore shows his statement in Wyl; I also cannot find from those who were present that Herr Heinrich said anything further than just about what was said in Wyl.</p>
      <p>If now in Wyl something was exaggerated and attributed to Herr Laurentius (as is quite possible), I cannot know; for if Herr Heinrich had not spoken further, he would have rightly gone against Herr Laurentius. With this, you understand the whole matter, how it transpired; for truly, if I could prove to Herr Laurentius that it served him well and good, I would be inclined.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you always with prayers, wishing to greet my dear brother M. Johann Friesen. With this, may God always be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on Tuesday after the feast of Peter and Paul in the year 1548. Your always willing Gilg Tschudi of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned, well-regarded Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in ZÃ¼rich, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Gilg Tschudi of Glarus.</p>
