      <p>S. Again, I thank you for the gift sent, than which you could have sent nothing more pleasing.</p>
      <p>I tasted the first sermon, and it was pleasing, from which I saw what is to be hoped for from the rest. The printer erred quite negligently in the first quire, which you have long since seen, of course; it is uncorrectable unless it is printed anew. I wish that the Lord may keep you for a long time, so that you may benefit the world for a long time; as for me, I will also pray to the Lord to always protect you. I will take care that your letters are delivered to Strasbourg as soon as possible. The messengers, that is, the miserable and exiled, when they frequently come here from there, are rarer who go from here to there. The people of Strasbourg act more disgracefully than any have ever acted before, whether Swabians or others; for what they did, they did under compulsion, as you know; these men, what they do, they do willingly, most impious men. Two noblemen of the Emperor came to Strasbourg, who wanted to go to meet Philip, the son of Charles. Phalerandus, as he is bold, remonstrated with them on account of the gospel. Here the other said: "What do you have against the Emperor?" he said: "Your people of Strasbourg, by running after this one, barely extorted what he did." What I say, he beautifully approves; therefore, I hate them from the heart because of their most impious impiety. It is added that they acted similarly with Pilate: they obtained from the Emperor in the last embassy that the bishop should establish the Interim according to his own will, if they can in this way obtain some excuse both from their own and from others. And the first is Bucer, whom they sent away, stripped of the office of teaching, the second is Paulus; they retain others for I know not what outcome.</p>
      <p>They still linger there; but I do not know for how long, uncertain as never before, where they want to go. Oh, misery.</p>
      <p>The matrimonial business of Melchior, whom you recommended to me, has been peacefully settled; the parties rest without any action by the men. I had promised him my help if the matter had been brought to a judge. He now returns completely at peace.</p>
      <p>The Confederates ought to see the Lord's Prayer and know the place of the author, so that they may understand what the spirits of the adversaries are. Whoever composed the rhymes is inept, and, as I hope, a vain soothsayer. Yesterday, a brother came to me together with his wife, expelled because of the Interim by the Palatine; he said that he had heard no pious person throughout the whole journey who does not hope that the Emperor will be removed by the Swiss; for this reason, all the pious who are outside favor the Swiss.</p>
      <p>A noble man, exiled because of the Emperor, wrote here that Lübeck sent letters to accept the Interim, indeed to establish it; the people of Lübeck burned the letters in the marketplace on a constructed pyre, then entrusted the messenger to tell the Emperor their obedience in all things except religion; henceforth, if he sends similar letters, they will not only burn these but also the messenger.</p>
      <p>Many things are reported about the Duke of Brunswick; but, because they are equal to trifles, I pass over them in silence. I cannot forget the English robbery, whose author was the brother of the royal protector and mother. The king has a sister, whom the admiral wanted to marry after the brother was killed and thus seize the kingdom. Stupendous plans, such as are also in the Emperor and in Ferdinand. God, I hope, will not bear such severe insolence for much longer.</p>
      <p>I would also like it to be known, whether it is true or not: that the Emperor, to hinder friendship between us and the French, sent an embassy to them and offered perpetual peace, and that now the Cardinal de Guise is acting with the Emperor.</p>
      <p>I spoke to Richerius; he firmly denies it; for friends from France wrote quite differently and it is certain that in the major cities of France armies are being enlisted, certainly not for the Emperor. Farewell in the Lord with all good things.</p>
      <p>In Basel, hastily, March 12, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Richerius greets you from the heart, the interrupter of these.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, a most excellent man, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
