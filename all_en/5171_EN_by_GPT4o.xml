      <p>Reverend father, greetings. Some say that the cause of this upcoming colloquy between the princes of Württemberg, Zweibrücken, and Guise is as follows: Guise pretends that they will accept the Augsburg Confession and ensure that others also accept it, but in return, they seek favor from the German princes with the French, so that the Guises may have all their revenues and incomes from France; for they are being withheld by the king or hindered while the matter of Namur is being considered.</p>
      <p>But another, who knows better what is in the pot, says that Guise is contemplating something against the French, only wishing that the princes of the Augsburg Confession do not impede them, and to achieve this, they pretend to want to embrace the Augsburg Confession and to fight for it, ensuring that France accepts it. I did not want to hide this from you.</p>
      <p>I believe the latter more, because the one from whom I received it is not a frivolous man and knows much. But whatever it may be, I will write to you soon.</p>
      <p>The senate has not yet given a verdict for our cause nor against the cause. Yesterday Marbach was at the meeting. It was proposed whether it seems advisable that organs be played while the supper is celebrated; for the same is already being done in Basel, although two twisted heads (I do not know the German term), one of which is now dead (a reference was made to our Junius), resisted fiercely, now consider the rest from them; but what I write is very true -, and all look at good Conrad with inverted eyes and do not wish to acknowledge him as a brother. Sturm and the professors are most steadfastly for the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p>These things hastily, and consider my foolish letters kindly; I preferred to be foolish rather than say nothing. Farewell and give greetings to our reverend father Dr. Peter Martyr and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, February 13.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow the Württemberger is expected here.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, as much as he is, Girolamo Zanchi.</p>
      <p>[Behind 836:] To the reverend and most esteemed father Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
