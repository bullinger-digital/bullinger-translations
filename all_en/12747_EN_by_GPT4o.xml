    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There is only to report that the [Schmalkaldic] troops are withdrawing and trying to harm the enemies in the process. Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, pursued by the Imperial forces, is moving towards Würzburg and Bamberg. A battle is likely to occur. Nördlingen has surrendered to Emperor [Charles V.] without being forced to do so. This will have dire consequences!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is said that a meeting will take place in Baden. In view of the current danger, everyone should take the matter to heart. The people of Zurich should make the other Confederates aware of the dire consequences of this war and convince them to send a joint letter to the Emperor, urging him to cease the war, as they would otherwise have to take measures to protect their interests. Such a letter would give the enemy pause and benefit the common cause.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] For several days, there have been rumors that the Emperor has died. People are even betting on it. If true, it would be a miracle of God, like the downfall of Pharaoh once was! But there could be a ruse behind it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Hopefully, Frölich's reply [No. 2689] to Bullinger's letter [not received] has arrived!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Hans Wilpert Zoller has returned to Augsburg in good health. [Johannes] Haller is likely writing himself [through the servant of Johannes Wyss].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In haste. Greetings, also to the authorities and friends.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I have nothing special to write to you, except that our troops are withdrawing. However, they intend to intercept the enemy on the way (to harm them). The Elector is moving in good order towards Würzburg and Bamberg. The Imperial forces are following him. I believe there will be a battle. The city of Nördlingen has surrendered to the Emperor without any necessity. This will have dire consequences for us here.</p>

      <p>I hear that a meeting is to be held in Baden. Since the situation is indeed uncertain and dangerous, it would be good for everyone to participate. If your lords of Zurich, as if for themselves and with sincere intention, had informed the Confederates of the burdensome consequences that might result from this war for the German nation and themselves, and if they had written to the Emperor together to demand the cessation of such destruction, with the added words that (if) it does not happen, the Confederates would also have to prevent the disadvantage that awaits them, etc., this would give the enemy much to think about and benefit the cause.</p>

      <p>For several days, it has been said and indeed written here that the Emperor is dead; and much is wagered on it, yet other reports also come. If it turns out to be true, it is a miracle of God and no less than the downfall of Pharaoh to be written in the chronicles, because of how extraordinary it is supposed to have happened, which I now refrain from mentioning. But there may also be a trick behind it. Therefore, I do not rely on it.</p>

      <p>I have replied to your letter. I hope all letters have reached you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Hans Hilpert Zoller is back here fresh and healthy. I suppose Dominus Hallerus is writing to you himself with this.</p>

      <p>Now in haste, nothing more, but commended to Almighty God. Greet all dear lords and friends for me. December 4, 1546. G. Frölich, called Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed (Antistes) of the church of Zurich, my beloved lord and brother, etc. Zurich.</p>
