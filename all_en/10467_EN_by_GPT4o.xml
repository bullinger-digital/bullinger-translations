      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a copy, which I have faithfully extracted from a letter written by the hand of Blaurer, which he recently sent to Benedikt Burgauer. From this, you can clearly and most certainly understand his opinion on the Lord's Supper, which he confessed before the prince. Furthermore, you can also discern what is appropriate for you and others, namely to support the truth that is in danger.</p>
      <p>Farewell and please let me know your thoughts on this matter, I pray.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, September 2, 1534.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, proclaimer of Christ's gospel, a brother to be respected.</p>
