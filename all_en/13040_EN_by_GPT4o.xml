    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] [Franziskus] Studer will have likely transmitted the documents [about Prague]. As soon as Bullinger has read them and copied parts of them, he should return them. This should be done as quickly as possible. If Bullinger does not have a messenger available, he should dispatch one of his own. The person [...] who lent these documents to Vadian is already demanding them back. Bullinger should therefore ensure that Vadian can continue to enjoy the trust of others in matters that are important to both him and Bullinger.</p>

      <p>S. Our Studer, I believe, has delivered to your Humanity what I gave; once you have read it or arranged for parts to be copied, I earnestly request that you return it at the earliest possible time and as quickly as you can. If there is no messenger at hand, ensure that you send one of your own to expedite the matter to me; for the person who entrusted everything to me in good faith does not cease to demand his things back from me. Therefore, ensure that you uphold my trust, so that I may also in the future enjoy the trust of others in matters concerning us.</p>
