      <p>My friendly greetings along with wishes from the Almighty for a blessed New Year be with you, venerable, highly learned, dear sir and friend. As my noble, dear son Johann Philipp previously informed you of his intentions, I have now, in God's name, who may direct everything to His honor and good welfare, sent him off to France in a fatherly manner. However, alongside my lord's writings, your commendations to Lord Bellieure, Beza, or others might also be particularly beneficial and good, and as I have always found you to be my dear lord and friend, my friendly request to you is to assist my aforementioned son in writing to those places and as much as you deem necessary. I desire to acknowledge this towards you again in all friendship and goodwill.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, we have nothing here. The Papists are still boasting greatly about their victory over the Turks, and every corner is full of letters and prints about it, but I fear the matters were not as well as one might think. It is said that the imperial majesty was very weak for a while, but is now recovering; I suspect he might unexpectedly pass away, as I understand the person is weak and frail enough. For the rest, you will be informed by Hans Lyner, who is my son's escort up to Lyon.</p>
      <p>With this, may God keep you under His protection; may He preserve you for His honor and the good of the church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given at Forstegg on the last day of December in the year 1571. Ulrich Philipp Freiherr von Hohensax, Lord of Sax and Forstegg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned lord, my especially trusted, dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
