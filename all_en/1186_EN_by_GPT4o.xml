      <p>With what great joy your letter, most excellent Mr. Bullinger, has filled me, I believe you can sufficiently judge from this alone: that I longed so much for your autograph and awaited it with much more ardor. Now indeed, after everything has turned out even more happily than I had hoped, what, I ask, could have happened to me from all of you that would be more pleasant and gratifying in this sad and calamitous time? You undoubtedly know what horrendous tumults have arisen in these regions and in what great dangers the miserable little house of Sarepta is involved, so that these times seem almost such that they are not only about to oppress the church in these places, which has been wonderfully sustained by God up to now despite so many tyrants and impious persecutors raging against it, but they also threaten the ruin and most terrible devastation of all of Germany or certainly a very large part of it.</p>
      <p>We sustain ourselves somehow, we seek and expect divine help knowing that, even if we are driven from this nest, the church will remain elsewhere, which is no longer bound to one certain place as in the Israelite people, but it must mostly wander in exile in this life, especially for those reasons, as it is very likely, that God wants to remind us of the first exile, when the first parents were expelled from paradise, so that we may consider the true causes of that matter and amend our life as much as we can in this weakness. Then also he wants us to think about the exile of his son, whom he sent into our flesh, so that he himself might offer himself as a victim for us to the eternal father and, having freed us from perpetual damnation with his precious blood, might adorn us with eternal goods and joy and eternal happiness and restore us to integrity.</p>
      <p>When these things are considered, they bring immense consolation to pious minds in the greatest calamities. Empires may fall, the whole world may collapse, yet it is certain that God will preserve some remnants until his coming. However, how and where he will preserve them is not for us to inquire. In the meantime, let us do what is necessary, bear these great hardships patiently, endure the wrath of the Lord, and not despair of divine help nor rage against him, because we have sinned against him, and let us pray and give thanks with the prophet, who says: "It is good, O Lord, that you have humbled me, that I might learn your statutes." I write these things, most illustrious man, so that you may somehow know the miserable state of these places, which, although I do not doubt you have long since understood from the reports of others, I wanted to share my own grief with you, which your letters have greatly alleviated, especially for this reason, that, just as I do not doubt you are deeply affected and afflicted by the dangers of the church, so on the other hand I certainly assume that you join your prayer with the whole church, wherever it wanders dispersed, and invoke the eternal father of our Lord Jesus Christ with your pious prayers for the salvation of the miserable and afflicted church.</p>
      <p>Having now recited the causes of my complaints, I hope that I will more easily obtain pardon from you for this importunity and audacity or rather impudence of mine, as you are occupied with much more serious matters.</p>
      <p>I am sending here a little preface of Osiander, prefixed to his two disputations, and I have written more about this man to Mr. Bibliander, who will undoubtedly share it with you. Therefore, I earnestly ask you to briefly express your judgment and opinion on this article. He is now completely raging, having found a greater opportunity than he had in Nuremberg; he is indeed giving birth to a new religion full of monstrous opinions, as is evident from a certain little book recently published about the image of God, etc. God willing, as soon as the opportunity arises, I will write to you more extensively about this matter.</p>
      <p>What news there is here, you can gather from the letters. Magdeburg is still besieged by Maurice. The miserable people, although I hear they have sufficiently provided for themselves with provisions and other things necessary for their miserable state, will hardly be able to sustain such a burden and such a difficult siege for long unless God assists them with his singular help. Even with this crown lost (as you call it in Socinus's letters), I fear that the Saxon strength, otherwise very celebrated, will collapse together. May God avert these great evils and kindly grant his church safe and peaceful refuges for the sake of his son, our mediator. Amen.</p>
      <p>What remains, most excellent man, I pray that you consider all these things favorably and interpret them, whatever they are, in the best part. What I have written, I testify before God, I have written with a good and sincere mind, and because from your letters to Lelio Socinus, with whom I converse very familiarly here, I have understood that a plague is raging among you and other public evils, wars, and the like are impending, I earnestly ask you to share all those things with me and inform me about the state of your country. I, whenever the opportunity presents itself, will not allow anyone to come to you without my letters. How grateful it will be if you respond, you can easily understand from these letters. Farewell, most illustrious man, with your whole family, and love me as you do. Wittenberg, on the day of Matthias, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erhard von Kunheim.</p>
      <p>Again, I ask, most excellent Mr. Bullinger, that you respond to me and also be an encourager and instigator to Mr. Pellican and Mr. Bibliander, so that they write together, than which you can do nothing more pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, excellent in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, his lord and perpetual friend to be respected.</p>
      <p>"Erhard von Kunheim, Prussian."</p>
