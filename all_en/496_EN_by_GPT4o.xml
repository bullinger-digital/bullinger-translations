      <p>Greetings. If you are well, that is good; I am well, most excellent and learned man. I should have declared my dedication and gratitude towards you sooner than I have done until now; for even though you have shown yourself to be exceedingly courteous in our conversations, which I greatly value, I am even more certain and assured in my mind that you are benevolently and Christianly disposed towards me. This is evident from the fact that, in recent days, when I was in Z端rich with my prince, you honored me with a literary gift, which seems to propose to me much knowledge of piety and true religion and to urge its study, for a small service. For this, I give you the greatest thanks, and all the more so because the matter itself, about which you write in your book, is so illustrious. However, do not attribute my failure to fulfill my duty in the meantime to ingratitude or forgetfulness; for I do not consider myself so ungrateful and forgetful as not to embrace the benevolence of men outstanding in both piety and learning and to display some ingratitude. Rather, attribute all blame to the principal affairs, which almost solely fall upon me. And since my prince writes to you, I did not want to omit sending you these few words, so that you might have some indication of my feelings towards you. I have read the first discourse of your book, which pleases me greatly both because of its order and clarity, and because I understand that nothing is written by you that is not in agreement with Holy Scripture. For this reason, I judge that the following books are written in the same manner.</p>
      <p>I reported this to my prince, who, so that he might also know what it was, instructed me to translate it into our language if I had the leisure and was free from business. I could not refuse this to my prince, both out of duty and because I am delighted by the reading of your book. I translated the first two discourses after returning from Z端rich. However, you need not fear any danger or prejudice from this labor of mine; I undertook this work solely in the name of my prince and to have something in which to exercise my mind. You only continue in this most pious duty; for it seems to me that you wish to clearly and truly explain all matters of true religion with these discourses, in which may the Lord abundantly grant you the spirit of truth.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider me among your number, if I am worthy in any way. Give my regards to D. Gualther and M. Butler. May the Lord preserve you and your fellow laborers of His harvest, and your church, the vineyard and harvest, in His word.</p>
      <p>Basel, 24th April, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Michael Maler, doctor, chancellor.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Z端rich church, his lord and friend, etc. Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Michael Maler, doctor.</p>
