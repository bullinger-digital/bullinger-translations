    <p xml:id="regest1">Read Bullinger's letter of recommendation for his [i.e., M端ller's] cousin Georg M端ller with joy and gladly accepts the offered friendship. He would like to hear Bullinger's opinion on some controversial questions: On one hand, he is concerned with the dispute over the [contested by Schwenckfeld] creatureliness of Christ and the relationship between His divine and human nature. On the other hand, he doubts whether it is right, for the sake of unity, to tolerate Catholicizing [Lutheran] communion rites, as the people of Strasbourg do. He has heard from his cousin about the Zurich church and marriage court order and requests its dispatch as well as a list of the writings of Bullinger, Oecolampadius, and Zwingli. Greetings and a request for recommendation to the Zurich council.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received and read your letter, most illustrious man, which you sent to me for the purpose of recommending my cousin Georg M端ller, with the greatest joy and pleasure, and I cannot express in words how much sweetness the reading of it brought me. First, because it came from a most learned man, whose name has already become immortal through his works in the Christian realm, who, as the poet says, strikes the stars with his lofty head, and who has come to me for the sake of seeking and beginning a common friendship. I sincerely promise that this letter will be the beginning of a bond of friendship and the highest intimacy between us. Secondly, because you so diligently commend to me my cousin and kinsman, whom I regard as a brother and love no less, with your appended words, you have done something most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>For even if I had not known him for his virtue, integrity, and piety, for which you have celebrated him to me, yet by this your most serious and sincere recommendation, he would have been most acceptable to me. I, in turn, ask you greatly to hold him in high esteem for his integrity and faith in Christ, along with his wife, children, and all his friends and relatives.</p>
      <p>Now, since you offer yourself benevolently to my duties, I ask you not to take it harshly if I inquire of you about certain matters of which I am doubtful and cannot establish anything certain in my mind, and if I seek your opinion and counsel more boldly. And first, indeed, it is not doubtful to me that you are aware of how some, as if with a gladiatorial spirit, quarrel among themselves about Christ, whether He is a creature or not, and how divinity in Him has united with humanity. This contention, as it is no small matter of our religion, has me quite concerned and perturbs my mind, desiring your judgment and opinion on this controversy.</p>
      <p>Then, there are different rites of the Eucharist at this time, some of which seem to me to be in agreement with the word of the Lord, while others do not yield at all from the papistic opinion even by a hair's breadth. Because our people openly insist that the bread is formed into the body and the wine into the blood of Christ, while others, such as the people of Strasbourg, although they do not feel this, nevertheless, under the pretext of a certain concord, do not want to be accused of dissent with our people. How the word of the Lord can bear this pretext is for you to judge, and I expect your prudent, pious, and exact judgment on this matter.</p>
      <p>My cousin also reported to me about the ecclesiastical polity instituted and ordered by the Zurich senate with great prudence, and the most pious and wise statutes of the matrimonial court written and published in order. If it is possible, I would very much like you to send me a copy of these along with a catalog of all the books published by you, Oecolampadius, and Huldrych Zwingli in Latin and the vernacular German, with the first available messenger, by which you will gain the greatest favor with me.</p>
      <p>I also commend myself to you, whom I have already written in the book of my friends and brothers and will never erase.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily together with your wife and sweetest children and the entire Zurich senate, to whom I also wish to be commended through you, as far as you are able, along with my cousin.</p>
      <p>Stuttgart, May 10, 1541.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus M端ller, known as Maier.</p>
      <p>To the man of utmost piety and integrity, Heinrich Bullinger, most learned minister of the Zurich church, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
