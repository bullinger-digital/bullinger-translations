      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Although I wish, most learned Bullinger, to write more to you, I certainly cannot due to the inflammation of my left foot, which happened to me last week from erysipelas, etc. In this republic of Rappoltsweiler, there is hope that, with the papacy renounced, the voice of Christ will sound publicly, since Egenolf consulted the Elector Palatine and his father-in-law from Erbach in Heidelberg about the change. The one from Erbach and the nobles of the Palatinate are going to come here.</p>
      <p>May everything succeed, so that the glory of God is spread and the salvation of souls, etc.! Remind Vogler to stand by his promises; he is expected.</p>
      <p>If he comes, he will be able to greatly benefit both the church and the republic. The Ubiquitarians and the quadruplers of the Richenvillers tyrannically impose their will; many citizens, having resigned from the municipality, leave the city. But God will also put an end to this.</p>
      <p>Jakob Müller spent a few days in Richenweiler because of the grains that were owed to him; the stewards paid. After his departure, they spread a very bad rumor about him, that the main reason for his visit was that he asked to be received back into favor with a codicil and wanted to be received with a change.</p>
      <p>This I do not believe, nor can I, to have faith in these trifles; he had agreed with me otherwise, having testified before he left, that he would not accept even one. I would have written; but I was not free due to illness.</p>
      <p>You will advise him from my writing to refute this slander. About the treaty that the prince from Condé made with the French nobles, you will understand from the letters of the baron; I asked him to send it to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother and lord, in the Son of God and pray to the Lord for me. Greet the brothers first and foremost. May 9, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthias Erb.</p>
