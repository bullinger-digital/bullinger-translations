    <p xml:id="regest1">Will thoroughly review the material delivered to him by Balthasar and David. Had to preach on peace and war at the urging of the persecuted Solothurn Reformers. Spoke about the proper conduct of the authorities. The question also arose whether it would be right to support the oppressed fellow believers with military force. Bad news is heard from Paris. Since the Pope's rapprochement with France through the marriage of Catherine to Henry, Noël Béda and other "Sorbonnists" have returned to Paris. The books of Erasmus and Melanchthon have been banned, and persecutions have begun. Meanwhile, Landgrave Philip of Hesse has met with the French King Francis I in Bar-le-Duc in Lorraine. Some speak of a large offer of troops and money from the king. Others talk of a marriage between the young Duke Christoph of Württemberg and the daughter of the Duke of Lorraine, Anna. The mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl believes in a French deception at the expense of the Landgrave. By Easter, eight new councilors will probably have to be elected in Bern. Fears that Wolfgang von Wingarten will have to be deposed for adultery. Hopes for good elections. Simon Sulzer will have been with Bullinger and reported to him. Blessings. He will let him hear from him in due time regarding Lenzburg. Basel has adopted a confession of faith. Asks Bullinger whether Bern should follow the example.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have received, dearest lord and brother, a whole heap from Balthasar and David, which greatly rejoices me and touches my heart, for I always feel a true and faithful brother in you, who takes my ignorance and concerns so much to heart that I could not expect more. I will, with good leisure, review all things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the five positions, which are a summary of all things, I am well satisfied; for as I wrote to you about it, it happened in the meantime, due to the urging and guidance of the suffering Solothurners, that I had to and must preach about peace and war. I did not take up the matter from a well-founded basis of testament and church, but from the magistrate, established in the old church, confirmed by Christ and the apostles, and the laws in the leader of peace and war, and concluded the same as you; therefore, your spirit is a powerful testimony to my small authority. And only one thing is lacking, since the Solothurners are our brothers in faith and are oppressed by their magistrate because of the gospel and are compelled in many ways, whether it is fitting for our magistrate to extend his life against the godless Solothurners, to help the oppressed. Treaties indeed cannot do this nor can that city. But what is permissible according to the word of God, you will signify in one word.</p>
      <p>Dear, forgive my overly long writing. I cannot do otherwise. I expect, as all peasants do, that my distress should concern everyone, as it does myself.</p>
      <p>From Paris, I have heard that things are going terribly badly. Since the Pope's friendship, the exiled Sorbonnists like Noël Béda and others have been readmitted to Paris. All books of Erasmus and Melanchthon, even grammar, are forbidden. A gruesome persecution has begun. In the meantime, the Prince of Hesse himself was with the King of France in Lorraine. What was negotiated there is unknown. Some say he appointed Hesse as a captain over 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen and gives him 40,000 crowns annually. Others say he made a marriage alliance with the young Duke of Württemberg and the daughter of the Duke of Lorraine. In summary: The consul of the Gallic deception, most learned, is persuaded of this, that the Cat is to be seduced and deceived. Therefore, he must beware, lest he trust anything to the Gaul. So much do I hear about these things.</p>
      <p>Things are going badly with our magistrate. I believe, by Easter, 8 new senators will have to be appointed. I fear that Wingarter will be removed for fornication. Pray all, that the Lord may guide the hearts of the elect with His spirit.</p>
      <p>I suppose Simon Sulzer has now been with you, and has also informed you of as much as he knew. I will send you all things in detail and very soon. Be safe, all preachers and readers.</p>
      <p>Regarding Lenzburg, I will let you know in due time.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel have proposed a confession of faith to their own. Some think we should do the same. I would like to hear from you about this. As soon as I have news, I will write again.</p>
      <p>Farewell. In great haste.</p>
      <p>21st of March, year 34.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
