      <p>S. D. I would have gladly written to you, most learned Bullinger, from the Frankfurt market; however, shortly before the market, I was in Strasbourg for the sake of a school position, which I nevertheless rejected, frightened by the magnitude of the tasks, which I now regret having done. Upon returning home, I could find no one who was going to Frankfurt; for everyone had left two days earlier. Now, since I am forced to send a courier to Basel, I have also sent this letter through him to Oporinus, so that it might reach you from there. That you, along with your fellow ministers, sympathize with my situation and promise all your efforts was very pleasing to me and brought me great joy. I recognized your spirit as not only dedicated to sincere and pious studies but also endowed with fraternal charity, and I give you great thanks. Our prince does not allow himself to believe that I share the same views as Brenz and other ministers on the Lord's Supper; I am accused because of a satire, the beginning of which is: "You speak absurdities," in which I clearly disagree with Brenz, nor am I one to oppose the truth. Therefore, having left Stuttgart, I have moved to a small town three miles from Stuttgart named Backnang, where I live on my own resources (as they say), awaiting divine assistance. I have a large load of books, and there are also other domestic impediments that do not allow me to go further at present, unless I had a certain sale somewhere. I have not been able to seek such a thing in the Palatinate so far because of an ulcer that developed on my right foot. However, once it is healed, I will see if a place opens up for me somewhere.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if you see anything certain, please deign to inform me.</p>
      <p>The same ulcer also prevented me from traveling there, as you invite; it indeed attacked me at a most inconvenient time and stubbornly resists health and medicines. May the Lord grant better things, I pray, so that I may be able to look after myself and my family. Farewell, dearest brother, and remember me.</p>
      <p>Given in Backnang, June 4, 1560.</p>
      <p>Greet your fellow ministers in my name.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Naogeorgus.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
