    <p xml:id="regest1">After Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse warned the cities of Ulm, Augsburg, and Memmingen against the recruitments by Christoph von Landenberg, 400 men were called to arms in Memmingen and field artillery was set up. At the Imperial Diet in Nuremberg, King Ferdinand with two sons and Count Palatine Friedrich have arrived; the Memmingen envoy [Christoph Zwicker] has not yet written; it is said that Emperor [Charles V] will come to Germany or Italy with Spanish troops; Duke [Ludwig X] of Bavaria, the captain of the [Nuremberg] counter-alliance, is up to something; from the Netherlands, there are reports about the armaments of Duke [Wilhelm V] of Jülich; for the summer, an advance of the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is expected; the Papists boast that the arsonist [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel] will enforce his restitution. The Protestants have recused the Chamber Court; it has summoned the [Schmalkaldic] cities under threat of outlawry at the request of the Duke of Brunswick; dangerous disunity prevails in the Empire; Balthasar Funk has confidentially informed Schuler that significant cities sympathize with the Confederates; Bullinger should work towards them possibly joining forces if necessary. Martin Frecht writes that the Confederates have made a decision in Baden regarding the Chamber Court; it would be beneficial if they came to the same position as the cities. Ambrosius [Blarer] will have sent Bullinger the Schwenckfeldian song [„Ein schön new lied von der gotheyt vnd herrligkeyt unsers herren Jesu Christi“]. Request for the promotion of neighborly unity; greetings. Hopes to receive at least a greeting. Recommends the letter carrier traveling to Bern and would wish him a parish position in the Zurich area.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Within eight days, dear brother, the Landgrave of Hesse has seriously warned the upper cities Ulm, Augsburg, and Memmingen with his own envoy, that we should be on guard so that we are not caught unawares; for his princely grace is well aware that Christoph von Landenberg, who recently attacked those from Rottweil, is recruiting a large number of mercenaries; he suspects it is instigated by Heinrich of Brunswick. We should therefore gather good intelligence so that we overlook nothing; for his princely grace will not hesitate. In response, my lords of Memmingen have, on the last Sunday Invocavit, called up 400 men from among the citizens, instructing them to be armed and armored and to await further orders at any moment. They have also arranged the field artillery here and there in the city through their war council, as much as is still available, for urgency.</p>
      <p>At the Imperial Diet in Nuremberg, it appears as if nothing at all will be accomplished; there is no prince there except Ferdinand, the king, with two sons, and Duke Friedrich, the Count Palatine. Our envoy from Memmingen has not yet written that anything has either begun or been accomplished. We have reliable information that the imperial majesty is to come out in person with several thousand Spaniards into Germany or Italy. The Duke of Bavaria is also brewing some misfortune, being the captain of the counter-alliance. I have recently received letters from the Netherlands that the Duke of Jülich is in remarkable military readiness. We expect the Turks to come with great force next summer. Our Papists, however, boast vehemently, thinking the arsonist will come to their aid, and we must resist him.</p>
      <p>The Protestants have recused the Chamber Court in matters of religion and secular affairs. The Duke of Brunswick has proceeded against us at the Chamber Court and obtained a peremptory citation against the outlawry, which they have publicly posted in our and other cities, stating that we expect the outlawry by the 22nd of this month and that they intend to execute it against us. Unfortunately, everything in the empire is divided and disunited; I fear the structure, as they say, will collapse, and therefore we must bite each other's tails; but we have well deserved such distress. I fear the matter is so arranged that it must eventually break, and, dear brother, that is the worst, that we bear the discord in our bosom and few, indeed not one in a hundred, truly care for God's honor and the fatherland. Contempt of God, hypocrisy, and avarice have almost devastated everything. The consul Balthasar Funk has confidentially told me that not the least of the cities in the empire have noticed on the imperial diets through their envoys that if the Confederates loved mercy more and upheld good justice, they would not hesitate long and would take a mouthful a fathom long. Forgive me for the words, you know well how I mean it. Thus are the pious and honorable cities now minded. I write this to you in confidence, so that you may act all the more appropriately in all your dealings that serve peace and unity among yours, should it come to that (as I fear), that we must use each other in tribulation, so that we may then more closely unite our heads to save our fatherland, remain in the received truth of God, and defend ourselves against the bloodthirsty tyrants.</p>
      <p>I have recently received letters from Martin Frecht that on the eleventh of February the Confederates were together in Baden and decided something regarding the imperial Chamber Court; it would be just right if we and the Confederates ended up in the same sack; but who knows the counsel of the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Dominus Frechtus has undoubtedly sent you the Schwenckfeldian song about his heresy through M. Ambrosius. It is a marvelous song, but it sounds well of Schwenckfeld's spirit.</p>
      <p>Let our common tribulation be of concern to you, friendly, dear Bullinger, as you undoubtedly do, and act according to your given grace in all that is conducive to neighborly friendship and unity. We are all fresh and healthy by God's grace, which we wholeheartedly desire to hear from you and yours at all times.</p>
      <p>May the Father of all grace keep you and your entire household well through Jesus Christ. Greet the pious, God-loving Pellican, Herr Caspar, Binder, and all servants of the word for me. Dominus Friderichus, my co-worker, sends you many greetings; likewise, my wife wishes you and your rib, along with your parent, well.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, February 15, 1543. Your old friend Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>I dare not well demand a letter from you, for I have not yet repaid my unworthiness, but I would still like to receive a friendly greeting from you, if it could not be more.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, pious and of good manners, endowed with not insignificant learning, is eager to serve Christ, traveling to Bern. I would sincerely wish him to be granted a position among yours in the Zurich area, where he could serve the Lord in the ministry of the word. Receive him in passing in my name, I beseech you, brother.</p>
      <p>To the pious, God-learned Herr M. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the churches in Zurich, my friendly, dear lord and brother, to his own hands. Zurich.</p>
