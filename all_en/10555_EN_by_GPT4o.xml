    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for his friendly letter and praises his conciliatory nature. Kolb, Megander, and he himself cannot travel to Zurich, therefore Bullinger should come to Bern with Leo [Jud] or someone else to clarify the issue of the Lord's Supper; possibly pastors from the countryside could also participate in the conversation, or a meeting could take place in Aarau with the participation of one or two people from Bern as well as pastors from Aargau, depending on the wishes of the people of Zurich. Chelius has presented him with the opinions of Melanchthon, Bucer, and Hedio, but he has only been persuaded to sign Bullinger's opinion [No. 514]. Distrusts the messenger. Repeats the urgent request for Bullinger to come to Bern. Has written to Leo [Jud] regarding Megander.</p>

      <p>S. How much your very friendly and truly genuine letter has delighted me, dearest Heinrich, I can hardly write, unless you yourself have already seen me relieved of all worries. I conceal everything and keep it deep in my heart, until either a similar deceit is played on me or integrity is entirely abolished. No one mentions this to me, nor do I. In the meantime, I recognize and revere the gift of God in you, who knows how to turn even the worst things to the best. If this were given to all of us, we would all be united by a greater bond of charity. However, since there is no one who lacks nothing, "each should bear the other's burdens" [Gal 6, 2] as necessary. I have learned to defer to everyone in many things, even to my own frequent inconvenience. If only it were not demanded of me so precisely and exactly by everyone, if I were to err in any way! But in the meantime, you are an example to me not to be regretted, as I find you much more tractable, even when treated with the utmost injustice by others. Please continue, dearest brother, continue; for the Lord undoubtedly reserves great tasks and tragedies for you. It is enough for me that you have made me more peaceful and have never doubted my feelings towards you. In the meantime, do with the advice of your colleagues what seems best for both of us. I will keep your letters with me until you order otherwise, namely those you sent last.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sacramental matter, since a meeting seems absolutely necessary to us, in order to more strongly and effectively quell suspicions and animosities that could easily arise from them, it is not possible for us to come to you. You know that Kolb is suffering from both old age and poor health. As for me, those who have seen me know what I can manage either as a rider or on foot. Megander cannot be absent for long due to the countless consistory matters. Therefore, with such a convenient opportunity offered, where you can come to Bern either with Leo or another of yours (since there are many among you who can take your place), I beg and implore you, yes, I urge you by our old alliances, to come to Bern at least once and for my sake. Ministers from the countryside could also be present, if you absolutely want them, although I do not believe they are necessary until we have completely agreed among ourselves. But if you absolutely cannot come to Bern and I cannot come to Aarau, one or two of us will still be present. Many ministers from Aargau could also be present, whose presence would make it easier for us to understand each other. It is up to you to set the day and place, and bring along whoever else you want to be present. They will be no less welcome to us than to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, that Chelius was with me and offered to read the moderation of ecclesiastical matters signed by Melanchthon, Bucer, and Hedio. And when he suspected that I would give them less support, he finally showed your writings, in which you wish to moderate everything according to the scriptures and confess the main points of our religion more purely than you consult anything else. After much persuasion, he obtained that I also add my name to yours, although I see nothing advised by both of us in his plan. For he seems to seek something else. I kept a copy of everything presented to me.</p>
      <p>What you request, I will only send with a most certain messenger. Ich bin ergrempt (I am upset). Lastly, when you have responded to us, I beg you to indicate to me alone who among you will come.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother. Use me entirely for all kinds of services, as I am most ready.</p>
      <p>Last day of January in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>Today a messenger left from us, a certain glassmaker, whom, since he was unknown to me, I did not want to trust. And the one who brings this is a colleague's relative.</p>
      <p>Nothing more remains than for you to see our church and us once. Now I want to see whether you will come to Bern to see me. Ich welt denecht dich gern kennen (I would really like to know you), if you came to me unexpectedly, I would not recognize your face. Dear mine, be so fresh and dare once, as you have long promised me.</p>
      <p>I wrote briefly to Leo to excuse Megander, so that he does not seem to be the author of everything and we mere senators. He himself sent a spear and letters to Leo. I did not dare to trust the messenger, nor this one plainly, since he is related to Megander.</p>
      <p>To his dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger, always to be cherished among the churchmen in Zurich.</p>
