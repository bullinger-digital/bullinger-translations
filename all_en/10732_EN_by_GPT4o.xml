      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, we have read your letter concerning the will of the late Hans Lux with great sorrow. However, the brothers on behalf of the assigned children and the executors are entirely willing. In the meantime, our gracious lords have written to the chief bailiff, as you will find a copy enclosed herein. We have truly, with effort, labor, and expense, brought the matter to a good end for the children, as long as our lords would only do a little of the best. Therefore, we are sending them our will and offer in writing; we are also enclosing a copy for you, in which you can understand all the dealings. However, since the children are poor, and we have otherwise incurred many expenses, we have sent witnesses of these letters to you, along with a letter of recommendation from the chief bailiff, with a friendly request that you, together with Mr. Georg Syz, may be able to ensure with the mayor that the letters are processed quickly, and that we receive a gracious response to our writing according to our need. If the matter is delayed by only a day and night, you may well have the messenger wait; but if it is delayed longer, you may let the messenger go (let him leave) and receive the answer in our name. Please send us back the enclosed copies sealed. The missive to our lords should be somewhat more orderly than the original shows.</p>
      <p>I have completed the chronicles up to the end of the year 1534 in an orderly manner; I will send them to you soon.</p>
      <p>Always keep me in mind and commend you and your people to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dated Thursday, December 2, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Stumpf wrote on behalf of all.</p>
      <p>I have not been able to find the time to write this again.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the gospel in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
