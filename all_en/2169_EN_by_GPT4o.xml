      <p>Greetings. I received your letter along with the packet from our Vergerius; I respond to it briefly. If you can do so at your convenience, you will send it to him. I am not so lacking in humanity that I would wish to burden you with this or any other matter. I write as matters present themselves, and I write openly. Nothing is more pleasing to me than that everyone should use the same freedom towards me, especially those to whom I owe much, as I do to you. I certainly love and revere you above all. Farewell. Chur, 8 days before the calends of February.</p>
      <p>Your John Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
