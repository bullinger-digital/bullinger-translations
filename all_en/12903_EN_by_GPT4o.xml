    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas thanks for the efforts undertaken by Bullinger [on behalf of Bernardino Ochino]. It is not bad that they were not successful, because it is always good to know how people think. This way, one avoids a rash action that would later be regretted in an even greater predicament! For Enzinas, Bullinger's willingness to help counts much more than if he had obtained the finest accommodation from the Zurich council for himself or Ochino. He is therefore always willingly at his service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Twelve days ago, he entrusted a well-packaged shipment intended for Bullinger to Myconius for delivery. He says that he has sent it. Has it arrived safely?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should share any news. Yesterday, the arrival of four ships from "India" [America] with gold for Emperor Charles V was reported from Antwerp, who now intends to transfer a large amount of money via Antwerp to Germany. He has grand plans. But the Lord is mightier than all gold and any human power! He will thwart the godless plans of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, also to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and to Bullinger's family.</p>

      <p>Greetings and good health. I am most grateful for your diligence. I do not regret that your attempts were not very successful; indeed, it is helpful to know the inclinations of people, so that one does not act imprudently when greater necessity arises. I value your willingness and readiness more than if I had obtained the most splendid accommodation from your council for either myself or Bernardino. I can promise or offer nothing other than equal love and readiness for your services. You will always find this integrity most ready in me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Twelve days ago, I carefully entrusted your letters, well-packaged, to Mr. Myconius, who informed me that they have already been sent to you; I wish to know if they have been faithfully delivered.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you receive any news, you will inform us with your letters. Yesterday, I received news from Antwerp that four ships have arrived from "India" [America] laden with gold for Emperor Charles V, and that he is arranging for a large sum of money to be transferred to Germany via Antwerp. He has grand plans indeed. But God will restrain the impious endeavors, for He is mightier than all gold and human power.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, along with Mr. Konrad Pellikan, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, and your entire family.</p>
      <p>Basel, 21st of March, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
