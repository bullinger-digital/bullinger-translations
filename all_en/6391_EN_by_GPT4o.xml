      <p>To the esteemed Balthasar, as he departs to you, I could not refrain from sending a letter, especially since today I received from you a letter full of love and goodwill. This has been the most gratifying occurrence amidst my other troubles and inconveniences, that I find you, a good man distinguished in all good arts, becoming more friendly to me each day. I willingly confess, I am delighted to be honored by your judgment and I consider it a special favor, so that I may diligently strive in the future to ensure that whatever judgment and duty you have bestowed upon me, you will deem well-placed.</p>
      <p>I am grateful that you inform me about German affairs; nothing of great disturbance seems to be feared there. I have learned about the Turkish fleet through the talk and letters of many.</p>
      <p>Our affairs in France are in a fairly good state. The King is in Toulouse, where there is much for him to do.</p>
      <p>May God mercifully be present to the youth of our prince and grant the Christian name, you and me, His peace. Farewell, most excellent man, to whom I wish the greatest health, to your consuls and republic, and to Gwalter and Gesner.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the first of March, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] de Belli√®vre.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
