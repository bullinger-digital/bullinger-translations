    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not inform Vadian earlier because his informant only returned to Zürich the day before. This informant showed himself willing to advise and explained that the [Swiss] cantons did not take pleasure in the Appenzell affair and supported St. Gallen, further stating that they believed the city of St. Gallen should be paid what is due to them and that the slanderous affair should be settled through mediation or a Swiss legal procedure, with the informant advising the people of St. Gallen to opt for mediation. He asks for indulgence for his hasty writing and sends greetings to Ambrosius Schlumpf and the pastors. It is assumed that a diet will be held in Baden very soon because of the Landenberg [feud].</p>

      <p>Friendly greetings, willing service, and whatever I can do to honor, love, and benefit you, is ready for you beforehand. Highly learned, pious, distinguished, and wise, gracious, and beloved lord, I would have gladly written to you earlier and informed you to the best of my ability about your written request and decision. However, the person through whom I had to convey everything has not been at home since your departure from Zürich and only returned last night from our lords' affairs (as you might well know what is present). Therefore, I earnestly ask you to excuse my long delay and the fact that I held up the messenger; for if this messenger had not been available, I would have sent my own to you. And the matter is as follows: The person was entirely inclined to advise and help you, also to keep everything that might be of use or harm to me in this matter. He first points out that no one among the places was pleased with the Appenzell affair. Therefore, you need not worry at all; for it must now be very rare and not at all steadfast in the places (of which he is not sure), should you be concerned about it now. He then points out that it was unanimous that the city of St. Gallen should be allowed to follow their course and be paid. The matter of persuasion should be amicably or legally settled or carried out, and here there was no more than a single place (not necessary to name) that intended to let the Appenzellers remain by their alliances and rights; but all the other places, although they are not inclined, neither the Appenzellers nor anyone to print letters and seals, they still want this matter, which is so partisan, not to be shown for the Appenzellers, if it cannot be amicably settled, but to take it generally for themselves. Lastly, as you asked whether the law or the amicability should be accepted? he says the matter is (as you know) confused; therefore, he liked it better and could advise you to accept the amicability. The reason for this advice is: you would gain as much with the amicability as with the law; he hopes for this entirely; the law brings much displeasure, enmity, unrest, cost, effort, worry, and work. With this, he sends you friendly greetings and offers himself to you with all faithful services and love. So I also ask you to always have me recommended and to take this my quick writing in good part and, if you should pass it on, to improve it. With this, God is entrusted. If I could serve you, especially a pious city - St. Gallen, you will find me willing and faithful. Greet Mr. Ambrosius Schlumpf and your preachers, my dear brothers. Dated Zürich, September 20, anno 1538.</p>
      <p>Note, it is assumed that a diet will be held in Baden very soon because of the Landenberg [feud]. The aforementioned person also instructed me to inform you of this; however, he cannot say anything specific. Your entirely willing Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, prudent, and wise Mr. Joachim von Watt, mayor of St. Gallen, his gracious dear lord.</p>
