    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer's encounter with the convinced Schwenckfeldian [Hans Wilhelm von Laubenberg] was fortunate in that he suddenly departed after waiting some time for a conversation with Blarer. Through his host [...], he let Blarer know that he would have liked to discuss with him, but had to return home earlier than planned. May the Lord free His church from such stubborn people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Hopefully, [Konrad] Hofherr will recover mentally and physically. His feverish condition is likely the reason why he feels exposed by Blarer's letters to him, to Bullinger [No. 2413], and to Theodor [Bibliander]. The people of Zurich should continue to admonish Hofherr.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Blarer would have liked to assess Bullinger's writing [„De sacramentis“]. However, since he could only skim through it, he is unable to do so. He is glad, though, that Bullinger is not upset with him for this. It is certain that hardly any of Bullinger's works could displease him, as his argumentation always testifies to the influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- He has already forgiven Hofherr, provided that he no longer bothers him with bitter letters. He wishes Hofherr's wife [...] a happy childbirth, the little daughter [...] and the parents Christ's blessing. At present, he cannot and does not want to write to Hofherr himself. If he needs money, Bullinger should advance it to him. For the remaining one and a half months of the [school] year, he still has 7 florins available.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- All righteous people are pleased with the letter [No. 2404] from the [Swiss] churches to Philipp [Melanchthon]! Whenever Bullinger wishes, Blarer is ready to write to Melanchthon and appreciate his work. Bullinger's letter will surely bring him joy. Bullinger should also share the content of this letter with [Jakob] Herbrot.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Emperor [Charles V] is trying to dissolve the [Schmalkaldic] League. Therefore, some [German states] believe that no steps should be taken regarding the League that could anger the Emperor. In this regard, the people of Augsburg are showing considerable courage, the people of Strasbourg somewhat as well, while the people of Ulm and other [allies] are very much seeking the Emperor's favor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Allegedly, he has appointed Count Friedrich [II] of Fürstenberg as the governor of Milan, which would be bad news for the Swiss, as the Count is very hostile towards them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Rudolf] Gwalther, whom Blarer cannot write to due to lack of time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [P.S.:] [The copy of Bullinger's] letter [to Melanchthon] will be returned by Blarer soon. He will, of course, treat the letter confidentially.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [Enclosure:] A vintner [...] in Baden reports that Hans Greber from Nebikon in the district of Willisau confirmed under oath to the Lucerne council that on the night of March 23, on his way home, he saw a comet and two blood-colored stars. When he later looked back to see if the stars were still in the sky, he saw six men, each marked with a Swiss cross, and ten other men, each with a red, Burgundian St. Andrew's cross, whereupon he hurried home in fright.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The innkeeper Caspar Engel from Frauenfeld heard from a Zurich [...] that at Kappel [am Albis] a dog had dug up two completely uncorrupted corpses from a mass grave from the [Second Kappel] War.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger should report what he knows about this.</p>

      <p>S. I dealt quite successfully with that Schwenckfeldian, as he left much sooner than expected, even without saying goodbye to me, except that he instructed the host to convey his regards and farewell to me, adding that he had intended to meet with me and discuss many things, but had to hasten his departure due to unforeseen delays at home. I consider myself fortunate in dealing with him, as I could not have dealt more successfully than by not dealing with him at all; he is so thoroughly committed to the doctrines of that man. May the Lord soon deliver His church from such stubborn minds!</p>

      <p>I hope Curio is well in mind and body. I easily understood his feverish state after my letters, which I wrote to you, Theodor, and him, did not please him as they should have. He claims that I have deprived him of all authority with you and that I regard him as a most worthless rascal, a "night-thieving rogue," etc.; all of which could hardly be forgiven except to someone feverish. Therefore, let the poor man be healed by your holy and most Christian exhortations, although I am very impudent to burden you with this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As Christ is my witness, I would have gladly written my judgment of your book to you if I had formed any opinion. I was forced to read it so tumultuously and in passing that I could not have the understanding required for a complete judgment, and therefore I should not pronounce on it. However, I am far from being upset with you for wanting to extract my opinion, and I now consider it a great favor that you, in your singular candor and modesty, refrained from pressing me. Meanwhile, know this: It is hardly possible for your works to displease me, as they always seem to me to exude something of the divine spirit in many ways.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have already easily forgiven Curio, provided he does not continue to provoke me with bitter letters. I pray for a happy childbirth for his wife and pray to the Lord that the little daughter and the parents may be eternally sanctified with Christ the Savior. At present, I cannot and do not want to write to him for certain reasons. If he needs money, I ask you to lend it to him until a certain messenger departs from here to you. He still has seven gold coins left for use this year (which will end in a month and a half). He will receive them back from me as soon as possible, whoever counts them out to him there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I will not hesitate to write to Philipp and bear witness to your church, which all good people rightly love! Especially to its ministers, when it seems right to you. Your letter to him pleases me greatly, and I know that it cannot displease him in his candor and modesty. It seems better to me that you yourself inform Herbrot what you wrote to Philipp.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor is making remarkable efforts to dissolve our alliance, and some are almost persuaded that it is better to keep the Emperor favorable than to attempt again those things which might provoke that majesty more strongly. The people of Augsburg seem to me quite prudent and brave in this matter. The people of Strasbourg also leave some hope. The people of Ulm are twisting themselves strangely and are thought to incline towards the Emperor's side, as are some others. This will encourage the Emperor and the remaining adversaries more than you can believe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Some reliable people firmly assert that Count Friedrich of Fürstenberg has been appointed by the Emperor as the governor of Milan; if this is true, as I greatly fear it is, new troubles will arise for you, as this count is as hostile and unfriendly to all the Swiss as possible, although this will not matter at all if you have the strong hand of the Lord standing with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I commend myself most diligently to your holy prayers. Greet your household with all friends and brothers, especially Theodor and Gwalther, to whom I would write if I were not excluded by lack of time. All of ours greet you very respectfully. May the Lord preserve you for us for a long time! Farewell well in this, my venerable and dearest brother. Constance, April 28, 1546.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I will soon return Philipp's letters to you. I have not yet copied them. However, be assured about their confidentiality. You know my faithfulness, which has never failed you, unless I am completely mistaken.</p>

      <p>Regarding this, what is it? It is written to a council in Lucerne that a man named Hans Greber from Nebikon in the Willisau district, belonging to Lucerne, saw a comet and stars at night when he intended to return home, namely 2 stars, one larger than the other and both blood-colored. And after half an hour, when he came to Strampfel (a path), he looked back to see if the stars were still there. But they were there again, and with 16 men, among whom 6 were marked with visible, broad, white Swiss crosses, each cross a hand's breadth, and among the six, one was very dark pale and not as visible as these five. The remaining ten were all marked with bright, red Burgundian, that is, mercenary St. Andrew's crosses, also somewhat narrower than these Swiss crosses. And when he saw this, he felt such a horror that he was very worried about getting home. He confirmed this vision under oath before a council in Lucerne.</p>

      <p>N., Vintner in Baden in Aargau, etc.</p>
      <p>On the Kapellberg:</p>
      <p>It is said that two fresh corpses have been found, of those who were slain in the Zurich war, whose hair, nails, clothes, and everything else have remained completely uncorrupted. Although they were buried with others, they were dug up by a dog, it is said quite credibly in Frauenfeld. The innkeeper Caspar Engel is said to have heard it from a Zurich man who saw the bodies himself.</p>
      <p>Write back if you have anything.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
