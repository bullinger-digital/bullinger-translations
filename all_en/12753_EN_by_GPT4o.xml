    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Yesterday, Haller wrote quite extensively [No. 2701] through [...], the servant of Hans Wyss. Now, with [...], there is again an opportunity for news transmission, which Bullinger so appreciates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The rumor still circulating about the death of the Emperor [Charles V] is even considered credible by [Sebastian] Schertlin, as [Wolfgang] Musculus reports, who dined with Schertlin yesterday. Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria is said to have ordered a large amount of black cloth from Augsburg. However, Haller fears that this is a ruse by the priests!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When he dined today with Musculus and the seventy-year-old [Wolfgang] Rehlinger, he heard of another rumor: The Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], Doctor [Johann von] Naves, [Anton] Fugger, and [Hans?] Baumgartner are said to be secretly negotiating in Nördlingen (which has voluntarily surrendered to the Imperial forces) so that [King] Ferdinand [I] [again] becomes the Roman King and the Duke of Bavaria is appointed Emperor. [Fugger and Baumgartner] probably want to spare themselves and their debtors financial losses. [Maximilian Egmont], Count of Buren, is said to be on his way with the Emperor's body to his birthplace [Ghent]. It is certain that von Buren is hurrying towards Flanders and the Imperial forces are not resisting the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony], who is devastating the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg. Hence the rumor of the Emperor's death, who otherwise would never have allowed the occupation of these strategically advantageous places, where so much grain is still available. The Elector is also said to have taken the Teutonic Order's monastery in Mergentheim as well as Würzburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Duke Maurice [of Saxony] has besieged Wittenberg but was repelled at the first assault and forced to withdraw.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Elector has almost the entire cavalry of the [Schmalkaldic League] with him. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] kept only 200 riders, who rode with him to Stuttgart. Today it was reported that Philipp is rushing with 12 riders to King [Francis I] of France!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] These unverified news as far as in haste. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. I wrote quite extensively yesterday through the servant of Hans Wyss about various matters. Now, however, since another messenger presents himself to me, I cannot refrain from writing again about what new things I have received these days. Because I know these services are pleasing to you, I gladly serve you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The rumor is still constant among many that the Emperor has died. Musculus, who dined with Schertlin yesterday, also told me that he suspects this to be true. He uses the conjecture that the Duke of Bavaria has ordered a large amount of black cloth from Augsburg. I truly fear that this is a deceptive invention of the priests.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Today, while dining with the consul Rehlinger, a seventy-year-old and now retired man, together with Musculus, I also hear other conjectures being recounted: Namely, that the Bishop of Augsburg, Doctor Naves, Fugger, and our Baumgartner are secretly negotiating in Nördlingen (which was captured by the Imperial forces who voluntarily offered and surrendered themselves) to see by what means they might make Ferdinand the Roman King and the Duke of Bavaria the Emperor, so as not to incur any loss of their debtors and invested money. There is also a rumor that the Count of Buren is carrying the Emperor's body to Lower Germany, to be buried again where he was born. For it is certain that Buren is hastening greatly to his Flanders. It is also certain that nothing at all is being done by the Imperial forces, and they allow the Elector to devastate the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg at will. From this, they conclude the Emperor is dead; otherwise, he would not permit these most advantageous places, rich in grain and strategically located for restoring the war, to be occupied. For it is said that the Elector has already taken Mergentheim, the richest Teutonic Order's monastery, and Würzburg itself.</p>

      <p>Duke Maurice has besieged Wittenberg and, having attempted to storm the wall at the first assault, was repelled and withdrew with the matter unresolved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Elector is leading with him all the cavalry that our entire forces had, except for 200 horsemen who went with the Landgrave to Stuttgart. Today it is also reported that the Landgrave is hurrying with only 12 horses to the King of France.</p>

      <p>These uncertain things, as I have heard them, I wanted to share with you. If I have more certain news, I will also provide it. Farewell. Most hastily from my study, December 6th. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich to be delivered.</p>
