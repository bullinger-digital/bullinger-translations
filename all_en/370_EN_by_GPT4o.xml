      <p>Greetings. Dear godfather, because I hold you dear from the heart and as myself, it allows me to be even more joyful in considering and dealing with you. I am sending you a letter here, belonging to my brother-in-law, as you see, named Uli Ulrich or Uli the builder, who resides next to the guild hall. I ask you to send it to him through a boy; there are 10 guilders inside, which belong to him, but I wanted to send them to you so that it would be better arranged and the money would be less likely to be lost.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God. Yesterday and the day before, I also wrote to you. I almost bet that if Blarer does not handle it correctly, he will remain; because I would rather work and do what I can before I want to have a dispute.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your wife and entire household from me and mine. Dated in Bern, December 15, 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his especially favorable, dear lord and godfather in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
