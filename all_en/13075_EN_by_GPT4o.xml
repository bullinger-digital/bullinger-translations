    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Peyer, Offenburger, and Stierlin have a very special relationship of trust with Bullinger and his colleagues because they have always taken good care of the sons of the Schaffhausen councilors and patricians. Consequently, they now allow themselves to inquire about the progress in studies, the eagerness to learn, and the behavior of the son [Johann Frank] of the Schaffhausen citizen Hans Frank. Bullinger should provide the bearer of the letter [...] with a corresponding written testimonial.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Schaffhausen councilors will fully trust the judgment and will prove to be grateful for it.</p>

      <p>Our willing, friendly service always beforehand, worthy, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir. As you, together with your fellow servants and preachers of God's word, have so far been highly committed to our lords and upper-class citizens, for which reason we have a very high trust in you. Accordingly, it is our very diligent intention and request to you, together with your mentioned co-preachers, to once again make an effort and inquire in Zurich about how our citizen Hans Frank's son has conducted himself in his studies so far (whether he has diligently and attentively attended and visited the lectures as is proper, also what his actions and conduct are and how far he has progressed and advanced in his studies), and then inform and notify us in writing by letter as soon as possible about what you find, to our greatest advantage.</p>

Alexander Peyer, mayor, Alexander Offenburger, and Johannes Stierlin, both council members, as appointed schoolmasters of the city of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the holy divine scriptures in Zurich, our especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
