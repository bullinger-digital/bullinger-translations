      <p>My lords of Biel have a parish, which is the largest in their land, named Gorsemont. This parish has been served for many years by a man otherwise pious and faithful, but nevertheless unlearned and unskilled, named Philippus N. However, the peasants have now, for 3 or more than 4 years, harbored a considerable resentment against this pastor of theirs due to his poor and unskilled preaching, and have therefore continuously requested that my lords provide them with a skilled man, whoever he may be, offering to accept whomever my lords would appoint from among all their preachers in the land. Thus, they have persistently approached your council, causing the council to discuss the matter with us; they have informed us many times, requested us to act so that the church might be helped. But we, the preachers, have nothing to do with it. I have therefore not wanted to speak on the matter, as I noticed that my dear brother, Mr. Michel, wanted to have his way in this matter, and I would have had to disagree with him if I had opposed it. Therefore, it has always been postponed and left unresolved. Mr. Michel's reasons, which he put forward on behalf of Mr. Philipp, were, as far as I understood from him, that although he is not learned, he is nevertheless pious and therefore should not be removed, also he has many small children, and the other parish, to which my lords have appointed him, is too small for his maintenance; also, if this is allowed now, the peasants will come tomorrow with another, wanting to have him removed as well, and finally, it will come to us preachers in the city. Later, as my lords did not want to do anything about the matter and we preachers also did not, the peasants offered to send their preacher to the city to hear him preach, and if the council then recognized that he was good for their church, they would keep him, otherwise they would fulfill their request.</p>
      <p>Such an opinion was also reported by a council. I also spoke separately with Mr. Michel about it and thought it would be good to do so; but he did not want to, answering me that it was unnecessary; they had heard enough. The peasants also threatened to go to the bishop in Bern if they saw that my lords did not want to help them with this man. Since my lords could no longer endure the delay and yet could see well that we both preachers did not want to do anything about it, they instructed my lord mayor, since he was about to ride into the valley anyway, to inform Mr. Philipp that it was the council's order that he should move to the next suitable parish named Sumpon, and the other pastor named Firmianus, a pious and learned man who had long endured there with poor income, should take his place.</p>
      <p>Upon this, all the preachers, at the behest of my lords, at the instigation of the aforementioned Mr. Philipp, held a meeting without my prior knowledge and also without Mr. Michel's, as I understood from him, came to Biel, summoned us to them, expressed their complaint that they did not want to let him stay in his old parish, and requested help and advice from us both preachers. Mr. Philipp also said that it was now about the fact that the peasants in Sumpoa did not want him and said that if he was not good enough for Gorsemont, he was not good enough for them either, but that was untrue, as was later found. For although the peasants in Sumpoa were initially not very willing to accept Mr. Philipp, as they knew well of his incompetence, nevertheless, they wanted to act as obedient subjects and willingly accepted him. When we discussed the matter in the meeting, they all agreed to appeal to the council and ask that Mr. Philipp be allowed to stay longer; if they did not want to do so, they would seek advice elsewhere, and if all else failed, they would all stand together and also take leave in common, and that for the following reasons: Mr. Michel read an article from the city's synodal constitutions; it stated that neither bishop, abbot, nor provost should give leave to any pastor without the knowledge and consent of the council and us preachers. Secondly, they had an article in the order of the colloquies, that if a council gave leave to a preacher without reasonable cause, all the others in the city and land should also want to take leave with him before they were bound to it. Now, since they were all determined on this, I did not want to separate and divide, agreed that they should come before the council and discuss the matter with my lords: however, I would not have helped to take leave for the following reasons, with which a council also excused itself, namely that Philipp was incompetent and knew nothing at all, and yet it is the largest parish, also that it had often been reported to us, even if we were not sent to the council last, as it was changed, also that the article mentioned above now applies to the bishop, provost, and abbot, not to my lords, also that the article about the leave of all of us, if one wants to take leave, is not confirmed by a council, nor is it in the synodal statutes; they made it among themselves years ago, now serving to disturb the church and cause unrest, etc. Also, since it was found through good acquaintance that Mr. Philipp lied in saying that the peasants did not want him, for he had begged the peasants over 6 times at the highest not to accept him, as he did not want to go to them, whereby one can well sense what kind of fellow he is. Since all the preachers were of one mind to appeal to the council, we requested a day from the council, on which it was convenient for them. They could not give us that day that week, as my lord mayor was not at home. The following week, they appointed us a day, Saturday, and the mayor informed us of this appointed day, to which Mr. Michel replied that he did not need any day, as my lords had already changed Mr. Philipp; therefore, he went there. However, a council decided, since it was rumored in the city that they did not want to let the preachers go, we must appear on the day, as we had once requested it, and thus informed all the preachers of the day and invited them to come. On Friday, when we were all to appear before the council on Saturday, Mr. Michel offered the mayor or told him himself that he wanted to be sent alone before the council in the morning; he had something special to handle. So, on Saturday morning, all the preachers came to Mr. Michel and wanted to go with him before the council; since I was sick, I could not go up. He then said to them: "I will not go before the council with you; I have something special to deal with before the lords." So they came to me, asking how they should handle their matters. I advised them to go before the council and hear what was presented to them.</p>
      <p>They did so. Thus, the council summoned Mr. Michel alone. He informed them how it had happened years ago when they had handled something similar concerning another preacher, as they did now with Mr. Philipp; at that time, he had sworn before honorable people by God that if it happened again, he would no longer be with them. Since they have now done this and changed the preacher, he would not make his mouth a pocket, but rather take leave. Alongside this were also other reasons: many people said he now preached what old women told him here and there, also he spoke of many things that he could not prove; furthermore, he was not initially willing to come to Biel when he was sent there from Zurich; for he had never preached in any city before; but nevertheless, since he had many small children there, he took the burden upon himself and moved them to Biel; but now, as his children have grown up and almost all have been apprenticed here and there, it is no longer convenient for him to preach; he finds himself unable to endure it any longer. Upon this, the council earnestly begged him for the 3rd or 4th time to stay, with many words, unnecessary to recount, also saying: if he had something to say, as he reported, he should indicate who they were, so he must see that a council would punish, as is right.</p>
      <p>But he persisted, not wanting to serve them further this time. So they also spoke with him outside the council, good people in prayer, the old Mr. Jakob himself in the morning, before he took leave. But it was all in vain, and as he took leave on Saturday, he immediately left for Bern on Monday, without saying a word to me or any of my lords, although he had promised me to preach for me on Tuesday, as I was still unable. Had I not learned by chance that he had left, the church would have stood empty on Tuesday. Because of this, a great council was held on Tuesday; for there was almost an uproar in the city, as some citizens spoke many harsh words against the council, and when the great council was properly informed of all things, it unanimously decided to let Mr. Michel take his leave and without delay seek another. Thus, a council sent for me on Wednesday and informed me (truly without my suggestion and presentation, as the whole council knows) that a council would try to see if Mr. Ambrosius might be available, and sent me along with the other council messenger to him. We had to leave immediately on Thursday. However, as we rode away, Mr. Michel had not yet returned.</p>
      <p>This is the whole affair, and nothing is reported here except what a council wanted us to inform you of, likewise what will be found to be true in all parts with the entire council's knowledge. God willing, all of this could have been avoided.</p>
      <p>Here is to note: Mr. Michel's complaint, that he is accused of speaking much from the pulpit based on old women's tales, comes from this: a year and a half ago, he was also examined in the synod, as is customary, and when he returned, my lords told him amicably that they liked his teaching and life; only one thing they asked of him, that he would sometimes want to verify something better before he mentioned it from the pulpit; for sometimes old women would come to him, telling him much, where there might not be so much to it if one inquired properly. This was said to him in the best way.</p>
