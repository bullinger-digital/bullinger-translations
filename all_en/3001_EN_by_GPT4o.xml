      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letters from your kindness, my most esteemed Calvin. From the latter, I understand how much you have valued and continue to value my services rendered to you in that common cause. Indeed, I know that I owe myself entirely to you and yours. Therefore, if I can do anything in the future for your benefit, I will devote myself entirely to you. The envoys themselves will report the rest. For the brevity of time and the business by which I am distracted command me to be brief in writing.</p>
      <p>I do not take it amiss if you disagree with me in that cause. Indeed, my dear Calvin, today I have less hope than I had yesterday. I know those men will change nothing in their carnal opinion.</p>
      <p>You will experience it yourself. They write to me these days from the court of the Palatinate and from the Duchy of Württemberg that there is no hope that the sincere doctrine of the Lord's Supper will be accepted. For every day those men become more obstinate, more stubborn, and more unmanageable in their Lutheranism. Three (3) sermons have been sent to me, written in German and printed and published by Brenz. Oh, how grossly and papistically this old theologian writes about the Lord's Supper. However, he has the Palatine Elector and the Duke of Württemberg as his obedient princes, on whom the rest almost depend. Hence, I think there is no need to seek discussions. But if we are called by them, I think we should attempt what seems best at the time, according to the circumstances. However, D. a Lasco attempts something not without danger, as he wants to reconcile our opinion with the Augsburg Confession. I know when and how it was published and presented to the Emperor, by which authors it was written. The Apology is too crude. He will make himself and his doctrine suspect if he continues in this way. Everyone will shout that it was done most imprudently, indeed most impudently. Therefore, I wish he would consider the matter more closely.</p>
      <p>A great war has arisen in Livonia. A most bloody one is now arising between the Emperor and the Pope. Soldiers are being enlisted in Germany. We hope that D. Peter Martyr has come to us for the great good of the church. We pray to the Lord to bless the matter. May the Lord Jesus bless you and all yours.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you. Greet the brothers and fellow ministers for us. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 28, in the year of our Lord 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
