    <p xml:id="regest1">When Gwalther visited him in the summer, Caesarius suspected in the greeting a mere pretext to be able to speak with him. His doubt was dispelled by Bullinger's letter, in which he announced his commentary on the Epistles [HBBibl I 84 and 91] as a sign of gratitude; since the book has not yet arrived, he asks for it to be delivered by the bookseller Arnold Birckmann. He is delighted with the gift and regrets that age and illness prevent him from visiting. He sends greetings to Gwalther and Vadian, whose works he reads with profit, as well as Pellican's commentaries; however, he dislikes the latter's too close adherence to Erasmus' "Paraphrases".</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>Your Gwalther, or rather mine as well, came to me last summer, a young man indeed endowed with admirable sweetness of character and not at all common education in the best literature, accompanied by two Anguses, certainly men, as I could easily surmise, both very learned and very pious. The young man came, I say, (I think) not so much to greet me with your words, as to see and hear me, a man already in moderate old age, which Juvenal calls the first and right age, so that he might see and hear about whom there is a greater reputation for learning among foreigners than is the case. And unless the same young man had immediately added that you had once been my disciple here, I could have suspected that the greeting was invented by him rather than recommended to him by you. For it often happens that, while we are held by the desire to meet someone and there is no just occasion, we contrive something of the sort, through which any occasion of approaching whom we wish is obtained.</p>
      <p>However, when your letters were brought to me at the last Frankfurt fair, I cast aside all scruple about this matter, as from them I clearly learned that the young man himself was sent by you for this purpose, not only to greet me with your words but also to visit and see me besides. From the same letters of yours, I also understood that you, as a token of your gratitude towards me, sent your Commentaries on all the Epistles of the Apostles; but to whom among our booksellers they were entrusted to be delivered to me, I have not yet been able to find out. I think this happened because the printer there with you, to whom you had entrusted it, has plainly forgotten this commission, not to say neglected it due to occupation. But a very easy remedy can be applied to this either forgetfulness or negligence if either you or the printer himself writes to Arnold Birckmann, a distinguished bookseller with us, and at the same time through the same letters reminds him not to hesitate to present one of the copies of your Commentaries to me at present until the next fair.</p>
      <p>Even though I have not yet received those Commentaries of yours, I nonetheless embrace your spirit towards me with as grateful a mind and affection as could be most pleasing to me. And if only I could declare it to you with some not at all common benefit! Oh, with how much desire I have longed to see and visit you and others like you, most learned and distinguished men there in piety; but age and certainly the very serious illness, from which I have suffered for almost four years now due to vertigo, do not allow me to ever fulfill this desire to visit you.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and most dutifully greet my dear young Gwalther and Joachim Vadian, a man learned in every respect, whose writings I wonderfully enjoy reading, as well as those of Konrad Pellikan - especially the reading of the Commentaries on the Old Testament -, in whose Commentaries on the four Gospels I am now engaged almost daily. I would prefer them not to be so frequently interspersed with Erasmus' commentaries from his Paraphrases, so much so that I can hardly distinguish them from those that are Pellikan's.</p>
      <p>In Cologne, on the very day of Gallus the Confessor.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in both piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, his best friend and most beloved by me.</p>
