      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>It is strange that you have not replied to three or five letters, if I remember correctly, nor have you sent the speech against the Interim.</p>
      <p>Our bishop sent an honorable delegation to us on January 21st, which wanted to persuade the council to accept the Interim. He sent the steward, named Sigelman, a nobleman, the chancellor, and the official; they excused themselves, saying they had to make such a presentation, which they knew would not be agreeable; they also excused the bishop, explaining how he was compelled by the imperial majesty to execute this. These cunning men were heard and dismissed without a response; they went to Mulhouse, where they also achieved nothing.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the Bishop of Constance will come to the city of Bern to perform his duty of restoring all that they once had. We hear that there was or will be an envoy in Zurich as well. Here it becomes apparent what the Seven Pagans are planning.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the Duke of Savoy will be with the council tomorrow; there is no doubt that they will demand the lost land back and will insult the Genevans with contemptuous words or try to incite us against the Bernese.</p>
      <p>Sulcerus, partly elected as pastor of the Church of St. Peter, partly desires to insinuate himself; he is compelled to serve, which he will gladly do, for a year without pay; he will preach in place of Lupo on Sundays. However, when the year has passed, he will be elected by all, if they are pleased with him. Is this not selling church benefices, giving chaff to others, and keeping the wheat?</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back. January 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor, Pellican, Rudolf, and our Musculus, to whom I send these letters sent to me from Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
