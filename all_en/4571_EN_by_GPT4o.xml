      <p>Greetings. I believe you have received my letters, which I wrote to you eight days ago.</p>
      <p>I sent along excerpts from letters I had received from Italy. Now, my son, understanding that he is traveling to you, could not restrain his hand from the pen. I also, so that there would be something to write, wanted to inform you that I have received letters from the Bishop of Rennes, in which he indicates that three major princes agree on the Council of Trent; the question remains whether a new convocation should be made or the continuation of the last one, which the Pope insists on. The Emperor wants to give his daughter to the Duke of Mantua.</p>
      <p>I believe the King has recovered from his cold and that everything will be quieter in France. My wife sends her regards to you and all our friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 7.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely [signed].</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
