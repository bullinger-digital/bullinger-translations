      <p>God be with us; may He grant you and Susanne much health in your household, and since I have heard that you have received it, I am sending you these bottles with colter (a type of drink) and the cheese leaves into your household. I am also sending you my judgment on the Saxon agreement and the agreement translated into German, the other in Latin, etc.</p>
      <p>Send it all back to me soon. And my salt book, which you have kept for a long time now, send it back to me as well and ensure that no harm comes to it.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanne and the children for me; Dorothea and all the people also send their greetings to you. Since I wrote the previous letter, I have learned that the treasurer, Mr. Thoman, has managed to prevent everything from falling to the authorities that was found behind the thieves. He, with some trusted men, surprised them at night in their beds; the third, Schirenbrand, one of the two servants, jumped out of the window and escaped; the other two have given the exchange letters and still have about 1000 crowns and the three horses, etc. And thus the thieves were not captured by the authorities; how it went for them is still unknown, and we await the treasurer. So the prisoners in Cologne should not be 20, but 17, and the council in Cologne gives the envoys of the princes proud answers; for they trust in Albani and the Spaniards, which is against the welfare and nature of the Germans. If you could send me a hare or something for the upcoming carnival (when I have all our people as guests for dinner) and send it to me by Friday or Saturday before, you would do me a service. In this cold weather, I fear for the seeds and the vines. May God protect us. God be with you. Let me know how it stands with Mr. von Rynow and make sure you settle your accounts with him correctly. Send the bottles back to me specifically; I have lent them.</p>
      <p>Wednesday, 13th of February, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
