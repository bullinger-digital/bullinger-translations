      <p>Greetings. The day before yesterday, I believe, I informed you, though briefly, of the death of our Lavater, which has struck my heart so deeply that I am at a loss as to what to write first or last. I would rather you hear it from others than from me, as I cannot express it through tears, especially to you, who have loved the young man as much as I have. Oh, what a dark day, on which such a young man was taken from us by such a disastrous death. There is no point in mentioning how much I would still wish for his life to be redeemed. God knows I could have borne my own death more easily, in which I find my only solace. For I loved him no less than if he had been born of me, which his virtues deserved. He never offended me while he was with me, and he was obedient to my word to the point of superstition. In short, he conducted himself in such a way that even Momus could not have found anything to criticize in him. My only consolation in such bitter grief is that he did not perish through any fault of mine, for without my knowledge and not even dreaming of it, while he was trying to rid himself of a cold, he lost his life. You, my dearest Bullinger, comfort his parents as you can and know how. For I am the least able to do so, as I am almost consumed by grief. I wish to be informed by you where I should send his belongings. He has added several commendable books to the library, including speeches of Cicero, works of Vives, Greek Euclid, commentaries of Stellan on Proclus, Isocrates, and others, which his brothers might perhaps use not inconveniently in the future. He has some clothes, but they are quite worn out, a zither, and a sword, which you should let me know in time whether they should be sold or sent to you at the next fair in Zurzach.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and do what is worthy of you in comforting the father and excusing me.</p>
      <p>So that you are not unaware, on the same day, two others besides Lavater perished in the water.</p>
      <p>They say the plague is on the rise here.</p>
      <p>You probably know the story of the occupied Monastery and the king with his followers being captured. Hofmann is still hiding in a deep prison. But these things you will hear from others.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell, my dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In haste. Strasbourg, July 11.</p>
      <p>Bedrot.</p>
      <p>The body, searched for diligently, was found the next day and buried properly, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his most sincere friend and brother.</p>
