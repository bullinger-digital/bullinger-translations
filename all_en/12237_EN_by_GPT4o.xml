    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sincerely thanks Bullinger for his letter [No. 2184?] and affection; may the Lord preserve this friendship forever! - On June 30, Blarer forwarded Bullinger's letter and the writings ["The Old Faith", "Hope of the Believers", and "Report of the Sick"] to [Georg] Frölich in Augsburg. - Bullinger need not thank him for his nephew [Josua Bullinger]; may he improve! - Matthias Schenck will take in [Johann Rudolf], the son of Johannes Stumpf, [as a student]. He wishes to do Blarer and the esteemed Bullinger a favor. Blarer regrets that he could show little gratitude to [Johannes] Stumpf in the short time, especially since he cannot forget the hospitality [shown to him in May 1544]. - Bullinger has surely learned what [Konrad] Zwick negotiated with [Johannes] Haab in Griesenberg. [Zwick] now sends [Haab] the main points of the negotiation, which show that he is not thinking of his own interest, but of the common good, and asks Bullinger for his opinion, assuming that the mayors [Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] will inform him about the matter. Zwick sends his regards to Bullinger. - Blarer again recommends Konrad Hofherr, who recently moved from a teaching position in Bischofszell to study in Zurich. He has a good, alert mind, but is too compliant. Bullinger should therefore pay special attention to him. The Augsburg mayor [Jakob] Herbrot has supported Hofherr and his family at Blarer's request; if he were disappointed, nothing more could be expected from him for students. It is reported that the Zurich doctor Jakob Ruf likes Hofherr very much and invites him too often to eat and drink. Blarer and Ruf hold each other in high regard. However, Blarer hears that Ruf lives in luxury, which is not suitable for future [servants] of the Word of God. - Gerhard [thom Camph] and [Samuel] Pellikan stayed in Konstanz, and they were treated as courteously as possible in the short time. Blarer sends his regards to Konrad Pellikan and thanks him for his letter. - Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther, Theodor [Bibliander], and the others, as well as Haab and Lavater. - [Enclosure with] news from Antwerp, Augsburg, and Worms: [Francis I] and [Henry VIII] are preparing; England has recently harmed France greatly. - The English [Captain Robert Renegar] has captured a ship [of Charles V] coming from the New World [India]. - [At the Imperial Diet] in Worms, the ambassadors of France [Louis Adhémar de Monteil and Sébastien de l’Aubespine] and the Pope [Paul III, Alessandro Farnese] as well as Duke [Charles III] of Savoy and [Ferrante I Gonzaga] are present. - Pope [Paul III] promises Emperor [Charles V] 20,000 [Lands]knechts. - Three Spanish bishops [...] inquired for [Paul III] in Venice whether the city would recognize the decisions of the Council of Trent. The city requested time to consider. - Duke [François I of] Lorraine died [on June 12, 1545]. [Francis I] and [Charles V] will likely now dispute over his land. - At the Imperial Diet in Worms, nothing happens, only much money and time are wasted. Due to the evil intentions of the Papists, the [Protestants] should present a more united front.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your sweetest and most affectionate letter, in which you continue to be the person you have long been. As for me, I assure you of the same, for I cannot help but embrace and revere with all my heart your sincerity and incomparable kindness combined with great learning. May the Lord make this bond of His Spirit, by which we are truly united, very strong, so that we may remain connected in the beautiful bond of divine love now and forever!</p>
      <p>I sent your letter to Lętus along with the package to Augsburg four days ago, and I have no doubt that he has already received everything accurately.</p>
      <p>It was not necessary for you to thank me for your nephew from your brother, as I owe not only small services but my entire self and all my possessions to you.</p>
      <p>May the young man return to good behavior as soon as possible (which he indeed promises to do)! It will be easily forgiven what he did out of the foolishness of his age.</p>
      <p>Our Matthias Schenck, a quite successful teacher of the literary school, will take in the son of the excellent man Johannes Stumpf, providing him with all the usual instruction given to other young men. He wishes to do this not only for me but also for you, whom he greatly respects.</p>
      <p>We were very sorry that Stumpf could only stay with us for barely a day and a half, and thus we could hardly show him any taste of our humble hospitality; for I will never forget such a generous host.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that you have already learned from my cousin Zwick what he negotiated with your consul Haab in Griesenberg. He now sends him some main points of the whole matter, from which you will clearly understand how he seeks not his own interest but your and his country's benefit. He asks you to diligently and freely advise him if anything in these articles seems to you to deviate from sincere public spirit or the rules of Christian charity; for he does not doubt that your consuls (which he also desires) will share everything with you. He has most diligently instructed me to commend himself to you and to send you his most abundant greetings in his words.</p>
      <p>I commend to you, as much as I can in a Christian manner, Conrad Curio, known as Hofherr, whom I have also recommended before, who not long ago moved from Bischofszell, where he taught boys, to you for the sake of studies. He has a good and very lively mind, but meanwhile, he is too compliant in any situation, so I greatly fear for him if he happens to fall into the company of those leading a more licentious life. Therefore, I beseech you by Christ and our friendship to watch over him for us, so that the beginnings of his studies may not be inauspicious. The Augsburg consul Herbrot has invested much in him and his family at my persuasion; I would not want him to make such magnificent expenses in vain. For if I deceive him even once, there will be nothing more that I or others can expect from him in the name of students, which would be a significant loss to the Christian republic. They affirm that your surgeon Jacob Ruf loves him very much and frequently invites him to his table and drinks with him generously, so that Curio does not even suffer the loss of a penny, with Ruf kindly providing everything. When you learn from yourself or others that this is indeed the case, you will gradually divert Conrad with certain reasons, which will never be lacking to you. I love Ruf very much, and he respects me beyond my merit and is devoted to my name, so I gladly acknowledge that I owe him much. However, I hear that he lives luxuriously and almost daily indulges in revelry; you know how much this hinders those destined for sacred studies. Therefore, it will not be for our Curio to associate with such a man, but to be with those who pursue frugality and sobriety in all of life.</p>
      <p>Gerard Frisius, a young man truly divine (if I judge correctly), was with us, along with the son of our Pellicanus, who himself closely resembles his excellent father. We treated them as courteously as possible given the short time and our rusticity; we would have treated them more courteously if they had been willing to stay longer. You will diligently and courteously commend me to Conrad Pellicanus and thank him on my behalf for his most loving letters.</p>
      <p>Greet very amicably Rudolf Gwalther, our distinguished friend, along with Theodor and the others, whose sacred prayers I uniquely desire to be aided by Christ in these perilous times of all things.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household. Commend me to your excellent consuls Haab and Lavater. Farewell, my sweetest brother.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, July 3, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>News from Antwerp and Augsburg, Worms: France and England are strengthening more and more, and England has recently caused great harm to France.</p>
      <p>Several ships with gold from the New World have come to the Emperor, one of which, with great wealth, has also been captured by England; I have forgotten which end this happened. Excellent embassies are in Worms from the French, the Pope; likewise, the Duke of Savoy, the Viceroy of Sicily.</p>
      <p>The Pope promises the Emperor 20,000 soldiers in his pay, so that he may uphold the Roman faith and the conclusion of the council more splendidly.</p>
      <p>Also, three Spanish bishops, along with an excellent embassy from the Pope, have been in Venice and wish to know whether they will remain by the conclusion of the council in Trent; they have taken time to consider this. The young Duke of Lorraine has died. The French are said to desire the land; the Emperor will not allow it. It is believed that the peace between these brothers-in-law will soon come to an end because of this cause.</p>
      <p>At the Imperial Diet in Worms, nothing is accomplished, as is customary, with such great loss of money and time, and with such great toil and labor. The bloodthirsty intentions of the clergy and the papists, along with the unfaithful practices, make it necessary for our people to unite more faithfully.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and more than dearest brother.</p>
