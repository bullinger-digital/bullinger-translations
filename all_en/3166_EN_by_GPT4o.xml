      <p> S. We have experienced both the piety and humanity of the most honorable councils of Schaffhausen and Basel, and of all the brothers, so that we have been provided everywhere with great reason to give thanks to our God, who has inflamed the hearts of His people with a special movement of His grace in this cause, so that we plainly hope, wherever the matter may fall, that these efforts, proceeding from the Spirit of God, will not be in vain. The more we will strive, relying especially on your prayers, not to fail ourselves. This one thing remains, that since it is necessary for the matter to be conducted by the common counsel of the four cities, as little delay as possible should be interposed. </p>
      <p> For you well understand that Satan, who undoubtedly knows what we are preparing, will attempt nothing so much as to ensure that those bloody threats are carried out before the King, at least compelled by shame, adopts some milder counsel. But why do we say this to you, who are witnesses of your utmost diligence? Indeed, these things are intended not to incite you or yours to diligence, but to kindle through you those whom we have found somewhat cold and slow compared to others. However, we fear that, as sometimes happens in chariots, if one wheel is slower, it may delay the impetus of the other three, no matter how prompt. Moreover, because in that our counsel, which you have, we ask: to expressly request the King to endure reading or hearing the confessions of our brothers, we send to you a French copy of them, which the envoys may carry with them and present to the King when necessary, and we earnestly request that they particularly insist on this matter, because we hope the King will recognize on this occasion what our adversaries have always diligently concealed from him, and having known the matter, he will be much milder than ever before. But if the King asks from where the envoys have those confessions, it must be prudently avoided that the brothers are exposed to the King's wrath, as if they had sent these to the Swiss, so that they would be inflamed with envy. However, a true and suitable response will be if they say they received them from their own, in whose hands they are commonly found, and there is no doubt that these are copied from true originals, which he can recognize from his own. Then, regarding the history of the Cabrierensians, if the King, to remove the odium of the deed, says that many things there are fabricated, although the history is most certain and well-known, we do not think the envoys should insist here, lest that fierce Pharaoh be provoked, but rather satisfaction should be accepted: indeed, on this occasion, he should be asked to show in reality how much he is alienated from such thoughts, let alone deeds, in our brothers. Finally, we remind you of the courtly arts, especially among our French. For among them, it is considered a mark of singular prudence to elude the less pleasing petitions of envoys with an ambiguous or uncertain response, to which it should be remedied in such a way that the King can neither escape nor be offended, nor should they immediately acquiesce to a universal or any response. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, as for us, tomorrow we plan to go to Montb√©liard, then to Strasbourg, afterwards to the Palatinate and others, as you know. We hope, however, that the Lord will also be present with our brothers through us here, especially if you continue to do what you are doing, that is, assist us with your constant prayers: which indeed we would ask of you in more words if we did not experience your constancy in this matter. Farewell, most excellent man, and in our name greet all colleagues and brothers, whom we must especially respect, as courteously as possible. May the Lord Jesus bless you more and more with His holy spirit. </p>
      <p> Basel, the third day before the Calends of May. </p>
      <p> Th. Beza, yours in his own name and in the name of D. Wilhelm Farel. </p>
