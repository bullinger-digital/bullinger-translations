      <p>Greetings. I assume you have received my recent letters through Jenatsch the Rhaetian, and in the meantime, nothing significant has occurred that you would wish to know. However, today a man of excellent faith reported that the Duke of Jülich is seriously contemplating ecclesiastical reformation and is currently hindered by some health issues, but it is hoped that once he recovers, he will prioritize the purification of religion among his people. Last summer, when he prohibited eucharistic celebrations, he was petitioned by his subjects and allowed them to be held on the same day throughout the entire principality, thus turning the vow into a mockery, as neighbors could not attend each other's celebrations as usual. Then he excluded masses conducted for any fee under the pretext that what was received freely should not be sold for money. These were preliminary actions, which nonetheless caused some consternation among the papists. It is reported that the King of Poland has died, and consequently, everything is now in suspense, so we must pray to the Lord that he may entrust the reins of the kingdom to a faithful servant. Marbach of Strasbourg, appointed as an envoy with others, remained at home, from which I infer that the religious negotiations have either dissipated or been postponed to another time. However, you will more accurately learn what is happening in Augsburg from the envoy of your republic, who, as I hear, has gone there. Here, the family of the Brabanters, called the Netherlanders, has been thrown into prison; they are accused of several crimes besides religion; however, I cannot predict the outcome of this tragedy and am more distressed by the proscription of Viret and others, from which you will understand, my brother, how severe a scandal it will be, spreading not only to neighboring areas but even to the most distant regions. I believe a remedy could have been provided if vigilance had been exercised in time.</p>
      <p>Farewell and please keep the bearer of this letter, an excellent and most innocent man, in your commendation. Basel, March 14, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed and dear brother.</p>
