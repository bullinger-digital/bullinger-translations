      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, dear brother and co-father, except that the news I recently wrote to you about the defeat of the king at Saint-Quentin is being confirmed more and more every day. I have no certain news about the colloquy at Worms.</p>
      <p>From that defeat, the papists across Germany are raising their crests, not because they believe the gospel will be promoted by the French, but because they promise themselves that Philip will turn all his forces to the defense of the papacy with their strength broken. But they must fail as they have so far; He lives, who has conquered.</p>
      <p>Behold, I send you my Hundred Sermons published on the Apocalypse. However, I leave it to your discretion whether you keep them in your hands and possession and thus share them with Mr. Philip and friends, or deposit them in the library of your church, so that all who wish may use this work. You can also present the German booklet of Mr. Johannes Anastasius Geldri [i.e., Veluanus], who calls himself Adam Christian, to the consuls and to whomever you wish, and now farewell forever along with your wife, children, your household, the consuls, Mr. Philip, Mr. Pontasella, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 2, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, his most esteemed and beloved co-father and brother.</p>
      <p>To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
