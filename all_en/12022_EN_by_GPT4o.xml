      <p>Our friendly service and all the best beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear sir, as our previous preacher, Mr. Balthasar Ös, has passed away, and in dealing with his left inheritance, there was hope that the benefice interest register would be found; but if not, and since we absolutely consider that no one is better suited to inform us than you, about what the annual interest and income of the benefice are, etc., because you also had the predecessors to rely on, therefore we kindly request and ask you to please do us the favor of informing us as thoroughly as possible about what, how much, and also where and on whom the mentioned preacher, his income, interest, and yield, etc., as you still have it in your possession, and then kindly report to us everything you still know about this in a register or list, and thus prove yourself in this matter as our good trust in you stands. If we can then favorably repay and deserve this from you, we will show ourselves completely willing, and besides that, you can also expect all good things from us. With that, God be with you. Dated Saturday before Felicis and Regula in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Mayor and Council of Bremgarten.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the city of Zurich, our especially dear sir.</p>
