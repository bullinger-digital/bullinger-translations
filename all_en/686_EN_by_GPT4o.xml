      <p>I received what you wrote through our Hieronymus, and I wish that we might someday hear more pleasant news both from England and from other kingdoms of the Christian world, so that the empires of monarchs, who recognize the Prince of Peace, may not be so bloody. Buttler has not yet given anything of the history he has compiled; I returned the letters of Frisius through Hieronymus, who recently set out for Winterthur, where he also affirmed that Johannes Wolphius would come. You will hear in good faith from this my Funcklius, whom I diligently recommended to you in my last letters, what is being spread among us; I truly wish that this recommendation still holds much weight with you. I know the young man is worthy, to whom all good people should give their support, and he is very suitable for tending to Christ's sheep, as, if anyone else, such great faith, diligence, zeal, and sound solid doctrine have shone forth in him from the very beginning of his ministry, where I nevertheless wish judgment to be made not from my testimony, but from the matter itself. But it is not necessary to say more about this to you, whom I know will neglect nothing of duty or kindness here, even for my sake. I sent Schöner's letter, which he addressed to his brother, the day before yesterday to Augsburg along with some other letters. I greatly grieve for the plight of the most afflicted old man; may the Lord have mercy on him and all who sigh under the high cross. Pray for us to the Lord, who may enrich you and your household with His most abundant blessing perpetually and keep you strong in body and spirit. Greet the friends and brothers, especially the fellow ministers. You will diligently greet Buttler, an excellent man and my very dear friend, above others. Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, and love us steadfastly.</p>
      <p>Unless the Lord decides otherwise, I will winter in Winterthur, although there are not a few things that keep me here; yet more things both advise and persuade me to move. May the Lord, by His gracious will, prosper what I attempt out of fear of Him. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, September 25. My wife and my excellent sister send many greetings to you and your wife and uniquely wish to be participants in the most fervent prayers to Christ.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Let me know sometime how our Gervasius is doing there, what he is doing, and what he hopes for. Greet the man diligently with my words. I hear that his wife was taken from him at a very inopportune time; but truly, he should seem to us mature for death, to whom the Lord takes away this truly shadowy life and, on the contrary, grants eternal and heavenly life. Moreover, may Christ console the widower himself with the companionship of His most prudent spirit and always cheer him with the conscience of righteousness. Delays have now been imposed on Funcklius, preventing him from embarking on the journey he recently intended; but he will nevertheless set out soon. However, I wanted to send these to you nonetheless, as I had a messenger of good faith.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother. In Zürich.</p>
