      <p>Greetings. I send you, dear brother, poorly composed laws.</p>
      <p>It is surprising that a learned man and the envoy of such a great king speaks so childishly and ineptly about the greatest matter of all. But perhaps the Lord wills it so; they might seem quite elegant, if only they were covered in gold. Sulcerus of Basel asked me for my opinion on this treaty; you will see what I replied from the enclosed paper, which you will return to me safely with the next messenger, nor do I feel or can feel otherwise yet.</p>
      <p>I know things are different with you; for even if you expose yourself greatly, you will do so in vain. Therefore, I would not want to be the author of the treaty; I would advise that they imitate the example of the elders, who shunned the treaties and gifts of princes; but since this seems to be said in vain, you should not conceal what seems right to you.</p>
      <p>But if they absolutely want to make a treaty, let them see that nothing is against religion; and also, as much as possible, urge the king to protect the evangelical religion, etc.</p>
      <p>You know better what can be obtained from them here, and what cannot. Urge them to make a treaty for the salvation of the gospel and the fatherland.</p>
      <p>The envoy is a learned man; I have discussed a few things with him; but still, he is the envoy of a foreign king.</p>
      <p>"Whose bread I eat, his song I sing"; you recognize the proverb. Therefore, I think one should deal cautiously with such people.</p>
      <p>If it is possible in any way, return Dr. Erastus's letters within eight days; for I am expecting a messenger daily, through whom I will respond to him. The French have also presented to the 13 places in Baden and requested to renew the agreement; they have received no answer, but the matter has been postponed to be brought back to their lords.</p>
      <p>H. Hans Jentzer, preacher in Eriswil, fought with a Lucerne peasant last autumn. This was judged by the Bernese, but the preacher was told to beware of the Lucerne people. Over this, he went to Lucerne territory, put on his armor again, and when he uttered some words, he was seized there in justice, promised, and released to go home; yet he was told not to understand it; it did not help.</p>
      <p>In the trial, it was found that he was taken to Lucerne; the Bernese demanded a breach. The Lucerne people wrote many wild articles, which he admitted to having spoken, partly political, partly ecclesiastical.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, the Bernese sent J. Bat Ludwig von MÃ¼linen to Lucerne to handle the matter. What has been handled now, I do not know, etc.</p>
      <p>The Glarus people now have a new dispute with Schwyz; they did not want their newly elected bailiff, Luchsinger, to proceed into the Gaster Valley; for he is not of the old faith.</p>
      <p>It is written that Cardinal Morone is sent to the emperor to receive the council and execute it, soldiers are being enlisted in the Milanese countryside and sent through the Alps to Feldkirch.</p>
      <p>I think it's nonsense; if you have any certainty, let me know. Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>May the fellow ministers, the councilors, and good men be safe. May 12, 1564. Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother and compatriot. Chur.</p>
