    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends the booklet of a well-known theologian [Kaspar Schwenckfeld?] to Bullinger, because he is reputed for his great steadfastness in faith, while among theologians almost everything else is prejudicially condemned; asks for a judgment as well as for the sending of his own writings. Greetings to Leo Jud.</p>

      <p>Christian, highly learned, honorable, dear sir, since a very learned, renowned man, whom I only desire to know through others' reports, has sent a small booklet - not that I can measure much or even anything in it myself - and now almost everything is directed towards the fact that the majority and almost all matters among the learned are judged with partiality or envy - God willing, this will not be found among those named evangelical -, and since you have been much more steadfast in matters of faith and are praised by all, I have been moved to send this to you with a friendly request that you may look into it, without hindering your other necessary matters of God, and be moved by your good judgment to conclude what good can be derived from it, not to take my unknown request amiss, but to bear with my ignorant desire and inform me of this, and also of anything else that always brings improvement, with your writings.</p>
      <p>And please convey my willing service to Leo Jud, to whom I am heartily inclined to share my best efforts with you.</p>
      <p>Dated the 20th day of October in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Hans Konrad Thumb, hereditary marshal.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, highly learned, and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, evangelical preacher and priest of the praiseworthy city of Zurich, my especially dear lord and good friend.</p>
