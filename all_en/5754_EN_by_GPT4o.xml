      <p>I have read, my father, what you recently wrote to our Calvin, and for your truly paternal concern for me, I am and will be very grateful to you and the other brothers as long as I live. As for the French affairs, in what state they were when I left there, I wrote to you most copiously immediately after my return. I entrusted the letters to a certain coachman of yours and also carefully recommended them with an added fee, and therefore I assume they have finally been delivered to you. What is now being reported to us is not so joyful, namely that Amiral is staying at home under the protection of his people against the avengers of the Guise massacre. Our prince and Andelot are indeed at court, but what they are planning, I neither know nor can I guess. The Helvetian garrison having been admitted to Orléans, they begin to be treated most unjustly by the prefect of the province; in many places, the brothers are not admitted. I wish the people of Lyon are not soon forced into the most unjust conditions! And we attribute all these things to those who most foolishly thought that those who should have been dealt with with utmost severity could be appeased with flattery. Yet I see the churches being restored daily, and certainly, whether he wants to or not, the Antichrist will soon, I think, be overthrown. What you write about their κρεαξαγςν attempt is true; but I trust they will achieve little, since not only has this evil been foreseen for a long time, but also a remedy has been prepared, and I know that all the churches will unanimously and most steadfastly reject the whole thing. However, I admit that there is a need for prayers, that he may free the churches so cruelly and for so long harassed by arms from internal dissensions. I hope we will soon receive much about this matter and many others, about which I will inform you. Our Calvin recently [...] had me and walks at home, but he is wonderfully exhausted. May the Lord look upon us all in him and avert from us that which could be nothing sadder for this church and many others, especially in these times. Farewell, my best and most esteemed father. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and sound for us and bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the fifth of June.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned brothers recently appointed as professors there, I pray for the most abundant increase of all blessings from the Lord, and I wish all the others to be greeted in my name as courteously as possible.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>I neither saw nor wanted to see Zanchus recently in Strasbourg. Two books of Ochino's Dialogues recently made in Latin and published in Basel offend many good and learned people, because they say that the arguments of the greatest heresies are clearly and plainly explained in them, which are refuted by no or certainly the weakest arguments. They also add that he indulges in curious and vain speculations in many places and often distorts passages of scripture. I barely glanced at the book. You, if it seems appropriate, will learn more fully what the matter is, so that offenses do not grow and that the reputation of your churches is considered. To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and father, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
