      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, a tumult has arisen in the Valtellina, such as Raetia has never seen or felt. The whole fan from Babylon, I say, has been stirred from its deepest roots.</p>
      <p>"What is this?" you will ask. Your Vergerius has entered with the preaching of the gospel. Some sheep of Christ listen gladly; but the devil could not bear it and summoned from the midst of Rome some shaven ones, who would mix and disturb everything. I stood firm in the tumult and can truly say: no one stood by me; thus everyone feared for themselves. Nevertheless, I stated the cause in the middle of the forum amidst the arms, and no one dared to lay a hand against me; but with their tongues, they acted with curses, execrations, and threats. In short: the Antichrist easily shows that he fears us, when he sees the valley next to Italy burning. If you could have seen, Heinrich Bullinger, how many thousands of men rushed and with what fury they were inflamed, you would have said: "It is over for my Vergerius." But the Lord did not abandon me. All the magistrates gathered and somewhat calmed the tumult. But it will rise again within 15 days; for some commissioners are coming here, who will hear the case. I have more to fear from some hidden rogue than from the whole people. I can enter the borders of the Venetians and the Emperor within three hours from this valley. What, you ask? The dangers of previous years were nothing, if you consider the present ones.</p>
      <p>The impious shout that in a few years, that is three, I have driven out the masses and the papacy from eight villages and will drive them out from the whole valley shortly, if I am not suppressed. I wanted you to know in what state my affairs are. I came to Chiavenna to deal with the brothers and see what should be done.</p>
      <p>The messenger who will deliver this letter to you was with me not indeed in the whole tumult, but in part; from him, therefore, you will learn much. I wish to know whether you are well, and indeed I am anxious about your health. We pray for you with these our churches.</p>
      <p>I bid the church, school, and family to be well. In Chiavenna, on Ash Wednesday (there you have a papist) 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
