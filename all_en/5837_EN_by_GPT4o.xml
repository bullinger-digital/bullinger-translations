      <p>S. I rejoice that you have been restored to us; for I was deeply grieved when I learned from my brother's recent letters that you were not in good health.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Mr. Musculus was also suffering here, so much so that I greatly feared for his life; but he too has been restored by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve both of you for us as long as possible! In the meantime, I received what you sent through Dumysius, and I thank you for them.</p>
      <p>I am also returning the same through him, as you requested, along with those letters you wrote to me about the Savoyard matter; I did not want to keep them, as I saw that they were so eagerly and repeatedly requested by you.</p>
      <p>You have reasons that are not to be despised; however, we fear that what you most desire, namely a constant and perpetual peace, may not be obtained.</p>
      <p>Many good men fear that whatever is done will lead to the suppression of the Genevans, and they themselves sense this; therefore, as far as I understand, they abhor that pacification.</p>
      <p>I do not yet know what the envoys here are going to achieve.</p>
      <p>The day before yesterday they were heard by the senate, and yesterday by the dioceses; but they received no other response than what they had previously received at Baden.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they requested to be heard again today.</p>
      <p>What that is or what should be answered, I do not yet know.</p>
      <p>The citizens are very much at odds with each other, and I fear disturbances among us, which the Lord may graciously avert.</p>
      <p>A certain song, not without wit, was found by the consul himself these days, written against those peacemakers; it greatly disturbed the senate; however, the author cannot be found.</p>
      <p>As for Sulcer's business, I have not been able to discuss it with our people these days due to the presence of those envoys; however, I have discussed it with Mr. Dumysius; he will act with our people.</p>
      <p>I was grieved that he was summoned to the senate; for he seemed to have satisfied most people.</p>
      <p>Now I see that this was good, as he was thus caught in a lie, and I do not doubt that our people will be very reluctant to bear this and will agree to send letters to the people of Basel.</p>
      <p>Would that he could be removed from there and the church of Basel be purged of this leaven! Various reports are coming from France.</p>
      <p>Someone recently returned from Lyon said that the English, having made peace, had left Normandy; now it is reported that they are proceeding bravely and inflicting many defeats on the French.</p>
      <p>Thus, nothing is certain to me here.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you in return, Treasurer Haller, Musculus, my father-in-law, brothers, and all fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to all of yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 14, 1563.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
