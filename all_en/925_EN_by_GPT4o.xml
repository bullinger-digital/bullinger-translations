      <p>Greetings and Peace. Since I know you are greatly desirous of learning about our affairs, I did not want to be idle, but rather a diligent writer to your kindness, so that you may know what is happening here as well as if you were present. I would not undertake this task if Mr. Hooper had the time to write; for he could provide more and more certain information. I only write what I know and hold to be certain. Regarding the six warships I mentioned in my last letter dated May 28, I understand there is no danger.</p>
      <p>The Lord of Châtillon, the French envoy, departed on the day before the calends of June after confirming peace. Mr. Hooper obtained everything he wanted from the king's counselors; he went to his homeland, intending to return within ten days and shortly thereafter to depart for his bishopric. He is expected to meet (as he thinks) Mr. Johannes Utenhovius. I will remain in London for the ministry of the word in the Flemish church, which Mr. Johannes a Lasco is arranging to establish here. I am not yet certain whether such a church can be established; however, there is great hope. If I am appointed minister to that church, it will not be permissible to leave here with Mr. Hooper with a good conscience. May God do what He wills, provided that I serve His glory. Joanna, the maid of Lady Hooper, married a French preacher, a good and learned man, on the day after the calends of June; I wish them all happiness. Also, the marriage was celebrated on the 3rd of this month between the daughter of the Duke of Somerset and the son of the Earl of Warwick, which the king himself attended. This matter, I hope, will wonderfully unite and reconcile the minds of the nobles. Mr. Johannes Utenhovius, a man distinguished in piety and lineage, wished to be especially commended to you through me. Farewell, most illustrious man, and I ask that you greet all pious men in our name.</p>
      <p>I almost forgot what I wanted to write first, that Mr. Johannes a Lasco will soon be going to Bucer in Cambridge for the sake of a discussion. I pray to God that some pious reconciliation of the dissenting places may be found. London, June 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
