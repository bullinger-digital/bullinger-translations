      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>These young men, pious and learned, were listeners and disciples of the late Philipp Melanchthon of blessed memory.</p>
      <p>One of them, Titus Amicinus by name, is from Kronstadt in Transylvania, while the other, Johannes Ferinarius, is from Neisse in Silesia. They left Wittenberg while Philipp was still alive and, having traveled through the Netherlands, explored France, from which they now come to these regions to visit our churches. They hold pious and good opinions about our churches and their doctrine, having been instructed by their teacher, as they themselves proclaim.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that you will receive them liberally and honorably, as is your custom. We also have provided them with what we could.</p>
      <p>They have with them a printed history of the French tumult, which, if you have not seen it before, they will gladly share with you. I have nothing else to write.</p>
      <p>We await what our people will bring from the Baden assemblies. Lord Wurstenberger greatly praises your liberality and honor.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of the plans being devised by the adversaries; but He who guards His own does not slumber; to Him be praise forever! May the Lord continue to scatter the plans of Ahithophel, which He will do. Farewell with all your people, to whom, along with all the brothers and fellow ministers, you will convey greetings in my name. Bern, July 7, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your perpetual [Johannes] Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and compatriot, to be perpetually esteemed.</p>
