    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's treatise on predestination, which Thomas [Blarer] has already commented on during two meetings with Bullinger, is also appreciated by the Zwick brothers. However, the word "moderation" should be replaced with "judgment of the scripture." Furthermore, it must be emphasized that God is free in his election of grace and yet not unjust, as can be shown in the cases of Jacob and Esau, the rejection of Judas prophesied by David, the fall of man, and the example of an arbitrary pardon; despite the risk of causing offense, this must be upheld, as Zwick also indicates in his preface to the New Testament. He points out a misleading passage and wishes for clearer statements on the issue of theological conventions, as the conditions have changed. Bullinger and Pellikan are to examine, alter, or even burn his preface to the New Testament; since the joint spa stay, they are aware of his ignorance. He has heard from Erasmus Schmid about the planned defense against Lutheran slanders and, like Thomas [Blarer], comments on it: A conciliatory presentation of faith would be desirable, while a convention is to be discouraged; the Pope may be attacked without concern. Ambrosius [Blarer] writes that mutual tolerance has been agreed upon with Schwenckfeld; he can only agree to the reorganization of ceremonies [in WÃ¼rttemberg] with reservations. Simprecht [Schenck] has been called to Strasbourg by Bucer to better prepare for his task; Zwick's assumptions were unfounded. [Konrad Zwick] is not coming to Zurich, as he is going to a spa treatment. Greetings. Thanks for the dedication preface [No. 604].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I respond late and briefly to the assertion on predestination. Since Thomas, my cousin, has met with you twice, it would be redundant to repeat what he could have discussed with you in detail. Initially, the booklet is highly pleasing to Brother Konrad and me for two reasons: firstly, because there is nothing in it that anyone could attack - for everyone feels this way - and secondly, because you respond to the slanderers and their objections in such a way that we do not see how you could not satisfy anyone. However, there are one or two things we advise you on:</p>
      <p>First, that you refrain from using the term "moderation," and instead, if you please, use "judgment of the scripture," as Thomas also diligently advised you. You know the reason: "You understood moderation," you say at the end, but perhaps better in our judgment: "You understood what the scripture says about predestination," etc. Otherwise, everything will only (nothing but) agree, and everywhere one wants to find a middle ground so that one can remain one with everyone.</p>
      <p>Secondly, that you firmly establish this doctrine of predestination and election in the most holy manner, which you indeed do, even though many abuse this firm and salutary doctrine. Although it is true that God is not unjust, even if he had not chosen a single person, it is also true that all who are chosen are chosen by grace alone and by the will of God, from which it follows that all who are not chosen are not chosen due to God's indignation and hatred. For it is solely up to God to choose or pass over someone. This doctrine, even if it offends the wicked, is true according to the saying: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" [Mal 1:2f; Rom 9:13], and it is not enough if someone says - as is commonly said - that the Lord knew what Esau would be like; for there is no doubt about God's omniscience. Meanwhile, dear brother, tell me, could not the Lord have made this Esau different, could he not have chosen him, just as he chose me, which I am absolutely certain of? For he did not choose me because he knew I would believe the gospel, but because he loved me. "Judas perished, that the scripture might be fulfilled," says Luke. We accept this so that God's ordination is satisfied, who also hated Judas. David indeed predicted that Judas would lift his heel against Christ. But could not David also be asked why Judas would do this? For at that time no one could have answered, namely, that the scripture might be fulfilled, since the Holy Spirit first revealed this to David. Therefore, he lifted his heel and perished indeed by his own wickedness and fault. And yet the Lord could have made him different if he had wanted to. Why then did he perish? Because the Lord did not have mercy on him, yet it does not follow that God is unjust in this regard to anyone who perishes. For all perish by their own fault. But we understand that all our salvation depends solely on God's will, and we should not deviate from this firm doctrine for anyone's favor. We would say the same about the sin of the first parents: They sinned indeed by their own fault, but God had turned his face away from them, who, as he knew they would sin, could also have prevented them from sinning. And we too are sinners by the fault of the first parents. Therefore, we do not cease to sin, and we are certainly sinners because God did not receive us. Thus we believe because God chose us, we do not believe because he rejected us. By what power he gives faith to some of the elect so that they may be saved, he could give faith to all the impious, unless he cannot do everything. But that he gives faith to a few is not injustice, nor does it follow: God did not choose me, therefore he is unjust. When two thieves are led out with another, and one is cut down from the gallows by the executioner, the other cannot say that he is wronged because he is not also cut down. But that this one is cut down is pure grace, and one can also say to the other: "Friend, I do you no wrong" [Mt 20:13]. Hence, we believe it is most advisable to freely confess that our salvation comes from nowhere else than from God's mercy and gratuitous election. By this assertion, God is not overcome by injustice, but his eternal benevolence towards his own is commended. If there are those who are offended, it is better that they are offended than that anything should be taken away from the truth. I have mentioned a few things about this in the preface to the New Testament, although your assertion on predestination gave me no occasion. But you will find many who think that certain paradoxes should have been treated from the beginning of the gospel in a completely different way, namely about free will, about Moses, about good works, about abrogated ceremonies, about the head of the church, and things of this kind. And if one did not do right at the beginning, one should now start doing right in all things. But I would like to see how well it will be done and what improvement will follow.</p>
      <p>In the conclusion of your assertion, you have: "Not so much grace," etc., but you would say more openly and simply: "I exhort you to be as sincere as possible," etc., "that we do not attribute salvation so much to grace, but to the pursuit of piety according to the most salutary precepts," etc.</p>
      <p>Likewise, at the beginning, you have something about the assembly of brothers and the sacred gathering, but you do not add for what reasons they should meet, nor are you unaware of what the present times demand. A decade ago, meetings were held with great benefit, as this was the only thing on the lips of our people: "To the law and to the testimony." But now some, indeed many, are deviating from this sacred oracle to say: "To the fathers, to the fathers," not to mention that there are many who, being powerful in authority and well-equipped to establish their own, also act as rulers, and you are not unaware of how unfortunately many of the most learned and pious assemblies have fallen. Now forgive us for teaching you, from whom we should rather be taught.</p>
      <p>I send you the preface to the New Testament with the dearest father Pellican, giving you the power not only to correct, change, add, or diminish, but to burn it entirely. For I did not write it willingly, but under compulsion, nor am I suitable for these studies. It rested with me for a whole month, but nothing better is now sent. I therefore adjure you by faith and charity not to add it to the edition unless it pleases you greatly. Once, indeed more than once, I have betrayed my ignorance to you in the baths, and from my letters, you always understand my stupidity, so I cannot sufficiently marvel why you wanted me to preface the New Testament, when otherwise such eloquent prefaces are at hand. Therefore, again and again, I implore you by all that is sacred to dissolve into ashes whatever I have written in this preface, unless you can swear by the name of the Lord that it is worthy of the light, for in my judgment it is not. I lament that you do not bring me to shame and perhaps the noble, holy testament with me, and see that the testament does not suffer ill because of my name. The judgment and fault be with you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Erasmus Fabritius was with us these days, telling us what you have in mind to wipe away the slanders of some Lutherans in particular. To whom I replied the same as Thomas, my cousin, to you: Would that a simple, clear, and true account of the Christian faith and religion were described by you without any mention of slanders or slanderers, ignoring all injuries. Perhaps there would be those who would go to your description with hands and feet, especially in this clever and dangerous age, when the articles of religion are treated in such a way that neither the simple understand nor will it be for the benefit of the truth. I completely dissuade a convention, and not only by my own, but by the advice of some good people. You could treat the Pope as he deserves. By this, you offend no good person and will increase the hatred against him, which I wish were deepest in the minds of all. You could add among other things how you recognize as brothers anyone who does not reject you, etc. But all this from Thomas in person. Oh, many more glorious points could be handled in such a writing, such as about church discipline, about the usefulness of ceremonies - that is, that they are not useful -, about the jurisdiction of the church, etc.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius writes that there is agreement with Schwenckfeld to the extent that he should not hinder the course of the gospel and the ministry of our people, and we in turn should tolerate him until he can join us. Likewise, a plan for ceremonies has been established in the duke's domain, in which, however, the good man Ambrosius desires some things and would like some things changed. "However, they are such," he says, "that, as far as I judge, I do not see any tragedies to be stirred up from this." Would that he could have, as he wished, won the votes of all. But the Lord must be prayed to, that he does not tempt us beyond our strength.</p>
      <p>Sympertus writes the reason why he was called by Bucer. For he had decided, but almost a year ago, to cease from the office of the word, because he thought he did not have enough resources for this task. Therefore, he is now acting in Strasbourg to be strengthened in faith, so that he does not withdraw his hand once put to the plow. Therefore, my dreams are nothing, about which I recently wrote to you.</p>
      <p>I had given you hope of my brother's visit to you, but in vain; for he is now setting out for the baths. He greets you most dutifully.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the dearest brothers, especially Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Utinger, Stainer, and the rest. Above all, forgive the most uncultivated writing.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, July 27, 1535.</p>
      <p>I almost forgot: We thank you for the dedication made to us, although you could have dedicated it to our church or senate with greater benefit.</p>
      <p>But we understand how much you love us, unless you now expect some angels or crowns.</p>
      <p>But again, farewell, and may Christ keep you safe.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurich church, his dearest brother by far.</p>
