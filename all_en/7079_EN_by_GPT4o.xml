      <p>By the grace of God, Friedrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Archduke and Elector, etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, honorable and dear friend. Your explanation of the prophet Isaiah has been duly presented to us. We express our most gracious thanks to you for this pleasing gift. We intend to read it at the earliest opportunity with great interest and will always hold you in gracious regard. We hereby wish you long-lasting health and strength from dear God, so that you may continue to serve His church with teaching and writing in these troubled times, when His divine truth is fiercely attacked and falsified by Satan, for a long time to come, etc.</p>
