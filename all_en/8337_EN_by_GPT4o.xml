      <p>The grace of God be with you all. Amen. I am in great need of it; for little has improved around me, etc.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your service, I am sorry about your deceased wine; also, I miss my mountain, etc. Yesterday, after the evening bell, Master Hans Ziegler came to me along with the bailiff; Ziegler said that his father had departed from this world with the same illness (but after a long time).</p>
      <p>May the will of God be done with me. Pray to God for me. From now on, I do not wish to take such costly medicine from the apothecary. I will ask God for a doctor. I would like to write more to you; it is not within my ability.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet the family, whom I earnestly ask to pray to God for me, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>To my faithful and dear brother Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The very last letter around the beginning of August written by my brother, who died on August 15 around 3 in the afternoon in Kappel 1570.</p>
