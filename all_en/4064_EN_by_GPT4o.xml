      <p>S. Our beloved Johannes Faber sends to me, asking that I write to your kindness in both his name and mine; for he is entirely unable to do so, as his wife gave birth last night very quickly and with great pain to a little daughter, who did not live long after birth. We have received the letters of your kindness along with the most precious gift, namely your sermons on Jeremiah. You cover your good deeds with good deeds, as he said, so that they do not rain through; but we can do nothing but give the greatest thanks. For we know that we must eventually repay.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the most notable things we have are these: Italy will feel famine this year. We hear from the royal envoy here that the Roman pontiff is dead.</p>
      <p>There is enough wine in Valtellina, less here with us. The mountainous and forested areas of our confederates are quite abundant in grain, nowhere is there a supply of hay, many younger cattle are indeed bought here to be taken to Italy, and first of all: the evangelical cause among us in the Confederation is in a worse state than it was some years ago; I cannot extol it with greater praises.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you and the other pious and learned men there for a very long time in safety. Farewell, most humane man, and do not cease to love Philipp, your old friend.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 28th of August, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours in all kindness, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good men.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
