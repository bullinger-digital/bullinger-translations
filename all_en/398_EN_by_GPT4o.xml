      <p>Grace from God above all! Dear godfather, I am sending you herewith some sermons by Blaurer, which Curio secretly provided to me, in which you will clearly see what is in him. Calvin seems to write more tolerably than he preaches here; for having read these, I am so disturbed that I do not wish him to be associated with me here if he continues to insist on these expressions, indeed even doctrines. These are intolerable for our church. As soon as you have read them, return them, so that Curio does not find out that I sent them to you. But if Blaurer suspects me, as if the matter came from me to Wolphius or others, I say before God with a clear conscience that I have not given any indication to anyone; indeed, it has never come from my mouth; only when I was asked by Curio, who had it from Peter in Aarburg, that it was somewhat tense, I completely denied and dissimulated it.</p>
      <p>None of my brothers know a word about it except Artopaeus, also from Peter in Aarburg. I would myself prefer it to be quieter, if he were different than he unfortunately is; for once it is publicly set, I know well how it goes. I would just like us to soon know a definite decision from him, so that we can deal with Musculus' matter. I would like to know what you have written to him about this and he to you; for with me, he dissimulates everything excellently.</p>
      <p>I fear the Lausanne matter will come up again; for now, there is someone here who complains that Viretus does not want to let him communicate at Christmas, solely because he spread their conclusions here.</p>
      <p>Calvin has written against the Interim again; I assume you have a copy. We sent a messenger to Augsburg last week to Xystus, so that we know where we stand.</p>
      <p>Apiarius gives great thanks for your copy of the Vocabulary; he will also try to return thanks. If you want more copies, he will send them. I will also return your [Greek]. I will soon send your letters to Blaurer along with his response; I have copied most of it. Tomorrow morning I have to preach; I found this message late, so I cannot complete the rest tonight. I would like you to write to me about the synod, when, how, and by what means and what is being done, both in the German and the French. I fear nothing will come of it now in Zurich, as they are just starting to get at each other; I am concerned that even our people will exceed all measure and reason; they are too harsh towards anyone even slightly suspect. May God direct everything to His glory and the tranquility of this church, which, if it has to contend again, will be completely dissolved. It will be your duty to diligently pray for us, that God may direct our efforts with His Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord forever. Greet from me and my wife and children your wife and all your family. May all the brothers Pellicanus, Theodorus, Gualtherus, Musculus, etc., be well.</p>
      <p>Hastily, January 8, after dinner, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and dearest godfather. Zurich.</p>
