      <p>Peace and grace and the increase of faith through the Lord Jesus, Hieronymus Carraria prays to Heinrich Bullinger. No occasion, esteemed Heinrich, prompted me to write to you. But when the grave and pious and learned Augustin Mainard, minister of the church of Chur from the brothers of the Rhaetians, sent me his letters on the fourteenth of May concerning a not insignificant matter, he imposed upon me that if I were to respond to such a matter, I should ensure that my letters be directed to you, so that for your familiarity with him, you might faithfully commend them to either D. Comander or Blasius, ministers of the church of Chur, on his behalf. Therefore, it seemed not rash to commend my letters in the name of another, whom I consider both familiar and dear to you. It is not necessary, therefore, to promote your dutiful kindness with many words, since you can be more eager to gratify such a man than I might think. Farewell, my esteemed Heinrich, in the Lord Jesus, whom I earnestly pray, that He may strengthen you more and more as a most valiant defender of evangelical truth against its adversaries, and preserve you in long life, whom I implore in prayer with the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Martiliasi on the 15th of June, 1549. Hieronymus Carraria of Turin from the brothers of the class of Tonon, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious in both piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and sincere pastor of the church of Zürich, our esteemed one. Zürich.</p>
