      <p> Greetings. It certainly cannot be said, most illustrious man, how much I personally confess and acknowledge from the heart that I owe to you, both because of that singular benevolence and almost incredible kindness with which you have always treated me, and especially because of this rare and unheard-of inclination of your spirit towards me, by which you embrace a little man placed far below mediocrity, so that I cannot sufficiently marvel, and you remember your Charles so much that you have finally honored me with that honor which I neither dared to hope for nor to aspire to. For what greater or more excellent thing could happen to me than to be so highly esteemed by you, that you took care to send your truly divine sermons on the Apocalypse of John to me, which I might offer to all foreigners and exiles dedicated and inscribed to the French and Italian church in your name? Indeed, you could impose nothing more pleasing, nor which I would more willingly undertake. Therefore, I offered your truly golden book along with the common letters, as you wished. </p>
      <p> How truly pleasing both gifts were to the French and Italians, at least they will testify with their letters and acknowledge that pledge of your love towards them, since it is not permitted in any other way. But this one thing I can certainly affirm, that there is no one here who does not confess to owe you much, even for that reason, and gives the greatest thanks. Now it remains for me to excuse in a few words why I could not respond to you earlier. </p>
      <p> And first, indeed, when your letters were delivered to Mr. Calvin along with the book you sent, I was not in the city, as you understood from my dearest brother Budeus. When I returned five days later and received them, I took care that some of our people knew that this gift of yours was with me, and they read your letters. Finally, because it was scarcely possible to recite them to each one, Mr. Calvin, when he had finished his lecture, explained how much honor you had conferred, dedicating your commentaries to all foreigners, and how much they are perpetually obliged to you. However, from that time, no one appeared to whom I could give letters to you, although I greatly desired it. For I was annoyed that the response was delayed for so long. </p>
      <p> But because you had decided from the beginning to inscribe your sermons to me, Budeus, Badius, and Normand, we are far more obliged to you than all our other brothers. Therefore, both in my name and in theirs, I give the greatest thanks I can, and I profess that we owe you much more than we can ever repay. </p>
      <p> I greeted by name Mr. Marchion of Vico, and those you wished in your letters. </p>
      <p> They respectfully greet you and all your fellow ministers, which I also do from the heart. Since I know that Mr. Calvin will write to you, if there is anything new, I will add nothing here. I only humbly pray to the Lord to always protect you, keep you safe for a long time for His church, and enrich you more and more with His blessings! Geneva, on the Nones of October 1557. </p>
      <p> Charles de Jonvilliers, most obliged to you. To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich. </p>
