      <p>Greetings. If it seems so, send the young man; for it should not be denied to you, such a great man and friend, when you first request an honorable matter from me. There is no need for you to be concerned about the price. The others pay thirty. I wish the times were such that the most generous services could be provided freely! But enough about that. For the rest, I implore you, if there is anything pertaining to piety that you think concerns me, do not hesitate to write to me about it. For I see your diligence in this matter indeed.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give my most diligent greetings to Leon, a man very dear to me, and also to our dear Theodor.</p>
      <p>Yours, Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest friend and brother.</p>
