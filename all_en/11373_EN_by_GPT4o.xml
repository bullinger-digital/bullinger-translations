    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns the [Six] Articles of the English King [Henry VIII]; fortunately, his power is limited to England. Is very busy, as the new school is unexpectedly thriving and is attended by the sons of noble families from all over the Grisons. There is peace in the land, except for the arrest and execution of some robbers, about which Gotthard [Richmut] can report more. In Lake Como, six houses have disappeared without a trace. Sends a letter from [Johannes] Travers and offers himself as a letter carrier, as he hosts boys related to Travers from Zuoz. Greetings to Zurich scholars.</p>

      <p>Nikolaus Artopoeus Balingius to Heinrich Bullinger, a most distinguished man, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Behold, I send back the articles of the King of England, which, thanks be to the Lord, do not greatly disturb us here; everyone says what you say with the scripture: "Do not put your trust in princes," etc. In my judgment, that king is the King of England and nothing else, whatever persona he may assume. I would like to discuss more with you, but my duties do not allow it. Believe me, I have never been busier; the beginning of our school is so fervent and favorable even to those whom I thought would find it abominable. From all the Confederations they flock here, and what amazes us is the sons of the magnates and nobles. May the best and greatest make it proceed always under such favorable auspices. So much for that. As for our entire republic: we are conducting ourselves quite peacefully, except that robbers are causing us trouble, many of whom have been captured, many punished, and many, as they say, still remain hidden and unknown, as you will clearly learn from Gotthard if you have time. If I had time, I would certainly write wonderful things, which seem to portend something to me; the Lord knows. At Lake Como, they say six houses have suddenly sunk and been covered by waters, of which now no trace remains, nor do any remnants appear anywhere. It was searched for a long time with machines and anchors, but in vain. I send a letter from our Travers. If you respond to it, send it to me; I will easily pass it on to him. I am hosting some boys from Zuoz related to Travers. Farewell, most learned man, and kindly consider this unlearned letter. Greet Leo, Bibliander, Megander, Ammianus, and Rhellicanus in my name. Chur, November 18.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man conspicuous for both learning and prudence.</p>
