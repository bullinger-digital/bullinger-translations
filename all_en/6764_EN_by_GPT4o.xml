      <p>S. I am sending this letter back to you for the sole reason that I have not been able to find any reliable messengers for a long time; therefore, please forgive me. Furthermore, I give you my greatest thanks for all these things and pray to the Lord that He may preserve us and all these churches in the truth of this most sincere doctrine. We hear daily from many how much the people of Basel have separated themselves from us; it is now apparent what they have long been harboring; indeed, Sulcerus openly admits in his recent letters to me that they disagree with us, whose words I send transcribed to my brother; he will share them with you. I truly ask for your advice on these matters.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new, except that it was written some time ago to Mr. Steiger that the French have occupied the port of Savona in Liguria, not far from Genoa, through the efforts of Pietro Corsi. This very thing was written in recent days to Mr. Petermann von Erlach; if there is anything, I do not doubt that you have more certain information. Steiger's letters also mentioned that the Pope is besieged in the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome; but by whom, it was not stated. There are new disturbances in Lyon, stirred up by the Jesuits; for they are demanding that churches be given to them as well, to expel ours from theirs.</p>
      <p>The new royal envoy was here recently and strongly urged us to accept the common alliance. Therefore, some are beginning to raise their crests again, wishing for all discipline to be abolished, among whom are some of the more powerful; Beza incites them with his writings, and they rely heavily on his authority, whom they otherwise hate worse than a dog or a snake, so I fear, whatever we say, that they will eventually break through. They think that with this alliance alone, the king, we, and the common cause of the Gospel can be served; yet by the grace of the Lord, no agreement has been reached so far. The king wants us to seal, as the other Confederates have sealed; what ours are still reserving, he will neither give letter nor seal, but only say by word of mouth. We must see that they intend to deceive us; they care for nothing but to misuse us and our children and make us their servants; they are cunning towards us and seduce us with their gold. It is all about doing the Chrysostom, if it is prolonged. May God protect us faithfully. Amen.</p>
      <p>What will your consul in Augsburg do with his company of Confederates? Steiger has been re-elected as consul among us, and his relative Willadingus is the pandareta or vennerus. We are waiting to hear what news you have received from England or elsewhere from these fairs; we pray that you share it with us.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you many greetings, especially Steiger. Bern, April 25, 1566.</p>
      <p>My Blasius also sends you his warmest greetings, who was here with me these days. You have written to me several times about the German history of Galeatius Capella; I have not been able to find any copy so far. Now one has been brought to me from Basel; so if you do not yet have one, write to me, and it will be yours. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual observance.</p>
