      <p>S. D. Indeed, I have been tormented for a long time by the uncertain rumor about the capture of Rouen, which I feared was too true, as happy news is almost always false, and unhappy news is usually certain. Now, however, I am almost undone by the true and cruel account of the more than Scythian brutality exercised in occupied Rouen and of our best brother Marlorat being hanged outside the temple. O Lord, how long? Now a new rumor miserably torments us; for we hear that Condé believes the flattery of the Guises offering peace, while the wisest think this is aimed at the destruction of the best Prince Condé and the ruin of all the faithful throughout France. I pray to the Lord to guide Condé and keep him from evil.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a rumor spread about a battle in which our side was victorious; soon the opposite is affirmed. I am forced to commit the matter to the Lord.</p>
      <p>For what you wrote through Liner, I give you the greatest thanks and I beg you, first of all, then our Ionville, never to stop writing. You can hardly believe how much we desire your letters and receive them with gratitude of heart. I am not in very good health now; however, I have long and diligently searched for what I have of your affairs; for I would wish nothing more than for you to respond to Stancaro. But, exhausted by diligent search, I found nothing else than what I am sending now.</p>
      <p>However, I beg you to return it; for I returned your shared writings long ago; then I took care to have these copied. I have nothing else nor do I know that you ever sent me anything about Stancaro's affairs. On November 24th, Maximilian was elected King of the Romans, crowned on the 29th of the same month. It is said that a Turkish delegation was sent there, boasting that the Emperor of the Turks would bring aid against the rebels of France. I am convinced that these things are concocted by the art of the Pope, the Emperor, the Duke of Ferrara, and the Duke of Lorraine. May the Lord scatter the plans of the impious and preserve those who call upon His name.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with Ionville and all good people. All of ours greet you; greet also the brothers and all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 31, 1562. I have not reread. May Trecius the Pole be safe.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
