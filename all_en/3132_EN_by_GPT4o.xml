      <p>S. D. When your letters, dearest brother and most esteemed lord, were recently brought here, I was not at home, but had left the city to visit my brother for two days. Upon my return, I found your letters and those of Mr. Fuchs. The person who brought them had already left; meanwhile, as no couriers were available, I finally decided to send these to Bern to be forwarded to you from there.</p>
      <p>But that growing discord between those two noble cities has troubled me for a long time. Many attempts have been made; but none have met with a successful outcome. Our people are very diligent and not long ago, in the month of January, after involving the people of Basel and Schaffhausen in the alliance, they sent letters to Bern, almost pleading for a friendly settlement to be allowed; but they refused. Yet our people are still working on this issue today. A courier from Zurich was sent to Geneva a few days ago, who has not yet returned. I see that their minds are so divided that, unless the Lord heals the afflicted matter with special grace, I do not see what men can achieve.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Lord must be earnestly prayed to, that He may inspire both parties with concord. Various reports are coming in about the Italian and Neapolitan war; since they are uncertain, I think we should wait for more reliable information. History bears witness that the French have very often entered Naples, yet have never enjoyed favorable fortune. If justice were done, but whatever may happen, the Pope will not cease to be the son of perdition. May the Lord curse him. I thank you for taking care of my brother-in-law, to whom you and your people wish well, and for reminding me to help with a service when possible. I say before God that I would have gladly done it long ago and have worked on it as much as I could; but it has not been possible.</p>
      <p>It is a great sorrow to me; but I can do no more. I have no hope here now, can do nothing, and there are so many people and known citizens that 20 are vying for one position, where only one is needed. Therefore, I have long called upon you and other good gentlemen to see if help could be found elsewhere; for I have learned and know thoroughly that I cannot and will not be able to place him here.</p>
      <p>If only he could be placed with the Margrave, whom he also served in his youth. But I have no acquaintance there, and can do little to help him myself. If only you had written to our brother Sulcer, who is well at court, that he might have done his best for him, or if you thought otherwise, that it would be good and beneficial for him. Farewell with all yours. Pray for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 19, 1557.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, most faithful minister of the church in Biel/Bienne, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Biel.</p>
