      <p>I will gladly read what you have responded to the theses of your Erastus; I would not want them to be published, I hope you are dealing with these matters in private writing; for I am deeply grieved, so that I do not hide from you what I truly feel, that the Lord's Supper, which has already been excessively battered by lengthy disputes and has become less pleasing to the people, is being dragged into a new controversy, and that which was instituted by the Lord for communion, fellowship, and consolation, finally for thanksgiving and the giving of thanks by the faithful, is now being drawn, for the sake of establishing discipline, towards excommunication, so to speak, towards separation and sad punishment, finally towards complaints and contention among the faithful. In my opinion, proper discipline can be established in the church, while the Lord's Supper remains free for all those who have examined themselves according to Paul's doctrine, and it should not be turned into a punishment, etc. And indeed, we hear with great concern that some in Heidelberg, whom you perhaps think to be better and more prudent than they are, are most importunately urging their disciplinary excommunication and pushing the excellent prince to impose it on everyone against their will, while the nobles, commoners, and plebeians bear this most indignantly, so that there is a danger that this matter may end in some tumult, when otherwise everything is already extremely ulcerated. And I wish we feared these things falsely. They murmur not without cause, that almost everything is administered through the Netherlanders or Belgians, foreign men, completely bypassing their own. Therefore, I beg and beseech you to act prudently in this matter and not to add oil to the fire, lest those who continually urge you, wanting to establish the purest church (lest I suspect anything else here), soon have none and regret having acted imprudently, bringing all good people into danger along with the excellent prince, and also causing the greatest scandal to the weak and the most insolent rejoicing of our enemies. Therefore, last month we wrote to the most illustrious prince, urging him to manage his affairs in this matter piously and prudently and not to give any occasion for new and most pernicious dissensions and contentions in the church, but rather to promote and preserve the peace of the churches and ministers with proper discipline established and the Lord's Supper left in free and thankful use. For I see now more than ever, if ever before, that we need holy moderation and firm concord, with all occasions of dissensions and contentions cut off. May the Lord guide you with His Spirit.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Beza, August 1, in the year 1569.</p>
