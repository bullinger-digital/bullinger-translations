      <p>S. Tell me, if you can at your leisure, what the German word "lekerli" means; for I very much need to know this, and I do not wish to know how insolent lawyers use it, but how the common people use it in legal matters. You may think I am joking; but I am seriously asking. Therefore, make sure that I have not asked in vain. After you have answered, I will explain what I mean by this request.</p>
      <p>Dryander the Spaniard has returned to us, bringing all good news, except that the king's protector has been captured; he promised to tell the reasons in the future. He left England on the fifth of November, which day you already know what evils preceded, devised and spread by the priests. They had begun to hope that religion would soon return to its former state. If Dryander tells the truth, those people have been found to be liars.</p>
      <p>He also reports on the death of Paul III; he proves that, while he was in Paris (for he came here through France) and a messenger arrived from Rome, the cardinals immediately flew in droves towards Rome. This is also reported about the Cardinal of Augsburg. But you have this confirmed from the treasurer whom we mention. If this is the case, what do you think will happen? I indeed see a change, but what, I do not see; yet I hope that Christ will someday look upon his church, especially since some visitors, who are sent by the bishops sent by Paul to Germany at the request of the Emperor, commit such horrendous acts. I will tell one thing that was written here: Through the Vosges Mountains, if I remember correctly, one of the visitors sent learned that a woman there had eaten meat on a day when it was not allowed by the pope. He examined her in the temple and, having discovered the matter, condemned her to receive certain blows on her bare skin; she was pregnant. Therefore, taken outside the temple and stripped, she suffered the blows severely, and after these, she was imposed three more days during which she was to eat bread and drink only water. She returned to the temple and, enduring through the night, was found dead with her child in the morning.</p>
      <p>I will add another: In Amsterdam, eight women gathered, among whom were three pregnant ones. They spoke about God, as was fitting for the pious; they were betrayed, captured, and condemned to the fire except for the pregnant ones; for they were kept until childbirth and similarly perished. Here is the reasoning of such a savior: a convicted person who does not recant is burned, one who recants is beheaded or strangled. You will consider the blindness of these people, whom God allows to use tyranny so severely against the good and pious. Sometimes God's long-suffering vexed me and that he grants so much happiness openly to the impious. But when I see such unfaithful blindness, I am completely silent and at rest; for I see that, even if he destroyed each one with a thousand deaths, this blindness is much more severe. For he who is struck in this way is struck with ignorance of God and thus with eternal death.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is pleasing to hear what you or anyone else, I believe, have never heard before. Close your ears, let your eyes only pass over what I will say: A certain papal legate (Giovanni della Casa) wrote in Italian against the heretics of Germany and among other things, on occasion, excuses the sin of Sodom and praises it, calling it a divine work. Vergerius told me this in the presence of Celio, as he wrote against this Sodomite, also in Italian, and when asked to translate it into Latin, he promised to comply. You see the blindness. Such people try to teach us the faith of Christ, and the Emperor helps them. You have enough of the abominations. Farewell in the Lord with your family and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 2, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
