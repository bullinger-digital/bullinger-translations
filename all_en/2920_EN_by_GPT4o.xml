      <p>Greetings. I received your last letter, most kind sir, on May 11th, in which you accuse me of negligence in replying, primarily because I have made you anxious and somewhat concerned and suspicious that perhaps due to the negligence or treachery of the messenger, I have been deprived of the letters along with the booklets. Therefore, I want you to know that the messenger faithfully performed his duty and presented your letter along with your booklets into my own hands. For this service, I am immensely grateful to you, as at this time nothing could have been more pleasing to me than this little gift, partly because it contributes to piety, and partly because it is evidence to me that you love me more earnestly and always remember me. I will also ensure, God willing, that your service to me will return to you not without interest.</p>
      <p>As for your accusation that I am less frequent in writing than is proper, it is not due to negligence, but because I had intended to thank you for your kindnesses in person. And it is still my intention, with God's favor, to visit you and the brothers in Zürich shortly. Furthermore, you write that Mr. Pellican has departed to the Lord; I rejoice for his sake, that he has attained this glory, which he long and anxiously sought in this world, but I grieve for the sake of your church, which is accustomed to miss such learned men. You also mention the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, whom you affirm has renounced papism and is considering reformation. May the Lord grant that he undertakes this matter seriously, and may He support his beginnings and confirm him in his holy purpose; for whenever I hear that Christ's cause is proceeding successfully, I am accustomed to rejoice greatly in my heart. There is nothing certain of new matters among us, except that I suspect the mountains have indeed conceived; however, I do not know whether they will give birth to a ridiculous mouse or countless other evils. The world threatens I know not what evils; but whatever it is, may God turn it to His glory.</p>
      <p>I will explain to you the state of our churches or how our affairs stand at present, or I will write at the appropriate time.</p>
      <p>Farewell along with your honorable family.</p>
      <p>Given from Glarus on the 13th day of May.</p>
      <p>Your Fridolin Brunner, pastor of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, my kind lord, to his hands.</p>
