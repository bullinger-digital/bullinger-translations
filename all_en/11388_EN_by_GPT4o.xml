    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Joachim [Maler] has returned, Zwick has only heard from the Diet [in Arnstadt] that Bucer was present, that he was sent by Landgrave [Philipp] to Wittenberg, and that another meeting is to take place; the pastors are being informed very cautiously. He is concerned for several reasons about the plans [for an alliance of Konstanz with the Swiss Confederation]: A change of alliance would cause offense, a connection with enemies of the Gospel is dangerous, the people of Konstanz rely too much on human wisdom, and the secret negotiations harm political customs. He forwarded Bullinger's letter to Mayor [Thomas Blarer] instead of [Konrad Zwick], as it concerns the confidential matters, and hopes that the matter will come to a good end. Ambrosius [Blarer] is still in Kempten or Memmingen, but will soon return and report what he has achieved in Augsburg. New Year's greeting.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to report about the Diet, although our Joachim has returned, except that Bucer was present, but not for long, as he was sent by the Landgrave to Wittenberg. Hence, my ears are also ringing, etc. Incidentally, I hear that nothing was discussed at this Diet, but other decrees were made; I do not know the time. Our people are so secretive towards us ministers in sharing this information that we cannot know anything until the children beat the drums, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding another matter, which is turning between our people and yours, my heart also beats with many bad forebodings. Firstly, it does not seem that it will happen without the greatest offense, that our people should join yours, nor is there sufficient reason for a defection from that, in which we are still in alliance. Secondly, to join those who love the priests more than us and who prefer to live by plunder rather than in holy parts, who are still conspired with the Roman king against the Gospel, who hate true religion worse than a dog and a snake, who stubbornly adore idols and the queen of heaven, and whose entire life and governance is nothing but the freedom of impiety on the right and left, and who have been the rod of the Lord's fury against us, this certainly instills great fear in me. Add to this that I greatly fear our people are being moved to such agreements by distrust and excessive reliance on human wisdom. Finally, I will not say, my brother, how much I fear for our morals. I do not disapprove of joining with good and holy people; however, I would prefer that we await the support of good people in our needs without such conspiracies. But you rightly, oh my most select brother, urge us to prayers; for if ever before, now the heavenly Father must be appealed to, so that hearts may be united in piety and the bond of justice, and indeed all hearts have long been united through the word of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>I gave your letters to the consul, not to my brother; for I sensed they were written for more secret matters, of which my brother is not a part. Pray with the most ardent vows, that the efforts of our people may be from the Lord and come to a successful outcome; to me certainly, as to you, my dearest heart, to speak freely, nothing less is desired in mind.</p>
      <p>May Christ have mercy on us and turn all things for the good. We expect Ambrosius at any moment; he is still in Kempten or Memmingen.</p>
      <p>He will tell what he has achieved in Augsburg when he returns. Farewell, dearest brother, and always love me.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, on the first day of January 1540.</p>
      <p>May a most fortunate year dawn for you and your entire family!</p>
      <p>Your brother from the heart.</p>
