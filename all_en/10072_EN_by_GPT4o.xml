      <p>Honorable, prudent, wise, gracious, and dear sirs, my willing service and whatever I know to please you be before you.</p>
      <p>As your honorable wisdom has so comfortingly and faithfully written to me in my tribulation, that I should join you, intending that you provide me with a suitable position where I may preach the Gospel of Christ, I give your honorable wisdom great thanks; I also will not forget such loyalty, honor, and goodness, as much as is possible for me, for eternity, but will strive at all times to repay such friendship with the utmost diligence, love, and favor. Therefore, I have urgently requested your wisdom not to take my delay as offense or anger, that I have not immediately dispatched the messenger; for I have been held up solely in the hope that I might give a final answer. Now, however, my affairs are such that I have not been able to act according to my will and intention. Therefore, I want to earnestly request you, as gracious lords and my particularly faithful ones, not to rush me, who is otherwise hindered in many ways; I will, within eight days, or at the very latest within 14 days, either give an answer myself or send a timely and proper message; I also want to express my great thanks and faithful friendship for such a postponement.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend you to God; may He keep you with wisdom and steadfastness for His honor for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given on Saturday, the 2nd of December 1531, Zurich.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's always willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, prudent, and wise Adelberg Meyer, mayor and council of the city of Basel, my gracious and dear lords.</p>
