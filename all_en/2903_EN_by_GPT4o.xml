      <p>Greetings. The Locarnese have delivered your kind letter to me quite dutifully. In your name, I addressed our consuls; they instructed me to refer the matter to the senate. I did so; we were heard. For the senate indeed gave them a most honorable letter to that less agreeable League on behalf of the Locarnese. They have set out, yet I do not believe they were admitted and heard unless perhaps yesterday; for that is how the matter stands.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, as I wrote to them in the letter attached to yours (... if only it has been delivered to your kindness, which I do not know; for from your recent letters to me, I could not perceive anything, and you have sent nothing for several weeks now), they can reside in our other two Leagues and even in that very League, which is opposed, provided they do not wish to be in that place of the Revle valley. For there are many communities hearing the gospel in that League, where they are permitted to reside, and I can find houses for the Locarnese, beautiful and fertile lands in our League, which are offered to me for sale, if they wish to buy. What I write is true. I cannot write more now, as this man is in a hurry to leave; I knew nothing of his presence. I see that he is honorably treated by our people as a German schoolmaster, because he is from there and comes here; I would have preferred to receive some letters from you. But if he is faithful, he will find not bad people. In the Valtellina, there are certain disturbances with some tumultuous people against the gospel; the Antichrist can do something. If only there were not magnates among us who cling too much to the envoys of the French. But this man here asked me not to delay him.</p>
      <p>I sent the letters addressed to me to Travers. But now the man is here, eager to leave. May your kindness fare well for the glory of God and the salvation of the pious throughout the world.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 29th of April, 1556.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
