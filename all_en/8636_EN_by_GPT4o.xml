      <p>Greetings. You give me thanks, my revered father, when I owe you greater thanks than I could ever repay, for you have deemed me worthy to visit with the most honorable and best men and at the same time inform me about the things happening at home with you.</p>
      <p>I read the writing of the Wittenbergers, which Ulmer sent; I pity both those men and the whole church, which in such controversies looks to those who are indeed learned men, but do not have enough courage to defend the truth they know so well with the fortitude worthy of theologians. They agree with us in the doctrine of the natures in Christ and the communication of idioms; however, in what necessarily follows from that, they expressly declare their dissent from us. Oh, the times, oh, the cowardice of theologians, who, lest they appear to be Zwinglians, condemn the truth they have recognized and resort to evasions, which (I am sure) they are ashamed of within the secrets of their conscience. But they deserve to entangle themselves in such labyrinths, who have sworn by the words of men or at least wish to appear to have sworn. I have often thought of sending my son there; but I would not want him to be taught by such people, from whom he would learn nothing but to play with verbal tricks and sometimes to admit the truth, sometimes to deny it, and I fear that the company and observance of those men, once we are gone, may also cause trouble for our church and perhaps those who associate with them may learn things that are less beneficial to our people. May God have mercy on them and on all of us. I have not yet understood who has been appointed in place of Petronius Grebel. I informed our Escher of what you ask; but I do not think he will come; for he is in a hurry to put an end to the use of the waters.</p>
      <p>We are all well except for little Elizabeth, who is troubled by a daily fever; however, she is doing better than at the beginning, so there is hope she will recover soon.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to all yours and mine. Farewell, my revered father.</p>
      <p>Urdorf, August 13, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich, my honored lord and brother-in-law, to his hands.</p>
