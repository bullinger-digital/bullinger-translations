      <p>Greetings. Although I had entirely resolved not to write to you or in any way disturb you until you had put the finishing touches on that holy labor of yours, which is dedicated to the public benefit of the churches, I thought nevertheless that I would not be doing wrong if I deviated a little from that resolution at the request of charity, which itself I will do in very few words and in such a way that I commend to you once and for all this Agnes, a most pious woman, with the most diligent and best recommendation possible: She is the widow of Alexander Schmozius, a truly pious and thoroughly learned priest of the church in Lütmaringen, to whom our Hieronymus Emporus succeeded in ministry. She will ask you for letters of recommendation for her son, whom she has in England, to some prince of that kingdom, a man with whom you have great influence through your authority and other means. Therefore, not only I, but also my sister, with whom this woman has always been united in the greatest charity and familiarity, earnestly and repeatedly ask you not to deny her these.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the same request is made in letters sent to you, which she herself will deliver to you, by her son Alexander and our Johannes Ulmius, at whose urging the mother sent him to England, never having sent him unless Ulmius had persistently urged her to do so.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will have bound all of us to you with a singular and great favor if you do not disappoint our expectation and the hope conceived of your human kindness in this matter, which I implore and beseech you not to do, by our friendship and indeed by the very bowels of Christ's charity. But farewell now, my venerable soul, lest I detain you any longer, and you will love me as steadfastly as you have until now.</p>
      <p>Greetings to the brothers, your fellow ministers and servants in the work of the Lord, along with your entire household, which sends you very warm and careful greetings. We commend ourselves diligently to your prayers. Winterthur, March 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the great and illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and brother in every way the highest, Antistes of the Zürich church, as holy as he is learned.</p>
