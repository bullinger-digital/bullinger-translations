    <p xml:id="regest1">Is concerned that the Zurich [Synod] rejects the signing of the [Wittenberg Concord], after so much effort has been made to reach an agreement. The ongoing conflict is due to mutual distrust. Luther sees the publication of letters by Zwingli and Oecolampadius as proof of his opponents' lack of insight, while the people of Zurich, despite the explanation [of the Concord articles] presented by Bucer and Capito [on September 25 in Basel], fear that Luther wants to commit them to his doctrine. Furthermore, Luther's condescending behavior towards the Swiss and their advocates raises doubts about his willingness to reach an understanding. Finally, it seems that Bucer has also alienated himself from them with his "retractions." From a higher perspective, it is clear that unchristian, harmful distrust prevails on both sides, even though it became clear in Basel that there is agreement on the matter; in light of this fact, the grievances of Bucer and Bibliander lose significance. Overcoming the scandalous dispute is in the general interest, and in view of the agreement now reached, private sensitivities must take a back seat. Zurich bears special responsibility towards the Swiss churches due to its preeminent position. Although Bucer has made significant concessions to Luther in his "retractions" to justify himself, his private concessions only concern the wording and are not a reason to reject the Concord. Moreover, there is nothing to fear from signing it, as it is not published and is only recognized in the sense publicly explained by Bucer, Capito, and [Johannes] Zwick. The suspicion that Luther could reinterpret their signing afterwards seems far-fetched, as even Melanchthon has confirmed the reliability of Bucer's report; rather, such a step, as already taken by the leaders of the most significant churches in Germany, promises great benefit. Vadian hopes for a willingness to compromise from Zurich in view of the upcoming meeting [in Basel] to avert the looming split among the Swiss churches and warns against referring the matter back to the authorities again. He recommends as a solution, on the one hand, a letter from the pastors to Luther, in which they should ask him to be satisfied with the signing of the declaration [by Bucer] and the response given to it; on the other hand, Basel should, on behalf of the Swiss delegates, send a delegation to Luther; this could make the signing of the articles unnecessary. Dominik [Zili] will present the records of the Zurich Synod to the pastors [of St. Gallen]; Vadian again points out the significance of the decision. Suggests meeting in Brugg on the way to Basel on [December 11]. Could neither inform Bibliander that his brother-in-law [Gschwend] is receiving support from the council, nor comfort Pellikan [after the death of his wife]. Retracts the criticism of the meter of a poem by Bibliander. Apologizes for not being able to copy the letter again.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, which brought not very joyful news about the refusal of your bishops to sign Luther's articles. I am saddened that the matter of such great importance is being dragged out, not only burdening the magistrates of some already weary cities with expenses but also increasing the suspicion of a significant disagreement among us. Despite having met so many times and being exhausted after a year of trying to establish concord on the single article of the Eucharist, we are so divided in doctrine and opinion that neither the great efforts nor the expenses have brought progress, and we are still stuck in the same, as they say, mud, with the latter almost worse than the first. This offense also tempts good and pious men, who are troubled by the procrastination, which is caused by nothing other than suspicions and certain animosities, which are utterly unworthy of Christians, not to mention ministers, but of any members of Christ.</p>
      <p>Luther has little trust in you; conversely, you have little trust in Luther. He claims that during the negotiation of concord, you published a book defending both the doctrine and the reputation and glory of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, making it seem that you were aiming for anything but a candid and accommodating concord with the opposing party. However, the nature of concord is not only to forgive what has been admitted through any error but also to allow something from fairness and goodness and to embrace the reconciled party in such a way that we seem to wish more for them than for ourselves. Therefore, Luther complains, and he believes he does so rightly, that although he was ready and willing for concord, he was received with such envy in that published work that everything was drawn to the utmost fairness, which was revealed by Zwingli and Oecolampadius even in the battle and more than vehement contention about the Eucharist, which you should have completely forgotten; whereas what was said or written about him was so touched with gall or at least with oblique bites that even the dull and not very perceptive, if they read it, would see that Luther's name and doctrine were not only despised but also criticized, and that by those who offered the bread of peace with one hand while silently hurling the hard stone of accusation with the other, openly testifying that you would not deviate even a finger's breadth from the teachings of your masters and would rest in the Pythagorean "he said it himself," whatever that concord, so eagerly sought and awaited by others, might promise. On the other hand, you are held in suspense by Luther's vehement assertion of certain points, which he has treated in his books against your tradition quite differently than the declaration brought by Bucer and Capito contains, so that it is feared that you are being dealt with by art and deceit, so that if the bare articles are signed by your hand, he might abuse your candor and lead you into a trap from which it would be difficult to extricate yourselves.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Luther seems to display a perpetual contempt, as he has written and continues to write so willingly and candidly to other churches of Upper Germany, but has not deemed it worthy to write even a jot to the churches of Switzerland, which are no less deserving than the greatest churches of the rest of Germany, and seems to be of the mind that, while he is wonderfully moved by even slightly committed matters and does not proceed to consult anything good that is done candidly on your part, he received those who were entrusted with the handling of your cause at the beginning in Wittenberg with a grave and drawn brow, etc., so that he does not seem to act or establish anything with a sincere mind and prepared for Christian concord.</p>
      <p>Bucer's Retractions weigh heavily on Luther's cause, as they seem to show a mind somewhat alienated from you, and he regrets having retracted, as if he had left your side and taken refuge in foreign and even hostile camps, so that he does not even mention that he seems to press and belittle certain chief ministers of your churches, though he does not name them, with remarkable contempt. In sum, from the whole disposition of the matter, it appears that the other party's part is so inconsistent and vacillating, partly envious and contentious, that you can hardly promise yourselves sincere and solid concord, etc.</p>
      <p>All these things, my dear Bullinger, as I see and contemplate them (let me speak freely with you according to my custom and your sincerity), what else do I see, as if sitting in some watchtower and looking down on this your dispute, but carnal and more than human affections, by which you are moved and disturbed on both sides, making no end to dissensions and, what is far weaker, suspicions, which the apostle is accustomed to count among the notable works of the flesh? And since it should be considered and consulted for the public cause of piety and strived for, that the most serious offenses of discord, exercised more than enough hitherto, should be removed, so that there may no longer be those who can reproach us with: "You, as if indulging the flesh with those carnal pursuits, however alien to your profession, are consumed, meanwhile, having become a notable and pleasant spectacle to the enemies of Christ, who to this day, with no strength of their own, but with that one and only discord of yours, promise themselves nothing about establishing their affairs due to your dissension." And would that this harmful tragedy were conducted in such a way that nothing of self-love, which is the handmaid of all carnal pursuits, stood out in it! I confess indeed that the intention of injuries is grave and almost intolerable to a civil man, and very few are those who do not kick against that goad. But I assert in the meantime that it is the counsel of Christian charity and indeed of the Holy Spirit to forgive and spare and to acquiesce in every way to those offering Christian peace, and that the concord of the churches in doctrines, which are based on the scriptures and whose truth we recognize from the scriptures, should be so embraced by us with both arms (as they say) that no regard should be had for reputation or matters, so that it may not be hindered. I say, therefore - and what I say, I also feel - that you seem to be not very perceptive on both sides to those most cunning wiles of Satan, who day and night takes care especially to throw a hindrance to the success of the gospel of Christ and, with whatever efforts he can, to forestall better things. Moreover, if you weigh what the matter itself holds on both sides, you will find, even unwillingly, that private affections hold you in such a place that you judge them worthy to be opposed to the public accession of truth and the glory of Christ, and you hold the occasion of concord, by far the most desired of all, in a lower place than it deserves. For neither Luther's nor Bucer's nor Zwingli's nor Oecolampadius's business is being conducted, while the churches are solicitous through charity, so that it may be established concerning the concord of those who now, having made the most esteemed comparison of their doctrine, openly confess that nothing remains that leaves any place for dissension. For what was there in the whole matter of the Eucharist that Bucer and Capito did not discuss and explain in the recent Basel assembly in Luther's name, so that all of you, for the sake of all the churches of Switzerland, having given thanks, were content with everything and asked for nothing else than the report of the matters done to the magistrates, led by a certain and undoubted hope that they would easily assent as soon as they noticed that the ministers of Christ had assented to everything? What, therefore, my dear Bullinger, is the piety, what prudence or civility, to grant private affections that they should not make and yield a place to the public, candid, expressed, and examined and corrected consensus and concord according to our judgment? Bucer would not have published that epistolary work with his preface, and he is indignant that he was mentioned by name in a place where, for the sake of peace, he should not have been named at all. What is this scruple to be compared with the concord of the churches? Nor will your Bibliander, that most pious man, I think, judge it worthy that, because he complains of being obliquely touched by Bucer, therefore suddenly there should be despair about the concord of the German churches to be mended in the word of Christ. Rather, he will more readily apply himself to this matter with all (as they say) his strength, so that he may not be caught giving more to private and personal matters than to the public interests of the churches and the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>What pertains to the concord so happily offered to us is public, O Bullinger, not private. The matter is undertaken by necessity, not by the industry or good pleasure of a few. The offense greatly oppresses the weak, nourishes the impious. It will be a laugh for the pope and the church of the malignants, that you, who claim for yourselves the pure and restored Christian doctrine, dissent diametrically in the highest and greatest internal dogmas and attribute the Holy Spirit to all your ministry, which spirit, however, is of unity and peace, professing one faith and one Lord, relying on and supporting one and only the word of God. In which, since we now agree on the doctrine of the Eucharist, and there is nothing that could burden us, with everything, as I said, having been explained with such faith, it is our foremost concern to testify to the Christian world about the concord of this dissension, then, if anything happens privately that has harmed either charity or the deserved reputation of a few, we should privately and with the work of good men placate it, and what remains, we should confirm ourselves on both sides with the excellent hope of exercising charity and benevolence, meanwhile forgetting the things done before, which, if resumed or admitted again, do not meditate peace but revenge. So far is it from those who strive for concord to be able to remember those things against which the sanction of concord was especially received, although this is the only thing that the often-attempted concord aims at, that we do not seek what is ours, but what is Christ's, and we send far away the carnal movements of minds always looking to their own and not discerning what pertains to the edification of the churches of Christ and the increase of faith throughout the Christian world.</p>
      <p>The church of Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Mulhouse, Biel, to which I add Glarus, Appenzell, Rhaetia, Toggenburg, Thurgau, Neuburg, the Rhine Valley, and others, which teach and profess Christ through Switzerland in the greatest temptations, desire concord, which have no private dissension with any man and rejoice and give thanks to God that Luther and his followers have been given such a mind that they wish the doctrine of the Eucharist, which they have hitherto proposed and still propose, teach, and hold, to remain intact, confirming with one voice that Basel confession and expecting the desired end of such a holy and long-desired matter. To all of whom, because the church of Zurich precedes in the dignity of primacy, it also rightly prescribes in doctrine and learning, I judge it fitting that it should also grant and bestow upon them, so that it does not allow itself to be alienated and let go of the matter, which will bring the greatest benefit to the churches professing Christ beyond all controversy, by private and little relevant causes in the opportunity of concord offered, but rather show itself more ready for the sake of others, the more it surpasses the other churches of Switzerland in doctrine and authority. The rivalries of bishops have also greatly harmed the ancient churches; how much damage ambition has caused, the Roman church (unless we are blind) places before our eyes.</p>
      <p>But, you say, Bucer has retracted. What then? He retracts only in his own name and from what he had previously written, unless I am mistaken, so that he does not disagree with your doctrine, although he moderates his words in such a way that he seems to have retracted in favor of Luther. Indeed, I seem to see with what intention this was done. For, being somewhat offended by the betrayal of his name, which was made in that epistolary publication, he wanted to testify once about the candor of his mind, and that openly and among those by whom he had been accused, that, having urged and agitated the concord of the churches for so many years, he has now finally made himself a partner in publishing certain things that would both reopen the old contention and invite a new one, far alien to the minds of those who sincerely wish to agree in Christian peace with the churches. For he complained about this both publicly and privately, not only in the gathering of brothers but also in the very senate, when we were in Basel, as you yourself know and heard. Therefore, with an offended mind, it pleased him to testify openly that he seeks nothing less than to be a harm to the churches by contending or exercising rivalries again. But what he complains about, that he had not been able to grasp sufficiently from Luther's words about that sense which he first learned in Wittenberg, and regrets not having observed the ministers of Christ with due dignity, etc., has nothing that should rightly offend you, since he does this with not only commendation but also excuse and indeed (if you pay close attention) defense of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Nor was anything else sought with that honest and full color of charity than that Luther's doctrine should be commended to our churches as nothing different from yours. For he does not fear to attribute to Luther what we are accustomed to attribute to those who are offended by us, and at the same time to teach that he does not think otherwise than what Bucer and his followers have long thought, with the added purgation of Zwinglian and Oecolampadian doctrine about the Eucharist. I think that this treatment does not harm concord but benefits it, and I have often discussed with you that it seems to me full of charity and prudence if we defer to those to whom it can be deferred for just reasons, but also with great fruit of piety, and recall to mind not the merits of others, but rather our own duties and what we owe to the glory of Christ. Bucer indeed touched on some things a little more bitterly, which I would certainly wish had been omitted. But Bucer is a man, and nothing human is alien to him. Yet all these things are still private and little relevant to establishing concord. For it is not to be considered what Bucer treats or retracts privately, but what doctrine is offered to us in Luther's name, which, having been received and admitted, can mend concord. And it is such that it agrees in all respects with your, that is, Zwingli's and Oecolampadius's doctrine, and does not change the sense, but brings a formula of words, which the most ancient doctors of the church have used, and indeed brings it with the condition that it is free for you to use or not use it before your churches, provided that the sense of the received doctrine is meanwhile established; not to mention that after publishing his retractions, Bucer, with such faith and sincerity, testified before the legates and ministers of the Swiss churches in Basel. And it cannot be otherwise for me that he thought differently in retracting than he thought in declaring, although he uses different formulas of speech. I see indeed (as I said before) several things on the other side that may rightly either offend you or instill fear of a bad outcome; yet I am of the mind that the glory of Christ and the peace of the churches should be valued more than that we should be drawn away from the opportunity of concord by these little hindrances and offenses.</p>
      <p>You fear danger if the bare articles are signed. I see no danger at all, since, not only are the articles not published, having been conceived for the sole reason that mutual and clear agreement may be established (I wish they had not been conceived, let alone signed: but what can you do with offended men who are not very unjustly demanding from those who offended them? And even if I grant that there was no reason or cause for them to be offended, it is certain that that epistolary book could have been published with no detriment after the concord was established for many reasons, which I leave aside for the present), but also because the articles would be signed with the clearest condition prefixed, namely, understood in the sense that Bucer, Capito, and Zwick brought to us from Wittenberg with such a contestation of truth, not only to the ministers of the Swiss churches gathered in Basel but also to the senatorial legates with the chief magistrate of Strasbourg present, not in corners, but in the very praetorium of the city of Basel, with the consuls of that city and a good part of the magistrate present.</p>
      <p>Imagine, however, that Luther intends to abuse your hand for some hidden meaning of his own as if it were approved and granted by you. What, I ask, would he achieve with such a ridiculous plan, however cunning and crafty? Do we not have the most illustrious men of two cities, Strasbourg and Constance, as witnesses, who are well aware of our entire action? And what, I ask, greater pestilence, what greater fire could be kindled against the means of concord offered, with greater damage, than if Luther were to proceed in this way to betray his faith and attack ours? Nor could the sincerity of our cause be more commended to the world than if he were to abuse our benevolence and humanity in this way. But let us be far from suspecting such things. Recently, Melanchthon wrote to me from Tübingen that he had read what Bucer told us in the Basel assembly, and he indeed judges that he recited that very opinion in good faith, which he had mentioned to Luther and the others who were with him. Behold, you have Philip's testimony, whose hand I have with me. How much, therefore, could we gain even with the smallest capital if we gave it to the other party, with our benevolence preceding, so that Doctor Luther would see those very articles, even bare, signed by your hand, which the leaders of the greatest churches of Germany have now signed and received with their own hand? I indeed see, my dear Bullinger, what you fear. But I cannot be persuaded to believe that it was ever acted in the way you suspect. And I wish a limit would be set to such suspicions, so that we would either let them go entirely or not give them place unless they are very exposed and great.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I do not write these things as if I condemn either your or your senate's counsel in this matter. For there may be other reasons, which are far beyond me, by which you have been moved on both sides to act in this way at present. And perhaps there will be no need for subscription, provided that other means, which in some part satisfy Luther's demands, are not rejected. For we must certainly take care of what Zwick constantly advises me in his letters, that we should not be divided by conflicting opinions, which you also anxiously demand in your letters. But indeed the Baselers (as you heard in person) have already accepted the concord, whose ministers are commended to us all not only by doctrine and learning but also by prudence and judgment, so that it is necessary either for us to admire and accept the same and deliberate about subscribing or trying another means, or to return from the next assembly divided and torn apart with the matter unfinished. For even good men are nauseated by so often repeated reports - although I suspect that there are great men among you (as there are elsewhere too), to whom nothing is more pleasing. Therefore, for the immortal God's sake, let some happy end be put to a cause so long debated. And come with authority, you of Zurich, so that we are not forced to refer the most illustrious cause to the magistrates' knowledge so many times. For in this way everything is attributed to the magistrate, while the dignity of the ministers is meanwhile excessively pressed and diminished, not to mention that we often find their counsels to be very affected, when nothing is more alien to the cause of Christ than the handling of counsels subject to affections.</p>
      <p>At present, two means occurred to me, which we could use, rejecting subscription. One of which is: If the ministers were to send the response recently given in Basel to the friends of Strasbourg, inserted in a friendly letter to Doctor Luther, along with a declaration, signed by the ministers who will come to Basel, in the name of all the churches and ministers of Switzerland, and request that he be content with this very response and now act so that some public formula of our doctrine and faith about the Eucharist be conceived and deliberated upon by the parties, etc., that you will not fail the glory of Christ and sincere peace and concord, etc. If this were done in this way, I have no doubt that Luther would show himself accommodating without demanding a larger subscription, which indeed the equanimity of Bucer and Capito could grant us. The other is: If the legates, together with the Basel magistrate, were to do the same with their friendly letters written in their own and the ministers' name, with the proper seal of the city of Basel sent by a messenger, I would not doubt that they could pacify Luther with this plan, so that he would not urge a larger subscription. Indeed, it would seem most convenient to me if we both jointly provided this, so that our faith and humanity would shine more clearly, and more faithful foundations would be laid for avoiding all bitterness, and Luther would see in person that he should suspect nothing less than that we are unwilling to acquiesce in concord from the heart. For unless I am mistaken, the matter itself now demands that we finally deal with Luther himself and no longer fail both our own and foreign churches and place the glory of the word of Christ far above our own glory. That this may be done is in your and the Bernese church's hand. Our senate will certainly not refuse anything that will contribute to the peace of the churches of Christ.</p>
      <p>I delivered your letters to Dominik, along with the synodal acts, who will read them to the fellow ministers and then inform us of their own opinion. Moreover, it pleased me to pour these things into your bosom, my chosen friend and lord, even untimely, beseeching you to continue to watch according to your custom. It seems to me that the quality of the matter is now situated at the very point, so that nothing more fortunate could happen to us who love Christ if we give our effort to strengthening concord, but on the contrary, nothing more dangerous for many reasons if we pass up the opportunity at present.</p>
      <p>We are burdened by the journey in wondrous ways, beseeching you not to take it amiss that we are heading straight to Basel. On Saturday, God willing, we will have lunch at Vocetius in Brugg, gladly awaiting your arrival, unless you arrive first. We will spend the night at Momphi. Please make an effort to meet either here or there, so that we may enter Basel together the next day.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus with all your brothers. I would have written to Bibliander and Leo, whose brother-in-law we have obtained two gold coins from the senate. I would also have consoled Pellican, the venerable man, but I scarcely had time to write these things, so it must be obtained through you for me with them, that they may take everything in good part.</p>
      <p>Tell Bibliander that the word "Batavi" in his polished poem did not displease me in the least, but that I erased it because of the penultimate syllable, which I always thought should be lengthened, deceived by Martial, who almost always lengthens it, while Lucan meanwhile shortens it. Therefore, I sing a palinode to him and accept the word I had erased.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, on the 2nd day of November in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Bullinger as a brother.</p>
      <p>I was about to copy what I had hastily written with a rushing pen, as things came to mind, but by chance, the opportunity of a messenger was obtained, so it pleased me to send you erasures instead of letters. For the day appointed for the Assembly is approaching, and otherwise, business overwhelmed me beyond what pleases or my mind can bear. Therefore, I must ask you not to attribute this either to our negligence or to any other cause. I would certainly have commanded the pen to paint everything more accurately, had I not intended to rewrite what the first and indeed hasty meditation suggested.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
