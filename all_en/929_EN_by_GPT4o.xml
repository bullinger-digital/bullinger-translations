      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Greetings, most esteemed man. Although I have nothing worthy of your knowledge at present, I did not want the most reverend Lord Vergerius to meet you without my letters, in which I testify that he has conducted himself sincerely, piously, and bravely among our people, with great benefit. For he is (as far as I can judge, with his character bearing witness) a man of great learning and true piety, worthy to be supported by all the pious in his purpose. Our Rhaetia rightly respects and honors him not only for his piety but also for his remarkable eloquence in the same language, with which he is accustomed not only to teach but also to convince and refute those who contradict. What he has done with our bishop, he will recount in person, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, I have nothing to write about our perplexing affairs. We are expecting the envoys of the Three Leagues next week; what they will do, we do not know.</p>
      <p>You will know as soon as I have received news. Many people have high hopes for this assembly. Some threaten our city, etc. The Lord God preserves His church. Farewell through the Lord. Hastily, Chur, June 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>The same, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most prudent, learned, and truly pious man, Bullinger, the most steadfast Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
