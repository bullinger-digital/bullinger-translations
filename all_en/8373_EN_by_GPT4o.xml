      <p>S. D. I sealed the previous letters when yours were delivered to me, and since there was nothing in them that required a response, I have only added this note. I congratulate you for having escaped safely from that insane and raging flood of waters. I am also glad that peace is confirmed by the legate. As for the bishop creating a new abbot in Disentis, he could easily have refrained from that innovation. Borromeo had an uncle, Giovanni Giacomo de' Medici, lord of Musso; he does not favor the Swiss, who expelled his uncle. If you learn anything about his plans, make sure to let me know promptly. I trust in nothing good.</p>
      <p>He would like to nest in the four bailiwicks beyond the mountains; a monster is being nurtured. Beware, lest that Schwenckfeldian and Anabaptist is received back into favor, unless you wish to experience the greatest disturbances again.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, who always wrote this on the same 1st of September 1570.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, his beloved brother. Chur.</p>
