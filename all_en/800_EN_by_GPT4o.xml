      <p>Greetings. If your benevolence towards me and paternal spirit were not sufficiently clear from the recent letters you sent me, I would by no means dare to disturb your ears again with my unpolished and unlearned letters. But since I have no doubt about your humanity, I eagerly and with a serene face take up the pen in my hand and first of all, as I should, I give you immortal thanks for not disdaining to visit me with your letters, which, to confess honestly about myself, I did not consider myself worthy to enjoy the sight of your letters. But I will keep these as a most precious treasure as long as the spirit governs my limbs, and no one will attempt to take them from the chest of my heart; for I read and reread them with such great pleasure of the soul that I would not wish for the wealth of Croesus to be brought to me, especially since they are filled with such arduous exhortations that it would be no wonder if they led one who had completely strayed from the true path back to the right way. Then I can also no less give you thanks for the efforts you expended on my behalf in calling my parent, when you were informed of my adverse health, which I am glad to hear has been somewhat mitigated, and I continually offer prayers to the gods above, that they were content with this scourge. From where I contracted this disease, it is not clear to me, except that I suspect a certain type of phlegm has affected my brain; for I still sometimes suffer from a headache; but they say healing comes with movement... the doctors. Those things, however, which I have neglected in the meantime, I will make up for with greater zeal and diligence, and I will not allow any day to pass empty by imitating the painter Apelles, and I will follow the golden saying of Cato: "Let no day pass without purpose" and I will not disappoint the good hope conceived of me and become liable and guilty of the crime of negligence or ingratitude, which I believe no more disgraceful mark can be imprinted on a man. I earnestly testify to you, not to fail in looking out for me, of which you have hitherto given excellent examples, so that I do not hesitate at all; for I completely submit to your judgment and will, and whatever decision you make, I will accept, and thus I earnestly ask that you receive this my letter, which contains little of learning and even less of pleasure, with a cheerful face and a kind mind. Farewell, esteemed patron. Bern, January 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Jakob Bindschedler, your most devoted. May he who rules everything, the pen, the sea, the stars, the earth, keep you safe for many times.</p>
      <p>May he who nourishes everything that grows on the wet lands happily end the year for you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
