    <p xml:id="regest1">He allows himself to present his concerns to him as his teacher and helper. He has considered sending his son Adam to Zurich for education in exchange with a son of Hans von Schönau, and has already reached an understanding with Schönau's brother-in-law Hans Jakob Brennwald about it. However, due to the sudden illness of his wife [Anna von Mochau], this plan has fallen through. In the hope that a host can be found within 14 days, he is sending his son to Zurich anyway and inquires whether he could be admitted to the Fraumünster-Alumnat. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Although I am usually reluctant to burden excellent men, who are occupied with serious matters, with my trivialities, most learned and distinguished man, I do not usually neglect the opportunity to sincerely express my love and hopes placed in them, nor am I ashamed to address them with my unpolished letters.</p>
      <p>With this intention, I have decided to address you, my teacher and helper, with this rather harsh letter, so that you may understand the hope I have placed in you and how I am disposed towards you.</p>
      <p>I am sending my son Adam to Zurich, so that he may shape his mind there with both sound learning and your most humane manners. I initially attempted to achieve this through the benefit of an exchange, and I was not entirely unsuccessful. The noble man Hans von Schönau and I deliberated about exchanging our sons between us, so that I would take his son here, and he would, in turn, take mine there to join at the table and in the study of letters. Meanwhile, the wise man Hans Jakob Brennwald, your fellow citizen and brother-in-law of the young nobleman von Schönau, came here. Although he had no mandate to arrange the exchange, after he learned of my inclination, he did not want to oppose my will, promising that if I sent my son there, he would receive him and, within that time, ascertain his father-in-law's intentions. This was agreeable; but the day after our conversation, my wife was struck down with colic, kidney stones, and a contraction of the limbs, which confined her to bed, from which she has not yet risen, nor is it certain when she will be freed or if she will ever find a remedy for these ailments. Therefore, the Lord has dashed the hope of achieving the exchange.</p>
      <p>How can a wife, bedridden with defeated limbs, perform her duties at home, and what can I do with her bedridden? Thus, the exchange is out of the question.</p>
      <p>However, since your institution and your humane and divine manners wonderfully attract me, I did not want to refrain from sending my son there, especially since he can obtain annual sustenance and lodging rights there for 12, 13, or 15 florins - for such is the reputation here - and because I knew of a house where he could move and stay for at most 14 days, during which time the Lord might perhaps show us a good man with whom he could lodge. Relying on your exceptional authority and benevolence and that of others, I have set aside my fear that you might refuse or reject him, and I am sending the boy for the sake of study, so that he may imbibe there, along with good letters, manners that are fitting for humanity and divine. I implore you by your kindness, by your very bowels of mercy, to deign to write back, whether the reputation flying here is true or false, and furthermore, whether you admit foreigners to the monastery of the Blessed Virgin for learning, if they promise a reward, and how much the reward for sustenance, for disciplines, and for other things amounts to, so that within the space of 10 days, I may fully discern, with God's help, what benefits my son, and what my resources can bear, whether I can support such an expense for study.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with your wife and children. I send greetings to my teacher, Master Theodor, Leo Jud, Caspar, Pellican, and all the lords and brothers in general.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 10, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your devoted servant</p>
      <p>Andreas Bodenstein.</p>
      <p>To the excellent and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his esteemed teacher. To Mr. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
