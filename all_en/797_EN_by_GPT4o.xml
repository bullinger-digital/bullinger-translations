      <p>To the magnanimous man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father and patron, Felix Tobler sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I may rightly be accused, most learned man and most esteemed patron, for having descended into this arena amidst the falling snow and for having undertaken this task to administer, which I will either not manage at all or certainly not with the dignity the matter deserves, and for seeming to trouble and burden you with my foolishness, now that you are already occupied with very many affairs (and which I have not dared to do until now). However, after those things you wrote to my very familiar and gentle companion came to mind, I could not help but yawn and add some spur to the runner, so that I might send you some letters, even if not so polished and charming as to deserve anything, yet you could easily understand they were written from the heart. At the same time, fearing the name of negligence might be imposed on me alone, if I measure by the foot of others, since they have long since outpaced me. But since there was little, indeed nothing, that seemed worthy of writing and suitable to your kindness, I reserved it until this interval of time, in which I would write the accounts of receipts and expenses to the schoolmaster. It seemed to you that it was appropriate to write these few things on this occasion, not because I thought they would have any value with you, but to ask from your kindness, as you have done so far, to have me commended to your trust. For I wholly give myself to you, I wholly submit to your mercy, so that, as you yourself know, how short our (as it is said) supply is, you would wish to provide for us with your kindness in such a way that it seems most convenient for both of us. For if the Lord grants his grace, which I trust he will do, so that something of any grace may be undertaken, you will see that all these things were placed with someone neither forgetful nor ungrateful. For I am naturally disposed in such a way that, having received any benefits, even if I could not repay them, I would still wish to return them from the heart.</p>
      <p>The last thing is, which I would like to ask you again and again, which most desires your support and favor, if there remains any love in you towards me, which I know, that you show it especially in this matter, so that I may enjoy greater studies, if only it does not displease your kindness. I certainly, what I consider to pertain to your dignity, which is very great in itself, will always undertake with the greatest zeal and diligence; I will especially also take care with all the observance I can, for the most illustrious men, my patrons and fathers, which I must do both for the antiquity of the relationship and for your benefits and for your dignity, so that the mark of ingratitude may never be imprinted by you, as long as I can satisfy my calling, to which I do not doubt I have been summoned from the cradle.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will now make an end.</p>
      <p>At present, I thought it should be signified only, so that I might show you my love rather than display prudence. Farewell, and I wish you and your family a most happy beginning, middle, and end of this year. Farewell again. Given in Bern in the year of salvation 1550, on the 7th day before the Ides of January.</p>
      <p>Felix Tobler, always most obedient to your kindness. To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his very dear patron of the fatherland.</p>
