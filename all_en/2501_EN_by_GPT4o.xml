      <p>Greetings. I received your letters yesterday and for the third time in recent days, and I wish the latter had not come too late! I previously responded to the earlier ones through our students. I can say nothing in response to the latter, which I only received yesterday. Now, a delegate has been chosen for your people, Mr. Claudius Mey. What our people are doing and planning, they all conceal from me so much that I can easily perceive that they doubt my loyalty; they are displeased that everything is shared among us and do not realize how beneficial it would be to sometimes hear and accept these mutual counsels. Thus, trusting in their own prudence, they rush into such errors that cannot be washed away without great repentance. Those who favor the matter are themselves too secretive about public affairs; they neither despise ours nor seem to value them greatly. I commend these matters to the Lord with sorrow. Our man here would have left without my knowledge if I had not been reminded of his imminent departure from elsewhere, which hastened this. If only it were possible for our people to be extracted again by you from where they have fallen! I could only share your matters with a few due to the shortness of time, and I do not know what we can achieve now that the delegate has already been dismissed.</p>
      <p>Regarding the note you included in your last letter about the marriage of Elizabeth, Queen of England, to the Prince of Savoy, I do not quite understand it. For why would he marry her, who was previously betrothed to Philip, the Emperor, and the marriage was also celebrated in the month of July, as we hear? Is he dead, or has there been a divorce, or what reason is there for this marriage to him? We have no news of this. Zebedee is here and excuses himself not unreasonably, if indeed things are as they are.</p>
      <p>Farewell and please inform me of what is happening there; I can hardly guess here. You can do this either yourself or through your brother. Greet him in my name; I did not have the time to write to him now. Bern, December 14, early morning, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Why was a delegation not sent from your people to our deacons instead?</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
