    <p xml:id="regest1">The pastors of Schaffhausen are interested in an agreement [with Luther], but the internally divided council is holding back and seeking excuses; it is advisable to undertake nothing until a favorable reply from Luther is received. Bibliander is not writing an apology against Bucer's "Retractations," but rather a private response to a partially sharp letter from Bucer, which Bullinger also did not like.</p>

      <p>Regarding the people of Schaffhausen, I can promise you nothing; for they are more obstinate than can be softened by any means. I wish this to be said about the council, not the ministers. For they would be most ready for agreement if the council were not evasive; but the reason they are evasive is that they are divided among themselves, favoring different parties. To me, it seems these matters should be concealed until a better opportunity arises; for when we receive favorable news from Luther about a well-made agreement, there will be a more suitable way to proceed. Before that, there is nothing we can hope for. Meanwhile, they do not want to appear to be separated from us; let us therefore bear with their obstinacy. He who is not against us, said the Lord himself, is for us. As for the apology to Bucer's "Retractations" being prepared by our Theodor, this is the first I hear from you. I do not know who spreads these ill-omened rumors. Bucer wrote a rather long letter to Theodor, and in some places it was quite sharp. He is preparing a response to this, but a private one to a private letter. Therefore, I do not think it will cause us any drama. Not everything Bucer wrote in that letter could be approved by me.</p>
