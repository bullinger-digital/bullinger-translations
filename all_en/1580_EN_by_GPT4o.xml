      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The bundle of letters you recently sent to me did not arrive nor have I seen it. Our Celio received the acts of the council, and I received the letters. Later, Celio sent me three sessions, nothing more. Our Borrhaus received your letters, but I do not know what he will respond; for he seems to me to be entirely in favor of Osiander in those articles I sent.</p>
      <p>I gave your letters to Musaeus, the envoy of the King of France, who was very busy at the time; he said he would like to reply if he could do so conveniently. I have not seen Dr. Schertlin; for he is still hiding with us, and I did not want to bother him for various reasons.</p>
      <p>But I read your letters to his son, and these threats from the Emperor do not frighten him, nor have the plots laid against him by S. been hidden from him until now.</p>
      <p>He arms his servants, enlists soldiers, but secretly sends them, I do not know to which place, soon to depart to the King of France.</p>
      <p>In Freiburg and in the villages of Breisgau, soldiers are being gathered, who are given 5 batz up to Donaueschingen, to resist Turkish incursions. What if the Emperor intends to lead that army, which he gathers against the Turk, to another place? I know his cunning.</p>
      <p>The assembly will be in Ensisheim. All prelates, nobles with the cities, have been summoned. The King requests soldiers and money.</p>
      <p>The dukes... must be present with full authority.</p>
      <p>All of Lorraine favors the Emperor and wants to pursue the French as an enemy; and this has been concluded by the nobles of Lorraine at the Emperor's instigation. If the weather had not been rainy, I would have sent you the sessions of Trent; but soon I will send them back through a certain citizen of Basel, who will soon ascend to you. Our Oporinus is in great danger because of Nausea's pamphlet. May Nausea perish with his pamphlets. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 28, 1552. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>The Brabantine soldier has been gathered, but where he will go is still unknown. He is undoubtedly heading to Paris, unless the king opposes him with a stronger army. But he will harass the Swiss.</p>
      <p>Hastily at night.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger of the Zurich church, his most esteemed in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
