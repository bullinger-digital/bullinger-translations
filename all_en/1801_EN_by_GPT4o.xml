      <p> Greetings. It is hardly believable how much joy my heart felt when I received the letters you recently wrote to me, dear brother, most esteemed friend, and that for many reasons, believe me; for soon after receiving the lamentable news of your severe illness, by which the Lord tested you in a remarkable way, I wept bitterly, not primarily for you, but for the church and our own situation; for I seemed to perceive that the Lord was plainly angry with us, who in such a turbulent and deplorable age would want to deprive us of your ministry and render the church, already afflicted in many ways, even more wounded. I had no doubt whatsoever about your faith and holy hope in the promises of God, that your spirit would aspire with open arms to attain the joys that never perish; for I know and experience daily how burdensome the corruptible body is to a faithful soul. But it seemed harsh to me, the judgment of the Lord afflicting our ingratitude, to which a great deal of sorrow was added in my heart over the departure of such a holy brother, whose friendship I had relied on for so many years for various benefits of body and soul in the Lord. Therefore, utterly dismayed in spirit, I turned directly to the Lord, and began to beseech Him with many constant prayers for this present evil to the church and to us. Meanwhile, my wife and daughter wept together. I, in turn, urged them to pray. Meanwhile, I inquired of as many from Z端rich as I encountered about the nature and state of your illness; some said you were lying gravely ill, others said you had somewhat regained your strength. Gradually, my spirit began to breathe again, now it fell again. By persisting in prayer, I persuaded myself to see the Lord as favorable, as one who would hear my prayers. While I was anxiously pondering these things within myself, the Father of mercies, God, sent a woman from Z端rich to Lenzburg. She publicly proclaimed before many, including the prefect of our castle and city, that the Lord was appeased towards the Z端rich church and that you had been somewhat restored to your former health and that she had heard you preaching from the sacred pulpit. Oh, what joy you would have seen creeping into our hearts, we all gave thanks to the Lord for such a benefit bestowed upon us and His church. There were about twenty women present, some very pious, some went into jubilation, others into tears of joy. Moreover, on the very next day, namely January 28th, the Lord confirmed this joy of ours with your letters, which nothing could have been more pleasing to me, your Gervasius. I thank you for the sent booklet, incomparable friend; I handed another to the prefect, which you should not doubt he received with a grateful heart, my brother; for he loves you and venerates you as a chosen minister of God. I eagerly await the Latin booklet of evangelical history; I will take care to send it to you as soon as I have found a notary. </p>
      <p> Concerning the rumor spread by a certain scoundrel, there is no need for you to be anxious, brother; they are vain, as they say, making an elephant out of a fly, those who wish the fragrance of our aroma to stink in the sight of the pious. Yet you do well, as a friend, to diligently warn me; for various snares are laid for me. </p>
      <p> But the Lord has preserved me thus far, whom I know will continue to do so. As for the affairs of the Emperor, which you say have taken the pace of a crab, I hope they are the beginnings of sorrows for all who wish to lull the glory of Christ. I have heard the same from some great men of Italy, who invited me to Lenzburg to their hospitality. Count von Mansfeld is coming with a great army to aid the French. There is a rumor that the King of England is gathering an army to support the maritime cities. The prefect of our castle, von Diesbach, wishes to be informed by you, who knows the English affairs to be not a little known. Kindly receive the present bearer in my name (for he is known to you as the prefect of our city). I, with my wife and children, am moderately well. May the Lord God preserve you, returned to us as if by postliminium, safe for a long time. </p>
      <p> Farewell, incomparable friend. The prefect also wishes you many heartfelt greetings. Given on January 30th, in the year 1553. </p>
      <p> The messenger hastens his departure; if there is any error, forgive it. My wife and daughter greet you in a thousand ways. </p>
      <p> Yours, Gervasius. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, the most vigilant bishop of the Z端rich church, Heinrich Bullinger, lord brother and most esteemed old friend. </p>
