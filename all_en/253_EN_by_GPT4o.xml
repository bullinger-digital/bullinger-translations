      <p>S. D. Today I received your letters, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, which you sent to me through the messenger from Kempten. I am immensely grateful for your care, as much as I can be; I do not ask that your magistrate now provide me with anything to cover the expenses of travel or sustenance. Therefore, I would not want you to initiate anything with him on that account; rather, you will assist my affairs if, with the care and vigilance of the brothers who are with you, you look out for a house for me and mine with you, after Froschauer's has been rented to others. Then, if any opportunity for ecclesiastical ministry arises, do not neglect it.</p>
      <p>The expenses of travel will burden me if they have to be repeated often; I have paid 24 florins for the transport of my belongings from Constance to here; if I am forced to bear such expenses again and again, I would face a considerable lack of necessary sustenance, as you can easily understand. I beg through Christ, whose ministers we are, as I hope, not entirely unfaithful, that in this exile you will consider me and mine, not anxiously and precipitously, but maturely and as conveniently as you can. As soon as my wife recovers, I will move to you, unless the Lord overturns this plan of mine with evident necessity; for I have long since entrusted myself entirely to His providence, and so I have decided to acquiesce in all things. My wife is now beginning to recover a little from a severe and almost fatal illness, so there is hope of her soon regaining health. It is very pleasing that you sent my declaration to Lord and Brother Haller, not only because it may make room for a calling, which I neither anxiously seek in that church prone to contentions nor stubbornly refuse when offered, but also because I think it may cause the brothers to dismiss any sinister suspicion of me and judge my mind more rightly and truly; for I can testify through Christ that no gross carnal and superstitious opinion and thought about the Lord's Supper, indeed about the whole remaining cause of Christ, can be conceived that I do not detest in my heart worse than a dog or a snake, whether it be papistic, Anabaptist, Schwenckfeldian, or perversely Lutheran.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens regarding the calling, I commend it all to Christ my Savior, whom I have served in His gospel with whatever faith and sincerity I could. I am concerned only that the brothers, whom I recognize in the Lord and to whom I wish to be joined and of whose doctrine and religion I think well, do not labor under any sinister suspicion of me. For as I am not greatly troubled by the judgment of impious men and enemies of the gospel of Christ about me, so I wish to please the good and pious, both faithful and ministers of Christ. For this purpose, I left that declaration of my writings with you when I departed; if it does not seem sufficient to you, I beg you, for the sake of our friendship, to indicate what else you or others desire. I will respond sincerely and candidly, as befits one who wishes to adhere to the truth of the Lord's words to the end, whatever fate may befall in this most wicked age.</p>
      <p>Even if I had never heard a word about the Emperor's plan against you, I would not at all doubt that the rumor, which is spread not only among you but also throughout Germany, is entirely true. Believe me, he is aiming at nothing less than to bring the freedom of Germany under his feet; he knows he cannot achieve this unless he subjects your people to his yoke. For he knows that it will remain in Germany as a kind of leaven of freedom and will, by its example, if nothing else, incite the rest of Germany to recover its former freedom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be vigilant and regard all his actions with suspicion, I say all, not only manifest deeds but also whatever may be attempted obliquely, even sweet words, with which he is accustomed to deceive, until he finds a way to ensnare the unwary.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Greet your wife, the rest of the household, and the brothers in my name and that of mine.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 1st of September, 1548.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, dearest lord and brother in Christ. Zürich.</p>
