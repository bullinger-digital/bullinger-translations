    <p xml:id="regest1">Because after the Second Kappel War, his income was reduced by Abbot Ludwig in Einsiedeln, the officials Peter Meyer, Ulrich Stoll, and Hans Bleuler granted him an improvement of eight guilders from the church property of Hombrechtikon in April; the community, which was displeased with this, has now terminated him on May 1st. He requests an assessment of his case in the synod, also a hearing of the [representatives] from Hombrechtikon, and a transfer to another parish. [Prefixed remark:] The benefice income amounts to only 32 pieces; Vogt Bleuler and others are informed about the church property.</p>

      <p>The benefice has in total no more than 32 pieces. The church property is well known and known to my lord and bailiff, Master Hans Bleuler, and also to other lords.</p>
      <p>Salvation through Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Honorable, wise lord and brother, I inform you, after we have discussed together regarding the benefice at Hombrechtikon, how it could be helped, I inform you that a gracious lord at Einsiedeln, before the Kappel War, gave me from the tithe he has at Hombrechtikon, 14 measures of grain, 4 eimers of wine, and 1 malter of oats. But after our misfortune, this was reduced and weakened, and now he gives me 9 pieces from the tithe, which serve the benefice, and the tenth piece, which he also gives, is taken by the church or the church mayor at Hombrechtikon. This is not yet sealed, but otherwise written, that these pieces should be mine alone as long as I remain at Hombrechtikon, and not to another. Therefore, dear Master Heinrich, if from Einsiedeln your benefice, which is promised to our gracious, wise lords, cannot be helped further at that place, I know no further income. Also, our gracious, wise lords, namely Master Peter Meyer, Master Ulrich Stoll, Master Hans Bleuler, our lord and bailiff in the office of Grüningen, have been appointed by an honorable, wise council and have dealt with Stefan regarding the benefice and my sustenance and told the church mayors and those who are with them that they should give me 8 guilders from the church property for improvement, because at Hombrechtikon the benefice has been redeemed from the farmers with 14 measures of grain, 3 heads of grain, and 2 quarters of grain. And as our dear lords, an honorable, wise lord mayor and a seated council, have sent a letter to the community at Hombrechtikon that they should give me these 8 guilders, and namely the letter states, every Lent 2 guilders, they have discussed and decided that they do not have it and the church cannot afford it, and if they must give it, they must give it from their own money. Therefore, it was Hans Krawer's advice, who is now almost the oldest in the community and a married man, that the community should give me leave, etc. This has been followed, and the farmers, behind the bailiff's back, without the knowledge of my gracious, faithful, dear lords, have now given me leave on the feast of Philip and James for the reason of the eight guilders and also think they are lords over the benefice, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I request that I be presented and censured and also hear from the farmers why they have acted in such a way. I also kindly ask, dear Master Heinrich, the same of Masters Löw, and other faithful brothers and especially my gracious, wise lords for the sake of God's honor, that you may exchange or cover for me for a while or perhaps place me in another location, I ask all brothers for God's sake. Also, whatever my lords command me, the same an honorable synod, I will kindly accept and be obedient and submissive to my gracious lords of Zurich in all ways as before.</p>
      <p>Dated the 7th day of May, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>From me, Conradus Spörli of St. Gallen, a poor servant of the word of God at Hombrechtikon. God be with us all. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to Master Heinrich Bullinger, and also to all other pious and learned brothers of the entire chapter, to be heard on the next Tuesday, the ninth day of May, etc.</p>
