    <p xml:id="regest1">Has obtained the requested information from [Paul] Fagius; although he does not want to publish a Hebrew Bible, he does intend to publish the Psalms commentary and the dictionary by David Kimchi and praises Elijah Levita, who has come to Isny. Schuler is doing well. Memmingen is not represented at the Worms Religious Discussion, but [Martin] Frecht reported on the opening of the meeting by Granvelle, the planned procedure, a friendly conversation between the Bishop of [L'Aquila, Bernardo Sanzio] and Calvin, signs of moderation among the opponents, and a newly appeared star. On December 5, Frecht wrote that although the opponents had shown willingness to understand, it remains to be seen whether they would demand submission and undermine the open discussion; Melanchthon has drafted a dialogue on the expected negotiation positions. Frecht further reported that Eck had a prostitute with him; the unchaste clergy celebrated a Mass of the Holy Spirit but wanted to act against it. According to Melanchthon, Luther will express his views on the question of restitution in a new book. The envoys from Ulm reported on the disunity of the opponents; the Protestants, on the other hand, unanimously reject concessions and distrust the Emperor, who issued a tyrannical edict in Brabant. Recently, it has been heard that the discussions have now begun. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Seven articles with conditions for holding the religious discussion, as proposed by the negotiators on November 26.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ, our common Savior.</p>
      <p>I received, dearest brother, the letters you sent to the procrastinator, that is, your Gervasius, from that baker. Upon receiving them, I immediately wrote to Fagius, the Bishop of Isny, who is very closely connected to me in Christian friendship, and inquired about what was being printed with his help. He replied to me in these words: "I am not printing any Hebrew Bible" (I quote his words), "but the Perusch R.D.K. on the Psalms with the Book of Roots" etc. He further added: "Elijah Levita came to me 14 days ago, truly very skilled in the Hebrew language and wonderfully kind, easy-going, and ready for anything, whose work will undoubtedly benefit me greatly. He brought with him excellent books, which I am now preparing for the press" etc. So much from Paul Fagius. Therefore, my Bullinger, if I can serve you in this matter with the man Fagius, who is entirely mine and eager to support your studies, I am ready, as you have Gervasius as an old friend, most willing to fulfill your wishes.</p>
      <p>I and my family are doing very well through the Lord. None of ours went to Worms, because no one was called; but I think you are not unaware of what is happening there. However, I send, as an addition, what Frecht wrote to me these days, whose words are inserted here: "On November 22, the Emperor's envoy from Granvelle came to Worms. He summoned both parties, acted as the Emperor's representative while presiding in the chair. In Latin, he wished health to the assembled in the name and on behalf of the Emperor, as is customary, and then ordered the reading of the credential letters and the mandate given by the Emperor in his person. After this, he delivered a rather eloquent speech, passionately exhorting to concord, declaring that he would act with utmost faith and integrity in the future proceedings. He also said in his speech with clear words: 'The poison spreads more widely, and faith, weakened by its own evils, now draws nothing but its last breaths.' On the 26th, however, the four presidents summoned both parties and prescribed a certain form of future action according to the decree of Haguenau, which you have here. There will be 11 votes from each side in the colloquy. The Bishop of Aquileia is there, who recently called Calvin to him and spoke with him so amicably that one might swear he had already become a Lutheran. He greatly praised Calvin's book, which he titled Institution, as if this book should be accepted and approved by all Papists and Lutherans as a friendly and certain medium of concord. The prodigious names Nausea, Mezentius, Cochlaeus, and Pelargus, about which someone joked: 'The names are almost to be feared by their very sound.' They are beginning to soften, especially Pelargus, who is said to have recently told his Dominicans that eight days before he came to Worms, he was of a different opinion against the Lutherans, namely that nothing should be attempted with them for the sake of concord, but now he sees that a middle way must be taken, which is to forgive the Lutherans everything for the sake of peace except for both species and the marriage of priests. A new star has appeared in Worms; for a star shining after lunch, and as others want and interpret, a comet was seen; perhaps the Scots and the blind will be enlightened, and the kingdoms of the Antichrist will be changed."</p>
      <p>On December 5, the same Frecht returned letters, the main points of which are: "It is a strange thing that at first, before the four presidents orally, then before Granvelle in writing, the adversaries did not refuse the colloquy, but, as they claimed, ardently requested it, but from November 27 until this day, what they consult, deliberate, compel, fix and unfix, after our people offered the confession and apology in German and Latin to the four presidents. Another apostolic envoy, from Modena, arrived these days; what news he brought from Italy is still uncertain, except that our people suspect the Romans will proceed Roman-style, that is, first demand submission from us, in German: that we surrender ourselves to grace and disgrace. But we will proceed in the Lord in German and openly protest that it was not our fault that we did not act as freely as possible in the colloquy. Therefore, we must wait to see what kind of response the adversaries will give us, who, as we suspect, will leave nothing untried to avoid a free colloquy under some pretext. Perhaps they will want to proceed in writing, not orally. You see, my brother, the cunning and various forms of Satan. Philipp Melanchthon has composed a dialogue on this matter, which I write to you alone" (all are Frecht's words), "which he will give when he has leisure, in which four persons will present four judgments and opinions that can prevail in this assembly.</p>
      <p>Some whisper about Eck that he called an elegant little prostitute from Mainz to Worms, which a certain canon from Mainz gave him. Our envoys heard this to be true from the mouth of the servant of the envoy of Duke Heinrich of Meissen and Saxony, etc., who was in the same inn where this Thais was with Eck's attendant" etc. Frecht also writes: "Today, on the day of Nicholas, the bishop of the Nicolaites with his people will sing a solemn Mass of the Spirit, to act against the Holy Spirit, and perhaps the colloquy will begin after a few days.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon, the most constant and learned soldier of Christ, told me when I asked when Luther would publish something, that Luther is writing about restitution, a book he hopes will be sent to him here from Wittenberg. Luther asks the Papists to first restore the true doctrine and economy of the Church of Christ, then the shed blood of the pious, and finally the goods of the Church. When I obtain a copy of this book, I will see that you also have it.</p>
      <p>We are waiting for when the adversaries will finally want to start the colloquy after so many preliminaries." So much from Frecht's letters.</p>
      <p>The envoys of the people of Ulm, who are in Worms, write to our senate that the Papists are not so well united among themselves. There are great dissensions among them. Our people are most closely united in the Lord, not willing to concede an iota to the adversaries. The Emperor is exceedingly angry against the Gospel; in Brabant, his cruelty and tyranny are testified by public edict. Meanwhile, he pretends with us to want to enter into a Herodian pact, etc.</p>
      <p>While I write this, I hear the colloquy has begun, but I have nothing certain from Frecht yet. I expect daily to hear what has been done further. Perhaps these things are also known to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord together with your holy family. Greet in my name Leo Jud and all the other brothers who have deserved well of me.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, December 14, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To my lord and dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Order of the colloquy: On November 26, after lunch at the third hour, the parties were summoned to the town hall by the presidents in the absence of Lord Granvelle, and the articles were proposed, in which the form of the future colloquy was comprehended:</p>
      <p>1. That the electors and other orders of the empire appointed for this colloquy each appoint one, two, or three deputies, by whom this controversy may be discussed, but in such a way that the deputies of each state are granted only one vote and that those to be appointed for the discussion are named.</p>
      <p>2. That the legates of the royal majesty be admitted to this colloquy, but in such a way that equality in votes is maintained and that in the other powers of the empire, if requested by anyone, it is free to attend the colloquy.</p>
      <p>3. Since in the Haguenau assembly a certain number of persons and a certain mode of proceeding were prescribed, and according to which this colloquy should be instituted, they decided not to deviate from it.</p>
      <p>4. Since the colloquy should not be obligatory and decisive, they decided that nothing should be conclusively determined here by the greater part of the votes, but that the votes of persons in a certain number should be used for this, so that it may be known to whom it pertains, and that something certain may be referred to the Emperor.</p>
      <p>5. As for the king's legates, they decided to join them to the Emperor's orator, Lord Granvelle, so that with him they have only one vote.</p>
      <p>6. That there be an equal number of notaries for both parties, but that they be named now. Also, that each party have only two, and that those four notaries be bound by oath to faithfully record everything, so that they may be referred to as certain and trustworthy acts. Furthermore, that they provide copies and exemplars of the acts, if requested, provided it is not outside the number of deputies, and that they disclose the acts of this colloquy to no one except their magistrates. Finally, that nothing be published until a report has been made to the imperial majesty about the agreements and acts of this colloquy.</p>
      <p>7. As for the cause itself, to avoid ambiguities, they decided that certain articles of their confession be presented by the Protestant orders, but that they be so moderated that they may be probable and acceptable, so that an agreement may be reached by fair and convenient means.</p>
      <p>They added these articles to the presidents, having conferred with Lord Granvelle, and that he approved this mode of proceeding.</p>
      <p>Deliberation is being held on these by both parties. Our people requested a copy of their articles, then a certain hour of the following day to be designated, at which they may respond to the present articles.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, lord and brother in Christ, always to be revered.</p>
