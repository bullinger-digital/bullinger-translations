      <p> Greetings. Dear brother, I received your three letters, to which I have not responded due to my immense labors, which have hindered me. For when the frequent Easter sermons had exhausted me, I was then burdened with the inspection of schools, examinations, and reviews. These, not yet fully completed, are followed by the synod, not to mention many other things. I am returning the letters of the most distinguished and faithful man, Ruinella, and I urge you to act with your usual faith before the magistrate on behalf of the faithful in the Valtellina Valley, encouraging them to oppose the most impure and violent efforts of the monks, and to do so in time, lest that intolerable tyranny incite new movements and lead the banners of the peasants into the field with great inconvenience. </p>
      <p> It would be more just to imprison a monk who is marauding in foreign lands and to take judgment against him than for punishment to be tyrannically imposed on Francisco Cellario, who was not guilty, and taken from his own land. It is said that the monks would then be found guilty of some offense in foreign lordship. </p>
      <p> I deeply grieve for our Lentulus. May the Lord console him and restore him to his former health! Greet him in my name. New assemblies have been scheduled in Baden for May 9, if I remember correctly. </p>
      <p> The case of the people of Schaffhausen will be addressed, and then about those who, siding with the Spanish, are trying to lead Swiss soldiers into Belgium, contrary to those siding with the French. The gifts of princes and the degeneration from our ancestors are destroying us; we were Trojans, etc. I am written from Bern that war has been publicly declared in Paris and that the greatest disturbances arise daily in France, the king being deprived of money, exhausted by long wars and the greed of plunderers. The Elector Palatine is said to have returned from Maastricht with nothing accomplished: Uranus is nevertheless progressing successfully in Zeeland and Holland. There are whispers of a new army being led into France from Germany for the discontented. For those who have been called Huguenots are now called discontented by those who join the Huguenots from the Catholics and are discontented that so many Italians dominate in France and that the king has weakened them with taxes, etc. All of England is at peace; but the cost of living there is unheard of, etc. Ernest VÃ¶geli in Leipzig printed a book on the Lord's Supper for a certain Silesian under a false title; therefore, he was imprisoned by the Elector. </p>
      <p> Some of the more distinguished scholars from Wittenberg have fled. I do not yet fully understand the whole matter, I am expecting letters. The people of Heidelberg have published a confession against the slanders of Schmidelin. In short: there is a remarkable exacerbation and confusion from the unfortunate eucharistic contention. It is the punishment of sin that open truth is so shamelessly attacked. - I am eager to hear from you what is happening in Italy and what is being reported about the Turkish fleet. </p>
      <p> Farewell with all our lords and friends. In great haste, Zurich, on St. George's Day, 1574. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin, my dear lord and brother. Chur. </p>
