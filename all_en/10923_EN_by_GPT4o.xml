      <p>Greetings. I believe you understand what the response from Bern is, from the letter written by the public notary.</p>
      <p>Every day, I am more and more pleased with the friendship established with you in the Lord. I know that Christ the Lord will not abandon us, nor will we fall from the truth.</p>
      <p>Regarding the few things we discussed about the Incarnation, I ask that you consider them more diligently. It is a great and sublime matter, and the whole thing about the mediator is extraordinary and wondrous, who places himself between God and man. Therefore, there will be many things here that do not immediately occur to us. I ask that you apply yourself diligently.</p>
      <p>Melchior has begun the plan to go to Wittenberg. He has my Nikolaus as a companion according to his wishes. He asks that you inquire about this matter. I truly believe it will be beneficial for him. The school is now equipped with new generosity from the prince for professors of all kinds, and to hear Philipp alone, you see how worthwhile it is. The young men would like to go to the fair now. Thus, it is easy to go down and with fewer expenses. You will expedite the business for the excellent young man there with his family.</p>
      <p>I want you to greet all the brothers diligently, each by name, for me. I admire them all greatly. You will greet Theodor more than diligently, more than once, and also Doctor Engelhard, etc.; our little lion out of order. I am waiting for you to respond to me about this question of the Incarnation in a joint letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>August 22.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend and patron.</p>
