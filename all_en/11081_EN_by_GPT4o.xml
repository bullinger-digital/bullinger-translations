    <p xml:id="regest1">Lorenz Meyer is to speak to the conscience of Geißmeier's daughter in Girsberg [Waltalingen, Canton of Zurich], as she frivolously denies having promised marriage to the son of the old man who is delivering the letter; he should also cautiously inquire about the mother's attitude. Meyer will highly appreciate this service.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>This good old man has a matrimonial case, in which I understand your assistance is needed. For the daughter of Geißmeier from Girsberg has pledged her faith to his son. Now, as far as I understand, she is pretending and would like the deeds to be undone. But you, in your piety, know that a pledged faith, especially in marriages and betrothals, should not be broken lightly. Therefore, you will make an effort to remind her of her duty, so that she may be cautious not to pollute her conscience with treachery. A small spark hidden in the tinder of conscience can sometimes ignite an incredible fire in a person. Perhaps the girl, too credulous, believed the informers too much. If she has pledged her faith, let her trust God more and stand by her agreements. I do not hear that anything was done here without the mother's knowledge. Perhaps she is unaware of her daughter's regret. Nevertheless, you will prudently inquire into all these matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 9th of September, 1537.</p>
      <p>Whatever diligence you bestow upon this old man, I will consider it bestowed upon me.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Lorenz Meyer, the most vigilant pastor of Stammheim and by far the dearest brother.</p>
