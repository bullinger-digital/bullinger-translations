      <p>What you have enjoined, illustrious Bullinger, I have carried out most diligently. On the 5th of June, I sent your letters to Wolfgang Mösel, my dearest father, through a soldier, but I did not receive a response. However, on the 9th of this month, Zwick and I are invited to a conversation. On that day, I will receive a response and news from him. For now, I am sending enclosed what news he has given me, through the aforementioned soldier. On the condition that you return it by his hand. Unless it is necessary, I care little. However, I would not want everything to be made public. Besides, you are greater than I can repay with any services. I do what I do out of duty, I acknowledge you as a teacher and patron and I desire to please you as well as all good and pious people. Therefore, hope for all good things from me through the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Stein am Rhein, June 6th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Georg Wimpfer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, archbishop of the Zurich church, his patron.</p>
