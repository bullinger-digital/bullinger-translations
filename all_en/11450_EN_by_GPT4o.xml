    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a book gift and for the friendly reception of the [Briton recommended by him]. Answers his question about the organization of the school system [in Marburg] and reports in detail about the structure of the studies as well as about the scholarship institution. In Haguenau, where [Landgrave Philipp] has sent him, the religious question has not yet been negotiated; names theologians present from both parties. Asks for intercession.</p>

      <p>Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace to you through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit. The book, which you, dear Bullinger, sent me as a gift, I had already purchased before your letter was delivered to me. Nevertheless, it was most welcome, as it was published by you, such a great minister of Christ, for the edification of the churches of God. Therefore, I give eternal thanks for this gift, and for your kind reception of the Briton pilgrim, for which you will undoubtedly receive a reward from the generous promise of our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The order of our school (for you wished to have it described to you) is as follows: A literary school has been established, in which elementary boys are taught, who, when they have advanced to the point of being suitable for grammar lectures, move down to the pedagogium - as it is called in the old manner - where they learn the basics of the arts of grammar, dialectics, and rhetoric. Furthermore, they learn the basics of the Greek language and the method of writing letters and poems, as well as the easier preludes of music. In this pedagogium, they are also required to sleep, and if they commit any faults, they are punished with rods. Once they have been exempted from this place, they undergo a more liberal way of living through a public examination, yet they are still required to attend lectures according to their capacity and progress in literature, including grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, arithmetic, and the Greek language. And before they are admitted to the mastership of the liberal arts, they listen for a certain period to moral philosophy, natural philosophy, Hebrew letters, and subjects related to geography and cosmography. Masters of the arts are free to listen to either sacred literature, jurisprudence, or medical precepts. For our prince supports here with a liberal stipend three professors of theology, as many jurists, and two doctors. This is the system, this is the order of this academy.</p>
      <p>Moreover, several poor young men are supported here by the generosity of our most gracious prince, whose number will in time grow to one hundred and thirty-six. They inhabit a college, live at a common table under the supervision and administration of the college. Before the morning lectures, they pray, and they close the evening ones with prayer; at the table, they read the Bible in order, and besides the ordinary lectures, they listen to a sacred lecture every day. On Sundays, led by the administrator, they enter the church together for public sermons and participate in the Lord's Supper. After the Sunday meal, someone preaches in order, first in Latin, then in German. One of their number reads the Pauline Epistles in Greek and interprets them in Latin.</p>
      <p>Here you have the description of our school's institution, which, although it is somewhat orderly decreed, we still have corrupt young men who cause us much trouble, whom it is not proper to neglect, but very difficult to restrain.</p>
      <p>Our most illustrious prince has ordered me, along with his counselors, to attend the assembly in Haguenau, where so far, as far as I know, nothing is being done to resolve the religious dissensions. The bishops of Germany are present in large numbers.</p>
      <p>Faber, the Bishop of Vienna, whom you know, Cochlæus, Nausea, Pelargus, and some others I do not know, are in charge. From our side, Bucer, Osiander, Blaurer, Brenz, Doctors Wenzelaus of Nuremberg, Balthasar of Tübingen, Master Peter Geltner, Johannes Pistorius, Sneppius, etc., are present; I did not observe the order of either age or learning, but noted the names as they occurred to memory.</p>
      <p>Farewell and kindly consider these my trifles. Commend me and all of us here to the prayers of your church, that the Lord may grant us confidence and strength to profess His holy gospel and to persevere in that profession.</p>
      <p>Given at Haguenau, the day before the calends of July 1540. Yours with all my heart,</p>
      <p>Gerhard Geldenhauer (Noviomagus).</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, teacher and most beloved brother in Christ, etc. Zurich.</p>
