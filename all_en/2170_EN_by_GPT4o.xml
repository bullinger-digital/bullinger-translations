      <p>Most honorable lord, the day before yesterday I received your package by post with the letters of Lord Vergerius. Now this one has been brought to me, which you will find inside here with another from the king, from where I do not know. I have nothing new. The lord ambassador is soon to return. If there is anything that I can do in your name during his absence, command, my lord, and you will find me prepared, and if any news occurs to you, please inform him, whom I shall send first. Farewell, my esteemed lord. Given on the 25th of January.</p>
      <p>Yours in all respects most observantly, Robert Le Gras. To the excellent and most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
