      <p> Greetings. You, my reverend father, satisfy us abundantly. I am aware of your occupations, I consider your health and age; moreover, I am not ignorant of who I am; therefore, it is no small thing for such a great man as you to deal with me so paternally, so that you wish me to be ignorant of none of those things which indeed it is in the interest of the republic for me to know. What should I write? Italy is closed to us because of the plague, which is infesting Chiavenna; how anxiously the Italians fear the plague, you know. This one thing is reported from there: the Count of Mirandola fears the Pope, whom he considers hostile because he does not act harshly enough against the Lutherans. Thus, someone writes to our people from the Count's court, to Carlinus, whom he asks to inform him what the people of Ems are planning, whether they are preparing soldiers; for he thinks it is so. Then the Pope gave his sister's daughter to another, who is also from the family of the Count of Mirandola, and promised to help him in winter around Mirandola. - The envoy of Philip has departed again and proposed nothing publicly; but in clandestine councils, he attempted many things. Therefore, I can write nothing certain except this one thing: as far as I can conjecture and perceive from not obscure indications, I sense as much as I recently wrote. All the magnates are focused on this alliance, the common people are furious except for the Upper League, which openly favors Philip. Therefore, I think by the counsel of the magnates he has now suspended all action, until the movements and tumults subside. His return is certainly expected. Now the envoy of France has arrived. Thus, I am continually distracted by new affairs and gradually wear out. I doubt whether I can ever achieve the desired end of my studies amidst so many troubles. What he seeks is not obscure; but he has proposed nothing yet. He came yesterday for the first time; in the meantime, I have not met the consul. I have read the acts of Baden. - I recently wrote about Vergerio's business and I hope all those things have been delivered to you, etc. But to those evils, another is added. Yesterday, Vergerio's servant, who takes care of the horses, stirred up very great disturbances. Both consuls and other great men, who were returning home from the royal envoy's dinner, came upon the scene with swords drawn from all sides. Finally, Vergerio's servant, who broke the peace three times, was apprehended and taken to prison; he struck the host and uttered inappropriate words against the consuls, so that the consuls told me they had not had a more inappropriate affair in 30 years. Thus, the good old man falls from one evil into another. This year, Aurelius, his nephew, started quite a wild affair here; we all helped to separate and speak the best. He insulted the bishop and refused to pay, etc., when he was supposed to pay the toll at the bishop's bridge; indeed, he said he would not pay the toll; for all priests are thieves and worse than murderers, etc. We helped him get away. Afterwards, when Vergerio was led over the Sätmer and scratched as much as possible, he let it be known in the Pergäl that the muleteers were scoundrels. For this, he was fined 7 crowns. And thus the old man, along with his servants, wants to say everything that comes to his mouth. Now we part powerfully; I fear, however, it will become too much for them, etc. These things suddenly, lest I write nothing. Farewell, reverend father. I received letters from the consul; he wonderfully praised your humanity. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Chur, April 24, 1564. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and eternally honorable father in Christ. Zurich. </p>
