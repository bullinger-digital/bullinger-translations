      <p>Greetings, most reverend father. If I doubted your excellent piety, humanity, and wisdom, or if I did not promise myself all the most certain things about them, I would now use more words in excusing this my action, namely that I, an obscure man and scarcely even known to you by name, except insofar as my Nuremberg friends have mentioned it to you, dare to write to you, a most outstanding man and revered not so much for age as for merits, and to disturb your very serious occupations with this most unlettered letter. However, as I said, I do not think it is necessary for me to do so; therefore, I only ask you, as I am certain you will do, to take this action from a man neither bad nor impious, and who embraces you with the greatest love and reveres you with the highest respect, in the best part, and to count me, hitherto unknown, henceforth among those who do not wish to be unknown to you, and to be willing to promise me without doubt all those things which your most observant can provide at any place and time. After I have prefaced these things, but I have prefaced them from the heart, I turn to the letter itself and ask you very much to be willing to know it gladly. From my early age, I have been most devoted to your most illustrious name, and that, since according to Cicero everything that excels has a just veneration, for many and very great reasons, the recitation of which, lest I be too lengthy, I omit here, I have held in high regard. I have also diligently and with the greatest benefit read your writings, by which you have wonderfully adorned the Christian republic partly by teaching and partly by fighting against wolves and mercenaries, and for which it will someday receive you into eternal tabernacles, and among my highest wishes, it has always been that by the benefit of God it might be granted to me to behold and kiss your venerable gray hairs. Although this has not yet happened to me, I could not do otherwise than to comply with my mind most desirous of you and to soothe my desire with this kind of writing, conceiving the most certain hope that you will take all these things in the best part and will be of a paternal mind towards me henceforth, whether I have been absent from you or have at some time greeted you in person (which I wish may happen to me) and will show this to me. Therefore, I add nothing further, lest I seem to doubt your humanity and, what is granted by words, now to have taken away in reality. Moreover, I send to you enclosed in these letters a list, in which I have recorded the names of some booklets partly published by you and partly by Mr. Vadianus of blessed memory, and since they all have come forth from the workshop of your city, I ask you greatly to be willing to give the task to someone skilled in these matters there, who may seek out these booklets (if I cannot find them elsewhere) with as much diligence, care, and effort as possible, at my expense. Certainly, you will have bestowed upon me a benefit of such a kind, for which I will never be able to give thanks worthy or as much as I would most wish. I am wonderfully delighted and instructed with the greatest benefit by the reading of your writings; but I lack these, whose names I have recorded, and I have indeed been able to use no circumlocution to ask these from you rather than from anyone else, so that I may the better and more rightly become a participant in my wish. As for the booklets of Mr. Vadianus, I can truly affirm to you that these titles, when I first read them in the library of Simler, so pleased me and, as if some love potion, occupied the innermost recesses of my mind, that I never seem to myself, while I live, to be at rest unless I become a participant in them.</p>
      <p>For what, I ask, can be said about this unhappy controversy, about which the disputes in our churches are so implacable, which in these Vadian books these titles so pious and learned do not sufficiently indicate can be found? Then indeed it is especially great that they show what was the rite of the Lord's Supper in the apostolic age, how long it lasted, how and by whom it was later corrupted and depraved in the following age by others, and so on. This indeed, so to speak, historical doctrine has led many most excellent men partly alone into the way of truth from preconceived opinions and inveterate errors, partly, as if admonished by this and awakened from deep sleep, to read the dogmatic writings themselves more correctly and to understand what the matter is. Therefore, you will certainly affect both me and many other good men with a great and plainly immortal and divine benefit, my reverend father, if you have taken care to buy and procure for me these your and Mr. Vadianus's booklets in whatever way you can. Having been purchased, collected into a bundle, and well secured, when you can rightly and safely, send them to Nuremberg either to Mr. Herdesius or Mr. Dornhofer, my greatest men and friends, so that they may keep them until my arrival, about which I will soon write to them. Whatever has been spent either on the books or on the labors of those who make them, I will most liberally pay with a joyful mind and good faith. I wish you to be fully persuaded that this benefit will be most rightly placed. I have received letters these very days from a certain great man in Germany, who has dealt with me about these Vadian books, namely by both praising the titles and wishing that he might someday read them and demanding my effort, as much as I could provide in this part, as much as possible, so that nothing more. This indeed has caused that what I had already intended in my mind, I now do even more eagerly and extensively. You see, my reverend father, what times are now and what calamity is among the Saxons and what evils from this tragedy are impending over all Germany.</p>
      <p>However, I dare to assure you in this regard that at no time have more been found among them who are so eager to know the truth as at this very time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is incredible with what desire that book of Exegesis by Curaeus, my fellow countryman, is demanded and handled by all hands, even though its use is forbidden in the lands of the Duke of Saxony. Thus, it pleases the Lord to show his hidden wisdom. You there, in whatever ways you can, help our people, and let the pity of those who are not thought to have stood most firmly touch you, and try what remedy can be brought by you to these evils. But at last, I make an end of this my letter more prolix than learned and perhaps written against all decorum; for I see that I have not had that regard for your age and your occupations which I ought to have had. You will forgive my goodwill towards you combined with perpetual observance and faith. For this indeed alone has made me prolix.</p>
      <p>If you would like to write back, certainly this would be the greatest and most pleasing thing to me; take care that your letters are delivered to Mr. Beza or Mr. Claude Scheuffelin of Geneva; for thus I will most certainly receive them. I intend to spend this winter in Geneva, where I have recently returned from Italy by the grace of God. When leaving here, when I must return to my Germany, with God's help I will arrange my journey, if I can in any way, so that I may greet you there. I pray to God that he may grant you a green and long old age for the salvation and good of his church according to the promise of the Psalm: "Planted in the house of the Lord, they will still be green in old age." Again and again, I pray that you may have me most commended to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, and write something, if you can through your business, to a man most observant and devoted to you.</p>
      <p>From my study in Geneva, which is in the house of Madame de Normandie in the Place de St. Pierre, October 28, 1574.</p>
      <p>Jacob Monau, Silesian, subscribed, honoring your reverend dignity with all reverence.</p>
      <p>If it is allowed, my father, write back and forgive that I did not write more briefly and accurately.</p>
