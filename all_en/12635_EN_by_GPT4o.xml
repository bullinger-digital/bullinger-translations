    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] and the commentary on Luke dedicated to him. He is all the more grateful, as Bullinger could have dedicated this work to a scholar. As soon as an opportunity arises, Welser will show his gratitude. May God keep Bullinger alive for a long time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The industrial city of Augsburg is very affected by the [war]. Never before has so much effort been made against the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] as now against the followers of Christ and his Gospel. The [Imperials] claim that it must cost [their opponents] property, body, and life. Naturally, this is frightening! However, Welser prays to God to support him with His spirit. The people of Zurich should also pray: for him, for Augsburg, for themselves, and for all who want to remain faithful to the Gospel. The danger is indeed great!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Initially, attempts were made to intimidate the cities to bring them to their knees. But the Lord will preserve His Gospel, especially since others still need to receive it. If God were to remove the Antichrist in Rome, many faint-hearted people would gain great courage. God will certainly not allow the adversary to defeat His own, as His will must be done.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The [Schmalkaldic League] is camped near Donauwörth. [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren, is supposed to join the army of the Emperor [Charles V] today or tomorrow. Allegedly, Augsburg will now be attacked. After the armies unite, more will probably be known about the [Emperor's] plans. It is now important to prove oneself persistent! May God have mercy on His own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Welser thanks for the greetings from the four [Zurich] gentlemen [Hans Rudolf Lavater, Johannes Haab, Hans Escher vom Luchs, Heinrich Rahn] and sends his regards as well.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ from God be with you and us all beforehand.</p>

      <p>Worthy, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, I have received your Christian generous letter along with the book Commentary on the Evangelist Luke, dedicated to me. And although you could have dedicated it much better to someone who is a Latin scholar, I have accepted it with great thanks and appreciation, and I am also most grateful for your kind Christian will towards me. I will strive to repay and reciprocate it if I can. You can be assured of this from me. May the almighty, eternal God continue to let you prosper in His church of Jesus Christ, preserve your life, for the Lord can still accomplish much good through your means. Here, life is truly burdensome, and Augsburg is most affected as an industrial city. Never before has such effort been made against the Turks as now against those who confess Jesus Christ and His holy Gospel purely and sincerely, and yet are still sinners. But for these people, it must cost them property, body, and life, wife and child. It is no less, flesh and blood are frightened, but I will pray to God the Lord that He may grant me the Holy Spirit more and more and preserve me until the end. I ask you to pray for me, the church here, as it stands in the greatest danger, and also to do and let be done for yourselves, your city, and all who adhere to the holy Gospel. For we truly stand here in the greatest danger. May the almighty God stand graciously by us.</p>

      <p>Here, they would like to act tyrannically first, to intimidate all other small cities so that they willingly submit themselves. But the Lord will not regard our misdeeds, but will let His holy Gospel remain out of His merciful will. For it must go further! We are not alone who are worthy of this great grace. Others will also receive mercy from the Lord. Many faint-hearted would be greatly encouraged if the Lord were to remove the Antichrist in Rome [...] until the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is [...] rightly preached. But the Lord will share mercy with us who believe in His Son Jesus Christ and not in the Antichrist, have mercy on us, grant grace that His holy word and those who love and believe in it will not be eradicated as planned, for all is in His hand alone. No matter how much the adversary cries and rages, it will not help if it is not the Lord's will. For His will must and rightly shall be done.</p>

      <p>The entire Christian camp lies near Donauwörth, and Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, is supposed to come to the imperial majesty today or tomorrow. Rumor has it in the field that Augsburg is to be attacked. If he now moves here, the other camp will also move, and in a few days, we will see what his intentions are. The main concern is to endure the situation. May the Lord arrange everything according to His divine will, be gracious and merciful to us.</p>

      <p>I thank all four gentlemen for their great friendliness, and I ask you to greet the gentlemen again and convey my willing service. Thus, I commend myself to you, also to the Lord, our faithful God, always entrusted in His grace.</p>
      <p>Given on the 15th of September 1546, in Augsburg. Yours always willing, Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord and friend, to his hands.</p>
