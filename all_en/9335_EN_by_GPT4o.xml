      <p> Greetings. I thank you, most excellent man and honorable godfather, for informing me and many others who wish for the safety and well-being of the Church of Christ about the affairs in France and the Netherlands. May God grant that all those who are exposed to such great danger may finally be freed, which will undoubtedly happen if first all those whom the Lord has decided to punish for His just judgment and as they have deserved, are completely confounded and crushed by that rock, Christ, who at the appointed time will shatter all impiety. We firmly believe, as you write, that this is the case; for the murmurs of the papists increase and confirm our hope and faith; for they are seen to be more sorrowful than usual. For just as they raise their crests in their own favorable and fortunate circumstances, so now, due to adverse rumors, their spirit fails and falls to their feet. I am sending you here our laws established by our highest magistrate, which were also newly confirmed and augmented in our recent assemblies, not to be a burden to you, but because I know you to be a lover and patron of good laws, and to assure you that we, who serve Christ here, do not spare our labors, I wanted to share them with you, so that, if you wish, you may read them and later return them to me; for there was no leisure for transcribing now, but if you desire, I will most willingly write them out for you in the future, if leisure permits. </p>
      <p> Consider this kindly and live happily. May the Lord keep you and all yours safe according to His holy will. Farewell. The Beldii, the treasurer, Schulerus, and the others greet you. Greet all yours in my name, as well as our fellow ministers and brothers. </p>
      <p> In Glarus, May 27, 1573. </p>
      <p> Johannes Hugo, your godfather. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant minister of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich. </p>
