      <p>Illustrious, noble prince, gracious lord, my humble and willing service is always ready for your princely grace. Gracious prince and lord, this past winter, with the help of God, I have written these 6 books against the Anabaptists for reasons I have explained in the preface. I am sending your princely grace a copy of some books here, with a humble request that your princely grace may graciously accept them from me.</p>
      <p>I have also previously sent some German books, such as the summary of the true religion and the report on the 61 articles, to your princely grace, and that with a very humble, friendly good intention. With the same intention, I am also sending this and for the sake of those reasons, so that your princely grace may clearly see that neither our ancestor in teaching and church service, of blessed memory, Ulrich Zwingli, nor we ourselves have ever associated with the Anabaptists or other sects, nor do we now. We humbly ask that if your princely grace has been informed otherwise about our aforementioned ancestor or us, that your princely grace may not believe such things, but rather hope for better from us and show such a gracious will towards us, your princely grace's favorable and willing servants, as your princely grace's lord father, the illustrious, noble prince and lord, Lord Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, etc., of praiseworthy memory, and also your princely grace's cousin of blessed memory, the noble, etc., Count George, etc., have shown and maintained towards us until their end. For something very burdensome has been undertaken or alleged against our ancestors and us by your princely grace, as we can infer from the regulations printed in Tübingen in the past year 1559 and also this year 1560, which have been issued under your princely grace's name, where we are named among the Anabaptists and other condemned sects, as the Zwinglians by name in the summary and simple concept, etc., on page 228 among the blasphemers... and in the Montbéliard regulations on page 126 with the Servetians, whom we abhor, and are named among the harmful sects. But we hope in God and your princely grace's discretion that our innocence will be sufficiently demonstrated through our other works, also through this book, that we are neither sectarians nor associated with sects, but have a true faith and true Christian teaching, by which we always offer ourselves, where we are taught otherwise and better with biblical scripture, we would gladly accept the better. We ask your princely grace to graciously accept this my writing and book from me and to always have me in your grace; for if I could serve your princely grace, I would always be willing. May God keep your princely grace in His grace at all times, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 28th of March, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, noble prince and lord, Lord Christoph, Duke of Württemberg and Teck, Count of Montbéliard, etc., my gracious prince and lord.</p>
