      <p>S. P. Recently, wearing a hat and boots, I wrote to you, most esteemed man, urging you to send your son to us at any time you wish and to order him to stay with us entirely, very hastily and yet seriously, as I remember. I now repeat the same in this letter, which I entrusted to someone from Konstanz, as I noticed that many others have not yet been delivered to you, who promised me his sincere and complete effort.</p>
      <p>For a quarter of a year has passed, my most respected Mr. Bullinger, since I piously sought advice from you and asked what you would have me do, having been so long among the profane in the detestable worship of abomination, hastening my journey to my homeland solely for the sake of purer doctrine, and there equally discovering the blindness and cunning doctrine of our teachers towards Lutheranism, if I may use the term, defection. Indeed, I confess that I am a native citizen of this city, whose church, at the time I was brought into this valley of misery, was free from all gross and vain altercation, as you knew best of all a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Therefore, already in the eighteenth year of my age, to which this Epiphany I have added a third by divine grace, I rendered myself a member of the common symbol of our church, which was then not yet contaminated in that part. Now having returned, intending to make myself a participant in the same consolation again, I do not know where I should turn, so frivolously are heretics condemned, that unless we were distracted by external contentions and wars, we would undoubtedly draw the sword and iron against ourselves with true zeal. Therefore, now about to visit Italy shortly, believing indeed by divine clemency to eat, yet I would very much like to do so for a long time, nor can I in any way, however eager, come to you, nor infect myself with what my constancy cannot bear, nor would my conscience be violated, nor do I wish to enjoy gratuitous benefits, lest it be truly wicked. Therefore, I implore your help, that you may not hesitate to explain what you wish me to do, which I recall to your memory again because I suspect the previous ones have been lost.</p>
      <p>Behold the concoctions of Jesuit rascals, unworthy of your eyes, but in refuting which some of your disciples will not waste their effort in vain, especially since these true hypocrites, with some feigned erudition, acquire great honors among the ignorant masses. If it were a matter of law or three chapels, which is my profession, I would gladly engage in it. For I have long read among the not ignoble recent interpreters of our law that Jesuits are not religious, that is, true monks, but something new and that they cannot rightfully enjoy ecclesiastical revenues, even if the pope himself dispensed them beforehand. You are not ignorant of some doctrines of Guillaume Postel, the leader of this order, although otherwise, he is a learned man. There is also a booklet among us about their origin, which I have sent to my necessary friends here and there, but I can no longer obtain; however, I have taken care that you have it. For I sent it to Mr. Beza, an excellent man, whom I venerate, love, and honor with all those whose profession in the Christian religion I subscribe to as a client in all things and for all my life. But behold, suddenly a boy, I beg you to impart some small reading to these trifles and then offer it to your disciples to mock. Please deliver the other enclosed ones... and.</p>
      <p>News from the diet is that the king, contrary to the usual custom of the empire, has appointed some select individuals for religious differences, whom our party finds impossible to accept; for he has chosen them from the dregs of the adversaries, making the Duke of Bavaria their president, whom if you do not yet know, at least imagine a drinking beast, who cares neither for God nor anyone else. A man known to you in his court is upright and truly candid, without whom I fear that greater tyranny would be exercised by the beast and gluttons than by the king of France or Spain, although I am compelled to affirm that I would live more freely under either than under this one, to whom other distinguished individuals of the same ilk, like Mr. Jonas, Mr. Lucretius of Brunswick, Salzburg, and others of the same kind, are joined. The Protestants have again openly professed before the king that they will not touch even a jot of the other points until it is left free for anyone throughout the empire without the loss of any goods or dignities... to embrace. If they never demanded this too accurately and ardently, now at last certainly not without some insolence. The Lord has hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he has privately bound himself to leave his kingdoms with only one staff taken up. What happens? The Turk will devour us with his mouth, whom the Venetians report to have never gathered with greater forces by land and sea... to our borders. The margrave is dead and has left behind greater contention over the principality than he himself... believed. Believe me, many crimes are falsely attributed to him, of which he was never aware.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, January 2, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Raphael Sailer from the heart.</p>
