      <p>Greetings. I send you, dearest godfather, the confession of the foreigners in the Church of England and I give thanks to the Lord, who spreads the seed of His most holy word throughout the entire world and gathers His elect to the wedding of His Son. It is truly a marvelous work of His providence and judgment that in these most calamitous times, so many are still found who are driven with great fervor of spirit to embrace the truth.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the letters of the dearest man, Mr. a Lasco, and again I give you immense thanks for sharing everything with us so faithfully. I am now sending you in return our mandate, which I recently promised; you may keep it with you if you wish. The cross has been removed by the French; I hope a heavier one does not follow, which they might be less able to bear! This has been given to them for the sake of peace and tranquility. I received your most learned and eloquent oration on the Council of Trent with joy, and I read it with great pleasure. I wish the world would recognize those practices! But I still hope, by the grace of God, that they will achieve as much there as was predicted for them eight years ago by the one who posted these verses at the Palatine in Rome: "Do you want to know, hypocrisy, what happened at Trent? What Caesar's fleet did in Libya."</p>
      <p>It is our duty to pray to the Lord to confound them, and we will achieve more at home by praying than there, even if it were allowed, which is not to be hoped for, by disputing.</p>
      <p>Regarding your students, I have received them into my household, although I had decided not to take in any more boarders due to the growing number of my children and other cares and businesses that distract me excessively. Nevertheless, I have received them for the sake of the Church of Zurich, to which, as they belong, I also acknowledge that I owe myself and all my belongings. Nothing more is heard about the plague. I immediately forwarded your letters to Calvin, and now, as I write these, his letters directed to you are brought to me. I do not disapprove of the agreement; I wish everyone would embrace it and that contentions would cease!</p>
      <p>Regarding new developments, sad news is brought again, namely that the army of the Cimbri has been divided and dispersed into various parts and that the people of Magdeburg are again under pressure; but so that you may better understand everything, Schertlius writes to Musculus about these matters among other things: "I fear it is true that our troop from there, as you have also heard, is divided, 6 companies along with Duke Moritz have taken off in different directions from Magdeburg, the others have dispersed in the absence of my friend and godfather Mr. Hans von Heideck (who was just in Denmark seeking money and help).</p>
      <p>There was no lack of urging, pleading, and help from me and others, in places where help should have been given; but everyone looks on until one misfortune after another falls. May God arrange it better! It would be no wonder if I became blue" etc. And soon again: "As I was about to leave Basel, I received new news, written by someone from the New City before Magdeburg, that on January 27, Duke Moritz came again before Magdeburg, set up all the camps, that they now had 26 companies of foot soldiers and many riders before the city, occupied the blockhouses better and had set up a new camp in the open field before Magdeburg at a small village, so that it would be impossible for anyone to endure this grim winter time for long.</p>
      <p>In response, the citizens of the city fell out in several thousand strong and attacked them hard; yet they were pressed so hard that the city gates had to be closed against friends and foes and fired so heavily from the city that the enemies were forced to fall into the city moat, in which 200 persons of the enemy, thinking they were Magdeburgers, and an imperial captain remained. Among these, the best soldiers of the landsknecht fell out to the New City, attacked them fiercely; but they had to withdraw back inside without success. Also, Margrave Hans of Brandenburg is highly engaged in reconciling Magdeburg with the emperor, and it is said to be true that Denmark, Sweden, and others are also undertaking amicable negotiations; however, some of their envoys are said to be in Nuremberg and do not want to go to Augsburg without a safe conduct." And he adds: "Much has been offered to the Roman king by the emperor lately, but everything has been rejected, therefore it is thought they will withdraw without leave and not well from each other, the diet is out of order etc." All this he says. These are the new things for us now; if you have other and more certain information, let us know as well.</p>
      <p>Schertli has left for Basel. They have given him time until Invocavit Sunday, beyond which he does not want to stay, he has gone to Aarau to see if he might have a place there; I do not know if it will be granted to him or not.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially my wife and family wish health to you and all yours, whom you will also greet from me along with all the most esteemed lords and brothers. Bern, February 23, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
