      <p>A long-time friend, Daniel Osiander from Basel, was with us these days.</p>
      <p>His arrival brought me great pleasure and joy, as it usually happens when a friend visits a friend.</p>
      <p>However, when I heard that you were again bedridden and suffering from a fever, the joy was extinguished by sorrow. Yet, what could I do here, except to pray to God for you, which I have done and will do daily, not for your sake, but for the salvation of others. Take care also, that you stay well, and do not think of yourself as you once were, that is, a strong and healthy young man and man, but as an old, weak, and retired veteran soldier, whose advice the church needs now more than his labors.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, take care of your health and moderate yourself in your great and usual labors at this age, as is right and as the well-being of many demands.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, that is, August 12th, we excommunicated a certain man from Padua named Antonio Sutor, because, although convicted, he stubbornly insisted that Christ is not the true God and that he wanted to die for this (as he said) truth.</p>
      <p>He said the same about the Holy Spirit; for he claimed only the Father is God. Italy is infected (as I hear) with this heresy; Pelagianism is also spreading among many. You see, into what times we have fallen.</p>
      <p>By God's grace, our church retains a sufficiently pure doctrine, and such fanatical people cannot stay here long.</p>
      <p>However, it will be necessary for this whole region, so that the poison does not spread further, to have some good remedy. I am writing to our Fabricius to devise some remedy, which will be proposed to the lords at the next synod. It would not be useless if you also give some advice after deliberating the matter with the brothers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>It is easy to guess where this evil comes from and by whom it is nurtured: the Spanish hen laid the eggs, the Italian hatched them, and we now hear the chirping chicks.</p>
      <p>They say that Malta is defending itself bravely, for it has received much help and assistance. Every day new soldiers are being gathered in Milan, who will be sent there.</p>
      <p>Everything else is quiet.</p>
      <p>Farewell and bid the brothers farewell in my name. Ulysses sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, August 19, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most observant H[ieronymus] Zanchus.</p>
      <p>Be careful not to give testimony of sound doctrine to our Italians, unless you have a well-considered understanding of their faith concerning God and original sin, about the baptism of infants, etc. To the most illustrious man, Mr. H. Bullinger, most worthy and esteemed father of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
