      <p>I received your letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, which you thought were delivered by Peter, and then your annotations on the Interim, which I arranged to be read to me. Be careful that they do not fall into just anyone's hands because of certain offensive remarks about the Emperor. The rest fully agrees with sound doctrine. I now return them and give you great thanks for sharing them. I sent a little letter through the young Augustine. I am still unable to do anything and cannot go anywhere as my head is still languishing. Our Onophorus Heurusius will diligently explain to you whatever is with us. Regarding the diet, see that you do not hide anything from me, but as soon as possible, so that I may know the state of everything, take care of what should be known for the sake of our mutual love. May your household and all friends be well. I am currently unable to respond to the letters of the excellent old man Schöner, but I will ensure that those addressed to his sister are delivered. Pray for me and our church. I hope to return to the duty of writing soon, as the dizziness is somewhat subsiding. July 27, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>You have seen what the Wittenbergers wrote about the Interim; what Bucer and the people of Strasbourg wrote is now being copied here by our Vadianus, from whom you may request it.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zürich.</p>
