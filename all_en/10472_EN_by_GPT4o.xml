    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's concern. His letters to the people of Constance are also intended for the people of Zurich. Personally delivered Bullinger's letter to Duke Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg, but he could not read it yet due to being busy with other matters. Reviewed the copy and is sending it back. Thanks for "De testamento". Will comply with the admonitions regarding monasteries and studies. German masses will not be introduced because even the people of Reutlingen, as Lutherans, do not know them. The images might also be abolished later. But for now, the Duke is too preoccupied with other matters. Philipp Melanchthon and Osiander have been called, as well as Grynaeus at Blarer's urging. The Duke is God-fearing; at the court, there are only a few. Departure is pressing. Greetings. Soften Leo Jud's harsh writing.</p>

      <p>I am grateful for your most Christian diligence and pious concern, most illustrious Bullinger, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>That I write nothing, you will attribute to my countless occupations - by which, however, I am not overwhelmed. I believe that the writings I send to my people in Constance are also intended for you, although I have only greeted them once or twice. I personally delivered your letter to the prince, who seemed to receive it with an open mind.</p>
      <p>I believe he has not yet read it, as he is occupied with many affairs. He thinks and speaks very highly of you. I have read the copies. The arguments greatly please me, and there is nothing that could offend anyone unless they are completely irritable. I am sending them back with this same messenger.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for what you sent about the unique testament of God. I acknowledge that I am entirely bound to you, and that in many respects. As for your prudent admonitions regarding monasteries and the nurturing of studies and other matters, I will take care of them with the utmost faithfulness, as much as it is in my power.</p>
      <p>German masses will not be instituted, especially since they do not seem to be known even among the neighboring Reutlingers, who are Lutherans. The images themselves, I believe, will also be removed, although everything is delayed because the prince is otherwise very busy.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon has been called, as well as Osiander, that Nuremberger, without me even suspecting it. However, I have persuaded the prince to also invite Grynaeus, to whom I wrote in the prince's name a few days ago. Philipp will not cause us any inconvenience. Many think that Osiander will not abandon his very ample position.</p>
      <p>You diligently pray to Christ, so that he may have his cause well commended. The prince truly fears God and is eager for His glory. However, I desire good men in the court who seek the Lord. For there is scarcely one or two.</p>
      <p>But departure is pressing. Farewell, my esteemed and best brother. Greet your most chaste wife and all the brothers. Soften Leo Jud, who sent me a harsh letter. For I am not to be blamed here, as I have done what I could. The cause did not seem to me to be entirely abandoned because of those thorns.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, and so that I may be Ambrosius, whom you indeed command me to be, obtain it for me through your prayers.</p>
      <p>September 11, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed bishop of Zurich and dearest brother.</p>
