    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter from Bullinger and for his continuous benefactions, from which he benefits so much for his office. Admires Bullinger, whom he wishes to see, and regrets his inadequate education. Due to work overload and physical frailty, he is unable to further his education, which causes him to suffer from the feeling of failing in his office. He receives little help from his colleagues. Description of the distribution of tasks during a week in office. He had no proper understanding of Theodor Bibliander's abilities, otherwise, he would have advocated for his employment in Bern. Looks forward to Bullinger's interpretations of the prophets; has read Hofmeister's remarks on Isaiah. Bullinger's "Ratio studiorum" is being copied. Asks Bullinger for help to keep Jud in Zurich, as Megander would otherwise be easily persuaded to return to Zurich. The council has made a final decision on the question of punishing adultery. Simon Sulzer is coming to Bern. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I received your most welcome letter, dearest Heinrich, in which I continually understand how sincere your spirit is towards me, and with what great love you pursue me, certainly unworthy, as you deign to serve and assist me in all things, as far as you can. You have poured out so many benefits upon me (I mean spiritual ones, as I am in greatest need of them) that unless I recognized you not only as a brother and a true parent but also as a superior in the Lord, I would be utterly ungrateful. Through your learning, you give birth to me daily, making me more learned and more suitable for the function of my ministry, so that after God, I embrace no one more intimately in my heart than you. I regard you as an instrument of the Lord, by which He wishes to enlighten the ignorance of many and to assist the desires of the studious. You will not understand this as if I wish to win you over with flattery and hypocrisy. God is my witness, in whose sight I write this, that my love for you and thus our mutual cause is such that I cannot restrain myself from mentioning our mutual love whenever I write to you. As for your coming to us, I have often thought about it, as you remind me in your letters, namely that the journey is not very safe and your holy occupations are such that you cannot leave them without loss. I have too many temptations, as you write; but they are not according to the flesh, for I have seen you only once in the disputation, when you offered what you had noted in axioms, and if you came to me now, I would not recognize you. Your spirit, which I draw from your letters and books, pleases my spirit and mind, so that whatever I have desired and have desired for many years, I find abundantly in you alone. I confess this with regret: I have never been able to study in my lifetime. Indeed, I have read many things, but since it was without order and reason, they have thus fallen away without fruit. Now, since you depicted the method of study in a letter two years ago, adding now a complete booklet, it is too late for me. I would like to take much in hand, but I do not have the time. I fear it is too late with the languages; however, from the authorized ones, you all generally draw tropes, schemata, Hebraisms, so specifically but sometimes incorrectly. Where should I, a poor servant, go out? I do not know Latin. Therefore, I would like to read the Fathers, your and others' commentaries diligently and with judgment, but now preaching drives me, now the choir court, now the brothers' visits and requests, and I am always ashamed of myself. I become very sick, but by God's grace, not for long. I have a heavy body, am gray, and suffer from a difficult hernia, yet without pain, which I attribute to the Lord. Johannes Fritz knows my illness, whom I once called from Zurich at my expense to prepare a bandage, but he could not, nor could Master Jacob, who was killed in the recent massacre. Thus, I find no doctors who could even prevent it from increasing. So stands my case, my pious Heinrich. My conscience presses me most of all, that I am unfit to stand at such a place for the business of God. Frantz burdens himself with nothing but preaching. Casper, who is now learned, understands the languages, but is not agreeable to the authorities or the community in all things; I cannot see him staying with us. I also cannot learn anything from him, so I must always suffer in my conscience, remain in my ignorance, and fear God badly, that I might scorn something in His business. And to confess to you, I say to you alone, my spirit is not as great towards him as it is towards you, which the Lord may forgive me. I wanted to indicate all this to you in person. Now, since it is not possible, you are compelled to read.</p>
      <p>So stands our order and being: On Sunday, we all three preach, on Monday, Tuesday Frantz, on Wednesday, Thursday Berchtold, on Friday, Saturday Casper. On Monday, Wednesday, Friday, the choir court is held immediately after the sermon, sometimes until 11 or 12, with Casper and me sitting there. On Tuesday and Thursday at eight in the morning, Megander reads Hebrew, Rellicanus Greek, now 3 Kings; there are few listeners, about eight. On Tuesday after lunch, we hold colloquies, the pastors from the countryside come to it, a passage of Scripture is brought to the table; each gives his judgment. On Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the third hour in the afternoon, Rellican reads the New Testament in three languages, and on the same days at 12, he reads Melanchthon's rhetoric; they pay attention, but few understand, except for Casper and himself. Now calculate how much time I have, according to what I need. I also write this so that you may consider how I might best use the time. We have no help for preaching. We have two helpers, but they are not agreeable and not skilled, and they are citizens of the city. Casper keeps his order in his studies free, because he does not go to any preaching except on Sunday after the meal; so he does not have the overflow from the peasants and brothers as I do. Frantz is the most praised, he needs it for his age's sake.</p>
      <p>My pious Heinrich, now do not be annoyed to read these complaints and give me your faithful advice on them. I have no one on earth whom I trust as much as you. He who was my hands and feet, indeed my eyes in Bern for many years, perished in the plague two years ago. Suffer with me for God's sake. I cannot and will not do otherwise.</p>
      <p>Regarding Theodor, I have never informed you. He was in KÃ¶nigsfelden in such a way that I never knew anything about his distinguished skill. I first presented him to the council on Zwingli's blessed command and spoke no more than three words with him, he never wrote me a letter. It is also not without reason that his skill was not revealed to me, for if I had known about him what I have now recently learned, I would have been able to influence the council to appoint him to our city, but some perhaps feared and therefore were less inclined.</p>
      <p>I rejoice in the prophets and will not cease to ask and beg until you share them with me one after the other. I have the annotations of Sebastian Hofmeister on Isaiah, which he completed just before his death. It is a poor writing, yet not unskilled, but without a doubt not to be compared to Theodor. That would be my first request, if possible (if not possible, I cannot be angry), that you would send me the disposition of Paul's oration in all the epistles. In Romans, I have enough; I would gladly return it to you in return. My young man is copying "De ratione studii" for me, as much as I need it. Regarding the place where we come together, we will let it stand this winter. Regarding Master Leo, my great request would be that you help, as you also do, that he stays; but if not and Megander were called by you, I fear, I tell you again, our lords would easily let him go if you seriously anchor. But if we should take another, I do not know. One can find many in our region, but you know well that one always needs a more learned one. No foreigner will be allowed; so the locals are closed, so if you do not want to be a Bernese anymore, then Zurich needs you very much. Thus, I would first be led between door and hinge. I do not want to trouble you further with holidays, people, etc. I write only to you what is thrown against us, we are not alike, and yet there should be one faith, one gospel. I must once refute the matter fittingly in a sermon. What do you mean by saying the Ave Maria in memory of the incarnation of Christ, which is otherwise handled in all sermons, and we draw the greeting and the words for others from the pulpit, those who hear from you do not indicate that they are free from superstition, although I recognize your sound doctrine in this. We abstain in our sermons; if only everyone understood freedom and used it according to charity!</p>
      <p>Regarding the punishment of adultery, it is not understood by everyone, as you write, but they desire that it should remain at three days, as first ordered. That has surprised us. I have no doubt, if it were written and understood as you indicate, it would have had no need. It would be good to report such matters to us as well, so that they might be carried out with propriety by a council. On the last Sunday, your writing was read before the 200; it was decided to remain at five days. God is angry with us that the two cities do not understand and listen to each other more. Now I first hear that a messenger is going to you, who will report new things; you understand from the pious. Frantz will hand over the gift to Wattenwil; he is not in the city.</p>
      <p>Now I have once again unburdened my heart. I ask you, my dearest Heinrich, not to take my laborious writing amiss, for if I did not trust you so completely, to whom you have given cause, with the most ample witnesses of friendship and love towards me, I would gladly leave you untroubled. We are all waiting for Vadian's Epitome, when it will be completed; it is exceedingly pleasing to our brothers. Continue with Pellicanus, as I had previously advised, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Simon Sulzer is coming to Bern this Lent, he is a Bernese, a very learned fellow in Greek and Latin, he will read with Rellicanus and help us, if the misers among us do not want to let themselves be persuaded. This brings a push to Rellicanus; he has so far not allowed himself to be used for the choir court or preaching, nor has he wanted to promise to stay in Bern. So my lords are unwilling to spend great costs on people who have no intention of staying with them.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and pray to the Lord for me, as you always do.</p>
      <p>23rd of September.</p>
      <p>Ah, now forgive me and do not cease to love me. In the meantime, I will enjoy your letters and books, as it is not possible to hear and enjoy you in person. Greet Pellicanus and everyone.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
