    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger testifies that [Konrad] Hofherr has rendered faithful and valued services in the churches of the region [Zürich]. Sometimes he is thoughtless, but that is forgivable. He will improve with experience and age. Bullinger can therefore recommend Hofherr.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [beginning of the] Baden Diet is expected. Many show an eagerness to defend Germany against the [Italians and Spaniards] that was never shown before. Bullinger preaches more vehemently than ever against [the Inner Swiss], who are being courted by the Papists.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Blarer should report on the situation and inform about the whereabouts of Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger misses Blarer's letters. He himself writes more often!</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I bear this testimony for Curioni, my compatriot, that he has served the brothers in the field much and faithfully and has received considerable praise from the churches. He is sometimes thoughtless, I admit, but this should be forgiven him. Experience and mature age will correct what we now find to be flawed. Therefore, I commend this man, who is certainly not bad, to your humanity.</p>

      <p>Everyone is waiting for the day in Baden, and many honest people are eager to save Germany from the Italians and Spaniards. Say that, while I am here in Zürich, I have never seen such a will. May God grant it for the good, and that we do not have some harmful people who act unfaithfully! The lands have many followers of the Papists. Against them, I have never preached so vehemently in all my life as I do now.</p>

      <p>Let me know how things are going. Where is the Landgrave, or how is he doing?</p>

      <p>I reluctantly miss your letters for such a long time. I know and am glad that I am more frequent in writing! Farewell. July 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>To Ambrosius Blarer, my lord and brother, always to be honored. Constance.</p>
