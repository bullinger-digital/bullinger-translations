      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We are affected by great and incredible sorrow, most illustrious prince, after we learned from the letters of certain men that the church of Christ, which not long ago was flourishing in the vast kingdom of Poland and the grand duchy of Lithuania, is now so miserably consumed by internal dissensions that it has greatly degenerated from its former happiness. After we received the letters of your highness, which indicate the danger that the contention over doctrine might progress to arms and slaughter, our sorrow was so much increased and so much distress was added, as the magnitude of the danger and our love for your churches ought to have brought. However, we are most vehemently concerned because your highness desires us to bring a remedy to these evils, in which we would not shirk any labor or danger if even a small hope of achieving something were shown. Since we have often given this advice to your churches in letters written publicly and privately, which if they had followed, they would never have been involved in these troubles, and furthermore, our most faithful brother in Christ, of pious memory, Johannes Calvin, has gravely and clearly explained this cause in public writings, and yet the matter nevertheless continually relapses into a worse state, we do not see what benefit our letters can bring to you, especially since we see that the ears of many are open to the calumnies of the adversaries, who interpret our writings calumniously and persuade you that they are condemned by us without the cause being known, when in fact the matter is far otherwise. For those who stirred up this controversy about God in your churches, certain Italian men, whom it is not necessary to name, lived in our churches in ZÃ¼rich and Geneva and, when they spread the same doctrines, they were convicted, so that some of them publicly recanted their errors. However, since turbulent, arrogant men, condemned by their own judgment, could not rest, they were excluded from the churches and proscribed by the magistrates, they moved from here to Poland and Lithuania and, abusing your humanity and liberality, they disturbed your churches. And would that this evil does not progress further and invade other doctrines of our religion, indeed undermine the whole religion. For they not only spread new doctrines about God, which is the head and foundation of our religion, or, what is more true, paint old errors with new names as if with colors, but nothing in the entire doctrine of our religion is so well established that it satisfies such minds. This is testified by the dialogues of Ochino, (which, if your highness has not yet received them, most illustrious prince, let it not trouble you. For if your highness receives them, you will find coals instead of treasure) in which everything is called into question in an academic manner. For he disputes in such a way that he is either a great prevaricator if he thinks otherwise than he speaks under his own person, or at least a cold and feeble disputant if he thinks rightly and yet cannot confirm his own and refute the adversary otherwise. Therefore, most illustrious prince, since such men are conducting this cause among you and wield great authority and bring nothing new, but repeat those things to which a response has long been given, we do not think it necessary to now respond to their calumnies, with which they are accustomed to burden our opinion, or even to examine their individual arguments, lest perhaps we give contentious men a new occasion for litigation. Since your highness, most illustrious prince, requests our opinion and judgment on this controversy from us, we send to your highness our confession, taken from the prophetic and apostolic scripture and confirmed by the testimonies of the ancient fathers. We do this according to the custom and practice of the ancient church, in which at all times pious doctors, having refuted foreign doctrines, composed some brief formulas of faith, in which they embraced sound doctrine. For the purity and simplicity of the apostolic creed, with which we ought to be content, crafty men have always tried to elude with various arts, while they subscribe with ambiguous words, they dissent in reality. Therefore, Hilary praises the bishops of Gaul, who knew no other creed than that of the apostles, not because he condemns other creeds, but because he congratulates them on this happiness of being free from heresies, from which Gaul was then immune, while the East was miserably torn by the Arians. And we too would be happy if there were no opinions conflicting with sound doctrine, which would need to be refuted by an illustrious confession, for then easily all would be content with this one creed and we would not require any further confession from anyone. But now, first the papists have greatly deviated from true religion, then the Anabaptists have disturbed the church, who also dissent from pure doctrine not in one doctrine only, furthermore Servetus has his disciples, who spread absurd, not to say impious, opinions about God and other parts of Christian doctrine. Finally, there are among you the antitrinitarians, who do not want to be disciples of Servetus, but have their own peculiar doctrines about God. Meanwhile, however, all these, whom we have just named, acknowledge and profess the apostles' creed. Therefore, as in the ancient church, when the Arians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutychians, and other plagues professed the apostles' creed in word, but in reality violated it with their doctrines, pious doctors, compelled by necessity, also issued other confessions of their faith, so we too have thought it necessary to do at this time. First, however, we testify that we approve those creeds of the ancients or confessions of faith, which the holy fathers issued in the public councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, to which we also add the creed of Athanasius. Although some contend that it is not of Athanasius, yet since the same doctrine is proposed in his books, we easily persuade ourselves that he is the genuine author of it. Furthermore, we do not think the consensus of the ancient church in this cause should be despised. For although doctrines must be confirmed by scriptures, yet because scriptures are brought forward on both sides and the question is about their meaning and how passages seemingly conflicting at first sight are to be reconciled, the authority of Ambrose, Chrysostom, Augustine, and the like will move us more than that of Blandrata, Gentilis, or Gribaldo himself. Indeed, we gather that your antitrinitarians do not entirely despise the authority of the fathers from the fact that they accept Ignatius and Irenaeus with Justin and Hilary, whom we too do not disapprove of, (although we could with good right use an exception against Ignatius), so that if they approve Justin's book on the Trinity, we would consider all controversy removed. However, in this place, most excellent and illustrious prince, we implore your judgment. By the singular benefit of God, there are many very ancient writings of the fathers extant, some of whom were distinguished by their knowledge of languages, others by their understanding of the scriptures, others by their knowledge of philosophy, many by all these and furthermore by martyrdom, and yet all these your antitrinitarians, I know not what sons of the earth, circumscribe with one edict and, approving only four out of the whole number, reject all the rest. We will not now deal with the more ancient ones nor with those who did not treat this question expressly, we wonder, since in the same century with Hilary many most learned men, both Greek and Latin, lived, why they have chosen this one out of all whom they would approve. For Hilary lived under the emperors Constantine, Constantius, Julian, Jovinian, and finally Valentinian and Valens, at which time the church abounded, as it were, with most learned bishops, whose writings also exist. For then, the church, having recently obtained peace, flourished, then the contention about God or the Trinity, stirred up by Arius and increased and amplified by his rivals, which greatly troubled the church, aroused many learned men and exercised in the scriptures, who wrote most accurately on this question. We see, however, that at this time it has happened in the church that doctrines called into question by heretics are more diligently examined and scrutinized. Thus, in the age of St. Augustine, the doctrine of the grace of God, of the corruption of our nature, of the powers of free will, when Pelagius raised a dispute about these matters, was more illustrated than in several previous centuries. With equal zeal in that century, in which Hilary lived, many, as we have said, devoted themselves to proposing the doctrine of the holy Trinity to the church of Christ as clearly and solidly as possible. Among all these, we can rightly and deservedly give the first place to Athanasius, who was engaged in this struggle for a very long time and, for the sake of the truth, was often chosen for exile and sometimes even faced the danger of death. With him were joined in friendship Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus, whom Greece held in such honor that it deemed this one worthy of the title and name of theologian, the other of great. In the same age lived Gregory of Nyssa, bishop, brother of the great Basil, and Didymus of Alexandria, blind in eyes, yet endowed with a most perspicacious mind. Slightly inferior in age to these are John Chrysostom, Cyril, and Theodoret, whose writings all still exist. And these indeed were all Greeks, among the Latins, however, contemporaries of Hilary were Ambrose, Victorinus the African, Jerome, and not much inferior in age, but in doctrine and piety second to none, St. Augustine. What then shall we do here? Shall we imitate the antitrinitarians and retain only Hilary, but pronounce all the rest to have mixed sophistry and philosophy with the sacred writings and therefore to be rejected by the church of God in this controversy? Or shall we acknowledge these as pious and truly Christian doctors, but reject Hilary as dissenting from them? We will do neither, most illustrious prince, but as there was always the greatest concord among them, so we will not allow their writings to be at variance with each other. And because there is singular obscurity in Hilary, so much so that Jerome thinks he is read in vain by the less skilled, we would wish, most illustrious prince, that your antitrinitarians would engage in his reading and not only excerpt some parts, but carefully weigh the whole body of his doctrine, compare with him both the Greeks, from whom he undoubtedly took much, and the Latins, with whom he never had any controversy, and thus compare these with each other, not to set passages seemingly conflicting against each other, but to explain the more obscure passages by those that are clearer. If they do this, perhaps we will not entirely refuse Hilary as an honorary arbiter in this cause, yet so that he does not pronounce as some Verres from his own sole judgment, but as Aquilius, a good and just praetor, first consults divine law and then calls Athanasius, Basil, and the rest, skilled interpreters of it, into counsel, and thus finally, according to law and equity, after the cause has been heard, pronounces sentence from the opinion of the council. Although we have dealt with the fathers at length, most illustrious prince, we do not therefore place the fathers before the scriptures, but the indignity of the matter moved us that so many most excellent and ancient writers are rejected with one sentence and condemned of sophistry, whom hitherto no good and orthodox man has ever accused by this name. But leaving these aside, let us now come to the confession of our faith. Therefore, we firmly believe and with all our heart confess that there is one God in essence, divinity, nature, majesty, power, and glory, but three in persons, which the Greeks call hypostases. And these persons in the same essence of divinity are the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which although each is equally and eternally partaker of the same divinity, yet they do not constitute three gods, but one and the same eternal, omnipotent, and creator and preserver of all things God, as Irenaeus also says against heresies book 4 chapter 47 that the Father and His Word are one and the same God and always assist the human race, and Cyprian in the exposition of the apostles' creed thus said that God is one because there neither can be added a second nor a third, just as the sun is one for this reason, that with it there cannot be other suns. And thus we acknowledge and confess the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit to be neither three gods nor three lords in number, degree, and office distinct and subordinate, but all one and the same to be equally invoked, adored, and worshipped with one and the same faith. Then we firmly believe and with all our heart confess that the Father in divinity before all ages from eternity and without beginning begot the only-begotten Son of the Father, endowed with equal power and majesty, through whom also He created all other things, whom John says was the eternal Word in the beginning with God. And with Cyprian we confess that the incorporeal and incomprehensible generation of the only-begotten God neither flows into a plural number of gods nor falls into division because the begotten Son is by no means separated from the begetting Father. Thirdly, we firmly believe and with all our heart confess that this only-begotten Son of the Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, consubstantial with the Father, was sent in these last times into this world, that in the womb of the virgin, having assumed our flesh from the seed of Abraham according to the scriptures, not brought from heaven from God Himself, by the operation of the Holy Spirit, He became a true man like us in all things except sin and redeemed the human race by dying for our sins. Nor do we in any way accept if anyone says that the eternal Word was either liquefied or coagulated in the womb of the virgin into a man and that Christ according to His human nature is consubstantial with the Father and the natural Son of Him. We also confess that in Christ there are two natures unconfusedly united, namely the divine and the human, wherefore we acknowledge that He is not divided into two Christs, since we attribute to His humanity what is human, to His divinity what is divine, and by the communication of idioms we say that God became man, suffered, and died. Fourthly, we firmly believe and with all our heart confess that there is one Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, the third person of the same divinity with the Father and the Son, endowed with the same nature, power, and glory, through whom all the faithful and elect are enlightened, anointed, and sanctified, who with the Father and the Son lives and reigns in eternal ages. Finally, we firmly believe and with all our heart confess that there is one faith, one church, and one baptism, and that whatever is contained in the sacred scriptures of the Old and New Testaments and also in the Nicene and Athanasian creeds is undoubtedly true, and we pray to the Lord that He may keep us faithful to Him in this faith and confession by the spirit of His grace and truth until the end. Amen. Here your highness has, most illustrious prince, a brief confession of our faith, about which we now institute no disputation, yet if the antitrinitarians wish to impugn it either by the testimonies of the scriptures or the authority of the fathers, let them act candidly, let them interpret nothing calumniously, as they have hitherto done. If they do this, they will not easily move anyone, for everyone who is even moderately versed in the sacred writings and the ancient fathers, when he sees that these agree with them, will not with much labor extricate himself from their arguments, however subtle. Yet since they think they are grievously wronged by us, who have accused them of two mutually conflicting crimes, namely that they make more gods and that they deny the true divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit, we will respond to this briefly. These things, which conflict with each other, to make the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit three gods and to take away the true deity from the Son and the Holy Spirit, these, I say, conflict in word, but in reality, the latter is concluded from the former position. For since in reality there is only one God and there cannot be more gods, if we exclude or separate the Son and the Holy Spirit from the nature of this one God, we indeed give them deity in word, yet in reality, we take it away. Just as Epicurus, who took away the providence of human affairs from God, affirmed and denied God in word. We gather that the antitrinitarians constitute more gods in this way. The fathers teach from the scriptures that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three gods because they are not of different substances, because they are not distinct in nature, because they are of similar and indifferent nature. This is taught by Athanasius and Basil against the Sabellians, among others. And Hilary on almost every page inculcates that the Father and the Son are of indifferent nature and therefore are not two gods. Therefore, those who distinguish the nature of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and deny that the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are of indifferent nature, make three gods. We will show briefly that the antitrinitarians do this. For although at the beginning of the former letter they admit that the Son and the Holy Spirit are of the same nature and divinity with the Father, yet later many things are added that conflict with this opinion. For first, they say that the Father alone is that one God whom the scripture proclaims, and that He is properly and absolutely called and is God, yet the name of God is attributed to the Son and the Holy Spirit, but with some circumscription. What is this but to say that the Father is God by nature, the Son with the Holy Spirit is improperly and homonymously called God? To this Cazanovius denies that the Son of God is included under the name of God. Then Cazanovius teaches that the Father is one God and the Son is another God, although he then denies this. Furthermore, in the former letter in the refutation of the proposition "the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God not by person but by indifferent nature", it is openly denied that the Father and the Son are of indifferent nature. Again, in the latter letter, it is written that there is no other essence of the Father than innascibility, of the Son than generation, of the Holy Spirit than procession, by which opinion three essences are established not only different but contrary, as Basil teaches against Eunomius, who affirmed the same. To this, when they say that the Father alone is invisible, they seem to attribute to the Son a visible nature as to His deity. Finally, when they take away the communion of idioms and admit no figure or trope in these expressions, when we are said to be redeemed by the blood of God, when the Lord of glory is said to be crucified or God is said to be born, suffered, died, it is necessary that they establish the divine nature in Christ to be mutable and passible. For if they wish to interpret it as suffered in the flesh, they now admit a trope, which they previously excluded. From all these things we gather that the antitrinitarians establish a different nature in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and therefore in reality make three gods, although they deny this in words. We know they are subtle and try to retort this charge on us with various arguments, that by saying the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, we too make three gods or rather four, because they say we make the essence a new, as they say, fourth God, but it is shameful to refute such impudent calumnies, since all our people with one voice confess that the Father is not a different God from the Son or the Holy Spirit and that the unity and identity of nature, add also simplicity and infinity, exclude all number, which although common to the three, is not extraneous or separable, so that they may imagine a fourth God. But we ask you, most excellent and illustrious prince, and in the name of Jesus Christ our God and Savior, we beseech you, that in this cause, in which you have great authority and power, you do not allow fraudulent men to abuse your goodness. Indeed, in the latter letter, you call the opinion of the antitrinitarians your own, which if this is fixed and established for your highness, we labor in vain, we write in vain to your highness. But if there is room for the knowledge of the cause with you and our opinion is not yet condemned by your prejudice, we hope our letters will not be entirely useless. And if your highness desires a response to the booklets of Gregory Paul and Cazanovius, we do not doubt that there are many pious and learned men in Poland, who, if they see that your ears are open to them no less than to the antitrinitarians, will gladly do this. And since Calvin, the most faithful minister of the church, is attacked by name in them, now resting in the Lord, we do not doubt that the ministers of the church in which he taught will defend the cause of this excellent father. It was enough for us to expose our faith, in which we have hitherto rested with the greatest assurance, to your highness and we pray to God that He may deliver your churches from contentious men and grant them true peace and concord in the fullness of one true faith. Amen.</p>
