    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests reliable information about the arbitration award accepted by Zurich to end the mandate dispute. Bad rumors: Zurich has recognized the Catholic faith as the true faith again, another agreement with the Five Cantons is in sight, Zurich has promised never to issue such religious mandates again, the next Swiss Diet is to take place in Zurich, etc. If all this is true, Bullinger should keep Myconius' letters well. Requests information about Bucer's visit. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Indeed, my dear Bullinger, I am so distracted in mind that I do not know what to do. Everyone brings the worst news about you. However, as I have a sincere affection towards the people of Zurich, I do not easily believe it when bad and impious things are said about them. Therefore, before I accept anything, I wish to be informed by you. But so that you may understand me more clearly, we have heard the following: Such a concord has been forged between you and the Cantons that henceforth you are by no means to touch, criticize, or disapprove of the papist faith with words, writings, or deeds, but to hold it as if you have confessed to the old, undoubted, etc., faith. Similarly, they have promised not to allow your faith to be disparaged. Moreover, they have allowed that when needed, soldiers may be taken from their own for the French, as many as desired. Others say they have heard that the Cantons expect a defection of the people of Zurich unless they show themselves more lenient than before, and for this reason, they have most conveniently come to an agreement. But what kind this is, I have not yet discovered. Others say you have sworn after the recanted mandate never to send anything like it to the public again. Then it was decided that the next Diet of the Confederates should be held in Zurich.</p>
      <p>How I should feel about these things, I would say if I believed them to be true. Now, as the matter stands, as I said, I will not add a word. Until I am informed, I will say nothing rashly. What else I wish now is only that, if your people are as they are proclaimed, you take care that the letters I have sent so far do not become a harm to us at some point, and indeed, that when you have the leisure, you write in detail about Bucer and the matters he has dealt with among you.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord and act bravely for the truth, as you are accustomed, to receive a sure crown from Him whom you have served. I wish Utinger, Pellican, and Theodor to be well.</p>
      <p>Basel, the first of May, in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Os. My. yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his special dear friend and lord.</p>
