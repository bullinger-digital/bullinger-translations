      <p>S. D. What has been reported from the Palatinate in many letters, I have condensed into a summary in German for the benefit of both our consuls, to whom the whole matter had to be reported, as I had sent a messenger at their command. I share it with you under the condition that you return it safely after reading and do not share it with just anyone, indeed show the earlier parts to no one; you may show the latter parts about the reformation to whomever you wish, especially to Mr. Believrio, whom I ask you to greet most dutifully on my behalf, and to inform him that I request two things from him: first, something certain about Turkish and Italian affairs, about which public rumors vary so much - he knows for sure, I am quite certain, what is going on - second, that he prepares or procures for us the form of the treaty to be struck between the Pope and the 5 Cantons. Mr. Beza writes these days that he has received from a certain man not ignorant of these matters that the treaty has not yet been concluded; it is still expected that Amman Lussium will soon return from Rome with full authority and a purse. He says the conditions proposed are roughly as follows: if they are attacked for the sake of religion, the Pope will provide twenty thousand crowns for the first month's expenses through the Bishop of Como, and if the war is prolonged, ten thousand for other months; they, in turn, will assist the Pope if attacked for religion by sending no less than 6000 foot soldiers with fair wages, which can be done with the French and especially Swiss treaty intact, etc. He adds that Count Egmond, barely returning from Spain, has begun to fortify certain towns on the borders of France, Brabant, and Flanders as if for war, wherefore the king has ordered Prince Cond√© to return to his presence as soon as possible, namely to Picardy from Paris, and to fortify Amiens and the whole region, just as he sees everything being fortified on Philip's side, etc. He writes that besides some Turkish ships, the Occitan coast (Langendocken) has recently begun to be infested.</p>
      <p>I thank you very kindly for your efforts and daily work, which you still have in my case against the late Arnold. I kindly ask you to continue in this manner and to earnestly persist with my lords, the mayors, and Paul Paul with requests, etc. Setzstab has found nothing more in Ragatz.</p>
      <p>The letter, on which Vogler and Wyssenbach have (Wyssenbach shows himself), lies in Chur behind the mint master and is not here. So we have invested a pot from your command and advice on the fat letters, which lie here behind Heinrich Murer; he has 92 guilders on it, there are still 250 guilders left or somewhat more; however, many citizens have invested pots before us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, help as you can; I will, where I can, earn it. I do not like to trouble you with such matters; but since I have come into the matter innocently and have no one but you up there, how can I do otherwise? Therefore, forgive me. God be with you. June 8, 1565.</p>
      <p>I have not reread.</p>
