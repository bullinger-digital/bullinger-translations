      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received the letters you sent on the 1st of November, dated 16 days earlier, in which you request the booklets printed in Magdeburg; you should know that at present none can be found here; if I had received the letters a month earlier, I could have bought them. However, if you wish to read mine, I will gladly share them, but on the condition that you return them in good faith; for certain reasons, I do not wish to part with them. I believe the matter concerning the people of Magdeburg, who are besieged by four armies—those of Brunswick, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Maurice—has already been settled, and rumor has it that Maurice has occupied Magdeburg. We will witness the marvelous works of God. I often think of the people of Constance, who, having lost their best men, soon surrendered themselves to the most disgraceful servitude, from which they will never be freed. Perhaps the same has happened in Magdeburg; having lost their best men, the hypocrites remained at home, who have now decided to hand over the city to the Emperor with a joyful spirit. But we will hear more certain news shortly. The Turk is in great preparation and plans to devastate Moravia, and the people of Wrocław and the remaining Bohemian cities are in great fear. Perhaps the Lord wishes to defend His church from these fox-like men. Almost all the nations of Europe have been ravaged by Germany, and now it will also give its hair to foreign enemies.</p>
      <p>What happened in Lorraine with the bones of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, buried in Nancy, you undoubtedly know better than I do. Thus, the Emperor is accustomed to breaking open tombs, destroying epitaphs, and I do not know what cruel plans he has for the dead through his envoys. Without a doubt, that was a great war. The French, indeed, are exchanging money for crowns everywhere here; they have much money with them; from where they have it, I do not know. I fear that Mr. Schertlin may be expelled from our city, a man worthy of being kept with us for a long time. But I do not wish to write about this, as I do not know the certain reasons why this should happen or whether it will happen.</p>
      <p>Farewell, 18th of November, 1550.</p>
      <p>Here my wife sends you a pair of knives for a table setting with a greeting, asking you to kindly accept them with a small gift, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, etc.</p>
