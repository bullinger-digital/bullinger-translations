      <p>S. D. (Salutations). The fact that I ordered a copy of my sermons on the Apocalypse to be given to your piety, I indeed owed to you, who labored in judging that book of mine for the role of typographical censor, for which I now also give great thanks and much greater thanks for the benevolence towards me, with which you have now sent your Commentaries on sacred history to me as a most welcome gift. And indeed, never has a different calculation in computing numbers in the blessed John's Apocalypse dissolved the friendship contracted in Christ. I am so affected that, after agreeing on the doctrines of faith and religion, I think that contentions should not be drawn among brothers due to the diversity of interpretations of certain passages, much less should friendship be renounced. I have written on the New Testament and now finally on the Apocalypse in such a way that, if others also write and provide better and simpler things, I do not envy the church or cling to my own, but rather I give thanks to them. I see that in the primitive church among the most learned and holy men of old, there was that grace that each one would bring forth his own gift for edification, and the others would also bring forth their own gifts, and in the meantime, they would not contend with them or disdain or attack the writings of others, unless perhaps someone had brought forth a new or unusual doctrine. How many, I ask, were the interpretations of the law and the prophets, and indeed they were dissimilar and diverse among themselves? Who indeed spat upon or taught to trample upon what existed for this reason? Therefore, I think we are unfortunate today, who see interpreters warring among themselves and one pursuing the gift of another.</p>
      <p>But now is not the place to speak of these things.</p>
      <p>You wish to be informed of what I think about your digression into the sacramental matter; however, I have scarcely been able to inspect that place. For yesterday towards evening the book was offered, and today I was compelled to preach according to custom and duty, and not much time was left for me. I could scarcely write these things because the courier said he would leave at dawn tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I kindly ask you to accept this brevity of mine. I have never seen you, I have read few of the things you have written, yet I have always heard from Leo Jud (Leo Jud√§) of blessed memory, who loved you dearly, that Borrhaus (Borrhaeus) thought excellently of the Swiss churches, of Zwingli (Zwinglius), a man of venerable memory, and especially of the sacramental matter, and while I inspect these things of yours, which you have now sent, I seem to see in many respects the old Borrhaus, and indeed such as brother Leo had described to me, except that I see certain things sprinkled in the meantime, which I would either not want sprinkled or more significantly explained. For in the whole treatment (pardon me if perhaps I have said something too boldly or impudently; for I speak freely with a most dear brother) I require clarity and would wish for it to be less tangled, clearer, and simpler, and therefore more accessible. We do not disagree in the exposition of the words of the Lord: This is my body; for on both sides we confess that sacramental names are attributed to symbols according to the sacramental reason, yet in such a way that these are not mixed, but remain intact in their natures, and neither is one converted into the other nor included or affixed to the other. Thus judged the entire antiquity, as St. Augustine (Augustinus) clearly testifies, who seems to have been almost among the last who treated and handed down the scriptures and religion more sincerely to the church. We also agree on that, which is among the chief causes, that Christ the Lord, who is the only nourishment for the life of the soul, is perceived spiritually through the mouth of faith, not carnally through the mouth of the body. In this, there seems to be some dissimilarity or obscurity, that you say sacramental signs are signs of present things, not absent ones.</p>
      <p>For if you understand this of Christ himself truly given over to death, it is most certain that neither the body itself is present in the supper, wherever it is celebrated, nor is the giving over or passion present. But if you understand it of the power of our redemption through the passion from the true and given body of Christ, now residing in the heavens, acting in the faithful celebrating the supper, we confess that this food is perceived as present, yet in such a way that there is no need for bodily presence, since Christ himself, remaining in the heavens, inspires life obtained by this once given body and shed blood. Therefore, I wonder how you could say that the throne on which Christ sits should not be thought to be remote from us, when scripture, both in Acts 1 and in many other places, clearly testifies that Christ's body, assumed into heaven, is no longer with us. Dr. Luther (Lutherus) of good memory and Dr. Johannes Brenz (Brentius) and their disciple Dr. Jacob Andreae (Andreae) proposed this doctrine to the church, while the ancients did not speak thus.</p>
      <p>Moreover, you seem, along with them, to remove the glorious body of the Lord itself, acting in the heavens, from place and to strip it of its dimensions, so that it is uncircumscribable. But I see the scriptures and the blessed fathers judge far differently about this matter.</p>
      <p>Unless, therefore, I do not rightly understand you, I cannot sufficiently marvel that this new Brentian doctrine could have been approved by you, who have been most versed in sacred writers. Nor do I less marvel that Augustine could not satisfy you, who according to the scriptures says that the pious eat the bread of the Lord, but Judas the bread of the Lord, those truly, these only as far as the sacrament is concerned, why that Andrean dissertation pleased you, in which he greatly exercises and torments himself and says that Christ is indeed present to some for salvation, to others for the judgment of condemnation. Which, however true it may be, seems to be badly applied to that, that the impious also partake of the true body of the Lord just as the pious do. You have, dearest man, what I think of your dissertation, your book, proposed to me. If anywhere I seem not to rightly understand you, forgive me for writing so freely; for this cause seems, after it has come into controversy, to be treated most simply and clearly and according to the scriptures, and not to be deferred to parties so much that we either yield to the truth or hand over things clear in themselves more obscurely. Live and farewell and love me, who loves you dearly.</p>
      <p>I will also offer your book to other brothers at the first opportunity. I have conveyed greetings to Dr. Martyr (Martyri), who also greets you most amicably.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen anyone else today, but I know they are most devoted to you and wish you safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Zurich (Tiguri), September 5, 1557, very quickly.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger (Bullingerus).</p>
      <p>To Dr. Martin Borrhaus (Martini Borrhai) and my letter on the supper and heaven.</p>
