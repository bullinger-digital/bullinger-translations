      <p>Greetings. While lying down, I conveniently read the second sermon of the third Decade, and it has greatly consoled me in this miserable and lamentable life. For several days now, I have not left the house, not burdened by one illness, but by many and severe ones, among which deafness is the most prominent. Good God, what a nuisance this is!</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will pray to the Lord for me, that He may restore my hearing, unless He has willed otherwise. I confide this to you alone, although it cannot remain a secret for long; however, I would not want you to be the one to spread it. I am pleased with the rest of what I have seen in your sermons, so much so that I recognize you as very knowledgeable, endowed with much grace, and seasoned in the practice of writing. May the Lord increase all things in you and keep you safe for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>The young man who delivers this letter has been received, supported, and instructed by us through my intercession. He has conducted himself most rightly, has made progress in his studies, and is entirely blameless; therefore, I would like you to consider him recommended, should he need your assistance in any matter.</p>
      <p>News: The imperial physician came to Speyer and said he had infused a new soul into that body; hence it is certain that no serious illness will attack him within six years. Consider the absurdity and divinity of these words.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write a little, so as not to write nothing. Farewell, remember me. Greet Gwalther in my name.</p>
      <p>Theodor, I believe, is buried; Pellicanus lives, but not for me. From the sickbed in Basel, so to speak, March 18, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
