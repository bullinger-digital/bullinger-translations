    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's benevolent letter and his efforts [in the matter of Thomas Hütlin]; spoke with [Thomas] Blarer and [Konrad Zwick] about a letter to the Zurich mayors [Diethelm Röist and Johannes Haab] and the treasurer [Hans Rudolf Lavater]; the former will not approach [the Zurich] for various reasons; however, thanks for the letter from Bullinger and Röist to the Zurich envoys [in Baden]; he cannot write everything. There is still no news from the [Imperial] Diet [at Speyer]; Konstanz has been asked by the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and the [Imperial] cities to participate, but has declined in a letter. Emperor [Charles V] will certainly request assistance [against the Turks] and deceive the Protestants with useless writings and declarations under the pretense of peace. In haste, the messenger is coming.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ from God.</p>
      <p>My especially trusted, dear lord and brother, I have well understood the contents of your letter, and I sense therein your brotherly heart and steadfast love not only towards me but also towards the common city of Konstanz. Therefore, I am very grateful to you for your efforts in this matter; may the loving, faithful, and rich God be your reward. I have also conveyed your good intentions regarding the letter to both of our mayors, as well as to the treasurer, my beloved brother and cousin; however, there are many and significant reasons why they do not write to your envoys, neither to Haab nor to Lavater, as they do not know how to write to Lord Röist, to whom they entrust everything good, so that the envoys may not suspect that they have written something to their disadvantage. They thank Lord Röist and you as much as possible for having written to your envoys so faithfully and diligently. But what such writing has achieved with them, God knows well; they wish to entrust it to Him. The pen is in no way to be trusted with what I might dare to speak with you orally; God will perhaps arrange that everything comes to light, and perhaps quite soon. Amen, amen, amen. O my brother, if only I could say a single word into your ear! But the day, I do not doubt, will one day reveal the deceits and frauds of the sons of men, etc., wonder upon wonder.</p>
      <p>We have no new news from the Diet. My lords have been asked by the Landgrave and subsequently also by the common cities through a special letter to attend the Diet, to which they have sent a very Christian letter and admonition, explaining the reason for their absence. May God will that it serves well and much to His eternal praise. The Emperor is in great haste; there will be a request for money and assistance, and how the Protestants are deceived with the pretense of peace through additional writings and declarations, which are nothing but patchwork and deceit, nec sapiunt tamen toties iam tamque graviter icti Phryges.</p>
      <p>12th February 1544. In haste; the messenger is on his way, et ipse sum occupatissimum.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
