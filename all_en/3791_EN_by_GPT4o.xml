      <p>Greetings. I am sending two of my men to visit my son; but I did not want to send them off without my letter to you. I assume you have received the previous ones, in which I informed you of the deaths of the Queens of England and Hungary.</p>
      <p>We still have no certain news about peace.</p>
      <p>I arrived late at the assembly due to illness; now I am feeling better.</p>
      <p>Please give my regards to Lords Walter and Martyr. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, December 12.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
