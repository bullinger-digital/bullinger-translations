    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger thanks for the letter written in the field camp near Nördlingen on October 8 [Letter No. 2616]. Since then, he has endeavored to act as best as possible in the spirit of the Landgrave, whose goal is to defend Christianity and the freedom of Germany against the attack of Emperor [Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Through the letter of the four [Protestant] places, the Landgrave will learn what these places decided at their meeting in Zürich. Yesterday [Saturday, October 30], the Zürich council gathered the councils and the citizens, who clearly stood [behind him]. Next Sunday [assemblies will be held] in the counties and lordships [of the Zürich region]. [One hopes for] all the best from this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Landgrave thus sees the good will [of the Zürich council], which is doing its utmost.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He is thanked for sending Bullinger another [war] report [with his letter of October 8], as he did on September 12 with letter HBBW XVII, No. 2581.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger remains at his disposal.</p>
