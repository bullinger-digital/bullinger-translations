      <p>Greetings. For several weeks now, my brother, I have sent you fewer letters, not for any other reason than that I am aware that your fellow ministers are also sending their letters to you, from which you can understand what is of interest to you and what you could have learned from mine. Now, however, since I have decided, God willing, to leave here on June 4th to the baths of Vals for the sake of restoring and strengthening my health, for I am compelled by some of my ailments and great pains tormenting me. Perhaps the Lord will grant better things, or if He grants worse, I will willingly and most readily present myself, with His grace accompanying me. I have lived 67 years now by the grace of God; if He wishes to add anything to my years, let Him do what is good in His eyes; I commit myself entirely to Him, beseeching that He may continue His grace to the very end. Therefore, if you or others wish to write anything, send the letters to my son-in-law, Mr. Simler or Lavater; they will take good care of it. In the meantime, I pray that your upcoming synod may be conducted and concluded successfully. Beware in it, lest you allow yourself to be drawn into disputes over those articles that are confessed and clear, such as the articles on the Trinity, the divinity, and similar matters of Jesus Christ. It is unworthy to cast doubt on what is most certain. The great Constantine was most indignant, as his letters to Eusebius testify, that Alexander and Arius had descended into this arena and inserted articles of faith into contentions. But the Lord will grant to those who call upon Him in truth what will be for His glory and the salvation of His church.</p>
      <p>In previous letters, I informed you that the evangelical princes had convened a synod for all the evangelical ministers throughout all of France at La Rochelle, and our Beza went there. He returned a few days ago, by the grace of God, safe and sound, and writes to us that the state of the faithful in France is tolerable and of good hope; the king is seriously maintaining peace.</p>
      <p>The synod convened from all the provinces of France; they conferred amicably and departed with the utmost charity and concord. They all agreed on the confession once offered to the king and, in letters written from the synod to us in Zurich, they testify that they agree with us. Those letters are full of piety, love, and complete erudition. Perhaps you will someday receive a copy of them from me. The principal ministers of each province subscribed with their own hands from Lyon, Burgundy, Occitania, Auvergne, from the province of Bourges, Angoulême, Poitiers, from Aquitaine or Gascony, Normandy, Picardy, Île-de-France, Brittany, etc.</p>
      <p>The evangelical princes attended the synod. In short: there was the utmost concord among all, which indeed seems admirable, considering that after so many massacres, disasters, and calamities, there are still so many pastors and so many renowned churches so well agreeing and ready to propagate the gospel of Christ. I hear that this agreement in France is highly regarded by many and terrifies the adversaries. Therefore, the Lord is to be praised and prayed to, that He may grant progress to these excellent matters. This week in Nuremberg, I received letters indicating that the captive Saxon John Frederick, at the instigation of the emperor, wrote to his brother John William to expel the Flacians from his region, as they are turbulent and seditious men; he should finally learn from the example of his captive brother; - likewise, that the Turkish emperor, together with the Tartars, is making a great expedition into Transylvania, whose prince, Voivode, died on March 17; and that the Roman emperor will convene a diet either in Regensburg or Augsburg. He might once again march with his women's chamber to the Turks, etc. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with Mr. Consuls, Mr. Gregor, Campello, Pontisella, Boneto, all acquaintances and friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 25, on which day in Alsace, due to the rainy weather, Urban is being dragged through all the puddles, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Chur, to the pastor of St. Martin.</p>
