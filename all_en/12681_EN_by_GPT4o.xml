    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas thanks Bullinger for his letter [not received], which was handed to him by [Oswald] Myconius, especially since this letter provided comfort in light of the bad war news that Myconius conveyed. The situation is extremely worrying, and if God did not have mercy on His own, they would all perish. The Lord is surely visiting them to chastise and admonish them to repent. However, Enzinas cannot believe that the Lord will deliver them to such blasphemers, especially since their misdeeds (which not even the Turks would commit) really must not go unpunished. The kings [of the earth] rise up and conspire together against the Lord and His Anointed [Ps 2, 2]. But He who dwells in heaven and does not sleep mocks them and will speak to them in His wrath and shatter them like clay pots [Ps 2, 4f. 9; 121 (Vulg. 120), 4]. These promises of God give Enzinas courage, and it is probably true what Julius [Caesar] already wrote, namely that "he errs who expects only success in war" [De bello Gallico, 7, 29]. In the meantime, there is nothing left to do but to pray often and fervently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] If there is good news, Bullinger should share it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enzinas is still waiting for Bullinger's response regarding the promised treatise on the [faith] points, which will likely meet everyone's expectations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to friends, especially to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and [Johannes] Fries, to whom he cannot write at the moment.</p>

      <p>S. D. Father Myconius gave me your most welcome letters, from which I easily perceive the integrity and virtue of your spirit, which is indeed not unknown to me, but nevertheless pleasing and desired. However, as much consolation as your letters brought, all of it was completely taken away from my heart by what Myconius announced about the war, full of sorrow and sadness. I see us reduced to extreme straits, so that unless the eternal Father looks upon our misery with the eyes of His mercy, we shall all utterly perish. I have no doubt that the day of our visitation is now at hand, in which we shall feel the chastisement of the Lord, which we ourselves have provoked against us in many ways, the blame for which we acknowledge and confess, prostrated at the knees of our heavenly Father, and at the same time we beseech Him to either avert or mitigate the punishment. But indeed, I cannot yet persuade myself that God wishes to deliver His church, which He redeemed with His own blood, in which there are many who legitimately invoke God and desire the glory of the divine name to be illuminated, to be torn apart by the hands of those blasphemers, who openly affront God with contumely and there is no crime so horrendous that they would fear to commit it.</p>

      <p>Certainly, these unprecedented crimes, such as were not even to be expected from the Turks, will not remain unpunished for long, nor does the great cruelty of that tyrant, the enemy of Christ, seem likely to endure for long. Now truly the kings are in tumult and have unanimously conspired in a nefarious conspiracy against the Lord and against His Christ. But He who dwells in the heavens does not sleep, indeed He sees and mocks these tragic furies and shortly will speak to them in His wrath and, like a potter's vessel, will shatter the heads of these wicked ones. I sustain myself with divine promises of this kind, otherwise miraculously broken in strength, although, when I see our people suffering not only hostile but certainly monstrous things as if by a continuous calamity, I cannot help but groan from the heart. It is true, however, what Julius wrote: "He errs who expects all favorable outcomes in war." The only thing left is frequent and fervent prayer to God, the eternal Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, who will not spurn our groans and cries.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But I beg you to console me, who am indeed greatly shaken, with some joyful news. I am expecting your response regarding the treatise on the points, as you promise, in due time, which I believe will be according to our wishes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Greet all friends in my words, Father Pellicanus, Theodor, Fries, and the others, to whom I do not have the time to write now. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th October 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the Church of Zurich.</p>
