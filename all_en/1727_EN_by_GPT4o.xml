      <p>I have delayed my return to my homeland for so long because I visited it free not only from the Spaniards but also from any other form of servitude, oh singular benefit of God and of that king, to whom these four are now sent as envoys to express their eternal gratitude. Here, everything is proceeding quite successfully. For the conquest of Orbetello, the only small town remaining in the power of the enemy, we are expecting the French fleet. The Prince of Salerno is expected to arrive on our shores shortly with at least forty-five galleys, and many unforeseen things will happen. We only trust in God and will not be put to shame.</p>
      <p>But you too should pray to God for us and celebrate. However, if you wish to hear more about this miraculous change of ours, these men will tell you abundantly and perhaps not unpleasantly; they are recommended to you, and I beg you not to omit to embrace them with your favor. After the feast of the Nativity, I will prepare myself for the journey, and God willing, I will be with you for the entire summer thereafter.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, most illustrious man, farewell with your entire family. Greet D. d. Theodor, Gwalter, Frisius, Gesner, and especially your sons-in-law in my words, and, what I had not forgotten, I wish all my Pellicans safe and happy.</p>
      <p>I would have written to them as well, but there is no more time given. Consider these few words kindly. Siena, 25th September 1552.</p>
      <p>Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>I am eager to learn something certain about our Vergerio. I sent your letters to Bologna to my father and will follow shortly myself.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be especially honored.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
