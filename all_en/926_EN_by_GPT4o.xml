      <p>Greetings. I received your letters with messages that were most pleasing to me. May the Lord repay you for whatever effort and benefits you bestow upon me, as I am in no way able to return the favor. As for your concern about the Seven Cantons, I beg you to cease worrying, since I am prepared to endure whatever darts may be hurled at me; indeed, to let you know, I will consider it a great honor when I see the raging enemies of Christ hurling all kinds of insults at me. There is reason to give immense thanks to God, who strengthens me everywhere and always, so that I am ready to endure any punishment and danger for His glory. I would write to you about the progress of the Gospel among the Misoxers, but I would prefer you to learn about it in person from Mr. Vergerio, the tireless soldier of Christ. I will not remain silent about this: the Mass among us is suffering from a serious illness, and the priests have abandoned the market of the Mass, as there are none to whom they can sell their most corrupt wares. Until now, I have been only a schoolmaster; now, with God's will, I have been appointed among the Rhaetian ministers of the Gospel, who have assigned me the duty of preaching among the Misoxers, which may God grant that I may exercise most diligently and faithfully for His glory, by whom I have been called.</p>
      <p>Nor do I fear anything from the Three Leagues, who rule in Bellinzona; for they have no rights or power over the Misoxers. Take care to be in the best of health, most dear father and patron, and continually commend me to the Lord in your prayers. Greet all the ministers there, one by one, in my name, along with all your household. Chur, on the Nones of June 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Giovanni Beccaria.</p>
      <p>To the ZÃ¼rich delegate going to the Locarnese, I would like you to most diligently recommend my cause, so that he does not allow me to be treated unworthily by the others for his virtue. Greet, I beg you, the most upright men, the mayor and the chief scribe.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
