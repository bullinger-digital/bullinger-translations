    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for their friendly letter. Acknowledges that they consider the [response to Luther's book "On the Councils and the Church"] he suggested to be unnecessary, since Zwingli's interpretations [of the New Testament] as well as Vadian's "Orthodoxa epistola" along with the books [“Contra Eutychen”] by Vigilius have been published; in his opinion, it would have been appropriate to publicly counter the suspicion of Zwingli as a Nestorian. His brethren are more inclined towards Luther than concerned with the unity of the Church; despite a prior conversation, they reacted with displeasure to Ritter's Christmas sermons on the Lord's Supper, which had a pleasing effect on the congregation. The hostilities, which go far beyond the conflict with Benedikt [Burgauer] [in Schaffhausen], are a test of his faith, but so far the [Bernese] Church holds to the true doctrine. Asks to write to him more often - through trustworthy messengers.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Your letters have so wonderfully refreshed me through Jesus Christ, as they were written by the best friends and dearest brothers, and at the same time they bore the most certain testimony that the friendship and goodwill conceived towards me by you remain unchanged. Indeed, as far as I am concerned, I will take the utmost care to ensure that it remains unblemished on my part.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I wrote about, I received your opinion that it is not necessary to respond after the publication of Zwingli's Annotations and Vadian's Orthodox Epistle and Vigilius's most learned books, etc. It is true that those who are capable of judgment are satisfied; but since I see Luther's pamphlet being handled by everyone and praised with great admiration by the simpler ones, and some pious people have conceived suspicion against Zwingli, as they are ignorant of what doctrine Nestorius taught, I thought it could have been briefly compiled and added from Zwingli's books, to show even the simplest, as they say, that Zwingli was utterly alien to this treachery, and this without any calumny. For I see Luther pretending as if he does not know what Nestorius thought; meanwhile, he contaminates and defames an excellent and innocent man with this impiety. But I leave this to your prudence and judgment.</p>
      <p>Concerning our church, about which I do not doubt that you hold a pious and Christian concern, I inform you that everything would be well and right if only my brethren were as eager to promote the glory of God and the concord of our church as they are to promote the glory of Luther and that ill-conceived concord. We recently had a colloquium in which we discussed the Eucharist, and it was concluded among us with great rejoicing that I promised myself the utmost tranquility. But in these days, on Christmas Day and the preceding Sunday, I delivered sermons before the church on the Lord's Supper, in which I explained everything with as much simplicity and clarity as I could, with the greatest benefit to the church; for it celebrated the mysteries with such great attendance and thanksgiving as never before, as long as I have been in Bern.</p>
      <p>But good God, how wonderfully the brethren were irritated that I discussed matters so clearly, who delight in obscurity, so that the sacraments may be held in the highest esteem (so they say), especially because I interpreted the words of the supper according to the most absolute interpretation of Scripture and the fathers. But as much as they gnash their teeth at me, so much does the whole church, with few exceptions, congratulate itself, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of this, dearest brothers, so that you may learn from me alone how impossible it is to enjoy peace and concord when the Lord is unwilling. I wanted to avoid Scylla and fell into Charybdis, I fled one Benedict and now I have encountered five; thus the Lord wishes to exercise my faith. But the church has so far most steadfastly retained the true doctrine, which it declared most openly on Christmas Day in the action of the mysteries.</p>
      <p>Farewell hastily and console me with frequent letters, but only entrust them to the most faithful messengers.</p>
      <p>From Bern, December 30, 1539.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious men, dearest brothers, pastors and readers of the Zürich church.</p>
