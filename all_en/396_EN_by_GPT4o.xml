      <p>God's grace be with us all. I am pleased that the matter with the embassies from the city of God is going well; may God grant that only those are sent who are concerned with God's honor and the welfare of the common church. Today, my lords have appointed Mr. Fenner Wingarter and Fenner Dilger, two sensible, honorable men who, as far as I know, are not opposed to God's cause but are favorable to it. Mr. Treasurer Haller has excused himself due to a bodily ailment; thus, Fenner in the Hague can also go through it. However, I hope the two will not disappoint.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it serves much good!</p>
      <p>Regarding the Savoyard embassy, it stands as follows: A Savoyard nobleman appeared here before the council and citizens, who also received his instructions, requesting, without any means, to restore the land to the Duke, and among other things, to let it be known that his lordship was told so, etc. He was informed: one has not said anything about it, one does not know; if he has anything about it, he may present it, for which the Duke started the war, no plea or warning was heeded, therefore one is not inclined to wish him so. In summary: he is dismissed, but as I hear, he will also come for the common Confederates. Now much is being discussed here about the matter. The only reason that presses the pious is that one does not like to give the people back into papal unbelief, since the land is also an asylum for all exiled Gauls; otherwise, I believe, one would do what one could to avoid war. I would like to know how other Confederates would act in this matter, that one would feel loyalty and love, not resentment and envy.</p>
      <p>Regarding the attack on Stein or Schaffhausen, I am surprised that my lords have not written anything; it would be good if something were felt, that my lords would be informed of it in good time. One will be quick enough; just wait for each other, so that it does not go as it did before.</p>
      <p>Farellus has been here these days, talking a lot with me. What presses me here, I will show when the time is right. He has a dispute with Fenner Tribulet; he has trained a boy in mischief, so that many in Neuch√¢tel no longer attend his sermons; he therefore caused that to be done to him.</p>
      <p>I am concerned that it will become a wild affair; for it is primarily about the sacramental matter. As the truth should be clear, so I would also like to have discretion with it, and that the unreasonable, unedifying words remain avoided. Otherwise, he is very restless, as it seems to me, and the matter is not going well for him.</p>
      <p>Regarding Blarer, you have indeed great effort; may God reward you! I wish that he alone would respond, so we could deal with Musculus. I will send his and your writings back with the next embassy.</p>
      <p>I send you herewith 12 copies of your Dictionary; we have applied our best diligence, as we can. For now, nothing more, may God protect you and all yours! They greet you from me and my household. My lords greet you back, as does my treasurer Steiger, who instructed me about this today at lunch.</p>
      <p>Given on January 2, 1549. Your entirely willing Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
