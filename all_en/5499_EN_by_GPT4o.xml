      <p>Greetings. Now I receive in the evening a letter from Pesclavium by Mr. Julius, in which, among other things, it is mentioned that the holy fathers are detained in Trient and are doing nothing else now than occasionally debating in meetings about that dreadful sacrifice of the mass, and they are to have a session on this matter during the Christmas holidays. Once this is concluded, the council is to be dismissed by the command of the Pope, where they will excommunicate all those summoned to the council who did not appear.</p>
      <p>I have included these words from Julius's letter.</p>
      <p>He says no more. October 28, 1562.</p>
