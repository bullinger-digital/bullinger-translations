      <p>Greetings. Genatius Engadinus conveniently presented himself to me here, to whom you can either deliver my letter sent to you today about recent matters or his reply, so that he may bring it to Friderych von Salis. Mr. Rodolph, your wife's brother, says he has delivered it to a certain man, having given it to him otherwise. And when I had sealed the previous letters sent to you, Mr. Ludwig Arcadius Mantuanus, the minister of the church of Enseberg with you, came to me and proposed these questions: whether it is fair and pious to bind brothers by decree to the Athanasian Creed, whether the Eucharist should be carried to the sick, whether accusations should be heard in synods in the absence of the accused and not in their presence? Since I was unsure where these questions were leading, and I suspected perhaps there was some dispute with you, I said I would consider what could be answered, but first I would also explore what the brothers in Chur think about this matter and additionally about this Ludwig. Therefore, I encouraged him towards concord, etc., and dismissed him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to inform me at your earliest convenience who he is and what the business is, and whether it is appropriate to respond to him in writing. Live and farewell with all the pious. October 29, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, dear lord, godfather, and brother.</p>
