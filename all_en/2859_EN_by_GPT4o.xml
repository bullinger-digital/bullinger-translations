      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have received your most beloved and pleasing letters, most learned and pious Philipp, most esteemed lord and most honorable and dear brother, and I give the greatest thanks to your kindness for your benevolence towards me. Furthermore, my son wrote to me about how lovingly you received him, how fatherly you protect him, and how you advise him in all things. For this, I again give thanks and pray that you continue to teach, advise, and protect him; I will ensure that your kindness is not bestowed upon an ungrateful person. My only wish is that this son of mine, pious and learned, may someday return to me, so that he may benefit his homeland and serve God in truth. Therefore, you will serve God and our country if you diligently instruct him.</p>
      <p>I am grieved, my father, that the sacramental conflict has flared up again; we have been forced, even unwillingly, to respond to the harsh pamphlets of some. I send you a copy of my Apology, dearest brother. I indeed fight, but in such a way that I bring peace, which we all prefer over war; I speak the truth before the Lord. Therefore, if you can do anything, and you can do much, use your authority to restrain the fury of some. If it cannot be otherwise, that they wish to write, let them omit insults and accusations and proceed with pious, modest, and clear writings. It would be much better if we tolerated each other, even if we could not agree on everything. The schism among brothers is harmful; it strengthens our common enemies and gravely offends all the weaker ones. Although we fight unwillingly, we cannot abandon a just cause. By nature, I abhor contentions; yet piety commands me to defend the position given by the Lord in the battle line. Therefore, I pray, use your authority, most pious Philipp. You see that we do not teach impious or absurd things.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my son will present to you the summary of true religion written by me in German; I have included in it all the doctrines or the most important ones of our faith. I do not think that either you or other pious and modest men will disapprove of my work; but if either you or other pious people find anything displeasing in it, I beg you to indicate it most freely. I gladly hear all the judgments of the pious about my writings, so that I may be more prudent in the future when advised.</p>
      <p>My brothers and fellow ministers all greet you and invoke blessings from the Lord; love us, my brother, who are certainly most loving.</p>
      <p>I again commend my son to your piety. Farewell forever. ZÃ¼rich, in the year of our Lord 1556.</p>
      <p>Lelio greets you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Philipp Melanchthon, (...) teaching letters piously and faithfully at the school in Wittenberg, to his honorable lord and most esteemed brother.</p>
