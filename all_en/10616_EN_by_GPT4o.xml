    <p xml:id="regest1">Vogler's wife thanks for the blessings from the people of Zurich. He is preparing to be in Zurich before July 25th. He will strive to obtain citizenship and a house in Zurich for the two [bearers of the letter]. He wants to know if Kaspar [Nasal] and [Johannes] Haab were able to secure a house for him. The people of St. Gallen understand his naturalization in Zurich; he will justify himself before the Great Council. Franziskus Studer traveled to Bern with a monetary donation for the fire victims. A conference is supposed to take place in Worms regarding Münster. Landgrave [Philipp] is with King [Ferdinand]; Duke Ulrich also intends to travel to the King [in Vienna]. A manslaughter occurred at the church consecration in Urnäsch. In the Rhine Valley, an old man took his own life. Greetings. Thanks to [Mayor] Röist, [Nasal], and Haab.</p>

      <p>God with us. Amen.</p>
      <p>My lord and brother, my wife has received the blessing of God, given to me in Zurich by my gracious lords, you, and others, with joy. May God continue to bless.</p>
      <p>I am preparing eagerly, but I do not know if I will come before St. James' Day (July 25th), as I would prefer tomorrow; yet, if God wills it, then etc.</p>
      <p>These two people are willing, also here; yet I think, when I come here, I will deal with you regarding citizenship and a house, which I want to keep quiet about, so it does not bring disadvantage here. I have forbidden him to let anyone know, except you, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, if my lord Master Kaspar, Master Haab, etc., have secured a house, he might let me know by delay, and if it is not neglected, that the rent starts approximately on St. James' Day. Then I think they have negotiated, etc. Also, I have opened my citizenship, although I feel that they tolerate me well and need something from it, yet in the end, the necessity will be recognized, etc. Next week I am summoned before a great council to explain and justify the cause, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, I have seriously informed the pious people of Bern about the damage. Thus, Franziskus Studer was sent to Bern yesterday with 50 crowns, to aid the poor people affected by the fire, with great willingness, praise God. Also, I think Franziskus will ride to you in Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the matter, a great day in Worms, you say, regarding Münster, that they have their envoy there, accompanied by a golden chain with a golden cross.</p>
      <p>Also, the Landgrave is supposed to come for sure; may he be an eternally gracious king. Also, it is said, Duke Ulrich also intends to go down, the king desires him.</p>
      <p>Also, last Sunday in Appenzell, at their church consecration in Urnäsch in the village, one was beheaded, fell from the body; the other also afterwards.</p>
      <p>Also, in the Rhine Valley on Sunday, a good old pious man hanged himself. My wife and I send our best regards to your household.</p>
      <p>If you ever come to my lord Röist, thank him; for I know his seriousness, etc. Master Kaspar, Haab, etc.</p>
      <p>Acted, quickly, St. Gallen, Wednesday, the evening of the remembrance of the Ascension of Christ in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, to be delivered.</p>
