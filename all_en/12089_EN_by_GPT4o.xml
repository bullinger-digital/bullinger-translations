    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not yet seen Luther's writing ["Kurtz bekentnis"] and does not understand why Luther does not send the work to those affected, whom he, as Bullinger has learned from other letters, reviles so much. The rekindled sacrament dispute pains [the people of Zurich] greatly; Melanchthon should understand that the people of Zurich, who recognize the great danger to truth and the church, must now react, especially since Luther has been attacking Zwingli and [the people of Zurich] for many years and they have already admonished him kindly several times. How often did one hear Bucer extensively discuss the [alleged] concord between Luther and the Swiss churches and promise much from it; but even when the Swiss [on May 4, 1538; WA Correspondence VIII, No. 3224] answered Luther's letter [from December 1, 1537; WA Correspondence VIII, No. 3191] in a friendly manner, he continued to treat them unkindly and preferred to incite war rather than peace. [The people of Zurich], however, will not reciprocate Luther's furious revilements in their response; since they also have nothing to do with the Anabaptists [Johannes] Campanus and [Kaspar von] Schwenckfeld, they will only address their own matters; if Bullinger now informs Melanchthon of this, it is because he knows himself to be connected with him in mutual esteem. Bullinger regrets Melanchthon's dangerous situation; but he should know that he will find refuge and every conceivable help [in Zurich]. Greetings from Pellikan, Megander, Bibliander, Gwalther, and [Erasmus Schmid]. Recommendation of the young bearer [Blasius Oechsli or Jakob RÃ¼eger] from Schaffhausen.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. We have not yet seen any writings of Dr. Luther either addressed to us or against us. We do not know why this is the case. Meanwhile, we are amazed at Dr. Luther's decision, who, as we understand from the letters of other friends and brothers, has written very bitterly against us, yet has sent nothing. In my opinion, it would have been the act of an honest and true German man to send a copy especially to those to whom or against whom it was written. We have given no occasion for him to act so harshly and hostilely against us. This greatly consoles us, who otherwise see with great sorrow the harmful scandal presented to many weak ones. For you truly write that our enemies will fiercely raise their crests. It also pains us greatly that the symbol of union and concord of those redeemed by the blood of the Son of God is turned by Satanic suggestion into a matter of quarrels, by which the souls of the faithful are wounded and torn into factions. Nor will the most just Lord leave this great evil unpunished. Since that former minister has condemned and treated our ministry and churches, which deserved nothing of the sort, most indignantly, by publishing such a writing (as we understand from the letters of the best and most learned men: we hope to receive the book shortly), which we cannot ignore without great danger to the truth and our churches, you, most esteemed and dearest Melanchthon, or any other good man, will not take it amiss if we defend our innocence before the Church of Christ, freely confess our faith, and respond to the arguments of our adversary. Indeed, for the sake of the peace of the churches, we have long ignored many things. He has not published a book for a long time in which he has not criticized our Zwingli, who deserved better, and also accused us. For this reason, we have repeatedly, with letters written most amicably to Luther, dissuaded the man. But we have also often heard at great expense Dr. Bucer splendidly discussing the concord of Luther with the Swiss churches and promising much. Our churches responded to Luther's letter and even contracted friendship with him, all injuries and hostile pamphlets being erased by oblivion. Forgetful of all this, he continues to act in his own way, trampling peace and sounding the trumpet of war. Therefore, enough has been ignored until now. Enough has been given. Enough has been attempted. He prefers war to peace. Meanwhile, there is no need to fear that we will exceed modesty in responding. We have never liked that furious reviling and most savage style of Luther, lacking example, so that we do not greatly desire to imitate it now. Nor do we have any business with the Anabaptists, with Campanus, with Schwenckfeld, and other authors of sects. We will handle our own cause. You pray to the Lord that all may turn to the glory of Christ and the salvation of the churches. We discuss these matters more fully with you because we love you and especially wish you to know our innocence. It also greatly pains us that you too are in no small danger. Therefore, if you can be relieved by our help, we offer all our resources to you. Come to us. The homes of all of us will be open to you. Nor will you be an ungrateful guest to our Magistrate and Republic. An honorable stipend will be provided for you. Meanwhile, keep us in your prayers, and pray to the Lord for us. Live and farewell. Dr. Pellikan, Megander, Bibliander, Gwalther, Fabritius, and the others send you their most friendly greetings. Zurich, December 3, 1544. We commend to you this diligent young man from Schaffhausen, who greatly praises your kindness, faith, and diligence. May the Lord Jesus keep you. Heinrich Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
