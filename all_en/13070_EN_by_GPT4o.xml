    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick received a letter from a well-informed man [...] with the advice that the people of Konstanz should reconcile with Emperor Charles V and, in this regard, turn to Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle. He would only advocate for this in the name of good neighborly relations, without expecting any reward! How strange! For how does this fit with the news that Bullinger was informed of? The human heart is truly corrupt and full of deceit!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The letter to Zwick also states that the Emperor and King Henry II of France were in agreement, but the Frenchman kept this secret, as he is much more cautious than his father Francis I.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Additionally, a five-year peace treaty has been concluded between Sultan Suleiman and the Emperor. One can imagine for what purpose!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Council of Trent is to be continued and immediately reconvened. At the Emperor's summons, all authorities are obliged to participate, and all decisions made there are to be accepted and adhered to without objection. Any resistance will immediately result in punitive measures, especially since no estate is powerful enough to stand against it alone. Soon, the authorities will likely be prohibited from publicly proclaiming the Gospel, and those who oppose it will have to reckon with execution or expulsion. Many will turn away from the Gospel because they are unstable. Others believe that Pope Paul III will prevent the council and leave it at the decisions made in Trent and Bologna.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The wretched monk from Schlettstadt, Johannes Hoffmeister, was on his way to Augsburg to plot against the Gospel. However, in Günzburg, he fell ill with the plague, and as he lay dying, he confessed in the presence of a Palatine secretary named Joachim Sailus [correct: Rutland], as a scholar of the Holy Scriptures who had recognized the truth, to have deliberately fought against it. Therefore, he could expect no mercy from God and was eternally damned. Georg Frölich shared this. He mentioned, among other things, that he could no longer sign with "Frölich," even though he still holds the same convictions. All reporters from Augsburg write of fear and distress!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The [captured] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony remains faithful to the Gospel. He is not treated poorly and is quartered with Leonhard Stöcklin, who is friends with Blarer. Stöcklin wrote that the Elector still has a court with about 40 servants, his chancellery [including Erasmus von Minckwitz], and some court preachers [including Christoph Hoffmann] with him. When he leaves the house, he is said to be surrounded by 50 Spaniards armed with rifles, thus displaying his captivity. Perhaps he will be released during the Diet. Landgrave Philip of Hesse is still in Donauwörth [captured]. No one knows more about his condition, except that he is not well treated. There are many rumors about him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Philipp Melanchthon was reappointed to the University of Wittenberg by the newly appointed Elector Maurice of Saxony. It remains intact. However, some claim he has renounced his faith: A pure lie!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger will have learned by now what happened to Pier Luigi Farnese, the Pope's son, in Piacenza. It is said that the Emperor will expel the current Pope and appoint another at his discretion. However, such a Pope could be even worse than the current one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] A man coming from Donauwörth [...] reports that the Landgrave is in good spirits.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Last week, the mayor of Augsburg, Jakob Herbrot, sent a messenger [...] to Blarer, to whom he gave a letter of credence. The messenger reported that everything points to an attack on Konstanz and that the Emperor intends to punish Konstanz as an example. Therefore, the people of Konstanz are advised to seek reconciliation with King Ferdinand and the Emperor as quickly as possible. He has brought several thousand horses from the Netherlands and wants to keep his army over the winter. Due to his peace with the Turks and with France, he does not have to fear any unrest in the empire, so he can freely proceed against the city of Konstanz and its neighbors, the Confederates. Blarer recently (as before) informed Bullinger in a letter [not received] about the negotiations of the Konstanz authorities. However, there is complete uncertainty about the Emperor's intentions and plans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The committee of the imperial cities at the Augsburg Diet has rejected the Council of Trent and, as before, demanded from the Emperor the holding of a free, Christian council in Germany. It is questionable whether this will be granted to the cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] When did Hans Schöner leave Zurich and where did he go?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] One should pray to the infinitely merciful God that He may reveal His steadfast, invincible, and firmly founded Church to the world! Meanwhile, sermons should call for true and swift repentance so that Germany may escape devastation! May the Church improve and the authorities exercise stricter censorship! May the Lord have mercy on His own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Bullinger is thanked for having so conscientiously advocated for the young people of Konstanz with Johannes Wolf. Soon, the young [Josua Boschar] will come to Zurich with his younger brother [Joseph]. Bullinger may assure Wolf that the two boys are teachable and not troublemakers and that they will not set a bad example for the other boarders. Blarer vouches for this. His relative, Gregor von Ulm, will not send the [entrusted Walter and Heinrich or Achior von Ulm] to Zurich for the time being. Therefore, it is convenient if Wolf now takes in the brothers [Boschar]. Greetings to Wolf!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Is Count Georg of Württemberg still in Zurich?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] [P.S.:] That's all for now, as Blarer only learned late that the letter carrier [Barbara Winzürn?] is traveling to Zurich. Moreover, he is currently very busy.</p>

      <p>A good, dear man, who may know many things, wrote to my dear cousin Zwick, advising that it would be wise for my lords to seek reconciliation with the Emperor's Majesty through Lord Granvelle. He would gladly promote matters for the best, not for any gifts or rewards, but solely for the sake of good neighborly relations. These are his words! This greatly surprises us, as it aligns with the things written to you and other matters mentioned, and much more. The human heart is full of deceit; the heart of man is wicked and inscrutable.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>This letter also states that certainly and without doubt, the Emperor and the Frenchman are in agreement. However, the Frenchman keeps his matters secret and completely quiet. He is very cautious and acts much more prudently than his father did. He knows a good, solid reason for this, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is also certain that a five-year peace has been made between the Turk and the Emperor. For what purpose all this serves is easy to understand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Council of Trent is to proceed and be reconvened anew, and that without delay. The Emperor's Majesty will have all Christian authorities summoned there. What is decided there shall be accepted and upheld by everyone without further objection. Whoever opposes it will find execution readily available, for no estate is powerful enough to resist, as all others will be against it. Oh, how soon it will be done that no authority will have the Gospel anymore or will dare to preach it publicly, and especially Christians who wish to remain with it will have to give their necks for it or be expelled and driven away! All things are leading to great persecution and cruel bloodshed. Therefore, a great apostasy will occur among all who have not set their affairs on a right footing and laid a good, firm, rocky foundation. However, it is believed that the Pope will hinder this council, for he wants it to remain as it was decided in Trent and then in Bologna.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The wretched monk from Schlettstadt, called the Hofmeister, also went to Augsburg to practice his matters against God's word. But when he came to Günzburg, the plague struck him. And as he was about to die, he said in the presence of a Palatine secretary named Joachim Sailus: "I am a learned doctor of the Holy Scriptures. I have well understood the truth, but knowingly fought against it. Therefore, I have no mercy to expect. I must be eternally lost." This was written to me by Lętus, among other things, with the note that he could no longer write "Frölich," although his heart and mind remain as always. Everyone writes of fear and distress from Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Elector is held very well. He is steadfast in God's word and firm. He is staying with Lord Leonhard Stöcklin, who is a very kind, dear lord and friend to me. He writes that he still holds a princely court and has about 40 of his dear servants with him, along with his chancellery. When he goes out, about 50 Spaniards with rifles always go before and after him, showing his captivity, although it is believed he will be released from his captivity at this diet. He still has his preachers. They preach to him at the lodging, etc. The Landgrave is still in Donauwörth. No one hears any real reason about how he is doing, except that he is not supposed to be well treated. Much and various things are said about him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Philipp is back in Wittenberg, appointed by the new Elector Duke Maurice. And the school remains in all respects as before, although some claim he has recanted, etc. But these are fables.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You may now well know what happened to the Pope's son in Piacenza. There are wonderful things. It is finally believed that the Emperor intends to depose this Pope and appoint another of his liking, who might be no less, perhaps even much more harmful than the current one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Now someone says (coming from Donauwörth) that the Landgrave is very cheerful and light-hearted. (in good spirits) Nothing can be noticed in him that he is somewhat sad and discouraged.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Last week, the mayor, Herbrot, had someone with me with a letter of credence, that I should believe what he would discuss with me and let me know through him: He cannot think or suspect otherwise, from everything he sees, hears, and can learn (he also hears from some prominent people in confidence), that the Emperor intends to attack us and set an example that many others should follow. Therefore, he also seriously advises that one should quickly, without any delay, seek reconciliation with the Emperor and King Ferdinand. The Emperor has now sent several thousand fresh horses from the Netherlands. He wants to winter and keep the army. Since he has peace with the Turks and France, and no unrest to worry about in the empire, there is nothing else but that he intends to undertake something against us and our neighbors. Although my lords are in negotiations (as you know and I have informed you before and for this), yet no one knows how they mean it against us and what they might undertake.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The committee of the cities at the Augsburg Diet refuses the Council of Trent. They demand that the Emperor convene a free Christian council in the German nation, as has always been desired. It is not known whether they will achieve this or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I would like to know where the good Hans Schöner has gone and when he left you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, let us press with holy persistence the ears of His inexhaustible mercy, that He may reveal His Church to the whole world, which is built upon the most firm and invincible rock. Let us urge true and timely repentance, without which we will soon see the dreadful desolation and devastation of Germany! Let the Church of Christ be reformed into a worthy appearance! Let the magistrate be moved to stricter censorship! Ah, what else shall we expect outside of that than certain destruction? May the Lord look upon us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>For the great faith and diligence you have shown with your Wolf, I am most grateful. A young man will soon be there with his younger brother. Tell Wolf to be assured of the teachability of both. I will be their guarantor. They will not disturb anything at all. Gregorius from Ulm, my relative, will not send his for certain reasons. Therefore, I think it will not be inconvenient for Wolf to receive these two brothers, from whose manners he will not fear anything for his other students. Greet the excellent man very respectfully for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Let me know if Count Georg of Württemberg is still there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best brother. September 26, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>There was no time for more, as I learned late about the departure of that woman to you and am now involved in many affairs.</p>
      <p>To his incomparable friend and brother, Heinrich Bullinger, the most holy Antistes of Zurich and most vigilant pastor of Zurich.</p>
