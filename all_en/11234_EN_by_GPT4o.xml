    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his hasty writing [No. 1189] again due to the rushed departure. Praises the teaching of the Strasbourg teachers, but due to the high cost of living, he must return to Basel next Fronfasten [December 18]; Bullinger should remind Grynaeus of the promise to accommodate him and ensure that he can settle the lodging with Bedrot in a timely manner.

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>When I had to leave Basel, I wrote a letter to you, most esteemed patron, and I do not doubt that you were greatly surprised by its rough composition. But here is the reason for it in brief: Since the plague had already begun to infest the house of Mr. Miconius, I decided, following the advice of Mr. Grynaeus and Miconius, to move to Strasbourg, not so much because of the plague, but because almost all the lecturers had stopped teaching. So, having made this decision, I happened by chance to come to the port and found a ship just about to depart. Therefore, I immediately returned home and wrote this letter to you in haste, in which I wanted to inform you of my departure and other matters. Therefore, I ask you not to consider this as negligence, but as something compelled by necessity.</p>
      <p>The current state of my affairs is this: I have arrived in Strasbourg under good auspices, where literary studies are now flourishing in a remarkable way. For there, the most learned men, Johannes Sturm, Bedrot, Capito, Herlin the mathematician, and many others are teaching. However, the more learned the teachers here, the more I regret that I cannot stay among them for long. For, as they say, the cost of living here is high, and having been received into the house of Bedrot, I agreed with him on a price, which would require me to pay twenty-seven florins of Strasbourg currency per year, which, when converted to Zurich currency, amounts to almost twenty-eight and a half florins. Therefore, I cannot see how I can live here any longer. For I could not live more cheaply with anyone here. Therefore, I have decided not to stay here longer than until the next Fronfasten, as they call it, and then I will return to Basel; for this also pleased Mr. Grynaeus and Miconius, who always promised me that his house would be available to me. Grynaeus also promised me his assistance in mathematics, and I would especially like you to remind him of his old promise, in case he might receive me into his houseâ€”not that I am displeased with Miconius's family, but because it would be much more beneficial for my studies. I now ask you to ensure that my money is sent to me in such a way that I receive it by December 18th or even earlier, so that I can settle with Bedrot and leave. For the longer I am forced to wait for it, the more the expenses increase.</p>
      <p>With me in the same house is a most honorable and wealthy young man from Schaffhausen, Martin Beyer. He would very much like to have some Zurich paper and has asked me to write to you about it; therefore, I earnestly ask you, if possible, to send this paper to Basel to Miconius or someone else, who can then forward it to Strasbourg. He will pay very well (completely correctly) for what it costs and for any expenses incurred with transport and other things.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write now, nor is there anything new, except that there are disputes and preludes to future war between the people of Nuremberg and the Prince of Brandenburg, whom they call the Margrave; but I suppose you have much more certain information about these matters.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf your mother and your wife along with the entire family.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, October 30, 1538.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed patron.</p>
