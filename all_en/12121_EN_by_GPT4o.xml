    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though Pontisella has only rarely written to his patron Bullinger until now, he is by no means ungrateful in view of Bullinger's great merits towards him; rather, he fears bothering the very busy scholar with his unlearned letters; yet, considering Bullinger's well-known kindness, he now allows himself to write briefly. - He would present Bullinger with the state of the [Nikolai] school, of which he is the schoolmaster, but believes it is more appropriate for Bullinger to learn about it from a letter [not received] [from Pastor Johannes] Comander, which will soon be addressed to him. He merely wants to inform that the number of students has grown so much that two [teachers] alone are no longer sufficient; however, he fears that they want to impose [Simon] Lemnius on him (which they have tried before). Bullinger, whose authority is respected, should write to the mayor of Chur, Luzi Heim, and [the school commissioner] Johannes Travers, so that he is no longer bothered with Lemnius. The [school] commissioners will meet at the next St. Paul's Fair. Bullinger is free to write something. - Greetings from Comander; greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler] and the children, also to his patron, the provost [Felix Frey], and to the other gentlemen.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If my letters can bring any pleasure or joy to anyone, then certainly I would confess that I owe more to you, most excellent man and most esteemed patron, than to anyone else. For the multitude of your merits towards me is so great that nothing which could be pleasant or useful to you can be omitted by me without a great crime of ingratitude. But since my letters do not have such sweetness that they can please or delight anyone, I easily believe that I can be free from the crime of ingratitude, even if I have written to you less often until now; indeed, I think I should rather now seek pardon from you, who, being both a most learned and most busy man, I do not fear to disturb with my unlearned letters. And indeed, comparing the excellence of your dignity with the humility of my condition, I was first deterred from writing; but then recalling your kindness, with which I knew you were endowed towards people of even the lowest condition, I was again confirmed in my intention, namely, to take up the pen and write these few things to you. However, since I have undertaken to write to you, I ought to reveal to you the state of the school, of which you know I am the head; but I thought it more convenient that you learn about it from the letters of Mr. Comander, my singular patron, who will soon write to you. At present, however, I only want to inform you that our literary school is so overwhelmed with the number of boys that two alone cannot suffice to teach and educate them. However, I fear that they may want to impose Lemnius on me, as they have attempted before if I request a collaborator. Therefore, most kind sir, I would like to ask you to deign to write something to our consul in Chur, Luzi Heim, and to Mr. Johannes Travers on this matter; and if this is done, there is no longer any reason for me to fear that they will trouble me with Lemnius, an impure man. For I know well that they will respect your authority. The commissioners, as they call them, will meet at the next St. Paul's Fair, if it would be convenient for your kindness to write anything. Farewell now, most excellent man and most esteemed patron, and always keep me commended to your trust. Mr. Comander ordered me to write many greetings to you at the end of my letter. Also, in my words, you will most dutifully greet your most honorable wife and your most beautiful children; and I beg you to deign to convey my greetings to the provost, my singular patron, and to my other most esteemed gentlemen in my name. Farewell again, most respected sir. Given at Chur, 11 days before the Kalends of February, in the year of salvation, etc. 45.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pontisella, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
