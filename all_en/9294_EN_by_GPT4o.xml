      <p> Greetings. I give immortal thanks to your kindness, most esteemed father, who with paternal indulgence and sweetness do not hesitate to daily send us something new and auspicious from France. In return, though in a different manner, I send what I have collected about our past affairs, and today I am finally expecting the series and essence of the history from the Thusis pastor, which I will send next. Meanwhile, you will pray to the Lord for us and for the safety of matters, that He may bring everything to a successful and fruitful conclusion for the glory of His name and the salvation of this church. I am not surprised, however, if I were given the opportunity to leave here, that people so deceitful would be present to accuse me of being the author of these disturbances, just as Christ was called seditious and almost condemned for that reason. But what do truth and innocence care for the most deceitful judgments of diabolical men? Yet no one, not even the most shameless, here attributes this mass of disturbances to us: and your people, whose assertion and vindication should have been a comfort to us, would do so, since the best among them cannot doubt how unjustly we and the church are being treated? The rest at another time. </p>
      <p> Our best consul Willius greets you, as does Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, along with Charles and many good people. </p>
      <p> Most swiftly. April 21, 1573. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> Please send whatever there is of the history to Mr. Haller to read, as you usually do. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary and most renowned pastor of the Zürich church, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Zürich to the pastor at the Great Minster. </p>
