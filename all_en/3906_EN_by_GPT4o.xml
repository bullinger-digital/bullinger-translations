      <p>Most distinguished man, I received your esteemed letter written on April 3rd long ago, and until now I have not had the opportunity to write back. The last letters from your esteemed self, addressed to Fabritius and Gallitius, included greetings and the narration of events, which I found very delightful to read. Now, something I consider worthy of your knowledge has come up: on February 6th, peace was reaffirmed between the Turk and Emperor Ferdinand, primarily mediated by our king; Ferdinand will pay an annual 30,000, as previously agreed, for what he possesses in Hungary, and certain court gifts or gates, as they call them, and a castle captured by the Turks will remain with them, though not without cost; since Ferdinand owed a five-year tribute, he will pay two parts of it within three months, and the remainder will be considered as received for the castle. Ferdinand will regard the friends and enemies of the other as his own friends and enemies; the kingdom of Hungary, however, will be divided into three with open boundaries, so that all occasion for war is removed, and the prince of Transylvania will retain his own unscathed. Regarding peace among the greatest Christian kings, which your esteemed self cannot be unaware of, a nearly certain rumor is being spread, and the matter seems to be in the harbor. The Pope suffers from a golden leg, which they consider lethal, yet he does not lay down his offenses against his own nor does he relent in the invention of cares, and he has decreed that by April 6th all bishops must be found in their seats, to remain there perpetually, unless a very necessary cause grants a two-month absence, and this under the gravest penalties. Some add dropsy to the Pope's old age.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, may your esteemed self fare well, to whom I sincerely wish all good things. From Chur, March 30, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your esteemed self's most obedient friend, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
