    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius was worried about Bullinger's long silence and thought of illness, misfortune, or a possible disagreement. He often asked [Johannes] Gast and others what the reason for this could be. Bullinger's letter [not received] with the good news was all the more welcome to him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding Bullinger's question: Captain Martin von Rossem marched with a large army to southern Germany to Emperor Charles V. However, he was recalled by the imperial forces because [King Christian III of] Denmark and the Hanseatic cities had invaded Charles's territory. Hence the rumor that a large part of Friesland was occupied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In Mainz, 70 cavalrymen arrived, who wanted to wait there for 2000 riders (the so-called Black Riders) and 14000 foot soldiers. After Bishop [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] had entertained them, they were expelled from the city. However, the bishop stationed 600 men on the Rhine to prevent a crossing of the river. Then the Hessians came, sent the 600 home again, and occupied three villages on the Rhine. Therefore, it is now believed that [the Dutch army of the Emperor] is cut off unless it succeeds in breaking through elsewhere.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- In Ensisheim, a diet was held on the orders of King [Ferdinand I], where new taxes were set and every third man was called to war. They are proud of this future army there, while others are afraid. The Sundgauers are taking pikes and armor out of [Altkirch]. The people of Mulhouse are procuring many larger cannonballs in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Martin [von Rossem] has written to the Emperor that he is being recalled. Therefore, he cannot provide him with assistance and would need help himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] is conducting church visitations as in peacetime and explained to an inquirer [...] that this must be done before preparing for war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Myconius has not heard anything from Bernhard [Meyer zum Pfeil], [the envoy] at the [Baden] diet. Bullinger is mistaken when he writes that Myconius would have learned everything from Meyer. Today, for the first time, the still completely unknown results of the Baden diet are being presented to the council. It is good that the Five Places have abandoned their plan to recall the [Swiss] mercenaries!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Claudius] Cantiuncula wrote to [Bonifacius] Amerbach that Charles V, upon leaving Regensburg, had left it open to hear the Gospel or attend Mass. May the Lord protect his church from the Spaniard's cunning!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger should take care of his health in the interest [of the church] and not overwork himself! Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther. [Johannes] Gast sends his regards back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- PS: The young Margrave [Bernhard von Baden-Durlach] has invaded the monastery of Schuttern [with mercenaries] at Abbot [Rudolf Garb]. The abbot fled to Ensisheim. When a monk complained about the large amount of food supplies consumed by the plunderers, the abbot replied that he was already glad that the monastery was still standing!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I was anxious because of your silence, not knowing what to think. Thoughts of illness came to mind, as well as misfortune for our people, or perhaps an offense to you, though there was no cause. In short, I often said to Gast and others: "What could be the reason that he does not write?" Therefore, the letters you sent are all the more welcome now, and the news you conveyed is more joyful. Thanks be to the Lord, who grants us the right spirit for the glory of His name and word.</p>

      <p>As for what you ask, here is the situation. Martin von Rossem, the captain, had gathered a large army and began to march into Upper Germany to assist Charles. But after he had progressed somewhat, he was recalled by the imperial forces because the Danes and the maritime cities had made an incursion into Charles's territories. This rumor suggests that a large part of Friesland has been occupied. Furthermore, 70 cavalrymen arrived in Mainz, intending to wait there for 2000 more riders (called the Black Riders) and 14000 foot soldiers.</p>

      <p>After being entertained with food and drink by the bishop, the former were expelled from the city. Moreover, the same bishop stationed 600 men on the Rhine to block the crossing. Meanwhile, the Hessians came and, after sending those 600 home, occupied three places on the Rhine. Thus, it is thought that this army is also cut off unless they find another place to break through. The nobility of Ensisheim held a meeting by the king's order. They imposed a new tax and selected every third man for war. They boast that they will soon have an army with which they will accomplish something. The rest are afraid. The people of Sundgau are taking pikes and armor to the city, and our people of Mulhouse are buying a large number of larger cannonballs from us.</p>

      <p>Martin wrote to the Emperor that he was recalled, and therefore cannot provide assistance. It is necessary that help be given to him.</p>

      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne, as if living in peace, visits his parishes to ensure everything is done piously. When asked by someone why he does this in such turbulent times, he replied that it must be done, and that he will prepare for what pertains to war afterwards.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Since the diet, Bernard has not spoken a word with me, so I am ignorant of all the matters you write about. You are mistaken when you write: "I know Bernard hides nothing from you." Today, for the first time, the acts of the Baden diet are being reported to the senate, about which no one knows anything. I am glad that the Five Places have abandoned their plan to recall the soldiers.</p>

      <p>The little song, whose name you know, wrote to Amorbach that Charles, when he wanted to leave Regensburg, left it free to hear the Gospel or attend Mass. Oh, Spanish ingenuity! May the Lord Jesus protect His church.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and take care of your health! The work is indeed too much. If you wish to be of service for a long time, do what you can to live long! May Christ preserve you for us! Greet Gwalther diligently. Gast sends his regards back to you.</p>

      <p>Your Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>The young Margrave has fallen into the monastery of Schuttern with the abbot. They have eaten and drunk. He has fled to Ensisheim. A monk complained that they drank a lot of wine, consumed 4 oxen and many pigs. The abbot says: "If only the monastery stands, then it is all right," etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
