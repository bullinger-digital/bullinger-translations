      <p>God the Lord has faithfully protected my church up to this point from the Anabaptists, pious lord and trusted brother in the Lord Jesus. But since St. John's Day, when this came to pass, I have summoned them all, women and men, and in the presence of my congregation, I admonished them, for God's sake and in view of the mandate issued by our lords (which I read to them) to desist from their conduct, which is: they go to the Anabaptists' preaching, get up at night from their beds, leaving the children behind, and go away, do not come to our preaching, saying our lords have nothing to do with them, they are willing to risk life and limb for the cause, claiming the Anabaptists are right, etc. I also offered them, if they have any lack of teaching, they should come to me, and I will kindly discuss with them, so that they desist, etc. To which they replied: Yes, as soon as they are done with the harvest, which now burdens them, they will let me know the day and come to me, etc. When the harvest was over, they sent word to me and indicated that if I am willing, they are ready to take up the matter with me before the whole community. To this, I, pious brother, took time to consider, for I suspect that they would like to spread the sect further and are so malicious that they would set me up to incur greater displeasure, and I know that if I dealt with them publicly according to their proposal, they already have in mind not to accept it, but rather to cause more trouble.</p>
      <p>Therefore, pious lord and brother, I desire your written advice on how I should conduct myself with them. I must not leave the parish, to avoid suspicion, which is why I am consulting with you about this and other matters concerning my office. Therefore, always act as a faithful brother, as I will also do, as God enlightens my understanding, and gladly do what is best, and whatever advice I might find with you that would be the most Christian, I will undertake with the people. For I know the people in the parish so well that kindness achieves little, and strictness will not help. My congregation has also long reported to the subordinate authority, also requesting that someone be appointed to Dachsen, where there has been none since Christmas, but the lazy and sluggish bailiff has never given any response.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend you truly to God the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Laufen, July 28.</p>
      <p>Peter Frick, your willing brother in the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>To my trusted dear lord and brother, M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
