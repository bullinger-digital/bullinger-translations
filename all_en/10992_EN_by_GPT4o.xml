    <p xml:id="regest1">Justify their refusal to Bucer, with which they reacted to his letter [No. 939] to the displeasure of Myconius and Grynaeus; through his partisan behavior, which has become evident with his "retractions," he divides the Swiss churches and unjustly creates the impression that the Zwinglians have revised their doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the sense of Luther. They do not want to respond to his letter for the time being and ask the people of Zurich to express their opinion on it.</p>

      <p>Health and a peaceful conscience through Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel have sent us a common letter from Bucer addressed to them, the people of Zurich, and the people of Bern, esteemed men and brothers in the Lord. While Mr. Myconius urged a response to it as soon as possible, and Megander, according to the opinion of most of us, replied that there would be no further dealings with Bucer, because he, having been an arbitrator of two parties, has become a party himself, abandoning the friendly side and defecting to the hostile one. It cannot be expressed how indignantly both Myconius and Grynaeus have taken this matter. Both accuse us, not without a troubled mind, of being superstitious defenders of the glory and name of Zwingli, especially at this time when the peace of all churches should be pursued, regardless of what Bucer has retracted. For no loss of truth occurs through his retraction in the matter of the Eucharist, because he retracts nothing that our common confession does not contain. Whether these things are entirely as they seem, we leave to you and all sincere and circumspect brothers (since we are accused of being so much given to emotions) to judge. Unless disturbances have completely shaken off the rule and yoke of reason and have become unbridled in us, it seems that not only the praise of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, good and learned men, but truth itself (which both diligently taught and defended) is in danger. For if anyone carefully considers all of Bucer's plans, while he offered himself as an arbitrator for reconciling peace between us and the Lutherans, will he not say that everything tended to this, that Luther was right in all things concerning the matter of the Eucharist, and we were wrong? Certainly. For he continually postponed this matter, retracted what had been done and transacted, until by enticing some with flattery and vain promises, and terrifying others with threats, and finally by innumerable arts and a thousand tricks, he managed to scatter the Swiss churches and draw some to himself. Having achieved this wish, he finally revealed his long-disguised retraction. In which he was not content to recant alone, but (such is the man's cunning and craftiness!) he writes therein that the people of Basel also agree with him. And to make this more credible, he cunningly arranged for his Retractions to be printed not in Strasbourg, but in Basel, so that it might become known to the whole Christian world that the people of Basel agreed with Bucer. What do I say about the people of Basel? Indeed, so that we all might be suspected, as if we had changed our opinion on the presence of the Lord in the holy supper and yielded to Luther, since such a great leader of the Zwinglians (as they call us) has recanted. But lest anyone say that we are also indulging in emotions now, when we say that this was Bucer's aim in making peace, come, let us produce as evidence, besides other manifest and innumerable conjectures, the letter of Frecht, pastor of the church of Ulm, in which he wrote to Erasmus Hippodamus, our brother and fellow minister, not long ago, that he had learned both from Strasbourg and Constance that three Swiss churches, namely St. Gallen, Basel, and Mulhouse, had subscribed to the bare articles of the Wittenbergers. And such a great man would undoubtedly not have written this unless he had received it from certain and trustworthy people. Meanwhile, let us remain silent about the fact that Bucer, with all his accomplices, is now intent on this one thing, that the sacraments and the external word of God be so adorned, cultivated, and made august and venerable, that, while the signs are confused with the signified, it finally happens that what belongs to divine grace alone is again attributed to the sign and the dead letter, and later ages become much worse than the former. Whether they do this unknowingly or knowingly and with reason, the Lord knows and will judge them. It is not for us to judge anyone. For each stands or falls to his own Lord. Nor do we judge except those caught in manifest snares and tricks, whom we think it worthwhile to recognize, so that they do not deceive both the unlearned and the learned everywhere and cast new shadows in the shining light of the gospel.</p>
      <p>This is our opinion on Bucer's retraction, and we do not intend to respond to his letter until, with common counsel from you and us, we are better informed by the passage of time about what should be done in such a critical matter. Meanwhile, it will be your task, excellent brothers, if you consider us too hasty, fervent, and rash in judgment, to restrain and moderate the movement of the mind with your modesty. Therefore, we wish to ask you in the Lord to inform us as soon as possible what you think about all these matters, especially about Bucer's common letter. As for us, however much we may be considered indulgent to emotions, we are nevertheless prepared to do anything (with Christ as our leader and guide) that pertains to maintaining the old and making new concord among brothers, provided it is done without loss of truth and without offense to the present and future age. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord, all of you.</p>
      <p>Given from Bern, February 17, 1537.</p>
      <p>The ministers of the church of Bern in administering the word of the Lord and teaching good letters.</p>
      <p>To the lords Heinrich Bullinger, Leo, Pellican, and Theodor Bibliander, overseers and professors of good letters of the church of Zurich, their beloved lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
