      <p>Greetings. It is reported to us with certainty from the Duchy of W端rttemberg that someone named Rambouillet has been sent from France to the prince; what he is doing, I do not know. Furthermore, there are those who say that the Duke of Guise seeks a meeting with the W端rttembergers and that the place designated is Saverne in Alsace, not far from Strasbourg. I do not affirm this for certain.</p>
      <p>This I know: no one in this age lives who strives with greater effort to impose that idol of the Augsburg Confession on all nations. He is driven by the Ubiquist Brenz, who is raving in this controversy.</p>
      <p>Recently he said (this is most certain): "Now at last it appears in the acts of France what Beza and Calvin and others think about the cause of the Eucharist." Hear another thing: Vergerius recently wrote to the Chur council (I had the letters in my hands); among other things, he said: "I am old and in poor health, and yet I fear that I may be forced to go to France in the dead of winter, and indeed soon." He writes to Philipp Gallitz: "I still fear that I must go to France; indeed, now I fear it more than ever before." The letters were dated in T端bingen on the 4th of December.</p>
      <p>Therefore, advise the brothers in France, if he comes, to receive him as he deserves. I write this in great haste and wish you and all yours the best of health; I also pray for a most happy year for you and yours. Please ensure that your people write to inform me of what is happening in France and what hope there is.</p>
      <p>The adversaries here spread ill omens; I hope for better things and pray to the Lord to have mercy on us. Greet and commend Tretius Polonus, whose two letters I have received; I have not yet been able to respond. Z端rich, 29th of December, 1562.</p>
      <p>Martyr greets you; all our brothers greet you. May the Lord bless you and keep you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I have not reread this.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
