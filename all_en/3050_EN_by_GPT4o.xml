      <p>Greetings. Today, my dearest compater in the Lord, I received your letter along with the gift for our little Heinrich, for which we thank you greatly, especially for your constant benevolence towards him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay you and yours a thousandfold! I have not yet seen your Apocalypse, but I have no doubt that you handle everything with your usual moderation, nor am I the one who should pass judgment on the vigils and labors of others, even if you ask this of me by the right of our friendship, which is more due to your modesty than to my estimation. Furthermore, I am so disposed towards you, who labor in the vineyard of the Lord, especially towards those with whom I have some familiarity, that I do not think it is my place to judge what they write too curiously. It is far different if a brother reads the works of a brother than if some adversary reads them, who thinks that every detail must be scrutinized and criticized. Therefore, it is not dissimulation if I do not undertake a thorough review of your labors. Let it not be that we act dissimulatively with each other, nor let it be that we scrutinize and examine each other's writings too curiously. However, if while reading, something occurs that I do not understand or think others will not take rightly, I will candidly advise, since you wish me to do so.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I ask you, when you write to our dear Laetus, to advise him to write what he thinks his prince's opinion is of my Commentaries on John. For since the time I dedicated them to his name, I have not been able to learn whether he approves of my service or rejects it.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet in my name the dear brother in the Lord, Peter Martyr, and the old friend Bernardinus Ochinus, and the rest of your colleagues there, along with Bibliander. We all wish much health to your most honorable wife, your children, and your entire household.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 22, 1556.</p>
      <p>W. Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest compater. Zurich.</p>
