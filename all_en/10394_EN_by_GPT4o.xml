    <p xml:id="regest1">The mass priest of Baden is causing a stir with a sermon in which he wants to prove the existence of four hells. Bullinger will have heard about the decisions of the Diet regarding the imprisoned pastor of Birmenstorf, Jakob Appenzeller, and about the people of Diessenhofen. Martin Pfiffenmacher reports how Thomas, the servant at the Rüden, wants to send his son to the Wettingen monastery against his will. Please do something about it, as otherwise Zurich will be cast in a bad light. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly, willing service, also whatever I can do for love and good, as always before.</p>
      <p>Pious, especially gracious lord, also faithful, dear and good friend, I assume you are well aware of how the mass priest here in Baden preached on a certain Palm Sunday that there are four hells, which he wanted to prove with holy scripture, but without any scripture (no Bible passage) and instead showed much shouting about it. Further, what was handled here on that day, how it fared for the imprisoned preacher, those from Diessenhofen and other matters, I assume you have been well informed from the beginning, making it unnecessary to write to you about it, except for what I consider necessary to write to you and all Zurichers for the good: Namely, Martin Pfiffenmacher from Zurich, who is bathing here, came to me and complained from a true heart how Thomas, the servant at the Rüden (I almost wrote at the wild people), has sent his son to Wettingen into the monastery to become a monk there. Now he has spoken with the boy, who answered him that if he had a proper father and mother, he would not be there; but he must be there. Now yesterday, when Thomas's wife came here to the market with cloths (pieces of cloth), he also addressed her about it and was very dissatisfied, she answered him, the boy now wants to be there. It is nothing but trickery and lying, for Thomas is said to have bought the monk's habit for him six or eight weeks ago. Therefore, gracious, dear lord, I write to you, also out of Martin's good intention, about this; it is because if you could prevent such a thing, for it is certain that they want to invest the young man in eight days, and if such a thing happens, it would not be a person, but the name of Zurich, which would place a great obstacle for us and especially for the word of God, as you well consider. Therefore, it is our mutual request to act in a Christian manner in this matter. I would have much more to write to you, but I cannot because of my bad hands, which the bath has caused me.</p>
      <p>Herewith I commend you to God the Lord. I ask you to greet the sexton, Master Wernher and all good lords and friends of God for me.</p>
      <p>Given at Baden, on St. George's Day, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Gebhart Hegner, mayor of Winterthur, your always willing friend.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, Christian preacher in Zurich, my gracious lord and beloved friend.</p>
