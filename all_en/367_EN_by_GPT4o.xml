      <p>God's grace and my willing service beforehand, dear godfather. I received your letter along with Blarer's letter and declaration on December 11.</p>
      <p>In it, I am no less troubled and concerned than you are to understand how Calvin's letter, which I sent through you, was not delivered: I would have sooner expected death than that the one to whom I entrusted it with special care did not deliver it, namely Beatus Comes, who spoke to me at the very time I had your letter, asking if I wanted to send anything to Geneva or Lausanne, he would gladly deliver it for me, which I accepted with special thanks, thinking I could not arrange it better, since he said he would at least go to Lausanne himself, from where he would send the letters to Geneva. I trusted him and was deceived. Now I will hold on here as much as I can, and not relent until I bring the letters to an end. I have only recently learned that since he has resigned from the preaching office and is no longer held in high regard, there is not much special trust or integrity left in him. But I ask you, for God's sake, to excuse me in this matter. If I could have sent my trust, I would have thought he was aware of this oversight.</p>
      <p>Then you think of another letter that you wrote to me, since I have not received any from you; but I have not received it until this time. It has come to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding Blarer, you write earnestly that I should hurry with the response and send everything back to you without delay. Now I have not been able to have a messenger, which worries me that it has been delayed these days.</p>
      <p>Now you want me to tell no one about it; I will do that; he also asks you to keep it to yourself. Now you have informed me of your trusted opinion and write along with it: "Answer faithfully and freely, what seems to you; but see that I also understand the gist of your response," from which I gather that your opinion is that I should not only answer you but also Blarer. Now I do not know if it is to be done, since he might not like it if he hears that you sent everything to me. Therefore, I will not answer him this time, but I have entrusted my part to you; you will certainly not be offended in this matter. But to answer you, I first thank you very sincerely for not withholding anything from me in this matter. Although the matter itself does not please me, I am pleased with your faithful diligence and work. As far as the matter is concerned, it troubles me that it is made as if on a single last and that the good Blarer is also caught in the chains.</p>
      <p>The matter of the supper, as he elucidates it, I would like to leave in good understanding, as I also believe that Blarer means everything well. For we ourselves do not hold or teach that the signs of wine and bread are there of themselves, but that they lead us and show us Christ, through whom (that is, all that he has acquired for us) we become capable and partakers through faith alone. Therefore, the faithful and thankful contemplation of Christ Jesus and his suffering in the supper should be the highest and foremost and pursued above all things, for otherwise, we are unworthy to partake of it. Through this faith, Christ always communicates himself to us and increases in us before, in, and after the supper, and nothing further in the supper itself to the believers, than as much as the outward symbolic action comes to it, which represents and portrays to our eyes the blessed mystery of Christ's death.</p>
      <p>For there is no other means to attain and grasp Christ and the grace acquired through him than faith and trust in the given body and shed blood, which Blarer himself acknowledges. Such commonality we do not derive from the supper of believers, but we give it to faith alone, and not to the supper. Therefore, it grieves me and will not be heard in our church that, as he says in another [...?], wine and bread in the supper of Christ are not empty signs but are truly given and received, where they are used with faith, that which is signified and represented by them, namely the true body and blood of Christ. These words cannot be used simply by themselves without causing injury to many hearts, therefore he should well consider such usage and the practice that is set forth by him in the explanation. Also, the statement that one should not say that in the supper there is nothing but mere wine and bread given and received, for then there would be no distinction between the supper of Christ and another meal or wine drinking, etc. This also carries suspicion on its back if no other explanation comes to it, and in my opinion, it does not need crooked turns. It is well known that the believer does not rely on bread and wine but on Christ. It is also known that as far as the outward action is concerned, there is indeed nothing else but bread and wine, and therefore it is not a mere meal but a holy mystery of the saving death of Christ. Therefore, one could have said at once that a person should not cling to bread and wine but grasp the suffering with true faith, as it is said in the supper there is not mere bread and wine, etc.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding the other following points, I am so satisfied that although they all belong to the contemplation of the supper, yet in none alone is the entire practice of the supper expressed. I also gladly admit that faith in the death of Jesus is the foremost that is required here, through which we come into the communion of Christ and his goods. However, that the communion is not bound to the supper or given something more than also to faith outside the supper. I do not think that this is either too short or too bluntly spoken or held about the supper.</p>
      <p>That it is also called the supper of Christ because Christ gives us something in it, has not much foundation. He has once given himself to us all on the cross.</p>
      <p>The remembrance of this giving is the supper, and for the sake of remembrance of the once-given gift, it is called the supper of Christ. For if it were called the supper of Christ for the reason he states, it would follow that he gives something else, more than to the believer outside the supper. Moreover, when the Lord institutes it, he tells us why and what we should do, it does not say much that he wants to give and communicate more to us there than through faith at all times. Therefore, it seems too sharp and pointed to me, while he thinks the other is blunt, that the supper of Christ is called the supper because Christ does something and gives us something there, he gives us food and drink not only with wine and bread but with his own body and blood for eternal life, as he then says: take, eat, this is my body, etc. That he says "is" can be understood as "signifies," indeed he does so rightly. That he cites Irenaeus, all Bucerans do, but certainly with a different opinion than Irenaeus spoke. Moreover, the word "handed over" is so very suspicious, for if one does not want to understand by it the handing over that the servant does, but the communication of God's grace to the believers, which does not always happen only in the supper, one could well find a more suitable word than that "handing over" now wants to sound too much on the servant.</p>
      <p>That the word "THAT" points to the heavenly, I leave aside. But it also bites me that it states: which heavenly things are no less present to the believers, also given and received by them, than the earthly wine and bread are to the bodily sight, hands, and mouth. Yes, these high heavenly things are especially handed and received in this supper. In summary, they seem to establish another and fuller exhibition in the supper than outside the supper for the faithful.</p>
      <p>Regarding the manner, it troubles me that he, like others, always says how one must reject human fantasies, as if we ourselves did not know that true faith does not come from flesh and blood. You know, however, that with the exclusion of reason, much else has been excluded, and indeed what we have ever said for the preservation of the true humanity of Christ is counted as fleshly reason, that may still be hidden under this.</p>
      <p>Regarding the word, Sultzer and Batt have made much wonder, always understanding the word: this is my body. But I understand by the word the preaching of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Regarding the miracle, I am also satisfied, and especially that he finally acknowledges from John 6 that eating is nothing else than believing.</p>
      <p>In summary, I see well that he understands the matter well, only what causes grievance he, along with others, can well endure. His discretion pleases me.</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin, I leave his judgment to him, I have also read him and say for myself that I have been perplexed in many places with him. Regarding Bucer, it burdens me greatly. I leave him to be who he is. I do not scold him rashly but know well what he has done. Here he is worth nothing and rightly so. If he wanted to protect himself much, it would not be necessary. I hear him so often being criticized that it seems to me, it sometimes goes quite roughly.</p>
      <p>And therefore, my dear godfather, what should I advise on all this? I am myself involved in the matter. Regarding the doctrine, I expect he will bend as he himself writes: We know that the formulas of speaking are different among others. Here, however, let us allow each church its own freedom, thus moderating everything so that we offend no one, as far as it is possible. If he did that here, it would be better. But, that he hangs so much on Bucer (whose following is cleaned out here) burdens me excessively. If he then wanted to trouble us much with the communion and the contemplation of faith was not sufficient for him and the exhibition, which is always made only to faith both outside and inside the use of the supper, for (not?) who here approaches the external symbol, then one could easily get into a quarrel with each other. Only his moderation comforts me in this, that I hope he would not cause a quarrel and would also be as satisfied with us as we are with him. Therefore, I cannot say either yes or no for myself. I would like to have him; yet the knot presses me, and I know well, if I opened this to my colleagues, there would be no grace anywhere. Therefore, I entrust the whole matter to you, my dear lord and father, as the more understanding one. Oh God, I am still a child in this matter, therefore I also bear the burden of this church more heavily; I also always prefer to believe the better, yet I always fear I will be deceived.</p>
      <p>Therefore, answering according to your pleasure, to which I completely submit myself. If he can moderate himself in all things and not only the 4th conclusion, but also the one that is for the preservation of the same disputation, in the name of God, then I hope for good; if not, then it is better, we remain quiet, so that he also remains quiet; yet not less in all friendship undivided. I also kindly ask you not to take this my unpolished writing and answer for ill. It is market day today, and I have about a hundred pastors around me, making me almost deaf. They have also made it so that I have gathered everything in such a tumultuous manner; please, with your singular humanity, consider it well and know for certain that I will always be yours.</p>
      <p>In Bern, December 13. Greetings from me and my wife to your whole house and Dr. Musculus, to whom I cannot write now due to too many occupations; excuse me, I will not forget him.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>My lords, both treasurers and Venner in the Hag, are in Basel; I will deliver your greetings when they return.</p>
      <p>On my part, they are not well pleased that an unequal answer was given to them and me in Zurich. Mayor Hab gave them an answer, my lords granted me to them as they requested; then the undersigned Bygel gave me the answer, my lords granted me according to the content of my letter until St. John's. I have taken a written document of this. It displeases my lords that the mayor has now answered them differently than advised by my lords. I almost believe he would like to stick me here entirely.</p>
      <p>Musculus's matter still stands as it is, that my lords think it good to wait to see if Blarer comes or not; if he comes, he will also help that it goes sooner; if he does not come, then there is more reason to call him. I will not delay, must now wait until they come from Basel. Lord Jos and Waeberus have never mentioned to me what you wrote to them. I have mentioned in passing what you said to me about Musculus; but they seem to hold the old position. Good Eberhard suspects and fears that he himself will be degraded if Musculus is called; which, however, will not happen, provided he does not fear too much for himself.</p>
      <p>While I am writing this, this letter from Farello comes to me along with another one addressed to me. They would like to sneak into the synod; but it does not happen.</p>
      <p>Also, in this writing, Hans Mangold comes and brings me the other letter along with the mentioned and both sugar loaves. My wife and I thank you, your wife, and godmother Elsbet most highly. May God grant you alone a blessed year and bless you in body and soul!</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the church in Zurich, his lord and venerable godfather. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich to be delivered in haste.</p>
