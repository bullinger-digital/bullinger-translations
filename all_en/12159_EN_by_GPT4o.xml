    <p xml:id="regest1">[Andreas] Osiander has directed a Latin [“Apologia”] against the Zwinglians. He was prompted to do so by the “Speculum [Osiandri]” of an unknown author, with whom [the people of Zurich] have nothing to do. If the people of Zurich had anything against Osiander, they would present it clearly and distinctly. Even if they adhere to Zwingli's teachings, they are not to be condemned. Osiander should leave them in peace. Bullinger asks Groß to persuade [the people of Nuremberg] towards peace and unity, especially since the people of Zurich do not intend to take any action against the people of Nuremberg.</p>

      <p>Your preacher Mr. Osiander has published a very defamatory little book in Latin, in which he speaks very badly of the Zwinglians, etc. The reason for this is as follows: At some point, someone wrote a very defamatory little book called "Mirror" against the aforementioned Mr. Osiander. We here in Zurich (who are also called Zwinglians) never approved of this; we did not create it, and if we had anything to say to Mr. Osiander, we would do it openly and clearly under our own name. However, we have nothing to do with the "Mirror" and do not know where it comes from. Therefore, he should have acted more reasonably and cautiously. Even though we adhere to Zwingli's teachings, because and insofar as he taught from the scriptures, we are not to be condemned and defamed for that. We are Christians and honest people. We have nothing but love and goodwill towards Mr. Osiander. Therefore, he should leave us in peace and conduct his affairs in such a way that he does not consider us honest people to be those whom he insults so badly. I write this to you in a very friendly manner, so that you always advocate among your people for what brings peace, goodwill, and unity; because we here in Zurich do not wish to do anything that would be against you in Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Sebastian Groß, bailiff in Nuremberg. 16th March 1545.</p>
