      <p>S. P. I received your letters when I was in Solothurn, and you sent them, which is to me a most dear gift, and I give the greatest thanks. I have nothing new, except what you see as certain from England, which would seem favorable to the queen, but there is no hope that they will ever admit the Spanish prince. I write to the lords because of some scoundrels... who under the name of the Roman king want to lead away your soldiers or rather introduce them to stir up seditions; these are the arts of the Caesars and Lord Ferrand and the Duke of Savoy, who would gladly disturb our friendship and your public peace. They are wholly in this; for by this way they think they can harm the king especially and you, which God avert. I expect something daily from Vergerio, and it is strange that he writes nothing, when letters come from all over Germany about the federation of princes, which they also assert the Roman king follows; but... among brothers... it is certainly expected. The Spanish prince is gathering forces to visit his father. With us, all is prosperous, as in Italy. May God favor yours. If you ask what I am doing here, so that even your lords may not be ignorant, I am dealing with a certain deputy of the marquis for the redemption of Lord Duke Daumalle, who is the brother of Lord de Guise (whom this marquis intercepted through treachery last year, when he was defecting from us near Metz to the Caesar, and from that time treated him like a Turk). Farewell well. Given at Baden, March 5th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassafontaneus.</p>
      <p>To the best man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
