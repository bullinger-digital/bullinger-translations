      <p>Greetings. Everything is full of treacheries and bloodthirsty arts, dearest brother in Christ. The Bishop of Rennes, sent by the King of France or rather by the Cardinal, went last month to the Emperor, where if there is anything more papistic in the world, I strongly doubt it. At the past diet in Baden held in July, he had much discussion with the papistic envoys of the Swiss; then he went down to Vienna, Austria. However, he wrote to me from his journey and said that he was going to the Emperor for the sake of convening a free council, asking me to explain what I hope and feel about the council, which I did, showing that I expect nothing but turmoil and wars from it, and I explained why I expect this from histories. He also sent a learned man, familiar to me, with mandates to the German princes. He explains to them the tumults in France, and that some confess they are causing turmoil with the consent of the German princes, which the king does not believe, and he asks that the princes themselves do not believe those causing turmoil. He adds that he is thinking about holding a free council and seeks the consent or opinion of the princes.</p>
      <p>Recently, the one who was with the Landgrave, the Palatine, and the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg reported to me that the princes excuse themselves and protest that they are not aware of the tumults; however, they know that severe persecutions have been stirred against the faithful, from which perhaps these disturbances arise; they pray that peace may be granted to the church of Christ. They recognize that a council is indeed necessary, but an apostolic one, not a papistic one; they will not avoid the former, as they will have nothing to do with the latter. Meanwhile, from Vienna, a rumor spreads that serious consultations about the council are taking place and that envoys sent from Rome have arrived there.</p>
      <p>Papal and imperial envoys are also sent to the Bishop of Constance, who are trying to impose a coadjutor on the Bishop of Constance. But the bishop refuses, the chapter refuses; however, they are said to be summoned to Rome for this rebellion. They would gladly impose as coadjutor a certain nobleman from Emps, a military man, the pope's nephew from his sister, almost a sworn enemy of the Swiss. They think for many reasons that he should be imposed, especially if the council can be held in Constance, finally to use his services against the Swiss adhering to the gospel. What do you want? Wonderful plans are being made, which if they succeed, will reach you. Your prudence understands the rest, and I have entrusted many things to a certain brother, who will report to you; he will come to you these days, he is a Savoyard, a good and pious man, etc. Let us pray to the Lord, therefore, that he may scatter all the counsels of Ahithophel, for among the Rhaetians too, the seed of sedition and tumult has been sown, while some stand against the bishop, others for the bishop, about which you may have heard from others.</p>
      <p>I see and understand that everything is aimed here to oppress the truth with various arts. But the Lord lives; for he disposes, man proposes, and often falls into the pit he has made, whoever plots destruction for others. Greet Mr. Beza and Viret and write what is happening in France, and how your affairs are. The fellow ministers and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 30, 1560.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Budaeus, Jonville, Badius, and the other acquaintances, etc. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
