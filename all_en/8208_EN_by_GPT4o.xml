      <p>Greetings. I have received both your letter, my brother, and that of Mr. Saliceus, but I have seen none from my Aernius. However, I hope that his letter was delivered to him with the same fidelity with which he ensured mine was delivered to me; in the meantime, I have neither seen nor met the boy. What pains me greatly is that recently, when you were here, we were not granted enough time to converse more familiarly. In the meantime, what was lacking there, we will make up for with mutual letters. There is no need for you to make much of the insults from private and drunken men against you; such is their way, but their thunderbolts are harmless.</p>
      <p>We in Zürich endure many of this kind from some of the Five Cantons. All this will last until it is enough; but God does not forget any time. Let us pray to Him to deliver us from absurd men. It is said that the Swiss soldiers, who have served in France until now, are returning from France, all without the king's good grace. He wanted to send them to Aquitaine to the Basques; but they refused and requested dismissal. The king pleaded that they stay at least another month, as the Queen of Navarre is at the king's court with both princes, and peace is being seriously negotiated; if they leave, a less favorable peace will be forced upon them. But they refused to stay and are said to be present for the Easter festival, those who remain, that is. Many are dying among them. Sixteen cohorts of royal cavalry, tattered and beggarly, are passing through Strasbourg; they are indignant with the king, who owes them nine months' wages.</p>
      <p>How much do you think he owes the Swiss, or what do you think those who have just entered military service will receive?</p>
      <p>They will receive diseases and curses from the Lord. The Emperor has called an imperial diet in Speyer in the month of May on the 27th day.</p>
      <p>The practices are remarkable, about which the brevity of time now does not allow me to write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with the councilors, Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and Mr. Ruinella.</p>
      <p>Zürich, March 17, 1570.</p>
      <p>Very quickly. I have not reread.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, fellow priest and my most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
