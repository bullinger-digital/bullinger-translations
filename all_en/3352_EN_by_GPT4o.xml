      <p>S. D. The esteemed magistrate of Bern did not approve the request of our lords. Therefore, as the Bernese requested from us, our people have chosen the envoy Mr. Johann Escher, the chief scribe, who will go to Bern in these days to await the envoys from Basel and Schaffhausen, so that they may proceed to the king to plead for the prisoners. I hear that the Bernese have chosen Claude de Madis and Mr. Johann Mirabilis. May the Lord bless their mission. In this regard, the brothers seem to be encouraged to pray diligently to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I greatly fear the Guise family: not so much the cardinal as the one who recently returned from Italy to France. But the hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. Philipp wrote me a very friendly letter from Worms. Among other things, he said verbatim: "We are enduring double struggles here, for some are asking for decrees to be written against those who reject bread worship. Many envoys have opposed. May God be with His church. I could not write more" etc.</p>
      <p>He said this. Other trustworthy sources have reported that the Saxons are diligently pressing for our condemnation, and that Melanchthon should clear himself of the suspicion of Zwinglianism and renounce Calvin. Marbach, the minister of the church in Strasbourg, is said to be urging our condemnation more than others: yet he occasionally has on his lips: If Calvin and the Zurichers felt as the confession left by Farel and Beza in the hands of the princes states, concord could be hoped for. You see, my Calvin, what they have achieved with their confession and how it is received by the adversaries. I wish now that they do not again cause inconvenience to our churches, as they are said to have gone down to Worms and Beza has hinted at something obscure in a letter written to us from Schaffhausen: or if they wish to act, let them act in their own name, not ours.</p>
      <p>For we do not recognize that confession left in the hands of the princes. This we have said openly in the presence of those present.</p>
      <p>You will learn what is happening in Poland from the bearer of this letter, Stanislaus. I commend to your piety this noble boy, Albert Dluski.</p>
      <p>I pray you ensure that he is educated in a holy manner and taught excellently. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 6th October, 1557. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
