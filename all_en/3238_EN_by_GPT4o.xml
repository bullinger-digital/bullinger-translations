      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>Revered and kind sir, after I have once again sent a certain pot to our trusted friend and brother Magister Francisco to your honor, I could not refrain from writing to you. I have just returned home from Tübingen 6 days ago, having been there for 5 weeks at the printing house.</p>
      <p>But what I am doing, you will learn from the enclosed 3 pages. Let no papist, who sits under the king, see the same; for I have not yet printed it completely. The widow, the printer, has dealt with me so much that I must stand still with my work for 10 or 12 weeks. She must print a German rhetoric and prepare it for the next Frankfurt fair, which she could not do if she had to print for me, and she suffered a loss of 200 guilders because of my printing. On the first of October, I will return to Tübingen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vergerius will certainly, if he is not already, travel back to Poland. Doctor Jacob Andreae, pastor in Göppingen, who recently let a booklet about the sacrament go out, which he says will not displease you in Zurich, tells me among other things, he is of good hope that you in Zurich will now reconcile with the Lutherans in Frankfurt. But Mr. Vergerius later showed me the opposite of his booklet, which I did not like to hear, and Mr. Brentius says to me that you and not the Lutherans have started this war about the sacrament anew, which I did not think before. I thought Westphalus had brought the matter up again first. May God grant peace and unity in the church. You have heard before about Garibaldi's opinion on the divine essence; I cannot understand his opinion, I want to remain and die with the 3 symbols. The Windisch have once again done some harm to the Turks in people, money, and goods. The one from Rothenberg has arrived in Vienna with 2500 horses. The Turkish emperor is said to be ill, has not yet armed himself, but is soon ready, as often before. How things are otherwise with religion in Vienna and in Hungary, you will learn from the enclosed writings. I hereby faithfully and obediently commend myself to your honor and the other brethren.</p>
      <p>Dated Kempten on the 10th of July in the year 1557. Your honor's obedient Primus Truber.</p>
      <p>Regarding the 2 orations "De fine seculi," I express great thanks to your honor, until an opportunity arises that I can compare them.</p>
      <p>I have recently given 2 sermons from them.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, etc., his most esteemed lord and teacher. In Zurich.</p>
