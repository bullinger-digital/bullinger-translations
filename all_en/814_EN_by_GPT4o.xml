      <p>Caelius S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus. Greetings. When our Vergerius was coming to you, I did not want him to leave without my letters to you, dearest brother Bullinger; for a long time neither I to you nor you to me have sent letters. Besides the fact that I have been very busy, having nothing particular to write, I did not want to interrupt you, a man involved in many and great affairs; perhaps for the same reasons, you have not written to me.</p>
      <p>However, as far as I am concerned, whenever there were letters to our Lelio, I diligently, lovingly, and dutifully ordered him to greet you, and there is no day on which I do not see you in my mind and commend you and your most honorable family, your most excellent wife, your sweetest children, and all yours to God and Christ our Lord in my prayers, mindful of your kindness, piety, and charity towards us, considering furthermore the excellence, vigilance, care, usefulness, and necessity of your ministry in the church of God. Therefore, I rightly pray to the Lord for you and yours, as all the pious everywhere ought to do. But concerning our Vergerius, once a pretended bishop, now truly a bishop of the church of Christ and a sincere servant of Christ and a man to be revered in every way, what shall I say?</p>
      <p>Should I commend him to you? Not indeed, since you (such is your piety) will of your own accord receive him with every kind of humanity, and he himself, on account of his excellent virtues and remarkable piety, is already both commended and known to all. Nevertheless, if anything can be added by my commendation, I commend him to you, my most humane and loving Bullinger, indeed to all of you. Farewell and pray to God for us. Greet the whole family in my name and that of my wife and all the brothers to be respected in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, 11th day before the calends of February 1550.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, brother to be respected in the Lord.</p>
