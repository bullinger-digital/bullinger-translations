      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I am surprised that you write to me less frequently, my dear compater, but perhaps you lack a subject or do not wish to burden and distract me, who is otherwise occupied, with your letters; but know that you cause me no trouble with them. Various rumors about the dissensions of the Rhaetians are being spread. Unfortunate things are said about the king's army in Naples, but perhaps they are very fortunate; for thus the king will learn to recognize sound advice and to beware of the betrayer of kings and emperors. Behold, you have a subject to write about. May you be well together with your wife, children, and good men.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 21st of June, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, preacher of the gospel in Chur of the Rhaetians, his compater and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
