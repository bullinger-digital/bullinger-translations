    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's premonition was confirmed: [Sebastian] Münster's book ["Cosmographia"] does not deliver what it promises; Stumpf should clearly point out Münster's errors, albeit without naming names, and hurry [with his work] to preempt the new edition of [Ptolemy's "Geographia universalis" by Münster]. Furthermore, he should send everything prepared in a timely manner so that Bullinger can read it according to the [Zürich] council's decision. [Münster] has described [Upper and Lower] Valais well, depicted the Burgundian War quite well; the representation of Augst is also commendable.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Johannes Stumpf, greetings.</p>
      <p>What I foresaw would happen has indeed come to pass. Münster's book does not deliver what it promises, and it is written without clear order. It compiles many things without judgment, presents many things incompletely, and some things incorrectly. You should clearly express those errors he made, but without mentioning his name. Hurry, I ask, to preempt his forthcoming edition, which I mentioned in my recent letters to you. Just as black and white are different, so are this and your work. I have examined the whole of this work. Hurry, but carefully, so as not to do anything rashly.</p>
      <p>Send what you have prepared in time, so that I can read everything myself, as determined by our council.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue in your work, aided by divine counsel and assistance. May the Lord be with you and your most chaste and excellent wife.</p>
      <p>Zürich, October 3, 1544. He depicted both Upper and Lower Valais. He also treated the Burgundian War quite well. The depiction of Augst is also commendable.</p>
