      <p> Greetings. The day before yesterday, I received your letter, venerable compater, through those noble Frenchmen and I thank you for your concern for me. I have joyful news to tell you about Musculus, which I know will bring you as much joy as it does me; for yesterday I presented and recommended to the senate his book of commentaries on the Psalms, having previously informed almost every senator about it privately. They received it with congratulations and gave him 100 pounds as an honorary gift, and in addition, they increased his salary by 40 pounds and a barrel of wine from the Rhine; for it seemed to them that this type of wine was most suitable for the good old man; for no one else has ever been given wine of this kind. The barrel contains 4 local urns; an urn consists of 100 measures, as we call them, so that such a barrel is commonly bought for 10, 12, or even sometimes 20 crowns. In short: the matter turned out as desired, and he himself is very satisfied. I wanted to inform you of this through this messenger, who is about to leave, so I cannot say more, except that I could not find those things of Blaurer's, which you wrote were not sent to you by me, among all my belongings, so I think I must have sent them, however they may have been lost; I will search further. I have nothing certain from France in the meantime; when I have, I will write. Farewell to you and all yours. </p>
      <p> Bern, April 11, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> Musculus has 120 guilders in pennies, 40 mutt of spelt, 10 mutt of oats, 10 soum of country wine, 4 soum of Rhine wine: this makes 220 guilders this year. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compater. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
