      <p>Greetings. It is not necessary for me to write anything to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, about the manner of this most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Budaeus's journey to you. For you will hear and learn everything from him directly. The church in Geneva is indeed very disturbed, and I do not see by what means it can be helped.</p>
      <p>For the ministers' vehemence and the licentious insolence of certain citizens will never tolerate each other. The state of the controversy, which is now present, depends on this one thing: that the ministers strive to retain the power of excommunication for themselves, which the magistrates presume to seize for themselves. And some reconciliation could easily be found, if it were not to be feared that, by giving one inconvenience, many more would follow. Although we do not have the discipline of excommunication from the Lord's Supper in our churches, we cannot advise those churches that do have it to change anything. For we see how many dangers those changes of external matters in the church bring with them, especially since the impious are not content if one yoke is cast off, unless they completely overturn everything. We will advise the senate now, if they require it from us, to encourage the Genevans to remain steadfast and not to separate themselves from them because of those external disagreements.</p>
      <p>Although the handling of excommunication is so odious among our people that I do not think they will listen to us on this matter. Please let me know what you think in your next letters. Farewell. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, because I wrote very quickly. Bern, last day of November, 1553. Your J. Haller.</p>
      <p>He will also explain here the whole history of Servetus and what was done with Farel in Geneva.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, and his honorable lord and godfather.</p>
