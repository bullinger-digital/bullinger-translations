      <p>First of all, I give you immortal thanks, dearest godfather, for your efforts on behalf of my Apocalypse. If circumstances and time allow, you will find that you have not undertaken these efforts for an ungrateful man. Furthermore, I beseech your piety to kindly express great thanks to the gentlemen assigned to the printing house for their efforts on my behalf. You promised them my service in any honest and possible matter. That the authorities did not want this work to be printed in their city, I take in good part. May the Lord grant you stable peace and tranquility, and may they never act imprudently, causing their republic to be disturbed! And since they believed my book to be such that it could have disturbed them, I consider it well done that they have freed me from that blame. I truly did not think anything like that would happen. Otherwise, I would not have requested (although I requested with the condition, as my letters to the most illustrious gentlemen assigned testify) nor would I have inscribed this work of mine to them, by which I thought I would greatly gratify them. But since they see it differently, I do not wish to impose a benefit on them against their will and will change the inscription when I have published the work, so that in wishing to bestow a benefit and heap honors upon them, I do not seem to afflict them with disgrace. I have never inscribed any of my works to this republic of yours; now I foolishly thought of dedicating not the least of my works, nor of the least labor and fruit (may arrogance be absent from the statement), but not wrongly, with a completely favorable and kind spirit. Since it is not dear to them, I will leave it unburdened and omit their name in this work, seeking elsewhere to whom I may dedicate it, who neither feels ashamed nor worried about the work, etc. And so I commend the whole matter to the Lord, whose will I earnestly pray may be done in all things. February 7, 1557.</p>
