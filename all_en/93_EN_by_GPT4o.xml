    <p xml:id="regest1">The plight of the people of Konstanz is, as Bullinger correctly assessed in his [unavailable] letter, very great. May God show them a way out and assist them in this life and the next. Hopefully, their [misfortune] will soon come to an end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The [delegation summoned to Augsburg by Emperor Charles V] will receive precise instructions and will not be allowed to accept any [for Konstanz] disadvantageous conditions [of the Emperor] without consulting the Konstanz council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Blarer thanks for the report on [the last Baden Diet]. He is still waiting for news from Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">He is interested in the [announced] German translation of the letter [from Girolamo Franco, the nuncio] of Pope Paul III, as soon as it is available to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger's letter to Joachim Vadian [along with the report on the Baden Diet] should be forwarded to St. Gallen before nightfall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[The news] regarding Parma is peculiar for several reasons. The Emperor would likely be displeased if King Henry II of France gained influence in Italy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The verdict against Joachim Mötteli of Rappenstein turned out to be surprisingly [mild]. This injustice will likely have repercussions, especially since many people [N.N.] are suspected of [bribery]. But Blarer prefers not to write about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">A reliable man [N.N.] has received a letter from Nuremberg stating that some Hanseatic cities [Bremen and Magdeburg] are making war preparations [against Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Tsar Ivan IV [“the Terrible”] is recruiting preachers, schoolteachers, and craftsmen with good employment conditions [in southern Germany]. Even the former Lindau schoolmaster Gaspar Brusch has signed up for four years. He receives 300 thalers annually as well as maintenance costs for himself and his servants, which he can continue to receive if he wishes to stay there after this period. There are many such well-paid positions there!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz, who would be completely at the mercy of great danger without God's help. God is still the Lord of the world. He will save His own, provided they turn to Him with all their hearts. May He lead the people of Konstanz out of this fear-filled world!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Greetings to Bullinger's wife Anna, [née Adlischwyler], and his relatives.</p>

      <p>May the Lord God preserve us here and there. Amen. It is as you write: There is fear and distress. We stand between the altar and the rock. May God, the supreme Lord of all, bring forth justice and not let us fail in His will, so that we may remain His in the next world, regardless of what happens here. It must soon come to an end!</p>

      <p>The envoys will have their instructions and appropriate orders. They will not agree to anything burdensome without consulting.</p>

      <p>I thank you greatly for the shared news. I am now waiting for news from Augsburg again.</p>

      <p>I would like to be informed about the Pope's recruitment, as soon as the translated Latin comes to your hands.</p>

      <p>I hope your letter will be answered to Vadian tonight.</p>

      <p>It is strange to hear about Parma for many reasons. If the king were to set foot in Italy, it would not please the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The way the Mötteli case turned out is astonishing. Evil worries, it will take a bad turn. Such injustice cannot stand for long. Many people are suspected of wrongdoing, etc. But not to write about it, etc.</p>

      <p>A letter has come from Nuremberg to a prominent man, stating that some Hanseatic cities are excellently preparing.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Tsar of Moscow has called for people, taking preachers, schoolmasters, and also some craftsmen with very good conditions and sending them there. Brusch, who was a schoolmaster in Lindau, has also agreed for four years. He is given maintenance along with his household and, in addition, two hundred thalers every year. After that, if he wishes, he will be brought back free of charge, etc. The conditions are many and good.</p>

    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Oh, praying and pleading with all the pious for our city! For without God's assistance, we are truly completely exposed and stand in more than great danger. Yet the Lord is still God and will not abandon His own, if we turn to Him with all our hearts, that He may recognize us as His own. There is nothing but fear and distress in all this world. May the Lord of the world help us soon with grace out of the world.</p>
