      <p>Our friendly greetings along with the offering of all honor, love, and goodness beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, pious, distinguished, honorable, wise, especially kind, dear sirs and good friends, the almighty, eternal God has called our beloved brother and preacher, Mr. Hans Rhellikan, on the fourteenth day of January just past (to be taken as a warning for our misdeeds and sins) from this time, to rest and eternal salvation (of which we do not doubt), but for us and our church, it may be a considerable loss and disadvantage. Therefore, it is our, and also the entire church's, earnest and humble request through the mercy of God, also the special love and loyalty that you have always shown to us and our church, that you may provide us with another pious and capable preacher, as well as a capable schoolmaster, to the best of your ability, and let the preacher come to us as soon as possible. How he should be disposed and behave does not need to be described, as you know this better than we do, given the many opinions that are currently prevalent and what may still occur in the future. Therefore, we are earnest in handling this matter, as we trust you; for nothing more pleasing can be shown to us by your love, for which we would gladly and kindly repay with the help of the almighty, whom we ask to preserve your dignity happily, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on Thursday, the 19th of January, in the year 1542. The mayor and council of Biel.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, distinguished, and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger along with other preachers and learned men of the city of Zurich, our dear and good friends.</p>
