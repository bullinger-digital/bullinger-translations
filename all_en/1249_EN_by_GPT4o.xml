      <p>Greetings. It was wise of you not to believe those frivolous rumors about the abolition of Sunday observance among us. For the absurdity of such tales undermines all credibility. However, by relying on our modesty and firmly rejecting the slander directed at us, you have performed the duty of a friend and brother to us. For I would certainly be more than insane if I were to disturb the good with such a foolish and frivolous novelty, arm the wicked, and expose myself to the ridicule of all. And why do I speak of myself? I think there is no one here among the crowd so troublesome who would ever have dreamed of this.</p>
      <p>However, I have learned through long experience to disregard such rumors, or at least to bear them with a more even temper. It has almost been my fate to be burdened daily with these vile slanders.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one matter provided the material for the tale, that the feast day dedicated to Christ's birth was transferred to the next Sunday. Whether rightly or wrongly, it is not for me to pronounce, and you are free to disapprove of it according to your judgment. For since it was done neither by my authority nor with my knowledge, it should not be attributed to me. You will be surprised that our people changed the order received in the church so suddenly without consulting the pastors.</p>
      <p>But this also happened more from oversight than from obstinacy. Before I first entered this city, all feast days except Sunday had been abolished. Farel and Viret thought this was useful: I willingly acquiesced to the received custom. The new province of Bern also initially followed the same reasoning. Conzenus arose and fought for feast days no less tumultuously than Victor of Rome once did for his Easter. However, after we were expelled, four feast days were instituted along with some other rites. Upon my return, although I could have overturned everything that had been done in my absence with the applause of a large part, I remained quietly: except that I could not dissimulate that the celebration of Christ's circumcision was preposterously observed while the day of his death was passed over. This was foolishly and wrongly fabricated by unlearned men. Now, as the people celebrated the day of Christ's conception under Mary's name, I vehemently attacked this superstition every year. For the French in their language call the feast "Our Lady's Day" in March, and therefore it is commonly believed to be sacred. Yet I restrained myself so as to curb those who clamored that these days should be entirely abolished. For those who had initially given their name to the gospel were so displeased with the innovation later introduced that they sometimes did not spare me, thinking I seemed too lukewarm. Indeed, it even came to swords once, when excessive fervor of contentions prevailed on both sides. A middle course pleased us, that in the morning, with shops closed, the holidays would be observed, and after lunch, they would return to ordinary work. This was established nine years ago. Yet even in this way, the disputes were not settled. For the variety in closed or open shops revealed a disgraceful dissension. When neither end nor remedy could be found, last year I went to the council, asked the senate to devise some measure according to their wisdom by which the people might be retained in better harmony. I did not speak specifically of abolition. On the contrary, I praised them for accommodating themselves to the Bernese custom in their zeal for fostering peace. When I heard by plebiscite that those days had been abolished, the matter was so unexpected that I was almost astonished.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if I had been asked for my opinion, I say nothing else but that I would scarcely have dared to decide so.</p>
      <p>You see in the whole context of the story that nothing new was introduced, but the custom of the church, which had been overturned by bad example through tumult, was restored: and yet this happened beyond my expectation. Nor was this the only church that retained no holidays except the seventh day.</p>
      <p>For the same was once instituted in Strasbourg. I, upon arriving, ought not to disturb a well-composed order. Now that it has been reinstated, it does not seem to me to be such a cause of offense. If there were any fault, they act unjustly who subject me to the charge of another's deed.</p>
      <p>The messenger from England has not yet returned. But in the meantime, having been informed of Bucer's death, I received great sorrow. Unfortunately, we will soon feel how great a loss the church of God has suffered. While he lived, I sufficiently considered how he excelled in distinguished gifts: how useful he would still be to us, I now recognize better from the very bereavement itself. Therefore, I am more urged to pray to the Lord that he may preserve you all for a long time and use your work. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be honored by me. Greet all the fellow ministers diligently. My colleagues send you all their warmest greetings. April 23, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
