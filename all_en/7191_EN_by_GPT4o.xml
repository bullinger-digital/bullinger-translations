      <p>I received your pious letters written on the first of August only yesterday, and I hope you have meanwhile also received mine, which, having no other messenger, I sent through the chief scribe of Bruges to the steward of Küngßfelden (through whom I also send these), and I hope you are now fully satisfied. I would write more frequently, but I lack messengers.</p>
      <p>But neither do I have much material to write about; the same thing happens to us as to you. We cannot learn anything certain about how things will turn out; there are many rumors and warnings, but without foundation. The Confederates are not far from Chalon, guarding the borders and waiting to see what the Spanish camp will do. Some predict good things, others bad. Recently, Dr. Michael Roset, the syndic of Geneva, was with us; but even in Geneva, they do not know how things will turn out, nor do they have any significant news from France. It is still in the balance, except that France greatly fears foreign nations, and perhaps from this, they will become more united in spirit.</p>
      <p>May the Lord make it so! This is what is happening with us: 1. My lords have negotiated with Geneva and the Duke so that they also agree to a settlement, so that a lasting peace may be achieved; both parties are willing. May God grant that it may be brought to a good end! Six arbitrators are to be chosen from Zurich, Basel, Schaffhausen, Lucerne, Uri, and Schwyz; I think they will be summoned shortly. 2. The Duke of Savoy's envoy was here these days, the Lord of Montfort, with 40 horses; he requests to renew the old alliance and agreement with my lords. This is postponed until the resolution of the Geneva affair; for it would not be appropriate while Geneva is not reconciled with him. He has ridden from here to Fribourg; he now demands from them the part of the land they hold; I think they will also have to restore something: 3. They are preparing to make restitution in 14 days. 4. Today, the French alliance is being discussed again, which some people are pushing so hard that it is almost...; but I hope to God they will be cautious about it, and may God preserve the city of Bern in its freedom. I still do not know how it will go, but I hope well; if I learn anything before the steward departs, I will add it. All officials from German and French lands are listed. Otherwise, I know nothing. I recently wrote that Steiger has taken a wife; he greets you again along with the Zehenders and my father-in-law. We are very saddened by the death of Dr. Finck; but why do they seek ministers from Basel, when they know how infected that church is with Sulcerolutheranism? Let them beware, let them beware in time. My mother, wife, and all of mine greet you and yours. Tell Gwalther that I took care of his letters, which he sent to Biel. May the Lord keep you all.</p>
      <p>Bern, 12th August 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>The matter with France, as I hear, has improved again by God's grace; yet it is not entirely resolved.</p>
      <p>Be assured, we must endure more storms. But it has once again turned for the better. May God keep us in this. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my ever-honored lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
