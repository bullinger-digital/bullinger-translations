    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter [No. 1465] and are pleased with the progress of the Reformation, which robs the opponents of all courage. Rudolf Schinz, who fled from Zurich, asserts his innocence and has asked them to contact Bullinger to facilitate his return; although they can well imagine that Schinz, with his obstinacy, has angered his superiors, they still want to issue him a good testimonial for the years he spent in Chur; possibly he behaves better abroad than at home; Bullinger should decide on the further course of action at his discretion. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. We have received your kind letter in recent days, esteemed brother, which has filled us with immense joy. For there is no greater consolation we can receive than when the knowledge of Christ is spread as widely as possible across the world. The same things you write about, our papists knew before us, but they suppressed it; they are greatly distressed and grumble. But thanks be to God, who will soon drive these most arrogant enemies of piety to despair, so that, having abandoned their superstition and false piety, they may worship Christ with us, or, having scorned the known truth, they may willingly fall into destruction. Rudolf Schinz, driven by adverse fortune, has come to us, confessing that he escaped from a certain prison in Zürich, solemnly affirming that he does not know at all why he was placed there, and beseeching us to write to you on his behalf, so that with your help he may safely return to the city and settle his affairs. We do not doubt that he has offended his superiors with his obstinacy. However, we can freely give him this testimony: during the time he lived with us in Chur, for he lived here for several years, he conducted himself honorably, irreproachably, and earned his living through very hard work. Perhaps, when he is at home, he abuses his freedom, and abroad he restrains himself within his own limits. Do what seems best to you in your wisdom, and may some benefit and relief come to him from our petition. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the 20th day of February.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Blasius Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, his lord and especially esteemed friend.</p>
