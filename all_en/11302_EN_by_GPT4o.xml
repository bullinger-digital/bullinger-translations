      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Having conveniently found a messenger, most esteemed Myconius, I wanted to greet you with this and wish you happiness. Otherwise, at present, I have nothing to write. A few days ago, I wrote what I had through Johann Buttler. We are all well; I wish that you are also well with all of yours.</p>
      <p>The reason why this messenger was sent here, I do not fully know; you will undoubtedly learn it from yours. I suspect he was sent because of the Frankfurt assembly. Farewell and always love me.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 24th April 1539.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Grynaeus, Gast, Buttler, Ryffenstein, my Gwalther, and the other friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger. I beg you, if you have any certain news from the Frankfurt assembly, share it.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lord and brother, Oswald Myconius.</p>
