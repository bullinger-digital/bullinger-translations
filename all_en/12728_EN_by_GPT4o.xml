    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Hochholzer would like to take the opportunity to greet Bullinger as usual with a letter and inform him about his personal situation; however, there is little to report, especially since Bullinger is already up to date. Recently, Hochholzer had already complained [with HBBW XVI, No. 2349] about his excessively low salary, as it forces him into debt. Bullinger had then recommended [in a letter not received] to turn to Gabriel [Meyer] in this matter. However, Hochholzer believes that Gabriel would be reluctant to advocate for him because he wants to please everyone and not cause any displeasure, which he would likely do with a request [addressed to the council]. Hochholzer therefore decided to first inform [Johannes] Zehnder about the situation, if only so that he would not think he was taking steps without his knowledge. Both concluded that they would present the matter to the council at the next opportunity, hoping for its generosity. However, Hochholzer fears that this will hardly achieve anything. He has no choice but to trust in God, who will surely provide for him and his family. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Furthermore, Hochholzer would like to know how [in Zurich] they would judge the case of a [at the time of the act] still unmarried member of the magistrate [...] who dishonored and impregnated his virginal ward [...]. The man seduced the girl with words and promises. But before the disgrace and pregnancy became known, he married another [...]. How would such a man be punished in Zurich? Only with the penalty provided for this offense, or also in his social status and office? Such a case has occurred in Aarau. Some, who are similar to the accused in this regard, want him to be punished only with the penalty provided for such a sexual offense. Others demand additional social and official sanctions. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Hochholzer has not heard anything about the course of the war for a long time. Bullinger should inform him about it when he has the opportunity. He also knows nothing specific about Emperor [Charles V] and the princes [Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick of Saxony]. He has also heard that the people of Zurich have mustered a strong army, which, together with the people of Schaffhausen, is supposed to invade the Hegau. However, this seems unbelievable to Hochholzer. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Greetings, especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther. </p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Since I had no occasion to write to you, esteemed lord and father, I seized the opportunity, as I often do, to greet you with my letters and to inform you of my situation. However, there is no need to discuss my affairs at length, as you already know how they stand. Your kindness is aware that I recently complained about my very small and insufficient salary, which forces me into debt. You advised me to inform Mr. Gabriel about the matter. That seemed to be the right thing to do according to your advice. However, when I consider the man's character, I see that he is such that he would reluctantly handle my case. He does not want to offend anyone and wants to please everyone; however, he easily offends more people when he requests something either in his own name or in someone else's. Therefore, I discussed the matter with Mr. Zehnder, my lord and brother, so that he would not think I was acting in this matter without his knowledge. Thus, it was agreed by both of us to present the matter to the council at the first convenient opportunity. We will see if they will show any sign of generosity and gratitude; but I fear they will add little or nothing. Whatever the outcome, I will trust in the Lord. He will provide for me and my family.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, there is something I would like to know from you. For your kindness, I ask that you do not take it badly. If someone among you (I pose the case) from the magistrate's order, not yet joined in marriage, were to dishonor a virgin and impregnate her, entrusted to his care, what, I ask, would you judge such a crime to be? Meanwhile, where that wicked fornicator deceived the girl with words and promises, before it was known that she was either dishonored or pregnant, he married another woman. What punishment is imposed on such a person among you? How simple or also in honor and office? I judged it necessary to consult you on this matter. The same thing happened among us. We do not want to let it go unpunished, nor do we judge it as simple fornication. Others, as they are patrons of their own vices, advocate for that man. They downplay the matter. They do not want to punish more severely, nor do they dare to let it go unpunished; thus, the matter is deferred. I ask you to reveal your judgment to me and what would be decided among you in such a case.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding other matters, the tumult of wars, I have not heard anything from you for a long time. If you have anything (as I do not doubt) and if you have time, I ask you to write something. We have no certain news about the emperor nor anything about the princes. I also hear that your people have already chosen a certain army, which, together with the people of Schaffhausen, is supposed to devastate the Hegau. But I judged it to be false. About these matters, unless it would be burdensome for you, I would very much like to be informed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>All of ours greet you. I wish your entire household well. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther in my name. Farewell in the Lord and continue to hold me in your esteem as before. Aarau, November 17, 1546. Entirely yours in kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most prudent and faithful minister of Christ in the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
