      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received your letter along with the enclosed copy of the book you sent us, and we have understood and accepted it with great pleasure. We also wish to acknowledge this with gracious consideration and recognition. If it is not inconvenient for you, we would very much like to have several copies, both in Latin and German. We did not want to withhold our gracious opinion from you in our writing and are inclined towards you with favor. Dated in Schaffhausen on the 27th of March in the year 1552.</p>
