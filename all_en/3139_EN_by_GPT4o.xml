      <p>My greetings along with my humble abilities always foremost.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dearly beloved Heinrich, knowing of your well-being is always a special joy to me. I am also, praise the Lord, still in tolerable well-being and health, together with the octogenarian Lystus, known to you. That you remembered him in your writing was very pleasing to him.</p>
      <p>As for the matter at hand, I have cut it off and sent it to him; he has joyfully placed it on his table. I have thoroughly familiarized myself with your booklet concerning the summary of the Christian religion, read it through and through, and carried it around for a long time as a handbook. May the Lord extend your life for many more years to complete such and similar writings for the edification of the Christian religion. I have little news; for with us, a terrible unheard-of drought persists, in the true grain land, a bushel of grain costs five thalers. The Count Palatine by the Rhine, perhaps you know better, continues, having recently had all the churches along with the choir singers in great numbers brought to Heidelberg. Also, Plattenburg, a small town in Westphalia, has begun the gospel, as has Dortmund, a free imperial city. May God grant that it may be to His honor and praise. I could not refrain from writing to you about these things and wish you and yours much happiness and salvation, commending you to the Lord at this time.</p>
      <p>Given in haste in the year 57, on Tuesday, the penultimate of March. Dietrich Bitter.</p>
      <p>To the widely renowned, highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my most gracious lord and friend, to hand.</p>
