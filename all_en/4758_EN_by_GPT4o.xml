      <p>Greetings. Knowing, honorable sir and godfather, that today, on the date of this letter, a letter has come to Mr. Georg.</p>
      <p>Carl. from the bailiff of the Bishop of Constance in Meersburg, to his cousin Mätzler, the content of which is this: he cannot appear at Feldkirch at the appointed time, as they had agreed, because he cannot have permission from his lord, the bishop, due to the fact that the current time is restless and the Empser affair is stirring again. Also, two regiments of soldiers are to be accepted, one of which will be mustered in Füssen, the other in Weingarten. Carolus, after sharing the letters with the consul, brought them to me; however, these soldiers seem to be gathered against the people of Glarus in the name and service of the Five Places, since the muster place is on the emperor's ground, etc. Therefore, we thought it necessary to inform you of this, so that you may be more vigilant and your people may inquire accurately into this matter. Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Chur, 15th of April, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the church of Zurich, to his honorable, kind lord to respond. Zurich.</p>
