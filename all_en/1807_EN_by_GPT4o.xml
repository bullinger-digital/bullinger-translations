      <p>Greetings. We have received your most recent letter written to us along with Camillus's writings. You reprimand me and order that when writing to you, I should omit those rather grandiose titles, which you do not accept. If you do not recognize those things which I transcribe to you as being attributed to you and accomplished through you for the world, you are ungrateful to God, who you do not acknowledge for his benefits towards you; but if you prefer that the praises of your virtues be in hearts rather than on tongues, you act most wisely and as befits you. Whatever the case, I will do as you order, at least with you; for I will cease to proclaim the benefits of God, which He bestows upon us through you and other men there, only when I become blind and ungrateful, no matter what you yourself command. Regarding the state of our churches in the Confederation, which you are eager to know, accept this briefly; for it would not be pleasant in more detail. The local churches are not in the happiest state; for not a few have no preachers at all, although they seek them, but those who know the Rhaetian language, whom they will not be able to find; for there are none and they are not being trained. Some retain the most dissolute men as preachers, and even in faith they are not sound, against the will and protests of all of us. The Tavascians have accepted a preacher for themselves, who has hitherto celebrated mass (let it be allowed to speak barbarously of the barbarian), but he has promised not to celebrate mass any longer. We found in examination that he holds the mystery of faith poorly; nevertheless, we received him into our college and confirmed him for them; both because he promised to devote himself more diligently to the scriptures, and because those same Tavascians extolled him and his sermons with wonderful praises, so that here too it is true what Pliny said about the orators of his time: know that he speaks most poorly, who is praised most highly. As for life, know that those communities which have received the gospel conduct themselves more honorably than those who still celebrate mass. For even if they eat and drink, they do not dance nor do many other things that are done among those who celebrate mass. The communities still entangled in papal superstitions do not all have priests, even if they wanted them; however, many priests come to them from Italy (I will use your word), as to the Athesians. For almost the entire region is filled with Italian priests, although they do nothing but celebrate mass; for they cannot preach in German.</p>
      <p>We, who preach, are now colder than we were at the beginning. Some work with their hands all day and on Sunday, when it is time to preach, they glance at some booklet briefly and superficially, yet they are compelled to work, since their salary is sixty or fifty or forty Rhenish guilders; among us, there are those who are steeped in avarice; they in all that they speak or preach, they babble like those who are asleep and perpetually revolve certain trite and common things: "The painter to a human head a horse's neck", you know the Horatian poem.</p>
      <p>It is sometimes discussed among the leaders of our Confederation about expelling all foreign preachers out of hatred for the Italian brothers, who seem to act more importunately and scarcely join us, men always desirous of rarer and more novel things of I know not what kind. Perhaps I will write more about these soon; for I am now called again to Clavenna by Vergerius, where it does not seem advisable for me to go for many reasons. - I will also add this: we have not yet found that the Bishop of Chur is plotting anything against the gospel, and he speaks to us here humanely and treats us, especially Comander, kindly, if he ever comes down to our town to dine with the citizens; yet he does not agree with us at all. - In the Athesian land, it is certainly reported to us that the castellan of Müschian is recruiting soldiers to be led to Italy for Duke Maurice. Four days ago, a servant of the Trawulschen passed through here; he, coming directly from Milan, reported for certain and seen by himself: during these Bacchanalian festivals, Spaniards in Milan, masked, ran through the city and committed certain things displeasing to the citizens everywhere; some citizens, also masked, met them; it came to blows; six citizens were killed by the Spaniards, among whom were two of the first citizens; the Milanese are greatly indignant with the Spaniards and are asking the emperor to remove the Spaniards from there. Now, so as not to trouble you, farewell, most humane man, in the Lord Jesus. Comander and others, whom you know, greet you. Write back, so that I may know that this letter has been delivered to you. From Chur, on the 18th of February, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good men. In Zürich.</p>
