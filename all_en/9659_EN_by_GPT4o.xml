      <p>Greetings. I received your letters through Fietzii, my relative, the servant, and through the same person, I now send these few things; when he returns, I will send more through him. Regarding the French affairs, I do not doubt that you have the same information there as we do here. However, there are different rumors. The people of Strasbourg write how the king has captured his younger brother and the King of Navarre along with Montmorency, and how Condé barely escaped to them and sought refuge with the Elector Palatine; also, how some of Condé's followers were killed at Pfalzburg, while others escaped; Condé himself escaped by taking the route through Saarbrücken. A certain man from Freiburg, knowledgeable about these matters, recently affirmed here that the King of Navarre has been killed. The king's envoy, as I hear, is spreading a completely different story: that peace has been established and the king has forbidden the recruitment of soldiers.</p>
      <p>It is confirmed, as someone told me today, that Tugginer (a Swiss mercenary) has returned to France without additional troops (for which reason he had returned). But, whatever they say about peace, all our people affirm that the disturbances in France have never been greater.</p>
      <p>These are the main things we have now. A successor for Aretio has not yet been appointed.</p>
      <p>I also give you great thanks for your work. May the Lord choose someone who will be an ornament to the church and school! We have not yet received anything about the defeat of Christoph of the Palatinate. I am going through Schmidelin's "On the Abundance of Words" and would send it back to you, if I had not also given it to others to inspect; however, I will send it back soon through my relative. I have to preach, so I cannot write more now; therefore, farewell well.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the morning of May 5, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual respect by me.</p>
