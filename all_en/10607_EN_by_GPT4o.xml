    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports that the meeting desired by the Bernese had to be canceled because tensions have arisen between Zurich and the Five Places; [Uli] Brüder, who is supposed to be responsible for this, is still being interrogated. News about the army mustered in the Etschtal and the conciliatory attitude of the Emperor, rumors about an upcoming meeting of the Landgrave of Hesse with the Elector of Saxony and with King Ferdinand I. Bucer is said to have become more reserved towards the French King. Bullinger asks for a more detailed explanation of the concerns that Myconius has expressed regarding [Karlstadt].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. The Bernese requested, venerable Myconius, that we come to Zofingen to discuss the matter of the Eucharist, in which they do not disagree with us, but there are things they wish to discuss in person. We set the date for March 30th, and Leo had already almost set out on the journey when a certain messenger announced that Zug had taken up arms and was waiting for the people from the mountains, expecting the Zurichers to attack them. See what Satan attempts! The Zurichers had no such intention. Therefore, we sent letters to Zofingen, explaining what prevented Leo from coming. Berchtold received these with equanimity and returned to Bern in good peace. This about the meeting. A certain trickster, whom the people call Vogt Brüder from Albis, is now held in chains, and he is believed to be the author of this tragedy. Certainly, he stirred up great trouble. What the senate has done with him, you will learn from me later if there is anything noteworthy to add.</p>
      <p>The army from the Etschtal is advancing towards Genoa. The Venetians have allowed these legions to pass through their territory in favor of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has sensed the deceit of the French and desires to win over the Germans. Therefore, he has promised much to the princes and cities, declaring that he never even thought of exterminating the Lutherans by bringing a Spanish army into Germany.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Landgrave of Hesse has gone to Glogau, a city in Silesia, with a fine cavalry, where the Elector of Saxony will also come, and Ferdinand will not be absent.</p>
      <p>Bucer, if certain reports are true, has declared in some letters that he will not attend the French colloquy nor will he write or do anything further in favor of the French King. If only he had decided on this course of action before those written plans!</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>However, I wish to know from you the reasons why you fear he might bring some harm to the church, if by chance I were to send him letters of my own accord, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 5, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the people of Basel, a lord and brother to be greatly respected.</p>
