      <p>I received your letters from my courier. Now, as the messenger who brought me the barrel returns to Tuttlingen, I write a few things hastily.</p>
      <p>Your letters were most delightful to me. Tomorrow I am setting out for Stuttgart to the Duke, to whom I will also communicate them along with Brenz for many reasons, especially to instill your judgment about Martyr. We think the diet will not take place this year; for the Emperor wrote to some of the princes of Cologne and Trier excusing himself and providing certain reasons why they could not come to the diet. But the Emperor does not postpone the diet because of the excuses of those archbishops, but because he covets the kingdom of England; indeed, there is a rumor that Queen Mary has gone there to arrange her marriage to Philip.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, instead of the diet, His Imperial Majesty gives hope of a council, and we hear he has written to Count Montfort, who was recently his envoy in Trent, to prepare himself again for that legation. Moreover, the Imperialists spread the news of a future peace with the King of France and that he will agree to reinstate the council. All these things pertain to the fact that, in the meantime, while he seems to conquer Britain, he flatters his supporters in Germany and terrifies his enemies. The Duke of Brunswick recently set fire to a small town of Albert; spirits are inflamed.</p>
      <p>I beg you, since I cannot write more at this hour, to describe these few things about the new developments and send them in my name to those two, to whom you arranged letters through Josias (as you wrote to me), and again I beg you, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>If you wish to write to me or send letters written elsewhere, send them to Jacob Rüger, the pastor in Schaffhausen; for he will send them to the prefect in Tuttlingen, and he will take care of them for me for the Duke's favor. But only common matters should be sent this way; if I want something rarer, I will use my own messenger.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I wrote to Martyr inviting him, if he wishes, to winter with me; I wish he would come!</p>
      <p>Tell the Cremonese to send those booklets, which the courier refused to carry, to Schaffhausen. As for other matters concerning the Black Forest, I beg you, ensure that someone brings them as soon as possible. If you write to Galitius, tell him I am surprised that he has not sent me the synod's letters. If anyone should happen to be going to Geneva, entrust to him those matters concerning Martinengo.</p>
      <p>Molineus is not ready to write at the moment, but in the meantime, he greets you along with Frecht, who complains that you have burdened him too much with titles.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greetings to your whole family, church, and school. May God preserve you for the church. Send not only the book on justification, which I will immediately translate, but also what you wrote about the Catalog, along with the Catalog itself. Today I begin to forge something here against the mandates of the antichrist's messenger. Tübingen, December 11.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Pole from Tölz, where he once stayed, has crossed into Flanders. This is also an argument against the future diet.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
