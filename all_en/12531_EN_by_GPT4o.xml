    <p xml:id="regest1">According to a letter [not received] that Bullinger received today from a friend in Chur [...], the Three Leagues have decided to deny [Italians and Spaniards] passage through the Valtellina, as they are marching against Germany. The Governor of Milan [Ferrante I. Gonzaga] must accommodate four Italian and Spanish regiments. Bullinger wrote to Blarer yesterday [unreceived attachment to No. 2483] about the situation of the Grisons and their letter to the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [Schmalkaldic League] should not allow [Emperor Charles V] to unite his troops. If they were to defeat a nearby troop unit, they would instill fear in the others. The Confederates have always benefited from immediately repelling enemies. The devastation of waiting is shown by the defeat in the [Second] Kappel War.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Today, the imperial envoy [Jean Mouchet de Poligny] pretended before the Zurich Council that the Emperor's armaments were aimed at some disobedient princes. This deceit greatly displeased the Council. The Zurich Council will probably report on this to Constance themselves. The Emperor incites against righteous people with his Spanish cunning. May God grant his protection!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Today, I received a letter from Chur from a trusted, good friend with this message: The Three Leagues are united here. They have unanimously decided not to allow the French to pass through the Valtellina (as they requested), because it would be against Germany. The Governor in Milan has been ordered to accommodate four regiments of Italians and Spaniards. However, I wrote to you yesterday through the messenger from Augsburg, detailing the situation in the Grisons and what they have written to the Confederates.</p>

      <p>Dear friend, do not let them gather their troops. Defeat the nearest ones, and you will instill fear in the others. God will grant grace. The Confederates have never benefited more than when they did not allow the enemy to stay on their land overnight. The delay ruined us in the Kappel War, especially because we did not want to recognize as enemies those who indeed were; we believed their good words until it was too late and we were struck down. Then there was good fighting.</p>

      <p>Today, the Emperor's envoy, a Burgundian, appeared before the Zurich Council. He spoke many good things (it is deceitful behavior). He excused the Emperor regarding the armament, etc. The envoy openly stated that the Emperor [wants] to punish some disobedient princes. The entire council was displeased with this. I believe my lords will report this to you themselves. It is deceitful behavior that he also uses against other honorable people. May God protect us from Spanish cunning. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given at 2 o'clock in Zurich, July 2, 1546. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, most faithful minister of the Church of Constance, his lord and always to be honored brother. Constance.</p>
