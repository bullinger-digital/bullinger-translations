      <p>Greetings. My father, by the grace of God, we have returned safe and sound, where we found everything quite prosperous and safe. Our brothers in Piedmont have felt nothing yet except threats, but those are utterly atrocious. May the Lord restrain Satan's rage, as we also hope will happen. Mr. Calvin greatly approved of the Confession; but why he thinks another path should now be taken, you have already learned, I believe, from his own letters, which he received from me two days ago, to be delivered to you by Vergerius at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>The time is very short, although I do not doubt that the cause of the Landgrave will take at least two weeks, so that if any of our people come to Frankfurt around the first of July, it will not seem to be a wasted effort. I urge you, I beseech you, and press in every way. For we have received this response from our people, that they will not delay if others think it should be done. Even if nothing else is achieved, we will certainly have taken away from those furious ones the open occasion for slander, that we, when invited to concord, hesitated. But I also hope that the princes themselves will be much more favorable to us, and therefore much more moderate, if the Lord grants that they understand in person the reasons that are clear to us. Then, how unfair it would be, I beseech you, to spurn the voluntary request of the best prince, and believe me, more inclined to this cause of concord than I can testify? Therefore, my father, I implore you, with the greatest diligence and zeal possible, to hasten this whole business, both with your people and with the rest of ours, so that we do not let the offered opportunity slip from our hands.</p>
      <p>But enough of this. I am sending you our table of predestination, about which you would do me a great favor if you would freely write your judgment to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, may the Lord Jesus bless your holy labors more and more. I wish to greet Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gualther, and the other excellent and most esteemed brothers as courteously as possible in my name.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, the day before Pentecost.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
