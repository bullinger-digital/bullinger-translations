      <p>I am compelled, most illustrious Bullinger, to hasten my departure both because of the expenses, which now seem to exceed my means, and also because of domestic matters, which will utterly perish in my absence for so long. I have therefore decided to set out for Chur, so that I may extricate myself from there. If in the meantime Mr. Vadian returns, I will either present myself here, if I can, or I will deal with it by letter, if anything can be done. Meanwhile, I beg you, take care that, as soon as it is possible, you send those cases, which I requested from you, to Clavenna to Doctor Augustin in such a manner that they are returned to me, and if you have anything else worthy of our relationship. Furthermore, it has been added that they have assured me that Vadian cannot return before fifteen days. I can by no means endure this delay. Therefore, if he comes there, as I hope, you could, if it seems right to you, settle this matter with him and involve your consul, who may assure him of the letters already granted to me and at the same time urge that procurations be obtained for me from this senate even in my absence, so that I do not have to return here, at least let there be no lack of recommendations. Now I will know how much your love for me and your piety towards this cause can accomplish. I beg you, inform me of all these things and ask the Lord to assist my affairs thus afflicted and his church so gravely suffering. May you always lead a happy life in Him.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Pellican, Bibliander, Walther, Gessner, and the others in my name.</p>
      <p>You will be able to inform Mr. Vadian about this whole matter; for due to the extreme shortage of time, I was not able to. I will leave here in writing what seems necessary for this business, so that they may be returned to him. Farewell in the Lord and love me. If I come to you again, as I hope, I will need to be equipped with a stronger stomach and a fuller purse.</p>
      <p>Given at St. Gallen on June 28, 1549. Tomorrow I will set out for Chur, then to Italy.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>[...] to the most distinguished and learned [lord] Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Zürich church, to be respected lord. Zürich.</p>
