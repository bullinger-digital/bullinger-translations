      <p>Greetings. These students from Prussia, Poland, Russia, and Lithuania are coming to Tübingen to see me; they have asked me for letters to you, brother, so that through them they may approach you; for they wish to converse.</p>
      <p>From the conversation they had with me, I understood that the elder Lithuanian, who is the tutor of the younger ones, is an exceptional follower of Brenz; for he willingly disputes about the place and movement in the heaven of the blessed, and about the substantial presence and eating of the body of Christ in the supper.</p>
      <p>Someone coming from Tübingen affirmed to me that Brenz is preparing a new and very bitter writing against me.</p>
      <p>I suspect that Lithuanian is hunting for something, perhaps to discover some dissimilarity between our opinions about heaven and the right hand of God; for you know what Brenz's doctrine is about the ubiquity of the body of Christ, heaven, and the right hand of God.</p>
      <p>But there is no need for me to warn you here, otherwise wise enough by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restore you to us, dear brother; we hear with great sorrow that you are ill.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we pray to the Lord for your health continually. I am brief, lest I add trouble to your illness.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently and continue to love us all.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you from the heart.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 31, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother, in Geneva or to be given to Mr. Theodor Beza.</p>
