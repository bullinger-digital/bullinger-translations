      <p>S. D. I know indeed, brother, that with you and with some others, Laelius Socinus of Siena, who was for a long time a diligent listener in our school, is suffering from a serious suspicion, as if he, favoring Arius or Servetus or the Anabaptists, does not acknowledge the adorable Trinity of God nor sincerely confess that Christ the Lord is coequal with the Father according to divinity, and according to humanity, consubstantial with us. For this reason, you urged me to watch over the flock of the Lord entrusted to me, lest it be infected by some pestilential poison through him. But I, having been very familiar with Laelius for a long time, and yet having not understood even a little of this from his conversations, was amazed when reading your letter. However, so that I might not seem to disregard a brother's admonition, for which I confess I owe you thanks, and again, so that I might not begin to oppress Laelius with a serious suspicion without hearing him, I call the man. He, endowed with humanity, willingly and promptly comes. I recite to him, omitting your name and that of some others, what some brothers signify to me about him, urging him to freely and clearly profess his faith to me on these matters.</p>
      <p>What more? Laelius complains most indignantly that he is being treated most unworthily and oppressed by the hatreds of some, whom he would prefer to openly and freely state why they think thus of him, rather than suspecting him in this way and also instilling those wicked suspicions in others. "I," he says, "do not know if I have ever said anything for which I should be considered a Servetian or an Anabaptist, unless perhaps it is because, while in Geneva, I said that I did not like that Servetus was suddenly put to death. However, I did not say this because I do not wish heretics and blasphemous men to be restrained at all, or because I favor Servetus's doctrine, which I do not wish to be extinguished; but rather, since I disapprove of his wicked doctrine, I would have preferred him to be freed from it than to be burned in it.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, concerning the Trinity and unity of the eternal God, concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ Jesus, our Lord, finally concerning the mystery of our redemption and the salvation of souls and their immortality, as well as the glorious resurrection of our bodies and eternal life, I believe, feel, and profess in every way as the canonical scripture teaches and as is comprehensively contained in the Apostles' Creed."</p>
      <p>I indeed added: "Do you then agree with the Nicene and Constantinopolitan Creed, and do you abhor all the heresies of Praxeas or Sabellius, Arius or Servetus, Macedonius, Nestorius, Eutyches, and the Anabaptists?" He replied; "I agree with the doctrine that has always been in the orthodox Catholic Church and is today simply and concordantly taught in the Church of Zürich. For this reason, I commune with you in the mystical supper of the Lord Christ; for this reason, I dwell with you, I seek no diversions nor do I instruct anyone in any errors, but I live quietly. And I wish to be clearly shown what more I ought to do, if indeed these things do not satisfy." I indeed responded: "If you believe with all your heart, Laelius, there is nothing more I require from you; I pray the Lord to confirm you in this faith. However, I ask one thing from you, brother, that after I have recorded these things, which have now been done between us, on paper (for I will record them), you do not hesitate to add your hand, not because I do not think well of you or do not fully trust you, but because I wish to have this testimony for others, before whom I can then more boldly testify to everything and seek peace and reconciliation."</p>
      <p>Laelius indeed agreed and added his hand to this statement of his to me.</p>
      <p>Since it is especially necessary for you to know these things, I wanted to explain them briefly, so that you may think better of Laelius and, if necessary, commend him to others with a better reputation. He indeed has a curious mind and is entangled in many questions.</p>
      <p>When he has sometimes proposed these for the sake of learning and experimenting, he seemed to those not yet accustomed to his mind to foster pestiferous opinions, and even to want to sow and propagate them. However, he is endowed with such modesty that when he understands from me and others, whom he sincerely loves, that from such questions or disputes such suspicions arise against him in the minds of many, and also offenses, he sees that he must abstain from them. He also promised that he would do this.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I urge you, my esteemed lord and dearest brother, to not only consider our Laelius purged from wicked suspicion with you, but also to fraternally excuse him to others who suspect his faith. For we are brothers who owe mutual love to each other; the apostle Paul counts suspicions among the works of the flesh. Our Lord and Savior uniquely commended peace and love to us. Farewell eternally and always pray to the Lord for us. Zürich, in the month of July, in the year of our Lord 1555.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
