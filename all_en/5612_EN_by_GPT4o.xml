      <p>Greetings. Those who wish you well, brother, out of imprudence, as I indeed judge, intended to help by not helping.</p>
      <p>Their effort is not to be disapproved; but they still deserve praise, who also do not wish you ill and saw that you had been thrust into extreme poverty and therefore dissuaded you.</p>
      <p>Those who serve the church in Wangens are almost deprived of all resources.</p>
      <p>When indeed would you have been freed from this misery? Everyone knows that you are greatly loved and held in high esteem among those with whom you now serve as a minister of Christ.</p>
      <p>They would have strongly disapproved of your desertion later, especially since you have scarcely completed two years.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is much more prudent that you still faithfully serve the church to which the Lord has called you.</p>
      <p>Good men will not forget you if you continue as you have done so far; indeed, the Lord himself, the consul of Cham, a most distinguished man, also dissuaded this change, but promises well if you always remain the same.</p>
      <p>And I too, if I could and were given to live longer, will always remember you.</p>
      <p>But also the Lord, who above all is to be regarded, will never fail the faithful.</p>
      <p>In this, I wish you well.</p>
      <p>Greet Remigius von Schauenstein, whom although I have never seen, I hear is a strong and good man.</p>
      <p>Especially greet the excellent old man, the beloved Paul, etc. February 14, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the faithful minister of the church in Davos, Tobias Egli, my esteemed colleague and dearest brother.</p>
