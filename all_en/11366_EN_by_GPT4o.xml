      <p>Nikolaus Pfister to Heinrich Bullinger, a learned and most courteous man, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>The bailiff of our monasteries, the bearer of this letter, is coming there on business with Mr. Christoph Froschauer. Whatever it is, you will learn from him. He is truly a good and sincere man, who, as the saying goes, supports and defends our, or rather the Lord's, institution with both feet and hands. He trusts that with my letter he will be somewhat more persuasive and gracious in your eyes. I earnestly ask you not to let this hope deceive such an excellent man; please make him understand that which he is already fully convinced of, that he and I are most dear to you. Farewell, most learned man. From Chur, October 28, from the school of the monastery.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man most outstanding in eloquence and learning.</p>
