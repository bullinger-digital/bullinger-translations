      <p> Greetings. Regarding the alliance, nothing has been concluded yet, as the votes and opinions of all the foreign communities have not yet been heard; most seem, and rightly so, to be opposed to it. May the Lord ensure that the better part still prevails, although I have long since despaired about this matter. Furthermore, regarding what Abraham Musculus writes to you, I ask that you take it to heart and assist us with your advice. Sulcerus is causing us a lot of trouble, as he tries to suppress and corrupt the last and clearest teachings of Musculus of blessed memory, and to patch up his own errors without the knowledge and will of Abraham and all of us, which we only receive from him in good faith; therefore, we are seeking the copy again and will have it printed elsewhere before it is corrupted, although Hervagius's widow has already spent some money on it. </p>
      <p> It is his old art to pretend to be a friend of the truth and to suppress it through deceit. May God repay him. </p>
      <p> Otherwise, I have nothing, except that I suffer from a bad ulcer, which some interpret as health for me. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> All your friends and brothers greet you. </p>
      <p> May all yours be well. </p>
      <p> Bern, January 28, 1565. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and compatriot, to be honored in every way. </p>
