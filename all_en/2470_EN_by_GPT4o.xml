      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Greetings. We have nothing new except that our Africa always brings us something new.</p>
      <p>Here were the delegates of the Lausanne class, Jacob Valerius and Theodore Beza, who worked very hard to obtain and establish church discipline. But in vain, as often before. They attempted various things, some of which have the appearance of good and hold out the hope of excellent results. Others, in my judgment, seem to not obscurely taste of tyranny. And although I hope for the best from those good men, I greatly fear that posterity will abuse good institutions. As I said, they achieved nothing. They now threaten, since they achieve nothing with delegations, to free their consciences in such a way that they will finally be heard when summoned to speak for the cause, who cannot be heard now. You can easily guess how much trouble this causes us.</p>
      <p>Shortly after their departure, behold, Francis Sampaulinus, the minister from Vevay, is here. He offers a booklet to the senate written about predestination, in which he declares his opinion and at the same time teaches with what moderation ministers should use in explaining places concerning this matter. He wishes the book to be published: for he was moved to write it because he hears his name is being spread everywhere in France as heretical because of this opinion. Therefore, he needed this purgation to maintain the dignity of his ministry. He treats everything simply (which he does) without accusing anyone, wanting to heal the consciences of the good, etc. Before he offered the booklet to the senate, I told him my opinion, that is, what seemed to me. But since he did not want to acquiesce, he offered the booklet. The book was transmitted to us by the senate. Today at this hour we are going to the senate to explain what seems to us and to remind the senate of its duty. If this book is published, it will soon have those who will criticize something by responding. Thus, the fire of contentions will grow. We advise the senate not to allow anything to be published, written, or disputed by its people on this matter at this time. We neither approve nor disapprove of the booklet, lest we imprudently involve ourselves in this contention. At the same time, we will also take up the Geneva cause today, that is, because Calvin is being slandered by some of our people as a heretic. We will endeavor that the senate will so interpose its authority that they may not be committed. If the senate writes to the classes, we hope they will rest.</p>
      <p>There will also be mention of Hieronymus the physician, who alone seems to be the author of almost all the disturbances, and not only breathes one heresy. For he thinks that we do not rightly understand any dogma of Christian doctrine. He turns many minds away from the study of piety with hatred of Calvin. Nor would we trouble the senate with these things if the Genevans had not first referred the matter to them, and if the greatest necessity did not urge us. If the messenger remains here for a while until I know what has been decreed, I will add it then.</p>
      <p>Mr. Blaurer did not use Calvin's writing against Westphal cautiously enough. For he allowed it to come into the hands of Christophorus Piperinus, who brought a copy here, and it was read here by our colleague Mauricius without my knowledge. He, however, confessed it to me later. I fear, therefore, that if something is changed now, they will suspect something. Although they may suspect whatever they want, it is fitting that what is contrary to our disputation should be changed. Otherwise, those who think that Calvin does not rightly keep that Consensus with our church will be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Our people are occupied with the Gruyère cause. The county has acknowledged the debts. My lords did not want to enter into any purchase with the count. The count protested against the sentence and has left; no one knows where. Now the debts are being offered for sale. The countess and those from Freiburg are here. Be aware, if it goes on for long, both cities will buy, but each will have its own part separately. There will also be a council and citizens about this today.</p>
      <p>Sampaulinus tells me that Beza has published a certain circular figure, by which he demonstrates that all things, even evil, depend on God himself as the first cause of all. I have not seen it; if I get hold of it, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>If you have anything new either from England or elsewhere, share it with us; we have nothing, except that a diet has been called in Augsburg for St. Martin's Day, and the arrival of the Emperor and King Ferdinand is expected. We are waiting to see what will happen at this diet in Baden, especially in the Locarno cause. Delegates have been sent by our people, Consul Nägelin and Tribune from Wingarten, as I hear. Hagius tells me of very lamentable letters sent by the people of Locarno, which I have not yet read; but today I will have a copy of them. I am forced to close the letter still unaware of what has been decreed today, except that Francis Sampaulinus has been forbidden to publish anything. What will be decided about Zebedee and the others, I still do not know. More on this next time. Meanwhile, farewell and live happily with all yours. Our people greet you. Bern, November 17, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
