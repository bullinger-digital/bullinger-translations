    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian thanks Bullinger for informing the two Zurich mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, as well as [Itelhans] Thumysen, about the accusation against the abbot [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee]. Perhaps [the abbot's officials] will still respond to the honest answer from the St. Gallen council, abandon their plans, and calm down. If not, Vadian will notify Bullinger immediately and clearly explain why St. Gallen's claims are justified, but the complaints of the opposing party are unfounded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Hieronymus] Sailer wrote very upset regarding [Hans] Muntprat and claims that he has already spent more money on this matter than is known! Therefore, he does not want to pay anything further. However, if Muntprat's son [...] wishes to do so, he would tolerate it. And if they were to send the two to him, whether to St. Gallen or to Augsburg, he would cover their accommodation and living expenses for the rest of their lives. Sailer also wrote to Hans Vogler the Elder about this, who will contact Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Sailer added a news supplement to his letter, which Vadian includes with the present writing. From this, it becomes clear that not all hope is lost regarding Landgrave Philip of Hesse. He has indeed sent a delegation to the meeting in Denmark. Allegedly, Emperor Charles V imposed harsh peace terms on him, so that Philip prefers war to such a disgraceful peace.</p>

      <p>My willing service beforehand. Especially dear lord and friend, I greatly thank you for the faithful information you have given to my gracious lords, both mayors and Lord Thumysen, regarding the accusation against the abbot. Perhaps they will still respond to the honest answer that my lords have given them, abandon their plans, and remain calm. However, if this does not happen, I will inform you of the matter in detail at any time without delay, so that one may clearly perceive and see the justification of our city's claims and the unfounded complaints of the opposing party.</p>

      <p>Sailer writes to me very agitatedly regarding Muntprat, claiming that he has already spent more on his behalf than anyone knows. He does not want to pay anything further. If the son does something, he will let it happen. However, if they were to send both of them to him, whether to St. Gallen or to Augsburg, he would provide them with accommodation, clothing, food, and drink for the rest of their lives. Vogler, to whom he also wrote, will give you a good report.</p>

      <p>The same Hieronymus, in the aforementioned letter, sent this enclosed document containing new developments, which I am sending to you. From it, you will understand that one should not yet despair regarding Hesse, as his delegation is said to be joined with the others that have now convened in the Kingdom of Denmark. I hear that harsh conditions have been proposed to him by the Emperor, which he rejected, indicating that he would rather endure war ten times over than accept such a disgraceful and infamous peace.</p>
