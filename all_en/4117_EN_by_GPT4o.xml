      <p>Greetings. The people of Glarus are not fighting, nor have any of them fallen.</p>
      <p>The situation is as follows: internal discord is harming them; all the trouble comes from within. They have long agreed with the Five Cantons on certain written articles of peace.</p>
      <p>In these, they promised to have a mass officiant in Schwanden, but only in such a way that no one who does not voluntarily attend the mass is forced to do so. However, since there is no one in that entire assembly who wants the mass to be celebrated for them, they have not hired any mass officiant. Hence, the Cantons began to complain, and some of them, being unruly, threatened something or other.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is said that the senate of Glarus decided on a mass officiant as had been agreed long ago, soon after our unfortunate war at Kappel. In the meantime, no one attends the mass, and they openly declare that they will not attend in any way.</p>
      <p>This is the summary of this entire matter.</p>
      <p>In recent days, a minister from Poland, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, came to us to report on what is happening in Poland. Mr. Lasko is indeed bedridden with a severe illness; however, true religion is progressing excellently. Moreover, it is spreading rapidly through Hungary, even in the areas under Turkish control, and is being received by countless people. Lesser Poland is currently afflicted by the plague.</p>
      <p>The Livonians have submitted to the King of Poland, who is now in Vilnius. The Palatine of Vilnius continues to advance, stronger than ever despite his age.</p>
      <p>The papal legate in Krakow has died from the plague.</p>
      <p>Mr. Franciscus Lysmanninus, known to you, writes that Franciscus Stancarus is disturbing the Polish churches with strange doctrines, but he has been excluded from the synod of the pious and rejected. We have no definite news from England at the moment, but we are expecting various reports.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that the son of the King of Sweden is seeking to marry the queen. The same rumor spreads that the Guise family (who are now the rulers of France) have prepared an army of 20,000 infantry and a proper cavalry, intending to subdue the Scots. The city of Trier is said to be in turmoil due to the preaching of the gospel.</p>
      <p>A pious and learned man, Doctor Caspar Olevianus from Trier, was here with us. He was called back there around Easter to his homeland, where he began to preach Christ. He is a noble man and very knowledgeable.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to see if he lives or has been killed.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that the matter has been settled without bloodshed and that the citizens have obtained the gospel.</p>
      <p>If I receive anything else or more certain information, I will share it. It is certain that he is preaching there with great constancy, etc.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord that everything turns out well.</p>
      <p>What news do you have about the conclave, the pope, and the papal officials from the city of Rome or from Italy?</p>
      <p>May our friends be safe; mine send their greetings to you. Farewell. November 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>May the legate be safe, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, his dearest lord and brother. Chur.</p>
