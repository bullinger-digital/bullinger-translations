    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller will also enclose the letter [No. 2970] written two days ago with his present writing, as the [Swiss] messenger [...] has still not been dispatched.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] To ensure peace and order, the Augsburg council has so far had secret, small night watches of ten men each patrolling the streets. However, recently a newly arrived imperial captain [...] and his soldiers encountered such a patrol. A heated argument ensued, and soon swords were drawn. The captain was injured by two sword thrusts, but not life-threateningly. However, his unit gained the upper hand and captured four guards, who are now in mortal danger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The incident caused so much noise at night that Spaniards and also [Nicolò] Madruzzo rushed over. The latter went with some arquebusiers to the house of Mayor Jakob Herbrot. They tried to break down the gate and forced the servant [...] to let them in. Herbrot, who had meanwhile dressed, was confronted about the city watch. Four times he was almost pierced by the sword of an imperial soldier. He tried in vain to calm the intruders; however, they took him away. The city bailiff [Ludwig Spinner], who had been alerted by the servant and rushed over with his soldiers, was finally able to secure Herbrot's release. Otherwise, he might have been lost.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Landsknechts tore away the offal offered for sale by some maids, threw it in the dirt, and trampled on it. When the women complained to the guild master [Paul] Wittelspeck, who had arrived, he was rudely insulted by the Landsknechts, so he had to keep his mouth shut.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Other Landsknechts snatched a basket filled with fruit from a woman and tormented her further. However, Mayor Herbrot, who arrived with his guard, did not dare to say a word! Such and much more happens here. The authorities are not allowed to make a peep, not even to the lowest soldier. God have mercy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Haller and his fellow pastors are treated with as little regard as slaves. The request to grant them a bodyguard in the church was rejected with the suggestion that they could ask their neighbors for protection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] What the Augsburgers wrote to the Zurich councilors about the protection of the pastors are therefore just empty words. They would rather have them murdered! And indeed, they would be in danger of life and limb if God did not protect them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Haller entrusts himself to God. He does not want to deny his faith in Him, nor does he want to betray anyone who has put themselves in danger not because of faith, but through negligence. For Christ has called not only for the confession of faith but also for caution. The cursed usury and vanity are probably to blame for the loss of the kingdom of heaven! All pastors agree on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Haller will wait another eight days for the response letter from the Zurich council. If it has not arrived by then, he will leave on his own responsibility, as he now really has enough reason to do so before God and all reasonable people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The public situation troubles him more than his private one, about which he does not want to report. People defecate on his doorstep and on the bench in front of the house. Gallows are painted on his front door. And all this would be indifferent to him if only the community were doing well and behaving courageously. Greetings, also from Wolfgang Musculus.</p>

      <p>S. I wrote this enclosed letter two days ago, as I thought the messenger would be on his way. However, since he has not been able to depart until now, I cannot withhold from you what has happened in the meantime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>So far, my lords have had a secret night watch of their citizens patrolling the streets to ensure peace and quiet, but not too strong, so that no one would think they intended to cause trouble: ten and ten together. Recently, one of the nights, an imperial captain who had just arrived encountered them and cursed at them, asking what they were doing there. They said they were there on behalf of the authorities. "What authorities?" this man said; "Is there any other authority here than the imperial majesty? Damn you here and there!", and he drew his sword along with his servants. Our men defended themselves and gave the captain two thrusts, though not harmfully. But the captain's servants were too strong for our men and captured four of them. The four captives are in danger of being beheaded, although great pleas are being made on their behalf.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As a result, there was such a commotion that many Spaniards and also [Nicolò] Madruzzo came over. The latter took a group of arquebusiers and went to the house of Mayor Jakob Herbrot and began to break down the door, waking them up. A servant ran out and said they should act politely, and he would inform the master; but he had to let them in. Meanwhile, the mayor got up, put on a coat, and went to them. They said: "Who told you Augsburgers to keep a watch over us? Damn you," etc. And one of them tried to stab him four times with a rapier, but it was prevented. Herbrot spoke kindly to them as much as he could. However, they forced him to go with them, not knowing where. Meanwhile, the servant ran to the city bailiff. He came quickly with his servants and persuaded them to release the mayor, otherwise, he might have been lost.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, Landsknechts took the offal offered for sale by some maids, threw it into the dirt, and trampled on it. When guild master [Paul] Wittelspeck, a prominent man, arrived, the maids complained to him. The Landsknechts ran up to him: "Are you the master here, are you the superior? We spit in your face!", etc. He was not allowed to say a word.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Furthermore, they took a basket of fruit from a woman and scattered it, causing more trouble. Mayor Herbrot came with all his servants, but he was not allowed to say a word. And such things happen countless times! Our authorities are not allowed to say a word, not even to the lowest soldier. God have mercy!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are treated as little as slaves. We have asked them to appoint someone to the pulpit who would watch over us. But despite our repeated requests, we have not been able to achieve anything, except that they said we should ask our neighbors to accompany us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, it is all for nothing what they promised our lords, that they would protect us or send us home safely. They would rather let us be worn out, for truly, if God does not especially protect us, we would be safe neither in body nor in life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Now I entrust myself to God, whom I will not deny when it comes to confession. But I also do not want to be in betrayal, where one suffers not for the confession of Christ, but for his negligence. For the one who said: "Whoever confesses me, etc.," also said: "Beware of men." The unspeakable usury and arrogance have well deserved that the kingdom of God be taken away from them. This is the unanimous opinion of all the brothers!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I will now wait for another eight days for the letter from my lords. If nothing comes, I will leave on my own! I have enough reason now before God and all reasonable people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What happens to me privately, I do not write. The public matters concern me more. People defecate on my doorstep, on the bench in front of the house, paint gallows on my door. It would all be the same to me if only the community were doing well and had some courage. Farewell, farewell. Musculus greets you, who does not know where to turn. The last day of July 1547. J. H., entirely yours.</p>
