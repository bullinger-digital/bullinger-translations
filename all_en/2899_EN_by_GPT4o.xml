      <p>Greetings. I accompanied Prince Otto Heinrich, Elector Palatine, during his entry and visit over the past two months. I returned safely yesterday, thanks be to God. Everything went well for him, and I have no doubt that if he had as much strength as he has body, he would attempt and accomplish many excellent things, although he is not yet fully instructed in divine matters. For neither is Michael Diller, his preacher, sufficiently skilled, especially in what pertains to the sacraments, which he handles so coldly that he seems not to understand himself at all, and for this reason, he flatters in a remarkable way, and by flattering, he also becomes an obstacle to some of the best people, as our master Laurentius Agricola recently learned from me, who will undoubtedly also explain to you what kind of trouble some malicious people have stirred up for him. Satan cannot bear anything less than purity concerning the use of the sacraments.</p>
      <p>Moreover, knowing that with this idolatry removed, such a market will rarely occur again. I defend, I intercede, I ward off the blows of adversaries as much as I can, and I do not fear to incur disfavor even with the prince for the sake of truth. I also wrote to Philipp Melanchthon and sought his judgment on the agreement of the Genevans and the Swiss, but he did not respond and was as silent as a fish. He is a hypocrite, which gives me an argument of his insincerity. But it is well; let him remain a disciple of his Pythagoras.</p>
      <p>It is said that a truce between the Emperor and the French, as well as Ferdinand's agreement with the Turk, has been made, not without great disgrace to the royal name. Now the assembly previously summoned to Regensburg for July 1st has been reinstated; but our princes will not go there unless they are properly assured of everything concerning religion.</p>
      <p>The Papists have attempted war; but, as I hear, these worst efforts have fallen flat. Cardinal of Augsburg perhaps sensed something, wherefore he now abstains from his usual haunts and keeps himself here and there with the raclam.</p>
      <p>I would very much like to have copies against Westphal, etc., as well as the German and Latin Bertram on the sacraments. Laurentius will pay.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for Laetus.</p>
      <p>I wish to learn from you what your Tigurine Quadrilateral is planning and how far their madness has spread. Greet each of the brothers.</p>
      <p>From my own home, April 27, 1556.</p>
      <p>The face of the stars now compels me to play: All the elements threaten destruction to the lands Woe to you, who have not yet begun to be pious.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Laetus from Lemnicz, counselor of the Electoral Palatinate of the Rhine, etc.</p>
      <p>To his brother and friend, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
