    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's recommendations of people are always welcome to him. Martin [Hentius] from Transylvania stayed only one day, as he wanted to quickly return to his own in Wittenberg; he completely matched Bullinger's description. Michael Adam, recommended by Bullinger and [Paul] Fagius, has become very dear to him, although otherwise baptized Jews are suspect to him, as they never change their ways; Fagius, who invited Adam [to Konstanz], suffers from severe headaches, but the doctor is hopeful; Bullinger and his people should pray for Fagius. The fate of Quirinus [von Leiden] pains him; his (Blarer's) arm is largely healed, and he wants to dedicate himself to God with full strength. He sends a letter from Konrad Hubert, Bucer's deacon; allegedly, Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg and [Philipp von] Hessen have defected to Emperor [Charles V]. C[aspar] Schwenckfeld has published a writing "On the Worship of Christ," in which he also attacks the Swiss and calls Vadian's writing ["A Thorough Report and Extract from the Books of Doctor Joachim von Watt..."] "Greckelbühlin"; he received Schwenckfeld's writing from one of his defenders and forwarded it unread to Vadian; it is regrettable that the dispute with him binds so many forces. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my venerable brother Bullinger, it is so far from being a burden to me to receive your truly dutiful recommendations, that I count it among my greatest pleasures whenever I have the opportunity to be kind or helpful to those whom I already wish to win over with all my heart. For I am doubly filled with joy when I can offer some small assistance to good and learned men, especially those recommended to me by you.</p>
      <p>That Transylvanian Martin stayed here for only one day and could not be persuaded to stay longer, as he was eager to hasten to Wittenberg and return to his own people. He appeared to me exactly as you had described him.</p>
      <p>I have begun to love your Michael Adam dearly in the Lord, because both you and our Fagius bear such full testimony to his sincerity. Otherwise, baptized Jews are always very suspect to me, no matter how much they have changed, since experience has shown that this kind of people rarely change their ways, though they never change their nature. But indeed, in the manners, appearance, and conversations of this good Michael, the grace of Christ seems to shine forth somewhat, so that he greatly recommends himself to me, and indeed, if I could be of any service to him, I would not neglect any opportunity. He is staying with our excellent and learned Fagius, who will make use of his services for some time, although he is now so tormented by unbearable headaches for several days that he can neither go out nor do anything at home. However, the doctor bids us to hope well, and having now somewhat relieved his head of the most troublesome humors, he begins to feel a little better. You too, my Bullinger, with your people there, diligently commend the health of this holy man to the healing hand of Christ, so that he may be able to serve the church of God for a long time, as he certainly can.</p>
      <p>I deeply grieve for Quirinus; may the Lord have mercy on him. By the Lord's grace, my arm is now sufficiently healed, and I wish that I may be allowed to dedicate it, along with my whole body and spirit, to the Lord and His children forever!</p>
      <p>Bucer's deacon, Konrad Hubert, wrote to me, which I send here. Besides that, we hear nothing that I think should be kept from you. Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, led by some unknown counsel, has defected from the French to the Emperor, and they also affirm that the leader of the Cators now stands with the Emperor.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and indeed on His whole church as soon as possible! It is more afflicted than anyone can easily imagine, whether you consider its affairs on the right or on the left.</p>
      <p>C[aspar] Schwenckfeld has again published a booklet "On the Worship of Christ," where he is also more virulent against the Swiss, calling that booklet taken from the books of d[octor] Vadian "das Greckelbüchlin," which was sent to me by a notable patron of the author, and I have taken care to send it to our d. Vadian, not yet read. It is deeply regrettable that this man causes so much trouble for so many good men born for far better things. May the Lord, by granting solid peace to His church, deliver us from these evils in due time! To Him, we commend ourselves diligently with your prayers and those of all your people.</p>
      <p>Greet your whole household with Theodor, Gwalther, Pellican, Megander, Erasmus, and all others who love the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and love us in Him.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and commend themselves to you, especially my brother and Zwick with Paul Fagius. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. May 24, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
