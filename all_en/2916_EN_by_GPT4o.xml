      <p>Franciscus Hotomanus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>With Master Martyr, I have advocated not for your cause, but for the cause of the Church of God. However, many things must be considered carefully and prudently; for if he departs, we are greatly concerned about succession. If it were permissible to assign the name of a certain little monk, whom our enemy has brought here, we are uncertain about what he intends to do; what he wants and where he aims, no one knows. Master Martyr also considers this. I received letters from Master Calvin and Beza, of which I would gladly send you a copy if I had the leisure to transcribe them. You would see the testimony of those churches and about him, whom they call impious, cruel, shameless, a sycophant, a manifest apostate. I will obey your advice and that of the brothers, as much as I can, and with God's help, I will erase this madness with eternal oblivion. However, I am uncertain how this will be done; for every day he continues, and now, when he sees that he has not been able to harm either my reputation or my fortunes, he is, as I hear, planning against my life. I do not dare to explain the matter to you more clearly, as you see what the time is. They say the King of France is to be feared diligently; the city is fortified; therefore, it will be guarded against the French. In this tumult, a little word can do more harm than the most verbose accusations at another time. God will have mercy on my family; moving would be most pleasing to me at this time, especially since my wife is about to give birth; but if my affairs in Paris were settled, that is, if my mother had responded, I would think it best to act as [Greek] or [Greek]. If I could be of any service to your church, about which I ask you to think, keep this to yourself. However, I earnestly ask you, as much as I can, if it pleases you to write to me, you would do me a great favor; but I beg you, not to anyone else.</p>
      <p>My reverend and best father, farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, May 8, 1556.</p>
      <p>I would like you to greet Master Gessner and Master Gualter, most distinguished men, in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, outstanding minister of God and the Church of Zürich, most excellent theologian. In Zürich.</p>
