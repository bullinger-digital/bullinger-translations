      <p>Greetings. I did not respond to your recent letters, dear brother.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, other letters written by you have also been delivered. I approve of your diligence and pray that if I do not respond immediately, you attribute it to my affairs and sometimes to my afflicted health. The account of your danger, in which you were enveloped upon leaving the bath, brought me amazement, as the flood suddenly and so greatly increased. May the Lord ensure that it does not harm you, with your limbs still tender from the recent bath and therefore more susceptible to illnesses. But the good Lord can avert this evil from you, who also delivered you from the present, almost certain death. I do not doubt that Cardinal Borromeo, the nephew of the tyrant of Musso from his sister, and a cardinal, is nurturing a monster. He seeks, as I hear, episcopal jurisdiction over the four transalpine prefectures of the Swiss, namely to deform them according to the decrees of the Council of Trent. Perhaps he also incites other prelates to attempt the same in their territories, that is, to stir up trouble. For these men cannot rest, nor would they be rightly clothed in red garments unless they were inclined with all their souls to shed blood. I believe he is acting on the execution of the council. They see their hope of war in France taken away; therefore, they think of transferring the war to other nations. The magistrates would act most rightly if they expelled such haters of peace and authors of robbery from their dominions and offered them the noose upon their return, which they certainly deserve. I trust in God that He will, in due time, give those who think of nothing but war enough of war and avenge the innocent blood. Certainly, unless the magistrates are vigilant, they would be brought into war with each other by these men.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he also seeks the help of the pope, who is said to be in serious disagreement with the Duke of Ferrara and some other princes in Italy. You do well to inform me of those matters which you have understood.</p>
      <p>Peace has certainly been made in France and is tolerable from the perspective of our people. If it is maintained, it will soon come to pass that Babylon will collapse from its foundations, like Jericho. The Lord must be earnestly prayed for its increase.</p>
      <p>You will be vigilant and will not allow that Anabaptist and Schwenckfeldian to nest. If a fellow minister wishes to defend him, let him present arguments and declare himself also to be an Anabaptist and Schwenckfeldian. Then he should be refuted and brought into the light, so that everyone may beware of him as a sectarian. However, I would wish that you first deal with him secretly and privately, to see if he repents; but if he declares himself to be an Anabaptist, then you will not dissimulate, but will inform the magistrate and request a discussion in his presence, and you will urge the magistrate to beware not so much of him as of the bookseller. But, as is your modesty and prudence, you will act with deliberation. I have nothing to add at present. I wish you and all yours well.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls, Pontesella, and other friends, especially Charles. If it seems good, advise; for I will write to Ganthner and dissuade him, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th of September, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my beloved brother and fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
