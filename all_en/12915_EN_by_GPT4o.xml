    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frey thanks for Bullinger's response [not received] to the incidental question posed with letter [No. 2750] about a person from Bremgarten [...], who died by a fence post.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The news reached the people of Biel first as a rumor, then with Bullinger's letter. What will the future bring?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The letter to Hans Wunderlich [not received] was delivered to him as quickly as possible. However, that Wunderlich recognized Bullinger's handwriting (which he probably wanted to avoid) is not Frey's fault, but Samuel [Wyttenbach]'s, who happened to be in Neuchâtel at the time. When Wunderlich asked whose handwriting it was, Samuel identified it as Bullinger's, which Wunderlich initially did not want to believe.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [From Paris] the "half-Frenchman" Josua [Wyttenbach] has returned, whom his father [Niklaus] now sends with an inquiry to Zurich. Josua reports that in France they are now treating the so-called "Lutherans" more "mildly"! [King Francis I] would only sell them to the galleys or send them into exile! How gracious! And from such a person, they now seek help against Emperor Charles V, like the Jews once did from the Egyptians [against the Assyrians]! This shows that the [Protestants] do not trust God at all! Apparently, goodness and repentance, even divine truth, are no longer of value to them! May God open their eyes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Michael [Schlatter], Jakob [Würben], Peter [Fuchs], and Frey's wife [...] send greetings to Bullinger and his family.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father. I owe you (dearest father) the greatest thanks for not hesitating to respond to a trivial request, namely about a certain person from Bremgarten, whose soul (as he deserved) was taken by a fence post in a new manner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is more than enough news, which first reached us as a rumor, and later also through your letter. We are waiting, clinging between hope and fear, to see what the final outcome will be.</p>

      <p>We ensured that the letter addressed to Hans Wunderlich was delivered to him with as much haste as possible. However, the fact that your handwriting was recognized by him (which I believed you did not want) was not due to me, but to our Samuel, who happened to be in Neuchâtel at the time. When Hans asked whose handwriting it was, Samuel, upon seeing the inscription, immediately responded: "It is Bullinger's." Although Hans did not initially believe this, he eventually accepted it as Samuel insisted more strongly.</p>

      <p>Our "half-Frenchman" Josua has returned to us, whom his father, eager to inquire what he can do, sends to you. With this message, we have learned that for several days now, they have been treating those they call Lutherans more leniently. For now, they either sell them to the galleys or send them into exile. Oh, what great grace! This is the person from whom we seek help against Emperor Charles V, like the Jews once did from the Egyptians! We have indeed shown that there is no faith in us! Goodness and repentance, even divine truth, are worthless in our eyes! May the Lord grant us a healthier mind, so that we may recognize how miserable we are.</p>

      <p>Your brothers Michael, Jakob, and Vulpius send their greetings, and especially my dear wife sends her regards to you and your family. Farewell and love me as you always do. From Biel, on the 3rd day before the calends of April in the year 1547. Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered father. Zurich.</p>
