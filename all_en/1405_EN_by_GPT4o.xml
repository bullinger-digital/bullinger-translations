      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We thank you for the diligence you have shown on our behalf by delivering the letter to your lords. We have written to them further, trusting they will prove themselves as good friends. That the Emperor has expelled the preachers from the empire, some of them are here. It is good to recognize and understand what kind of good fruit he has borne for a long time. In summary, his intention is nothing other than to bring the entire empire into a monarchy. But we trust in dear God, he will bring it to naught. We share this with you in confidence. We have received the little book you sent with many thanks; as much as time allows, we will read it. However, we have had little rest to read for a day or four, and would very much like to see something written to the King of France, in which he is held as a named Christian king more godly and Christian than the Emperor. The war in Italy is advancing rapidly and the war on the water has already been declared, and as we have seen letters and also believe them, the city of Asti will not hold out much longer; for the castle nearby has already been conquered. Otherwise, there is nothing new to write at this time. We did not want to withhold this from you, our gracious and trusted opinion. Dated Basel, the 17th of September, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
