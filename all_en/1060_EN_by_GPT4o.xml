      <p>Greetings. Around the first of September, I received some of your letters, incomparable man, in which you mentioned that you had sent me three letters before and had received no response to them; therefore, you doubted whether your letters had been intercepted by treachery or whether I had departed from this world, etc. To which I briefly replied, indicating to you in passing that I would soon be with you and therefore would use the pen sparingly; however, before those letters of yours, I had seen almost none of your letters for about a year. I sent this little letter of mine to Lindau to be forwarded to you by Hieronymus Papius; I am surprised if it has not reached you. Meanwhile, two other letters of yours were separately delivered to me, which contain almost the same as the others, except that the Confederates, who were somewhat distracted a little while ago, are now in excellent agreement. You also add that even if your letters were intercepted or opened either by chance or deliberately, no one would find anything in them other than what is usually discussed among good people. You write prudently and piously, as should always be done, especially in these times; furthermore, each of us has the privilege that we do not fear the light. It is as commendable as it is beneficial for you to be united. To recount the state of my affairs would be so lengthy that I cannot now achieve it with the pen due to the lack of time. However, I have long since decided to visit you, and may it be done with God's guidance. So far, partly the multitude of business and partly the harshness of the weather have caused delays. Meanwhile, know that I am still living in Kaufbeuren with my wife and beloved children and am living at my own expense, yet I am always grateful to God, who has kept me safe amidst so many dangers. Indeed, not only the faces of our people but even the locations seem to have changed both nature and color. The Lord from on high certainly, indeed most certainly, threatens this generation with something great unless we turn to Him. Oh, the vile change that can only be corrected by the most bitter contrition. I am visiting you mainly for this reason, so that if it happens that I briefly pass away amidst these troubles, it may not happen without first greeting you. You are indeed my friend above all others.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable household, and convey my greetings to the lords, the councilors Lavater, etc., and to each good and learned person who cherishes my name. October 24, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the pious, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian community in Zürich, my trusted lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
