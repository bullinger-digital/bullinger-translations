    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Zürich are pained that their [Communion] confession [No. 482] caused offense, as it does not deviate in the slightest from the truth of Christ and the teachings of Zwingli. The presence of the body of Christ in the meal of believers is undisputed. Therefore, it can also be said that it is distributed and eaten; however, it is not the case that it is only present through the symbols. Christ gives himself to the believers in the execution of the meal, but not through the symbols, which only serve for its external representation, but internally through faith. Just as the presence of Christ in the sermon cannot be attributed to the external word, the confession also rightly distinguishes between the spiritual, heavenly bread, which is enjoyed in faith, and the sacramental, which the minister gives. When the people of Zürich rely on John 6 to affirm their view of internal nourishment, they are in harmony with all of Zwingli's writings; he only rejected Benedikt Burgauer's false interpretation of this pericope. Some parts of their confession were misquoted or misunderstood: Contrary to all accusations, it clearly distinguishes between the internal nourishment that occurs through the Spirit and the external offering of the sacrament; apparent contradictions are thus resolved. That the signs were instituted to provide assurance to the church and a view of faith corresponds to Zwingli's conviction. He opposed a disdain for the sacraments and rejected the dispute over words; since there is agreement in the matter, it is incomprehensible to the people of Zürich why the people of Bern refused to sign. That their confession was rejected, even though it aligns with Zwingli's teachings, makes the people of Zürich fear the worst, so they ask for a renewed careful examination and hope for a renewal of brotherly love. This justification should also be brought to the attention of the rural pastors.</p>

      <p>To the dearest brothers in the Lord, the ministers of the church of Bern, we wish grace and love from God the Father through Christ Jesus our Savior, we who preach Christ in Zürich.</p>
      <p>We are immensely grateful to you, dearest brothers, for your concern for us, and we are deeply saddened that there is even the slightest thing in our confession that offends you, even though, as far as we are aware, this offense did not originate from our side. It is indeed an offense taken, not given.</p>
      <p>For everything in our confession has been carefully considered and weighed, so that if anyone reads it with judgment and not with bias, they will not only find nothing offensive but will also gain some benefit. Either you have not examined our confession diligently enough, or you have been inclined to criticize it, both of which, as it seems to us, are quite unfriendly. Nevertheless, whatever the case may be, we will follow the rule of charity and interpret everything in the best possible light, while at the same time striving to remove this disgraceful mark you have placed upon us. It is possible, dearest brothers, that you do not fully understand our position, as your letters suggest. We will therefore demonstrate that we have not deviated a hair's breadth from the truth of Christ or the teachings of Zwingli, and by doing so, you will understand what now seems obscure to you.</p>
      <p>First, you agree with us that the true body of Christ is truly present in the supper of believers. However, it seems excessive to you that it is distributed and given there. For from this, it would follow that Christ first arrives with the administration of the symbols, even though he has already been presented, distributed, and received in the hearts of the elect through faith and the Spirit.</p>
      <p>You rightly believe, dear brothers, that Christ is in the hearts of the elect before the supper. We have never denied this. But since we speak of the supper of believers, we understand not only the supper in which the symbols of sacred things, bread and wine, are distributed externally, but also the one in which the soul of man is internally refreshed and nourished by the body and blood of Christ. Both occur when the faithful partake of the supper. We do not have a supper in which nothing is present besides bread and wine, as some falsely claim about us. We say, therefore, that the body of Christ is truly present and not only present but also distributed and eaten. For what would it be doing there if it were not eaten? We cannot understand why you do not agree with us on this, since you concede that the body of Christ is present in the supper. If the body of Christ is present and eaten, it must be distributed, and we do not think you have a supper without the body of Christ being given and distributed. For if Christ is not distributed and eaten in the supper, then nothing besides bread and wine is distributed and eaten. We do not see, therefore, by what argument or consequence, namely the most unjust, you conclude: Christ is present to the church before the supper, therefore he is not distributed and eaten in the supper. For what prevents the body of Christ from being present to the faithful before the supper, in the supper, and after the supper, and being eaten by them? Therefore, by these words: "Christ distributes his body in the supper," we do not assert what you think, that Christ first presents himself through the administration of the symbols.</p>
      <p>When we say that Christ, the high priest and pontiff, is present by his power and distributes and gives himself to be eaten by the faithful "here," we refer to the time of the action, not to the symbols themselves, as if we were saying: Christ, at the same time and place where bread and wine are distributed externally, at the same time distributes and gives his body to be eaten internally, which believers bring with them to the supper, namely through faith, and yet they do not lose the same Christ through the distribution of the symbols. For as Christ is not truly given by the symbols but is signified and represented, so he is not taken away by the symbols, but in a certain way becomes more present, as far as all senses are moved and affected by the similarity of things, and as far as all external things serve and assist the internal. It is one thing to say: "John comes with Peter" and another to say: "John comes with feet." The former "with" denotes time, the latter the instrument of coming. Even if we were to say that the body of Christ is given with bread and wine, we would not mean that the sacraments are channels by which the body of Christ is conveyed. You could have understood from our confession that we attribute nothing of these matters, which are of faith, to external symbols, especially since we explicitly reject this everywhere. We attribute everything to faith, everything to Christ, everything to divine power.</p>
      <p>We ask you, however, whether, when the external word of God is preached in the church, Christ is not present with his own and teaches them? Surely you will assert that this is so. Now if someone says that in the preaching of the word of God, Christ is present with his own and refreshes them internally, does he thereby attribute this to the external word, as if it were a funnel bringing Christ? By no means. But he shows that Christ is truly present and refreshes and teaches internally at the time when the word of God is truly preached. If someone wants to be contentious and seek a knot in a bulrush, nothing can be spoken so cautiously and circumspectly that it cannot be distorted by calumny, a disease we hope is far from you, and we fervently pray to God that it may be absent. We do not unite the body with the bread, but we rightly separate one from the other, lest anyone think we confuse the two. The bread that came down from heaven is spiritual, heavenly, and eternal. It is given internally by Christ, eaten internally by faith, not only before the supper but also in the supper. There is also the sacramental symbolic bread, the bread of blessing, by which we give thanks to Christ for his death. Therefore, when we say that Christ gives us this bread to eat, when he teaches us internally through his Spirit that we are delivered from the death of sins to life by the sacrifice of his flesh, you think we are speaking of the sacramental bread. But almost every single word cries out that we are saying something different, which we repeat in our confession to the point of satiety. We say this about the bread that Christ gives, not about the one the minister gives.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when we bring up John 6[51] as support for internal nourishment through faith, you object to us with Zwingli, a man of holy memory, our dearest teacher and father, as if we had not long since read Zwingli's writings most diligently and held them in our memory and fresh mind. But we respond to this: We will not allow ourselves to be oppressed by the authority of any man, no matter how great, but we gladly adhere to the truth preached and taught by Zwingli, indeed we embrace it, kiss it, and, as far as our weak judgment allows, imitate it. When such a great man first began this discourse on the Eucharist after Karlstadt, he prefaced his commentary on True and False Religion with these words: "No one, when they hear us discussing the Eucharist, should judge us as if, since Zwingli said it, it must be followed; if there are any who are so sworn to the words of a man, though I think there are few or none. On the contrary, let them not reject what they see brought forth from the sources of God's mysteries because the author is humble." This we follow. And since no one wrote more clearly, more beautifully, more briefly, and more simply about the Eucharist than our Zwingli, we have transcribed most of his words into our confession, so far from having deviated from him by a hair's breadth. But he almost always brings up and explains the beginning of John 6 in all the books he wrote about the Eucharist. Why then should we not be allowed to do the same? In a letter he once wrote to a certain Matthew of Rutlingen, he gives him this advice: "The essence of this matter can easily be derived from John 6[26-65]. Nor will you hear those here who immediately object: Christ is not talking about this sacrament here. For we feel the same way. But he is dealing with something here that most certainly refutes what we think poorly of him. We began with this chapter when, after much deliberation, we were about to embark on this most dangerous discourse: Is it not by God's gift that there are few among us who do not know what this bread and cup are?" So far Zwingli. In his commentary on True and False Religion, he explains John 6 most clearly right from the beginning. He does the same in almost all the books he writes on this subject, namely to teach that Christ is eaten only by faith. We beseech you, dearest brothers in Christ, to show us one book written by Zwingli on the Eucharist in which he does not clearly explain John 6. Is not this the single weapon: "The flesh profits nothing" [John 6, 63], with which he pierces both the papists and the Lutherans, namely taken from John 6? He wrote a book in German titled "A Clear Report" etc., in which, after explaining John 6, he adds these words at the end: "So much I think I have shown of the true meaning of the words of Christ in John 6, so that the simple may not be led into misunderstanding by the papists." We therefore bring up John 6 in this context to clearly exclude any carnal or corporeal eating of the body of Christ, so that the Lutherans cannot catch us anywhere. We say, therefore, that the body of Christ is eaten by faith alone, distributed and given by Christ and the Spirit alone. This is in the first part of our confession when we speak of the presence of the body of Christ. In the other part, when we speak of the symbols and their administration, we do not even mention this chapter. In the Bern Disputation, when Benedict Burgauer wanted to prove from John 6 that the bread was the body of Christ and that the sacramental bread was the one Christ promised to give in John 6, Zwingli, rightly opposing him, wrested this weapon from his hands. We, however, used this chapter not for this purpose, but to reject all carnal presence and eating of the body of Christ and to establish only the spiritual.</p>
      <p>Now in your letter, you quote some parts of our confession incorrectly and erroneously. For your letter quotes our confession as: "They are distributed and eaten when they are eaten in the symbols," while ours reads: "They are distributed and eaten when they are celebrated in the symbols." You then add: "If you refer to the aforementioned, there is nothing absurd, but if to the eating of the sacraments, so that it is distributed there, as your confession has it, truly and not only symbolically, we would like this to be proven." To this we respond: We refer distribution, eating, or consumption, all of it, to internal faith, which occurs internally in the soul through the Spirit, not to the eating of the symbols. For how could we be so insane as to confess this against manifest truth? We explicitly distinguish everything and make a double eating, a double food, the former in the first part of the confession, the latter in the latter part. It never occurred to us to say that this happens through the administration and offering of the symbols. This you falsely impute to us:</p>
      <p>"As I offer you bread to eat for the body, so" etc. Here we explain the meaning of the symbols and the analogy and speak of Christ the first institutor. For he, as he offered bread externally, so he worked internally in their minds. Then when we say: "By which I indicate to you the fruit of my death," you say that the word "indicate" contradicts the word "give." But what prevents "indicate" and "give" from being contradictory when they refer not to the same thing but to different things? We refer the word "give" to the internal and spiritual bread that came down from heaven, but the word "indicate" to the symbol of bread. If we had referred them to the same thing, you would rightly say that we wrote contradictory things.</p>
      <p>Now this also offends you, that we said the church is made certain and undoubted by the symbols. But we are still speaking of the institution of Christ in the first supper, who wanted to lead the church of the apostles into the contemplation of God's benefits, especially his death, and furthermore to make it certain and undoubted that he gave his body into death for the salvation of the faithful. We do not understand this as the internal assurance of the mind, which occurs internally through the Holy Spirit and faith, but as the certainty by which the church is made certain by external symbols and also testifies to faith. But we will soon make this sense certain from Zwingli's words, from which we took it. We are not of the opinion that symbols applied externally support or make faith certain internally, but in a certain way, symbols make the church certain, as far as it is appropriate for them. But now we will show that we have diligently read Zwingli's works and have not intended anything against him: In the book of articles, article 18, when he cites and explains John 6, he immediately uses these words: "Therefore I want to show a short but clear statement, in which the whole content of this holy meal is comprehended." After explaining this chapter in his usual manner, he soon adds: "Therefore, pious Christian, do not consider the body and blood of Christ to be anything other than the word of faith, namely that his body, killed for us, and his blood, shed for us, has redeemed us and reconciled us to God. If we believe this firmly, then our soul is fed and nourished with the flesh and blood of Christ. Yet Christ, so that the essential testament might be more comprehensible to the simple, gave the form of food to the body, namely the bread, and the drink to the blood, so that they might be assured in faith with a visible act (ecce 'assured')." We wrote these words from here into our confession, but we have sinned against you. Zwingli did not sin, he now adds an example: "[...] just as in baptism the immersion does not wash away sins, the baptized person believes in the salvation of the gospel, that is, the gracious redemption of Christ. So here I speak with Christ: Whoever has not previously given true faith to his word, before he approaches, that which we believe in, that is, completely trust and rely on him, that he is our salvation, so the body of Christ is of no use to him, yes, I say with Paul, that he eats and drinks judgment on himself. But if he approaches with the form and meaning, as Christ speaks and teaches here in John 6, then he becomes alive and is already alive in faith, so the food strengthens him" etc. In these words, he teaches from John 6 how and with what faith one should approach the Eucharist, from which chapter you so greatly recoil. Then he says that faith in Christ, who is the spiritual food, must be present when the recipient approaches, which you reject as impious. In the booklet to the princes of Germany about symbols and signs added to things, he speaks thus: The joining of hands is not the thing itself, but a sign of the preceding contract. "But this sign, although it is not the thing itself, nevertheless confirms the thing itself as if by testimony and confession, so that it cannot be denied. [...] In this way, it is also to be considered in the sacraments. [...] In the Eucharist, the thing itself is to give thanks to the Lord for the benefits he has bestowed on us by redeeming us through his Son. The taking of bread and wine, the sacred symbols sanctified by divine words, is the sacrament of that thing. Therefore, giving thanks is not either the remission of sins or the bread and wine the natural body of Christ, but it only signifies and brings the thing itself into the present by representing and offering it to the contemplation of faith." So far Zwingli. If now, as we acknowledge the truth, the symbols signify the natural body and the remission of sins and, as it were, bring it into the present, represent and offer it to the contemplation of faith, then faith must be present. But what else have we said than that faith works internally while eating, but is not first brought by the symbols? After a few more words, he says again: "Who does not embrace the sacraments as sacred, joyful, and venerable things, when they not only signify such sublime things to us but also, in a certain way, present them to our eyes and senses?" "For when the bread and wine, consecrated by the word of the Lord himself, are distributed to the brothers, is not the whole Christ, as it were, sensibly (so that, if words are required, I say more than is commonly said) also offered to the senses? But how? Is the natural body itself to be handled by hands and palate? By no means, but it is offered to the mind for contemplation" (ecce here he says the body of Christ is offered to the mind for contemplation in the supper), "but to the senses, the sensible sacrament of that thing. For the mind acts more freely and expeditiously when it is called away as little as possible by the senses. Therefore, when what is most similar to what the mind acts upon is also presented to the senses, [...] it is not of little importance that these signs are so instituted by Christ himself that they also have great power by their analogy to lead into the thing present by faith and contemplation" (ecce he says present, the same as we do). "I do not believe that this contemplation of faith is great enough unless it holds the thing itself as certainly and undoubtedly as if it were naturally exposed to the senses. Hence the ancients said that the body of Christ is truly present in the supper [...] because of this certain contemplation of faith, which sees Christ himself, who died on the cross for us, no less present than Stephen saw him reigning at the right hand of the Father with his bodily eyes." Do you not hear here, O brothers, that the body of Christ is present in the supper, which when we say, you condemn as an insane doctrine and do not deign to subscribe to? At the end of the pericope, he adds: "And we have never denied that the body of Christ is sacramentally and in mystery present in the supper, both because of the contemplation of faith and because of the whole action of the symbol, as we have said. [...] But this presence [...] is of faith [...], not of the sacraments." So far Zwingli. But what is it to be present in mystery and sacramentally, if not to be present by faith? This we have said in those words, in that manner, and in that way, in which he gives himself to his own, namely through faith, and as the soul can desire him. For the soul does not want to have or eat the body of Christ in any other way than by faith.</p>
      <p>In the same booklet C 1 he says: "No one should despise or neglect the external justification of the sacraments; indeed, no one who has faith can despise or neglect the external when the opportunity is given. For who can neglect the things of charity? Does not the charity of God and neighbor long to recall, praise, and magnify the benefits of God by giving thanks? Does it not long to be united with the neighbor in the bond of the Spirit and to testify to it openly? Does it not desire, where it senses faith is faltering, to be supported and restored to its place? But where in the world can it hope to find this more conveniently than in the very action of the sacraments, as far as all sensible things are concerned? For although all creatures invite us to the contemplation of the deity, all that invitation is mute. But in the sacraments, there is a living and speaking invitation. For the Lord speaks, and the elements speak and persuade the senses of the same thing that the word and the Spirit speak to the mind. Yet all these visible things are nothing unless [...] the sanctification of the Spirit precedes." In the same booklet C 4: "Now we," he says, "are not offended that, even if all that the Spirit works is referred to the external sacrament, provided we understand it symbolically, as the fathers spoke, we will not be angry. It is foolish to contend over words when we do not disagree in the matter." This we would have deservedly obtained from you, dearest brothers, since our confession does not differ from yours in anything, that you would have subscribed to ours. For we do not disagree in the matter at all, however much we may use different words. In the same booklet D 1: "In the Eucharist, when a noble man was about to depart to a distant region, offering bread and wine, he gave himself to us much more vividly and peculiarly when he said: 'This is my body,' than if he had said: 'This is the symbol of my body,' even though he was about to take his natural body away and carry it into heaven. Nevertheless, he gives himself entirely, as far as faith and grace are concerned, with these words, as if to say: 'Now I go to death for you, shortly to depart from here entirely. But I do not want you to doubt my love and care for you. I am wholly yours, as much as I am. In testimony of this my tradition and testament, I commend to you this symbol, by which you may excite the memory of me and my benefits, so that when you see this bread and cup offered to you in the memorial supper, you may remember me no less than if you saw me in person, as you now see me and dine with you and soon be taken from you to punishment for you' etc. Thus, I say, we have the Lord's supper splendid with the presence of Christ. But in all these things, is not the body of Christ present sacramentally and by the contemplation of faith, as we have said above, the sum of the whole matter?"</p>
      <p>So far we have reviewed Zwingli's writings on this matter in good faith, as we think, so that you may see that we have diligently read the writings of Zwingli, our father, and have not deviated from them at all, indeed have placed his words in our confession. If you have read and considered them, what injustice is there in condemning us and not wanting to subscribe to those with whom you agree? We can hardly remove this grief from our hearts, lest there be some affection in you towards us, some root of bitterness sprouting, causing you to so quickly reject your dearest brothers, whom you have experienced as strong and faithful in the preaching of Christ and truth through many dangers, by the grace of God, and condemn their opinion not yet understood. Charity does not think evil [1 Cor 13, 5] of brothers nor is it so easily suspicious. But this is the work of the devil, who labors nowhere more diligently than in sowing and fostering seeds of discord everywhere, so that they may yield the most abundant fruit. For nothing is more suited to his nature than hatred and dissension. It is certainly a lamentable spectacle to see the dissension of so many years between the Lutherans and us now growing with this new increase among us. When will there finally be an end, O Jesus, to the discord and contention among your people? A new pain now pierces our hearts when we hear that you too are separated from us. What do you think our people on both sides will say if they hear that we are at odds with each other in such a great matter? For what certain persuasion can there be for the simple among these battles of the preachers of the word? Will not everything be in turmoil when they see us constantly devising and spreading new things? Will not everything be uncertain for them, so that they fear being deceived by us no less than by the papists? We want to strip our colleagues (for we are leaders of one army) of all protection, and driven by sinister suspicions, we interpret what they say and write and do unfavorably. We therefore expose ourselves, deprived of all help and disarmed, to the injury of those who seize opportunities to harm us. We often prefer everything to be disturbed and overturned by the hatred of others than for the matter to be well managed by the auspices and counsel of those we hate. These are impotent and harmful diseases of the soul, dearest brothers, from which if we do not abstain, we will one day pay a great penalty and also lose others who would have been saved through us.</p>
      <p>Consider that we are children of light and truth, not slaves of the most shameful affections. Truth drives out all vanity, self-love, vain glory, and contention. Where the grace of the Spirit is and charity born from heaven, there hatred, envy, and suspicion born from Satan will not remain. Bear with us as foolish and humble, dearest brothers, if we speak to you a little more freely and harshly. You seem to us to be suffering from some disease against us. For how else could you have treated our matters so contemptuously and unfriendly? And this disease causes you to observe vain images of that matter in your mind, which never occurred to us. These suspicions greatly detract from the authority, benevolence, and sweetness of friendship, and we begin not to trust enough nor from the heart, as was fitting. We ask you, however, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, to embrace us with true and brotherly love, putting aside all affection. You will feel the same in us. Do not withdraw from such a holy brotherhood and society, lest you give the impious an opportunity to slander. Examine our matters more diligently, look more accurately and deeply, and without a doubt, you will subscribe to us in all things. May the Lord grant us to be of the same mind and to be united and glued together in the bond of charity. Amen.</p>
      <p>We ask you to present this our excuse to the brothers you have gathered from the field, so that they may see that it is nothing less than what they thought. If you still desire anything, that we may speak more clearly (for we cannot say anything else), let us know. Whatever can be done with truth and faith intact, we will do, yet do not alienate your mind from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, best and dearest brothers. May the God of peace always be with us!</p>
