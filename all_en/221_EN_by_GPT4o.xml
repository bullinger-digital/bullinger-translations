      <p>S. I send to you in good faith a copy of the written letters, from which you will understand the ways and the old privileges by which the emperors Charles and others have stripped the most deserving city of its ancestors, and under the guise of freedom, have burdened them with a new and unheard-of servitude for many centuries, indeed, and condemned them, for the favor of a few men who have allowed an aristocracy to be offered to them, which I do not know whether it is more of an oligarchy.</p>
      <p>It certainly opens a great window for recognizing betrayals and now for the first time grasping them by hand, which have destroyed not just one city after enduring and suffering war and have immediately subverted the purity of religion. But more on this another time.</p>
      <p>The lords of Constance finally resisted by grace to the point of bloodshed, having lost several most honorable men, but who died for their country, so that in this way it is more desirable to have fallen than to survive in many ways. God will give them grace, by which they will be much dearer to many even by this single deed than ever before. At noon of this day in Lindau, Thomas Blaurer, Hieronymus Hirussius, and the tribune Labharter, finally released from that Augsburg scaffold, had lunch.</p>
      <p>They were going to go straight to Constance via Ravensburg; but when they were warned early and unexpectedly of the siege and the disaster that had simultaneously occurred, they retreated into the mountains and came from Isny to Lindau this morning. However, I do not doubt that, having been carried by a small ship, they are now comforting and encouraging their people in Constance. They say, however, that the emperor will soon leave Augsburg, but it is unknown where he is going with those wagons of his factions and arts.</p>
      <p>From Habio you will understand with what man Antronius dealt with us; the cause fell most disgracefully.</p>
      <p>We have blown the dust from the ears of his envoy before an honorable council here in such a way that, according to his promise, he has not wanted to provide any further assistance to his subjects in Baden, and they have also not appeared in Baden at all as they had been induced. Would to God that he now stood with us in the right, where one would hear beautiful locks. Truly, truly, that beast is unworthy of the favor of good men, certainly conscious of pernicious factions. But more on this another time. Now I barely had time to smear these things rather than write them. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 8th day of August, in the year 1548. Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his own. Zurich.</p>
