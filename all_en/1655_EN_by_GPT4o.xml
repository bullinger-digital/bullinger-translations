      <p>S. I wrote these days with a very disturbed mind; but in the meantime, the election of my brother has greatly refreshed me again. May the Lord grant that he may be beneficial, happy, and prosperous to himself and the church! I have good hopes for him; he is a calm and hardworking man and will refuse nothing, I know, whatever you command him. I ask that you commend him and instruct him on how he should conduct himself; for it is a far different matter to preside over urban churches than rural ones. I will also remind him of his duty.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, nothing new has come except about the Nurembergers. The Margrave is pressing them hard; it is expected that they will be conquered in a few days. They are very enraged; thus Witz had Nuremberg, etc. God have mercy on them!</p>
      <p>These are nothing but the loving plagues of God; thus must Germany be punished. I fear for us, sooner or later.</p>
      <p>Mecard writes from Augsburg that the interimists are still preaching; none of the others have yet been appointed because of the oath taken. It is going very poorly; the council is of no use, they still have Fucker and Baumgarter among them, not looking to God, but still always to the world. He also writes that Wittenberg and Bavaria have many people; it is not known whether they will declare themselves friends or foes. I fear Bavaria will also have to suffer. Marti von Poßow is said to have burned up to Champagne and done great damage; the king pursues him; he flees again. It is expected that it will not end without a battle. Nothing is known of the emperor in Augsburg. Many people think he is dead. They would like to have Musculus in Augsburg; but it still does not please him, and all the wise write to him to stay. They are completely unprepared in the city, having no people. It is feared that the princes are seeking to appropriate the cities, although I think Musculus writes all this to you. With us, there is nothing else, except that the plague is breaking out again. Schultheiß Negeli is sick with fever, Wattenwyl is not here.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May all yours be safe; all mine are well by the grace of God and greet you and yours. June 12, 1552.</p>
      <p>Having written this, behold, other letters from Mecard are brought, which are dated June 3, of which this is almost the summary: 1. On June 2, 46 wagons with artillery, which were taken from the emperor and bishop at Füssen and Innsbruck, came to Augsburg, along with 71 wagons of artillery and goods. 2. It appears that King Ferdinand intends to make a violent resistance at Regensburg. The Count of Eberstein is in the city with 12 companies, therefore the princes are directing all their power to Donauwörth. 3. Duke Hans is free with the king, is supposed to fall into Saxony through Bohemia and with their help; but the Count of Oldenburg is strong in Saxony, to resist him. A marriage between his elder son and Ferdinand's daughter has been arranged; the matter will be dangerous. 4. Nuremberg has suffered over 100,000 guilders in damage. The Margrave wants another 600,000 guilders for costs or losses, intends to burn down their forest, on which all their ruin depends. He has made a breach through the town hall, one through the chancellery, three through Krafft's house, one through St. Sebald; otherwise, he shoots the houses in general without distinction, has never shot the wall at any place, incites young and old, etc. 5. The bishops, Mainz and others, have gathered a force; it is supposed to relieve Nuremberg. 6. The emperor is arming up to 16,000 strong in Carinthia, Styria, and Austria together. 7. Brentius has been summoned before us, but cannot come at the appointed time. A response is expected daily from Doctor Schnepf and Sarcerius. We have brought the matter with seriousness and the help of the parishes to the point that we fear no innovation; we would like, if possible, to be free of the choir robe. But when Dr. Johann Marpach's considerations take place along with all others, who look to the future and national council, it will not happen. They also want private absolution, which is supposed to be free, as it was held before, for the sake of youth and preservation most of all. This he writes. 8. Also, my lords give Lord Sebastian Schertli 60,000 florins for Burtenbach and all other claims.</p>
      <p>This is almost the summary of what he writes to them, some of which may be known to you; therefore I wanted to extract it for your sake. Farewell again. Greet in my name Mr. Pellicanus, Theodor, Gwalther, and all the others.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
