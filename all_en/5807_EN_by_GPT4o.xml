      <p>Since I recently wrote to you, nothing new has been brought from France, except that God seems to be seriously playing through children.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Orléans, offended by the insolence of the Guise boy, struck him with an arrow he was holding in his hand.</p>
      <p>He immediately went to his mother, the mother to the queen, who gently rebuked her son with words and urged him to forgive the Guise.</p>
      <p>He freely replied that he could not be persuaded to ever endure his sight, and that he not only hated him, but the entire family, which had been ruinous to the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the mother was forced to remove him from the court; but in Paris, she encourages and inflames the insane rashness of the people.</p>
      <p>New disturbances arise daily; there is absolutely no authority of the court.</p>
      <p>The armed populace overturns all judgments with impunity. This is the most just reward, that the license should rebound on the authors of the robbery.</p>
      <p>The queen opposes us as much as she can; Condé is silent; the admiral excuses himself, preferring to wait for an opportunity at home rather than throw himself into manifest danger.</p>
      <p>Since he, the Count of Rochefoucauld, and Beza had been accused by the Guise's assailant, they had issued a common defense, which was immediately presented to the king's council; but because not all doubts were sufficiently removed, the admiral issued a declaration.</p>
      <p>We send a printed copy; if there were anyone suitable among you, it would be desirable to publish it in German at the next fair.</p>
      <p>The book would be saleable, so there is no fear of loss to the printer; but haste would be necessary.</p>
      <p>We entrust the matter to your and the other brothers' prudence; if in your judgment it is expedient to bring it to light, perhaps some way will be found among you.</p>
      <p>In Lyon, everything is still peaceful.</p>
      <p>The priests conduct themselves modestly, indeed they flatter our people; they have only celebrated mass in one place so far, and indeed on a profane altar, because there was no sacred one.</p>
      <p>In Montpellier, Nîmes, and other cities, our people still enjoy the churches, because no one from the opposing side dares to reclaim them.</p>
      <p>In Normandy, the Port of Grace, which the English had occupied, is under siege.</p>
      <p>This is what I had at present to add to the previous matters. I ask that you and Mr. Gwalther take care of the publication of the Apology, if time permits and a good printer offers himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and brother, venerable to me. Greet all the colleagues in my name and in the name of the brothers, as well as your family.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 19, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
