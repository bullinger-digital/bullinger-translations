      <p>On Wednesday, the imperial envoys, the Count of Heiligenberg and the Truchsess, arrived in Konstanz, and on Tuesday they took their seats in the guildhall with great solemnity, along with kissing and tapestries; the entire council was assembled there, and whoever else could go up there; the entire council, in the name of the imperial majesty, paid homage, begged for grace and forgiveness, etc. Then a letter was read out, stating how they were once again received into grace by the imperial majesty, and he took them into his bosom and forgave everything, released them from the ban and double ban, etc. A great celebration was held, and there was a tremendous sound of joy with one shot after another, so that we thought here that the enemies were before the city; such a terrible shooting it was. Imperial mandates were also posted and sent around, stating that the people of Konstanz should be treated and allowed to move safely everywhere, paying them all rents, dues, and debts, etc., in the best form, and there is great joy. God willing, that no great suffering will soon follow! The date of the imperial absolution was in the letter in November of the year 1548; so long have they been sitting on this egg until it was hatched.</p>
      <p>The servants, who are still lying there in addition, about 40 of them, have been newly quartered in the houses of those who are prominent among those who have not yet gone to mass, etc. The pious must always bear the cross. May God grant steadfast patience until the end, etc.</p>
      <p>The merchants from the lake towns have also been to Frankfurt; they are supposed to have been reconciled, but they do not want the Interim. Only Magdeburg is still resisting; the emperor wants to build blockhouses in front of it and force them in every way, etc. It is said that someone from the lake towns minted a thaler and stamped it in such a way that on one side John baptizes Christ and the inscription around it reads: "Hic est etc." which you should hear, and on the other side a bishop's hat with a snake underneath and the inscription reads: "Pack dich, Interim" etc.; it was thus written to the W端rttemberg court, etc., to Doctor Knoder.</p>
      <p>The old Count of Oettingen is still at the W端rttemberg court, is now sick, but recently secretly visited his domain, stayed quietly with an innkeeper in one of his villages; the innkeeper hosted him overnight. This was immediately reported to his son, who now rules the domain and is strongly against God's word. Thus, he had the innkeeper immediately arrested and, without prior judgment and right, had his head cut off because he hosted his father for one night; it greatly troubles the old count that the good man lost his life because of him.</p>
      <p>The Duke of W端rttemberg has now had "Verbum Domini manet in aeternum" made into the sleeves of all his court servants; it is interpreted as a great defiance. He is as large, stout, and well-nourished as never in his life, yet gouty and with very bad legs, so that he must be carried in a sedan chair; otherwise, he does not let anything bother him, goes hunting daily, has 12 trumpeters, which he never had since he returned to the land, etc. They are wonderful talents; but before the fall, there is pride, etc. It is widely believed that he will flee the land. The judgments at the chamber court are already prepared between the king and him; a prominent person at the chamber court recently had a good friend warned not to move back to W端rttemberg; otherwise, he would soon have to leave again, etc. The Duke is said to have prepared a large estate in France. It is so strange and wonderful, also so unequal regarding religion in the principality, that it is astonishing. The faithful, dear God, have mercy on your own!</p>
