      <p>Greetings. The letters you recently sent to me, most illustrious man, I carefully ensured were delivered to Strasbourg with the package of our Oporinus, which I wanted to signify with this present letter, so that I might relieve your piety of all anxiety. I congratulate Lord Christoph Mont, the most learned of all men, whom we greatly mourned as having been taken from life, therefore it can hardly be said how much I was refreshed by your letters, which indicated the man was still alive. But Lord Mont shares this in common with Caesar, whom vain men have already several times spread rumors of his death, to pour joy into the lap of adversaries. As for the books, which you requested from me several months ago, I had entrusted the entire matter to Peter Mechlin, who requested them along with others from the people of Strasbourg, but in vain, as I see. Today there is great dishonesty among carriers, who do not blush to demand three or four times the fee from Frankfurt and Strasbourg to Basel, which has resulted in books purchased by our people six or eight months ago in Frankfurt and other places being stuck and repeatedly requested in vain by good men.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is no reason to accuse my faithfulness in handling your affairs, as I willingly acknowledge myself to be obliged to your piety in more serious matters. We have no news at the moment; however, the common rumor is that the Emperor and Margrave Albert have dismissed soldiers and that peace conditions have been proposed between the Emperor and the French, but I do not know what kind. Lord Johannes Junius, the preacher of Aarau, preached among us on the 17th of June, whom we hope will obtain a position at the Church of St. Peter in Sulz. Farewell with your family. February 19, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in both piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
