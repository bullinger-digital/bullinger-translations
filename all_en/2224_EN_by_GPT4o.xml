      <p>S. D. The letter along with the 4 books "On the Justifying Grace of God" have been safely and completely delivered to me. Indeed, my spirit is most willing to translate them promptly, but overwhelmed by the excessive burden of the prince's affairs, whose chief secretary I am now, I scarcely see how this can be done, especially since the work itself needs to be expedited. I wish I could gratify you and the entire Church of Christ with this labor. I am sending you the translation of the book titles, along with the dedication to the Elector of Saxony; for there is doubt whether I have satisfied the first impression; you judge and freely write back your judgment to me soon.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the importance of the matter will invite me to steal an hour daily from other tasks and devote it to this labor. What I am going to do with Jonas, I have not yet decided; since the day he arrived here, he has been seriously ill and is still excessively tormented by scabies. You, along with your excellent son-in-law Simler, are abundantly excused with me. I indeed see that the lesser part comes from discipline, but the greatest from the grace of God; yet I do not completely despair; I will pour out prayers to the Lord for my son, that, if possible, he may finally return to the right path. I also believe that Jonas's creditors are impatient with the delay in the payment of debts; but the only reason it has not been done so far is that a reliable and suitable courier could not be found, unless I wanted to send it at my own expense.</p>
      <p>In this, however, be certain that if no one presents themselves shortly, I will not spare the cost of such a journey, lest I be overwhelmed by the suspicion of ingratitude.</p>
      <p>The affairs of Germany are in their former state, that is, they decline more and more every day. A diet is convened to begin on April 8 in Augsburg; the princes of Germany are choosing lodgings for themselves, persuading themselves that they will also obtain them from the arriving Spaniards.</p>
      <p>The Papists are wonderfully raising their crests because of the English executions; they are beginning to inquire here and there, burn books, proscribe and kill Christians. Farewell. Hastily amidst many labors in Neuburg an der Donau, March 15, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your brother from the heart, Georg Frölich (Laetus), etc. I desire my German copy to be returned to me as it is the protocol.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zürich, most sincere friend and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich.</p>
