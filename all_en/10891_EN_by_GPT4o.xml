    <p xml:id="regest1">Received money and letter(s). During a visit to Jonen on June 24, [...] Bechli assured him to inform him in time about a [sales] offer from Durs Hofmann. For Jörg [Stadler?], it will probably be too expensive; he owes 600 guilders. An unknown person from Zug threatened Johannes Bullinger because of his sermons, but he doesn't care about it. He also rejected the proposal to resign from his office for ten times his salary. The client is presumably [Heinrich] Schönbrunner, who tried to persuade him during his visit yesterday that supporting the king [Francis I] as a mercenary leader [illegally] would benefit the Confederates. The letter carrier has something to report to [Heinrich] Utinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, money and letter(s) have reached me. I was at Jonen myself at Bechli's place. He assured me that he would inform me in time about an offer from Durs Hofmann. He is a good man to me. By the way, I want to take good care etc.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I will go to the bailiff to learn about the matter. If Jörg wants to buy it, it will be too expensive for him; he owes me 600 guilders.</p>
      <p>Further, I cannot write you any news, as I go nowhere, except that I have received two warnings to be cautious. Someone has threatened to cut my throat. I cannot find out who he is, but he is supposed to be from the Zug area, and it is because of my preaching etc. I don't care.</p>
      <p>The devil also has his messengers. Someone from Merenschwand came to me and asked in detail if I could be persuaded with money and goods to abandon my plans. He is not the least of the Confederates who desires my resignation. However, he finally offered 10 guilders. I gave him a friendly answer and thanked him with modest words, but told him that he would not get more. I cannot find out who he is. I suspect it is Schönbrunner, who was very friendly with me yesterday, and as I like such things, if not the king should rightly help, so that it does not come to us. I thought nothing further. His business is well known etc.</p>
      <p>Send this young man to Utinger's house, and whatever pleasant words he has to say. [A]nother letter send to me.</p>
      <p>To M. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear brother, in Zurich.</p>
