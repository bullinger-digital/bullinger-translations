      <p>Greetings. I intend to respond to your previous letters (reverend father in Christ); for now, know that I am very willing to comply with your advice, and I did not write to him as if to attempt something more importunate. I know what the times are now and how inadvisable it is to change one's position, nor do I shirk labor, provided that some fruit of the labor is evident. Now to your matters.</p>
      <p>I have received everything, both from Strasbourg and Geneva. I am very displeased with the hesitation of our people, as are all whom I have indeed heard.</p>
      <p>You wish the Rhaetians to do their duty; but what could they do, since no one has written anything so far? I see them bearing it very indignantly, that they are so shamefully neglected. How is it that when Condé sought soldiers elsewhere, he passed over our people? Now, when our people see this hesitation, because that madness displeases them greatly, they begin to cool off. However, if Condé has any concern, I think he should definitely be written to.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this matter contributes to the reconciliation of wills. Now, before our people go to Geneva and return, a month will pass; will Condé wait in the meantime? You have much influence with Calvin and Beza; exert all your strength at once to spur them on, those of Condé. I will send this letter to Hercules; tomorrow he is the one who will depart.</p>
      <p>I will not communicate with others until Hercules has arrived or at least written; but I would prefer Hercules to go to Geneva. In the meantime, unless soldiers are requested by Condé from the public senate of the Three Leagues, what can private individuals do? From Brescia it is reported (I write as Bonetus writes) that the second session is finished, but not published by order of the pope. Our people are surprised that the Zurichers restrain their own with such strict law from military service; they think it should be concealed now more than ever, since the common cause is at stake. Stephan Heymius is departing for Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>If you give him any letters to Mr. Erastus, in which you commend him (he is a very honest young man), you will do a favor both to the consul and to me; he pursues theological studies and may be of use to his country someday. The prefect of our city, a man of the highest authority among us after the consuls, is coming to you; he is going to Baden to plead a case on behalf of the Three Leagues for a young man, a citizen of Wallenstadt, otherwise a Rhaetian, whose parent is a minister and preacher. The landvogt of Sargans fined him 50 florins and imprisoned him, imposing a penance on him because he went to Einsiedeln to confess, and meanwhile seized all his goods, accusing him of having said that the mass is foolishness, and that the mass priests hide behind the wine, and slandering his father and the degree to which they came into conflict with him, also saying they had knowledge of him. The young man asks to pay the 50 florins so that he may be released from the other or be allowed to move with his goods according to the law of the leagues. He incurs great costs for this; for when previously sent to the landvogt of Sargans, he would not accept any action or request. Along with him is Mr. Lux Äscher, who can speak of everything.</p>
      <p>This is the summary.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask nothing else than that you write with six lines to the mayor or both envoys going to Baden, requesting them to support the city prefect of Chur and let him receive a friendly response, since the matter is not so serious. If the city prefect takes this letter with him (for he will depart tomorrow), he cannot delay long in Zurich; for it is time. Thus, I must trouble you again, though I do not do so gladly.</p>
      <p>But the young man has an old, pious father, a preacher in the Rhine Valley; we are obliged to serve him. Otherwise, the young man will lose all his goods.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>The mayor says he will depart on Friday.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 22, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, always reverend. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
