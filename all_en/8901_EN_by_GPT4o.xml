      <p>Greetings. The messenger who was sent to the Engadin has not yet returned, and I hope that the intentions of the Engadiners are not as dangerous as the initial rumors suggested.</p>
      <p>I am sending the rest of the history and now fear something else, that the Archduke, together with the Pope, is plotting something new. If Conradin had appeared these days, he would have been out of danger of life and would have been treated no differently than others who have suffered some loss of dignity and wealth. I fear that he may bring greater harm upon himself by preferring to linger elsewhere rather than return to his homeland when summoned and respond. The judgment has been dissolved once and will not convene before the Pentecost fair.</p>
      <p>I will send the response given to the Milanese envoy shortly. Now, I have sent what I could, knowing that your guest at the Stork, Heinrich Becker (who did not deign to visit me, even though he stayed at such a lodging that was not safe for me to visit; therefore, he could neither be greeted nor seen by me), has decided to return home. I do not know with what peace the communities will accept what the judges have decreed at this time.</p>
      <p>We may perhaps hear more news than we would like before the fair is at hand.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 10, 1572.</p>
