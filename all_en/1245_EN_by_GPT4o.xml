      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, my dearest compater in the Lord, is already in readiness, waiting for me to write these few lines; therefore, take it kindly that I do not write more extensively, although there is nothing of such great importance at present that I should write. My case was heard and concluded in the senate on the 10th of this month. My Psalter was presented to the lords by my beloved compater Johannes Haller, who also explained my domestic necessity. I did not want to do this myself, but, to maintain decorum, I made use of Mr. Haller's assistance. The lords gave, in place of an honorarium, 30 crowns, and then increased my stipend by twenty florins annually and one cask of wine from Rüfenach.</p>
      <p>For this, I owe much to both you and Mr. Haller, my compater, for this service, which you have faithfully rendered to my needs. I pray to the Lord that He may, in turn, always and everywhere take care of your needs. I am sending here what I received yesterday from Augsburg, written to me about the people of Magdeburg.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's son has decided to leave his father this month and return to Spain. Queen Maria has also returned to the Lower Germany. Thus, the Emperor will remain alone in Augsburg, may he go to the old heap from there! Farewell excellently, my dearest compater.</p>
      <p>May all yours be well, including the lords, friends, and brothers. Bern, 14th April 1551.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord. I will write to Mr. Pellican on the next occasion. I gave the commentaries of R. Sal. translated by him to the servant of Robert Estienne, as he wrote to me.</p>
      <p>Think about my Psalter, how it might be conveyed to you. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
