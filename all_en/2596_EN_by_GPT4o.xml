      <p> Greetings. To your recent letter, my lord and dearly beloved brother, I responded immediately, among other things, that your correction and enrichment of my Confession is most pleasing to me and greatly delights me. Therefore, I fraternally request that you submit it to the press as soon as possible, send 50 copies to Lindau at my expense, and you will receive the indicated price shortly thereafter. I repeat this so that you are not uncertain of my intention, in case my previous letters were intercepted. Furthermore, when I returned home from the prince's court these days, I found the agreement of your churches given to me by you. Good God, how joyful and exultant it made me in the Lord, that all your writings agree so that they exist as the strongest, indissoluble chains. Nothing would be more pleasing to me than to have some copies to share with others to silence those who speak unjustly, especially if they were published in German; I would gladly bear the cost for five or six, which could be sent to me with the Confession. I also eagerly desire to know from you whether your Agreement has been translated into German or not; for if a German translation does not yet exist, I would like to offer my efforts to work on it. </p>
      <p> The state of the comedies remains unchanged. The Lutherans seek peace, under which religion is expressly included, and they seem to achieve their desires, provided that the Zwinglians and Anabaptists are excluded, which the papists strongly urge, and they have long hoped to achieve their request; however, I see that the princes have not yet approved or accepted that impious exception. </p>
      <p> Three hundred captives are now being led from Lower Germany, reportedly for no other reason than their devotion to the truth, although their leaders assert something quite different; they will be handed over to work on ships; they are now going through Italy to the maritime coasts. Farewell, brother, and greet the brothers. </p>
      <p> Jacob Funck, an excellent man, was recently with me in Lauingen, Augsburg, and Gundelfingen, to whom I would have gladly offered the duties of hospitality, had his haste not prevented it. </p>
      <p> Hastily from Gundelfingen, where I now hope to have my residence for a longer time; the Lord exercises me in wondrous ways; nowhere since my first exile has a sufficiently certain place been open to me. Farewell again and forever. March 26, in the year 1555. </p>
      <p> Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus). </p>
      <p> Your relative did not say a word to me about his affairs; otherwise, I would have helped him with the prince to the best of my ability; from this, I infer that he did not need any assistance. </p>
      <p> To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the Church of Christ in Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and friend, to his hands. </p>
