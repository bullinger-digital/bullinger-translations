      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received and understood your recent letter, which you sent to us through a messenger.</p>
      <p>Regarding your mention that you are saddened by our cousin and Strasbourg's decision to send their representatives to the council, we do not share the same opinion. This is because we believe that the envoys of the imperial estates, whom we assume are devoted to the Gospel, are not sent to support the partisan papal council. They are not to recognize it as judges, neither silently nor publicly. Instead, if they cannot agree with the papal judges, they should protest. If they are not heard, they should avoid suspicion of evasion by appearing and thus prevent many offenses. They should also immediately make their confession of faith and submit it in writing, if they can no longer do otherwise. For the Gospel should be preached to all creatures, much more to all people, especially when required by the authorities, who have now forbidden our people to speak and debate, despite having promised safe conduct. Therefore, we cannot disregard God's command to appear and give an account of our faith.</p>
      <p>Where the word is, there is hope that it will not return empty to the Lord. It will not only bear the fruit that people submit to the Lord through such confession, humbling themselves under His hand and preferring to experience and expect His miraculous deliverance. It may also reach a Nicodemus on the other side, and for the others and the hardened ones, it will serve as a testimony against them on that day. It is also a defense of Christ's honor, commanded to all Christians. The hope is certain: the more Christ is persecuted, the more and stronger His word spreads.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it cannot become worse for Christians, but better, as they follow and practice their spiritual and temporal calling to the honor of Christ. How then should God not also accomplish something through the learned, even if the scribes and Pharisees do not accept Christ? Should He therefore not preach in their temple or refrain because it brings little benefit? And if no other fruit follows, it is still pleasing to God that we testify through such speech that we believe and therefore speak, and through such good works make the calling of election to salvation certain. This is what Christ and His apostles have done everywhere with all Christians, etc. It is said that the imperial estates (of whom we speak) have allowed themselves to be misled and have fallen heavily. How else should one act than to hold fast to Master Christ, so that the fall may be pleasing to the Lord and His strength be perfected in our weakness? But this can only happen if one does not remain lying down, but rises again from the fall. Rising requires repentance and faith, faith requires confession. Where is one more obliged to confess, or where does one do it more blessedly than precisely where one is required to do so and is most fiercely persecuted? Yes, if it does not happen in the presence of and against the opponents and persecutors of the word, it would be a poor confession. If someone is then persecuted, they stand in the saying: All who want to live a godly life must suffer persecution, etc., from which the Lord can save beyond human plans in His time. But without necessity, there is also no salvation. The necessity of confession and accounting for faith is commanded by Christ against anyone who desires it, and is especially Christ's calling when required by the authorities, as mentioned, where He particularly wants to save His honor, etc.</p>
      <p>We are also hopeful that our cousin and other estates will, with God's help, remain steadfast in their Christian confession at the council without yielding, and will uphold and defend it according to their office and calling, and will dedicate everything to the honor of Christ, to which the Lord may grant us all grace, courage, and perseverance. Amen.</p>
      <p>We wanted to inform you of this, graciously, how the evangelical estates of the empire will act at the council (as it is called), and that we hope they will not act contrary to this opinion, graciously requesting that you understand this and our opinion and considerations in the best way from us, and if we err, instruct us, as we always trust in you, etc.</p>
      <p>The little book you intend to send us, we will let happen, as it serves the honor of God, and we thank you very graciously for your humble offer, being inclined to your grace, hereby commending you to the Lord. Dated Schaffhausen, the 25th of February, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc. To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
