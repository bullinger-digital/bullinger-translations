      <p>Magnificent man, sincerely beloved by us.</p>
      <p>We have received what you were pleased to send us of our labors through the servant of the magnificent Francesco Lismanino, which we have not yet been able to read due to the many occupations that the general convention of this our kingdom holds us in. We cannot give you further response for now, only that with more leisure, which we do not have at the moment, we will read them. In the meantime, we thank you for this good [office and declaration] of your spirit towards us, for which we offer you our grace and favor.</p>
      <p>By the command of the sacred royal majesty himself.</p>
      <p>... To the man Heinrich Bullinger, of the Zürich church... or sincerely beloved by us.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
