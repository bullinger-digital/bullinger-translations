      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you at all times, etc. beforehand. On the 15th of this month, I sent you the latest from Winterthur, also to the captain in Wil, to inform me by whom he sent the letters and the package from Rottenstein via Zurich; for I have no peace until I hear that you have received them; for without a doubt, both women are very eager for a response. The captain has assured me that he has arranged it; kindly ask to inform me via courier. There is a messenger who goes to Nuremberg, well known to Mr. Schlüsselberger. If my honorable Mr. Walther has received the letters from Augsburg, I would like to know. I will not send anything more to the captain.</p>
      <p>I have little news, except the following: Duke of Alba is said to have lost up to 5000 men before Haarlem, 8 ships, including 5 laden from Antwerp, were sunk, the port thus damaged, that it cannot be cleared for a long time.</p>
      <p>In Amsterdam, due to the munitions, the Spaniards have slaughtered over 8000 citizens.</p>
      <p>Before La Rochelle, the defeat follows; may God help the Prince of Condé; he will have to leave. The Lord of Chamagne, who was governor in Burgundy, has passed away, so I know of no more renowned commander who could lead an army of mercenaries. There is great famine throughout the land; in Lyon, the grain costs 65β, which is over 2 francs, almost a Constance quarter. There is fear and distress; the pious are dead in body, the others kill them in soul and body. I will not forget the poor. So my request is, if it is not too burdensome, to find out if there is a cabinetmaker among you, a native of Zurich, named Rudolf Dowys, who worked with noble wood in Bologna, Italy, years ago; whether he is still alive or dead, and if he is married; it would be a favor to me, so do not spare me. Greet all your people for me. God's grace be with you, yours, and all of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my honorable, beloved sir in Zurich.</p>
