      <p>I thought that in my last letter to you I had satisfied you abundantly; but you write another and earnestly request that I respond to the questions you have posed to me. For Vergerius, a cunning man, has elicited from me certain words with which he might undermine Celio. I am always ready to serve you and have always shown myself to you as befits a friend and brother. Now, however, since I suspect that a new response is demanded from me so that it may be used in the conflict with Vergerius, and since I do not wish in any way for my name to be involved in that dispute, I see that I have nothing else to respond with than what I truly answered in my last letter. Vergerius has elicited no words from me that tend towards the subversion of Celio, unless you think that those which I explained in my last often-cited letter to you tend towards your subversion. Therefore, there is no reason for me to respond to those questions of yours, since I have neither said nor written anything else about that book of yours than what I have already explained to you in my last letter. You indeed say: "I know that you advised me not to publish; these, I say, are old matters, now all is new." But I acknowledge nothing beyond the old, and I do not wish and I grieve that a new contention arises among those who were once brothers and of the same nation. If you had followed my advice and not published that disputation of yours, you would now easily be free of this trouble. Our Laelius wanted to offer a part of your Apology; but I have not yet received it, nor read it, especially since at the time he offered it, I was not going to be in the city for several days, to which I only returned yesterday. I will read it, however, when he offers it to me again and when my affairs permit. There is enough and more than enough of contentions and disputes in the church; the spectators of this unfortunate fight are our enemies, with great joy to themselves. May the Lord Jesus, the Prince of Peace, grant us more peaceful times and form peaceful hearts in you and Vergerius, cleansed from the filth of envy and the disturbances of a wicked mind.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, July 9. Greet your wife and the whole family in my name and my wife's name. 1557.</p>
