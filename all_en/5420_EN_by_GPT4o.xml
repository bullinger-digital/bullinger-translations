      <p>S. What I should write or where I should begin, I do not know; I am so completely disturbed.</p>
      <p>However, I will begin with that which now moves me the most. Yesterday, without any of us knowing, Castalio came here, whether he was called by the senate or only by our chief scribe, I cannot yet ascertain; the matter is still so new to me. Even today, while we did not know what he was doing here and suspected that he might be traveling for pleasure during these dog days, he entered the senate and, as I now hear (for he just met with me), he was confirmed by himself as a professor in Lausanne, provided he can obtain a release from the people of Basel.</p>
      <p>This was done without any of us knowing and being unaware. However, we can easily estimate who arranged this, and it is not so much the indignity of the matter that moves us as this deceit, and that contrary to the common custom of our church, he was not sent to us, nor did he greet us beforehand. He just spoke to me and explained these things.</p>
      <p>I barely restrained myself from bursting out at him; however, I preferred to delay until it has been discussed collectively what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>This will hinder us the most (for otherwise, I think it will happen that we will complain to the senate about this matter), that we have nothing certain in our hands against him. He indeed opposed Calvin in the matter of predestination; but this subject is not so odious to everyone, and many are pleased with the opposing opinion. With mere suspicions, with which he is burdened, we will achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he has a serious promoter and patron, who will not allow himself to be pressed except by solid arguments. Therefore, if you have anything that can help us here, make sure that I have it soon.</p>
      <p>If we can do nothing else, we will certainly inform the senate of what kind of person he is, and demand a confession by which he clears himself of all suspicions. It will first be in Geneva that it will be clear...</p>
