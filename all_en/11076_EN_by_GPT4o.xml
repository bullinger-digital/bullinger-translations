    <p xml:id="regest1">Has carried out the assignment; moreover, [Konrad] Geßner, whom he recommended to Kaspar [Megander] and [Peter] Kunz, [as a professor in Lausanne] receives a generous remuneration and will one day be an ornament to Zurich. Since the dangerously divided Bernese [theologians] do not listen to the people of Basel, he asks Bullinger to exert his influence. The English King [Henry VIII] supports Emperor [Charles V] with troops, and the Frenchman [Francis I] has published a new justification; the Turkish threat, which is indeed confirmed by letters from Italy, perhaps only serves as a pretext for measures against the Protestants. He asks to find out the circumstances of [Heinrich] Schönbrunner's death through Werner Steiner.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have completed the tasks you entrusted to me, as you can see. Furthermore, Geßner, with my recommendation to Kaspar and Kunz, has obtained a sufficiently generous stipend. I am very hopeful that he, if he lives, will one day be an ornament to Zurich.</p>
      <p>I do not know what the dissension among the Bernese brothers will ultimately bring. I see those who fear for the gospel because of it. Both sides are strong; certainly, there is a fear of not a small evil. You, with your wisdom, should keep watch over them; for they have cast us aside, which I wish had not happened. For what we have done so far, we have done for them, not against them. God knows and will judge. I love them, and therefore I commend them to you; do what I trust you will do.</p>
      <p>You surely know that the Englishman is doing everything for the Emperor, to the extent that he sent his troops to him this summer. I had hoped otherwise, but the hope of men is vain. The Frenchman has newly defended all his actions in a public writing. Indeed, what is written is astonishing. I am beginning to doubt the Turk, although letters from Italy keep coming, saying he is at the gates. For it is known that the evangelical cities in the empire are being tested under the pretext of the Turkish war, to see if an opportunity can be seized to wage war against them. I wish that we do not abuse the grace given by the Lord, whatever the monarchs may attempt either against themselves or against us. I have written this so that I would not write nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with your family. If it is not too much trouble, inquire from M. Werner Steiner about the death of Schönbrunner, what it was like, I mean. Indeed, I hear things that I am amazed at.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 29, 1537.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his most venerable brother and lord.</p>
