      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard, etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, well-learned, dear friend. As we previously wrote to you regarding a learned man, Doctor Jacob Andreae, pastor in Göppingen, how he, out of Christian zeal, wishes to assist in achieving a final unity and concord in the long-standing dispute over the Lord's Supper of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, we are sending you his booklet, which he has had printed for this purpose, to read. And as we wrote to you before, we are heartily willing to do whatever we can to promote a resolution and removal of this ongoing dispute. We did not want to withhold this gracious intention from you. May the Almighty keep you.</p>
      <p>Dated in Mömpelgard, the 27th of March, in the year 1557. G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
