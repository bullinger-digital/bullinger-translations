      <p>Greetings. I thank you, most kind Bullinger, for your benevolence towards me, by which you have deigned to share not only yourself but also your most cherished treasures, namely the books written by you or rather offered to your church, with me. I would not have dared to hope, even in a dream, that such a treasure would be shared with me, had I not previously experienced your kindness towards all the pious.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, your prompt kindness, indeed offered through him to all of us, has emboldened my fellow ministers, especially our Jacob. For this reason, I give you infinite thanks, which I would undoubtedly return if it were within my power. Therefore, I am sending back what you gave concerning the prophet Zechariah, which I would have returned long ago if a reliable courier had been available; for you do not wish, nor is it unjust, that these be sent back with all drivers, lest they be lost through their negligence.</p>
      <p>I would indeed wish for those things which you have now dictated in a sermon on the Epistle to the Romans; for it has also been started by us. (See my audacity), if you could spare them for a few days; but the choice of this matter is entirely up to you. For you could very easily blunt my audacity with these words, that you have already given enough and firm and clear on that epistle, which I can use as I wish.</p>
      <p>But I know that the pious grow in grace, virtue, and knowledge day by day; I do not doubt, therefore, that the latest are more solid than the previous ones, however solid they may be. We have nothing new, except that our envoy has returned from France with a golden chain (formerly these were the popular chains of the Arabs; now we too are bound by them, with our freedom prostituted, not unwillingly, but willingly) with great congratulations [Greek] of himself, to our great sorrow. For I testify to God that it was not our fault that the safety and freedom of the homeland are not preserved with us. You, with all the brothers, pray to the Lord for us, that He may have mercy on our church. Meanwhile, we wish you and all yours to be safe. Lingkius and Grubell[ius] greet you. Also, convey my most dutiful greetings to D. Theodor, D. Pellicanus, D. Gualtherus, and all the pious.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Schaffhausen, 4th day before the Kalends of November, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
