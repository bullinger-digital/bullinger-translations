      <p>About Polish affairs, written by a certain Pole on August 24, 1550.</p>
      <p>Two assemblies of our Polish kingdom have already been held under this new king of ours; but just as the first had a tragic outcome, so the latter almost had a comic one. For as the previous assembly ended with angry spirits, so in the latter, with the king prevailing with great moderation of spirit, the nobles reconciled with him and he with them. Moreover, many enmities and rivalries had arisen among the leading men because of the king's marriage; but all these were quelled and buried in this assembly. In the matter of religion, although we did not achieve everything we wanted, some steps were made towards better and greater hopes. In this part, there were great contentions with the bishops, which lasted for several weeks. The nobility presented the matter of religion against the bishops before the king. The delegates were prudent and eloquent men. First, they explained the true meaning of the gospel, then the errors conflicting with the gospel, the most obvious errors of the papists, whom they called (with honor to chaste ears) priapists. They added to all this the well-known and usual impious and unlearned sermons of priests in the Polish kingdom, which they showed to be in conflict with the word of God. When the bishops responded to these objections learnedly and steadfastly, the nobles said much about the ignorance and lack of charity of the bishops, etc. In summary: never before has the nobility spoken so sharply and clearly with the bishops about true and false religion as in this public assembly of the kingdom. The bishops have not understood the danger until now, as they are beginning to feel it, when they see and hear openly and in person the nobility burning with great zeal for piety and the gospel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the bishops despair of their power and write to the Roman pontiff, so that with his counsel, prudence, and authority, he may counteract the defection of such a great kingdom, and that promptly, before the future assemblies are held. For the matter of religion, at the request and supplication of the bishops, has been suspended, but in such a way that henceforth the bishops alone may not assume the judgment of heretics, that is, Lutherans, nor think it pertains to them alone; but that such judgments be referred to the general assemblies. The king must hold an assembly before the end of the year 1551, and that for the matter of religion; which he promised to do with letters given under his seal and hand, so that the assemblies may not be prolonged further by the cunning of the bishops. The works of Zwingli and Calvin are bought and read in Poland with great applause. This was reported to me by someone through whose hands hundreds of copies were sold at the kingdom's assembly, etc.</p>
      <p>About English affairs, written in London, England, on August 30, 1550.</p>
      <p>The most reverend N. bishop ordered me to write this to you. The most serene king, as you know, assigned the bishopric of Gloucester to Mr. John Hooper, which he rejected in every way, unless he could occupy it without any appearance of papist superstition. The king here orders Hooper to be secure. Meanwhile, a contention arises between him and some other bishops about the form of the oath. For they demand that he swear by God, by the saints, and by the holy gospels of God; he resists in every way. It came to the king's council and even into the presence of the king himself. Here Hooper prevailed with many reasons and arguments, that oaths should be taken by the invocation of the divine name alone. Therefore, the king himself rose and with his own hand struck out the names of the saints from the episcopal book, ordering that the oath be taken by the name of the eternal God alone. This was done on July 20.</p>
      <p>After this, a new contention arises about the form of inauguration or consecration. Some bishops recently composed it in parliament, not differing much from the papist form. Therefore, Hooper obtains letters from the king, that he be inaugurated without any superstition. When he presented these to the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was referred to the Bishop of London. Here he denies that he will initiate anyone against the common form of consecration. Therefore, the matter is again referred to the king and the senators; this was done on July 30. From that day, nothing has yet been decided, with the parties skirmishing in private writings and conversations. Blessed be God, who has given our kingdom a most prudent king and most wise princes, even more learned than the learned. When the matter has been brought to the desired end, he will write everything to you in detail. By the king's piety and the help of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other pious men, a church of the Augustinians in London has been given to exiles and foreigners, French and Germans, and ministers have been provided by the king's munificence, who preach and administer the sacraments in it according to apostolic doctrine. Martin Micronius is one of the ministers. The most illustrious Mr. John a Lasco is the superintendent of this church, and it is remarkable how dear this man is to the king and princes. Give thanks to God with us. For the matter of piety is proceeding beautifully.</p>
      <p>But hear a new thing: the Emperor, who most cruelly persecutes Christ in the Belgian Gaul (for many of the faithful fleeing to us in England), secretly sent Mr. Scepperus, one of his chief counselors, to England in July, to take with him the king's eldest sister Mary, from Catherine of Spain. But this matter, by divine benefit, was both revealed and prevented.</p>
      <p>About Italian affairs, written by N. Italians from Italy in September 1550.</p>
      <p>The Pope has prepared a persecution against the members of Christ, such as Italy has not felt in these 30 years, nor, I think, any province. Many brothers are invited to renunciation, which these demons call repentance. They cruelly rage against the steadfast, defame, drag them into prisons, proscribe, exile, banish to galleys, and even use executioners. Recently, one of the brothers was hanged at Piacenza; but he departed to the Lord with such faith and joy, that they say more fruit will come from the death of one than from many books and sermons. Cardinal Sfondratus died at Cremona in the very heat of the persecution he had prepared against that church. He was the bishop of that city and one of the three general inquisitors. He was immediately succeeded by Cardinal Carpensis, a man of noble birth, wealth, and authority among those devils. The task has been given to abbots, priors, and prelates residing at the borders of Italy, to guard the borders well, lest anyone escape by flight. For public sermons, they openly boast that a council will soon be held, into which no one will be admitted unless united in faith with the pontiff. They add that Lutherans will be rejected unless they say they come to the council to seek pardon. Meanwhile, many promises are made at Augsburg to the princes, especially that they wish, as far as they can, for all to attend the council. But you know in what sense they use the word attend.</p>
      <p>About Saxon and Brunswick affairs, I have nothing certain. Friends write nothing, although I have received several letters from Wittenberg; but the last ones were written on August 27. Those returning from the fairs report that the duke has suffered no defeat, but has fought fiercely in the siege. Some affirm that he has suffered a defeat. But they say the suburbs and the whole field have been devastated, the camps have been moved, and the siege lifted by the duke, etc. If you have anything certain, please share it.</p>
