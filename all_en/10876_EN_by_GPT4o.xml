    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to a longer absence, he has not written earlier; because the lot fell on [Peter] Kunz this time, he does not have to accompany [Simon] Sulzer to Yverdon. He is in great concern due to the involvement of the Swiss Confederates in France's war against Emperor [Charles V.] and considers his departure from Bern unavoidable; he requests to be called back to the hospital or to a rural community in Zurich, and laments the danger threatening the fatherland.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>That I write to you less promptly, dearest brothers, as we almost all tend to do, I truly blame on my occupations. For I have not been at home for almost three whole weeks. And today I would have had to go to Yverdon, if the lot had not fallen on Kunz, who went there with Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as far as the Swiss Confederates' expedition against the Emperor in France is concerned, the evil that I see threatening not only the Swiss Republic but also our Christ and His gospel cannot be lamented enough. Certainly, do not doubt, brothers, a great calamity awaits us, so great that it cannot be remedied. There is no longer any place for healing. No one accepts the most beneficial remedy. For anyone who does not know how to flatter is borne with great impatience by some. In short: No more health remains - I tell you, I say to you alone -, as the prophet speaks, from the sole of the foot to the top of the head. Therefore, whether I want to or not, I must once and for all leave here and abandon this church. And certainly, I tell you, not a day - what do I say? - not even an hour passes without me anxiously and solicitously consulting what I should do. But what to do, I simply do not find. Therefore, I beseech you by Christ, take care to either call me back home to this hospital duty of mine or to any church in the countryside. Oh, the delightful youth and cohort of the Zurichers setting out for the French camp! I certainly seem to see either the reward of the princes and indeed the return of all immodesty's Lerna and filth or war, and that a calamitous one. Choose which you prefer, and you will experience the very ruin of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 6, year 36.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all the brothers.</p>
      <p>C. Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent lords and men, Leo and Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastics of Zurich, his dearest brothers.</p>
