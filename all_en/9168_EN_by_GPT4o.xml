      <p>God be with us, beloved son, your letter and my letters have reached me well, and as you desire that I share with you the latest news that has come to me since, I have not received a single letter, so I cannot write anything to you. I have not yet heard of the king's death; I have heard that the king's people have been defeated; whether it is true, we will hear later.</p>
      <p>Bellieure's speech, which he delivered in Baden before the 13 Cantons, is printed; for the people understand their cause to be printed; they think it will not go further than God wills. I have otherwise, before I knew of the printed speech, answered Bellieure's letter to me. I have also completed my book on the persecutions of the Christian church; whether it can be printed, I do not know.</p>
      <p>I am quite surprised that I have not received a reply to my letter to Mr. Hans Conrad Ulmer in Schaffhausen. I have sent a lot of money there these days.</p>
      <p>Hans Heinrich Lochman to Geneva, the poor exiles from France; Chur alone has sent me 122 florins. I thank you sincerely for your hare and veal, and I will also send you something in due time. Greet Susanna and the children for me; all my people greet you all. Dr. Burgower sends his sincere greetings. When I have something new, I will send it to you. I will inform you of the letters I have received from Glarus at another time and let you read them. I have letters from Heidelberg, dated December 21, but nothing special, except that Dr. Erastus has become rector and that Sylvanus is to be brought to justice before Christmas. Not a drop of good news from the Netherlands. The imperial envoys have left Poland without hope; the king is to be set for pacification; may God grant a good one; they consider the Muscovite. In 7 days, an Englishman will come here, saying all is well, and that the queen is brave. May God strengthen her and protect you.</p>
      <p>Dated in haste amidst strong sneezing and headache, etc. January 15, 1573.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
