      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Savior Christ.</p>
      <p>The envoy from Magdeburg has reached us, equipped with your commendatory letters; to whom we indeed offered our assistance in his first journey and, as much as is in our power, we turned every stone so that some help might be provided to that church through our efforts. He was received quite honorably by our council; yet, he took nothing with him back to his homeland except words. We delayed the matter for a few days, waiting to see what our council would decide; when we saw the matter being postponed, we approached them, reminding them that it is an act of Christian charity and the duty of a pious magistrate to assist the distressed brethren, meanwhile praying that they might allow gatherings in the wine presses during the upcoming grape harvest, and likewise in our fields for the grain, which could then be easily converted into money and sent to the people of Magdeburg. The council deferred the entire matter to future days; we ourselves learned through some trusted sources that in this matter they were dependent on the decision of your most honorable council, and they would also see what your church would decide on this matter. The decree of the council was sent to us in these terms: "My gracious lords, the mayor and council have decided regarding the people of Magdeburg that no wine shall be collected for them in the presses; the lords, the preachers, may, if they wish, exhort the people from the pulpits, if they want to give something to the people of Magdeburg for God's sake, they may hand it over to the preachers, and it will be sent to the people of Magdeburg." Therefore, since we have understood that they will see what your most honorable magistrate will decide, and will adjust their plans according to the decision of your council, it seemed appropriate for us to consult you on this matter, since we have so far observed your readiness both towards us and towards the church entrusted to our faith, not doubting that we will receive both a convenient and pious counsel from you; for it is not unknown to you what your council ultimately intends; for thus we have persuaded ourselves. Furthermore, the nature of our church is not unknown to you; therefore, you will be able to advise us most conveniently on how we might approach the matter.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor among us that the Emperor is in Strasbourg with 10 regiments of Landsknechts and fifteen hundred horsemen; and that he intends to invade the Margrave at the first opportunity. If you have any news and it is convenient for you amidst your many affairs, we pray that you share it with us. Greet all the brethren from us. My fellow ministers greet you. Hastily, in Schaffhausen, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
