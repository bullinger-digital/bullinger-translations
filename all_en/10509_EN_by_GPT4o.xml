    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for his extensive information. The people of Strasbourg wished that Myconius - to whom Capito wrote about this - would put an end to the discussion about the Lord's Supper in Basel, partly in the interest of unification efforts, and partly because of King Ferdinand I's threat of war against the "Sacramentarians." In Myconius' absence, Paul Phrygio and Wolfgang Wissenburg argued with Karlstadt about whether the terms "essentialiter" and "vere" were synonymous. Under Myconius' leadership, 17 Basel theologians then signed a confession of the Lord's Supper, which corresponds to their printed First Basel Confession, and sent both to Strasbourg, but have not yet received a proper response. Simon Grynaeus wrote from W端rttemberg after his encounter with the Strasbourg theologians that they agreed with his and the Basel doctrine of the Lord's Supper; but why do they not respond? Perhaps because they fear that Karlstadt, as a stubborn Wittenberger, will defend his old doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Myconius is outraged by Luther's derogatory remark on Konrad Pellikan's letter. Myconius recommends a relative. Christoph Froschauer will tell the news from W端rttemberg. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have done much more by writing back than I would have dared to ask. Therefore, I give you my eternal thanks. For now, I am not able to do anything else. If I could do anything else, I would do it just as willingly and readily. You should also impose something on me sometime. You will see that I am not at all unwilling to serve.</p>
      <p>I will say a few things about the people of Strasbourg. They have heard that there is a disagreement among us regarding the matter of the Eucharist. Therefore, Capito wrote to me many times to use my authority to quell the disagreement. He had reasons for a future concord among the churches of Germany and a war that King Ferdinand was planning against the so-called Sacramentarians. So, to prevent this disagreement from hindering concord and provoking Ferdinand against our heads in particular, he wanted this very thing removed. For he said that we alone in all of Germany were the ones who did not have Christ present in the supper, but only bare and empty signs. When I read this, I was astonished, as I was not aware of any disagreement. Upon inquiring more diligently into the matter, I found out that there had been some semblance of contention between Paul Phrygio and Wolfgang Wissenburg against Karlstadt about the words "essentialiter" and "vere," whether they meant the same or different things, and this happened while I was at the baths. Karlstadt did not want there to be a synonymy, while others wanted the opposite. So, I gathered all my brothers, seventeen in number. I inquired into the mind of each one. I found the utmost concord about the sacrament of the Eucharist, namely the one we had long professed before God and the world in the booklet published on it. We decided, therefore, to send a confession to the people of Strasbourg with the subscription of each of our names, so they would see that there was no disagreement, but the utmost concord. We added the published booklet, praying that if there was anything less consonant with the truth of God, they would point it out, although we thought nothing of the sort could be found even by their judgment. For if anything had been found, they would have pointed it out long ago, as befits brothers. You have how these things were done among us. So far, they have not responded to us about the matter. They only informed us that because of business, all the brothers could not be gathered. After this is done, they will respond. Meanwhile, Mr. Grynaeus was there on a journey to W端rttemberg. He conversed. He wrote back: "This is how the matter stands: That eternal, unshaken truth stands: The body of Christ is eaten by faith, but truly, but, as you last heard from me, essentially, that is, in such a way that the flesh and body of Christ the mediator is destined for our salvation. The brothers agree." This is what he said. From these words, I hear nothing else than what we have confessed and taught until now. I wonder, therefore, what the delay in responding means, although I seem to see what the matter is. They fear that Karlstadt, because of the stubbornness they attribute everywhere to the Wittenbergers, will try to defend his old opinion, which indeed seems to hold bare and empty signs in the Lord's Supper. But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding what you write to Bucer about Luther having said in response to Pellikan's letters that he is more learned than to be from such, etc.: What else do you think is underlying than that the people of Strasbourg are laboring in vain for concord, unless all the Lutherans are going to defect from their leader? Good God, what a shameful and proud statement! Indeed, I cannot detest it enough. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>To finally conclude: This man who delivers the letters, my brother-in-law, I commend to you, wherever your help may be needed, please. You are indeed doing for me what you do for him. I have entrusted the news from W端rttemberg to Froschauer to be told orally.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ and diligently care for the household entrusted to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 9, 1534.</p>
      <p>I wish Utinger, Theodor, Pellikan, and all to be safe in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the first ecclesiast of the people of Zurich, his esteemed brother and lord.</p>
