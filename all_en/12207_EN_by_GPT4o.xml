    <p xml:id="regest1">The [people of Schaffhausen] thank on behalf of the [Swiss] churches for the [“True Confession” or the “Orthodox Confession of the Zurich Church”], because Bullinger has defended the faith of the [Confederates], which is in harmony with the old creeds, so well against Luther's [“Short Confession”]. Everyone can see how Bullinger's moderation and piety surpass Luther's lies and slanders. - Bullinger should continue to exercise the patronage over the [Swiss] churches with such moderation as in the present book. - Bullinger's admonition has been well received. The people of Schaffhausen will heed it. - Calvin has been more successful in [advocating for the Waldensians] than Vogt dared to hope. The council [of Schaffhausen] has appointed an envoy [Alexander Peyger] for the meeting in Aarau. - Whatever Calvin dislikes about the [“Orthodox Confession of the Zurich Church”], Bullinger should be informed, as Calvin did not want to comment on it. - If Bullinger has written or preached anything against the pension[recipients], he should inform Vogt in writing. - Greetings from [Heinrich] Linggi, [Sebastian] Grübel; greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], [Kaspar] Megander, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>We thank you, most candid and learned Bullinger, not so much for your literary gift, which is otherwise most dear, especially as it was bestowed by the author himself, but in the name of our common churches, which you have so defended from Luther's furious slander, that you have not only presented to the whole world the reason for our faith and its comparison with the orthodox faith of the ancients, but you have also excellently protected the spirits of the deceased from the most importunate calumny of the man. It will certainly be evident to all, and even to Luther himself, unless he is completely devoid of reason, that the insults, lies, trifles, and blasphemy stand from him, while you have preferred to contend with modesty, piety, and the most just cause. It certainly befitted a theologian of such great name to spare the spirits of the deceased who had deserved well of the Christian republic, not to so foully besmirch innocent churches with such insults, to stand by the agreement and nurture the peace and concord not yet fully cemented, to have regard for the scandal. But forgetting all these things, boiling with infernal furies, he draws his dire pen against those expecting nothing of the sort from him, to the papists, the common enemies, almost rejoicing; to whom - to have supporters for his contention - he prefers to join even in those things which he had previously attacked in them, rather than to propagate the kingdom and glory of Christ with common votes with us.</p>
      <p>You, continue, most esteemed brother in the Lord, to excellently defend the patronage of the common churches once undertaken. Posterity will judge, I do not doubt, with a more just balance, what each one sought in this matter. Continue to contend with modesty, which you have never forgotten in this little book, against this unbridled monk. The Lord will be present to his cause and will never forsake his own. It seemed perhaps to Luther to become famous with insults and to acquire eternal memory for himself with blasphemies. Let him have it, let him glory in it; only let our modesty be known to all men.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what you so piously admonish us of our duty, you do a favor. With God's favor, we will take care that we do not seem to have been lacking anywhere.</p>
      <p>Calvin has succeeded better in the matter than I myself had hoped; for you know what kind of people we have to struggle with. The council has appointed an envoy to Aarau.</p>
      <p>If Calvin has anything in your little book that displeases him, I ask you to indicate it by letters; for we could not find out anything of the sort from him.</p>
      <p>There is one thing I would like to ask you: I do not doubt that you have either collected or preached something against these bloodthirsty pensions; if you would make it available to me, you would do a most pleasing thing. May the Lord preserve you long unharmed for his church. My fellow ministers Linggius and Grübelius greet you. You will greet in my name Theodor, Megander, Pellican, Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Schaffhausen, on the day of the Lord's Ascension in the year 1545 from the birth of Christ. Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and lord in Christ, to be respected. In Zurich.</p>
