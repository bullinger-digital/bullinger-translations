    <p xml:id="regest1">Assumes responsibility for the designation of Vadian as mayor in the title [of the "Aphorisms"] as well as for the epigram [by Georg] Binder [prefixed to this work]. Myconius is confident regarding the concord on the Lord's Supper; Bullinger has heard that Bern has taken a position in line with Zurich and, like Schaffhausen, is ready for an agreement. Urges Vadian to participate in the upcoming meeting and asks him to answer the question posed to him [about the nature of the body of Christ] beforehand. Froschauer will forward [Vadian's] books and letters. In Zurich, people are pleased with the success of the St. Gallen marksmen. Thanks for the news about the war in France. Utinger has died.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>If there is any fault in the title of your work, my dear Vadian, you will attribute it to me. For it was at the urging of Froschauer that I made the title. I wanted to show other magistrates what kind of consul the city of Switzerland, a nation of peasants, has, which some people praise so highly. I wanted to encourage other magistrates by your example to attempt similar things. Above all, I intended to attract readers with this new and unusual title, and so that everyone would see that the cause of truth has protectors even among the ranks of the republic. Therefore, I beg you to forgive me this error, if I have erred in any way.</p>
      <p>Then, regarding the hexastich you mentioned, it is not so much the yawning of Binder that frightens us all, but rather that he sang that poem at my urging, indeed that he could not correct it when advised by you; for Froschauer had taken away the copies. I had requested this from the man for your sake, indeed for the sake of honor. He, being somewhat unwell and as if forgetful of himself, poured out a foolish poem. But what is done cannot be undone. I will be more prudent in the future.</p>
      <p>On August 31, Myconius writes to Theodor and me in these words: "The aim of the matter seems to be this: Christ is entirely consumed by faith, as faith can consume. I gather one thing, that concord cannot be hindered except by the wickedness of affections." This is from Myconius. I also hear that the people of Bern have responded; however, I do not know what they have replied to the people of Basel. They say their response does not differ from ours. You, however, will ensure that you are present at the upcoming and announced meeting on September 24. But before we meet, I ask you for a response to the question posed.</p>
      <p>Froschauer will faithfully take care of the copies with the letters.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen has great favor (happiness) and goodwill in Zurich. The second ox follows the first. Everyone praises you before men, and everyone thinks it signifies much good, and that we owe you good. Would to God that the marksmen had been more numerous.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed Vadian.</p>
      <p>I thank you for what you have explained about the Gallic war; I anxiously await the rest.</p>
      <p>September 8, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Utinger, a most excellent man, has passed away to the Lord and instructed me to bid you farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
