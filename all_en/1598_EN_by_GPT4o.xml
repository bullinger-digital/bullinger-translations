      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned Bullinger. I have nothing to write at the moment except for the recent events. At St. Gallen, many Landgrave and French cavalry have occupied the pass. The imperial forces moved there by night, intending to attack in the morning, but they were poorly received and lost many men; thus, they withdrew again. The Count of Rhine plundered a village called Sol in the Wilertal, which he had just bought, a large village with wealthy people. Also, he burned a village belonging to the Lord of Rappoltstein; this lord fled to Breisach with all his goods. The people of Dann have placed about 500 men in their city, thinking that Schertlin wants to move into Lorraine and thus hinder him. But no one knows yet where he intends to go. Many soldiers are imprisoned in a cellar in Ensisheim like animals, although I have not yet heard that they have killed anyone. The Duke of Mecklenburg, both the old and the young, came to us on March 13.</p>
      <p>It is surprising how they could escape the hands of Ferdinand's men, who have placed guards so diligently in every corner.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have sent their ministers to the council and say that Philipp is waiting for them in Augsburg. Do not worry about the booklets you requested; I will ensure you have them shortly. Farewell again and again. Basel, March 16, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Gwalther most respectfully on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mecardus, formerly a preacher in Augsburg, was called and chosen by Lord Schertlin to be a military preacher.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent pastor of the church in Zurich, his own.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
