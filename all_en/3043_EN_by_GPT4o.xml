      <p>Greetings. I received your letter through Geldrius, who, as he has been recommended to you by learned men and by you to me, seems to be endowed with a certain remarkable nobility and piety; therefore, I will diligently seek an opportunity to assist him. Furthermore, regarding the struggles and disturbances of Dr. Philipp, I certainly feel sorrow; for this distinguished servant of Christ was worthy of peace and tranquility, so that he could devote himself to better matters; I also dislike the old and most harmful disease of continually stirring up new conflicts and the license to condemn anyone. There is enough and more than enough scandal in the church, and too much has been allowed for bitter and hateful accusations. But the Lord is the one who alone calms souls; let us pray to Him to grant us holy unanimity in Him.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Neapolitan or Roman war, which you write about so diligently, I am very grateful. The great beast is giving birth to a monster and is striving with a double arm, French and Venetian, but both are of flesh and therefore not at all firm. Our confederates, as I see, persistently urge their deity and will not cease until they either cause harm or are restrained by the hand of the Lord. I also hear that the Bavarian is as embittered as ever, having recently driven an excellent minister of Christ into exile because he administered the Eucharist according to the institution of Christ. In the diets, they vehemently urge, and above all, the princes, that bishops and other prelates be allowed to be married without harm to their status. The three archbishop electors oppose this excessively; but the Austrian provinces repeat their old demand, urgently and earnestly pleading that they be allowed to enjoy the preaching of the gospel and the legitimate use of the sacraments. In the transalpine Allobroges, there are more than ten thousand Christians who completely reflect the image of the early church with holy innocence and minds prepared for extreme punishments. For when the French king recently commanded the denial of the Christian religion, unless they wanted to risk their lives at once, they all unanimously offered themselves to death. Moved by this constancy, the royal prelate himself has so far refrained from bloodshed and, as much as he can, dissuades the king from his instituted cruelty. They have ten ministers, singular instruments of Christ, and they demand more, whom I wish they may find, resigned to the will of the Lord with equal piety and burning with necessary zeal.</p>
      <p>You can return the book of Marsilius of Padua, if you wish, to Peter Mechlin, the bookseller, or to me. I am sending the booklet of Philipp, which the bookseller, who has much commerce with Froschauer, attributes to you. I am sending the wisdom or rather the Bavarian blasphemies, which I wish you to return at the first opportunity after reading, because I received them with the condition that I restore them.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, November 10, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>I wrote very busy and burdened with a headache.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
