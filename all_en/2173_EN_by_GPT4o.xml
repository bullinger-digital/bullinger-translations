      <p>S. P. Most illustrious doctor and pastor of the church, I have indeed written familiarly about my private affairs to your excellence, who is occupied with great and serious matters; but fearing much offense, I omitted many things. But now something more serious has arisen, which I do not want to keep from you.</p>
      <p>It is a small matter that in this school, not only juridical but also theological, I found many papists both in number and authority; it is less that they have long tried to exclude me (especially after I openly declared my zeal against the papacy in my first and solemn speech on December 18, and expressed my desire to restore the civil and imperial laws, which have been inclined and affected with unworthy insults by the papists, to their splendor, which I have begun and continued to do boldly and diligently). Some fear that their papacy, others that their glory, would be diminished by my admission.</p>
      <p>These things are easier to disregard. Now, I have been accustomed not to withdraw from, but to openly communicate in all Christian churches, even when I first arrived in Basel, soon to return to France with danger. Therefore, being here, I wanted, as is fitting and as I am accustomed, first to address those to whom it pertains, Mr. Iseman, the first minister of this church, when I wished to approach him, he came of his own accord on the last day of January. I knew why they do not admit your people, but I wanted to move every stone to begin to remove or at least soften that abominable schism. At the beginning, I candidly and openly narrated what I had done for a year and a half in five or six Christian churches, which I held sacred; I desired to communicate here in the same way, but I did not want to rashly intrude without first having my faith exposed and approved.</p>
      <p>When he hesitated, I added that I was amazed at this schism, about which I had recently heard from the rector, a wise and easy-going theologian, whom I thought disliked the schism, and that I was very distressed by it and felt that the question of the mode of the presence of Christ's body in the sacrament was not so important that the church could or should be divided over it, that agreement in the words of the Lord and the main doctrine, that Christ was sacrificed for us, is our expiation, our perfection, that he truly communicates his body and blood to us as true, life-giving, and saving food for the soul, is sufficient. But about the mode of presence, whether physically and materially, or truly spiritually, there should be no fighting, so that it may be allowed for learned and serious men, exercised in sacred letters and church history, to discuss this soberly and peacefully, but neither should be demanded from the church or the communicating people, especially since the primitive church and thereafter never demanded it, and those new teachers are the ones who so stubbornly demand it against that of James 3 and more expressly to the Philippians 3, where it is said, however, in what we have attained, let us proceed by the same rule, that we may be concordant. And it is altogether impious and a most serious crime to divide the church over this. He said: "Not us, but they divide." But I said: "Indeed, you; for I know that they would gladly and eagerly admit you, even retaining your opinion about material presence and eating, without, however, the schism's κακοζηλία (evil zeal) and without contempt and condemnation of others, which you were the first of all to refuse actively and passively, and you persist as the last. Therefore, you are the sole authors and defenders of this schism." However, I excepted the article on ubiquity, which I said was not only false but also monstrous and rightly not to be endured, nor otherwise invented and introduced except to support hyperboles with a newly concocted commentary, which commentary it is certain the universal church not only did not know but also always felt the contrary. When I had said these things, he began not to argue about the schism, but about material presence, which I easily, if not dissolved, at least so elevated that it could not be solidly founded on these. Then I again began to agitate the schism, he on the other hand also defended ubiquity and that everything is heaven to God. When I pressed him to teach me this new dogma he had brought forth by the manifest word of God, after many things were brought up, to which I easily responded, he said he had one greater, which was the chief foundation. I asked him to bring it forth; he said: "He who descended is the same also who ascended above all the heavens." Then I: "Isn't that Ephesians 4, to fill all things?" He agreed. Here I said the whole church had always understood that to mean that all prophecies about him would be fulfilled, and that this is the true sense and consistent with the letter of the said place and all other parts of sacred scripture, and that I understand it so, asking him to prove by another place of scripture that this place should be understood according to this new dogma. When he could not bring it forth and yet persisted, I asked with what face he dared to condemn so many holy churches, Lausanne, Geneva, Neuchâtel, Basel, and our prince's Montbéliard. He (without, however, a laugh, but with a simple sign of confidence smiling) said: "Not only those, but also all, if otherwise." Here the night after the sixth hour from before the third separated us. I followed him to the door always exhorting to remove the schism, and he also departed very amicably. But on the next Sunday, when the Lord's Supper was celebrated, I did not want to communicate, because I could not, lest I seem to condemn the holy churches with which I communicated and adhere to the schism. Indeed, even if invited, I would not want to, unless he declared before two suitable witnesses that he does not condemn the said churches for this reason and consequently departs from the schism. I had asked him not to make it public; but on the following day, February 1, in the morning, it was already spread among the scholars, and to my host Mr. Christoph Ehem, an Augsburg professor of philosophy, from various places rumors were announced saying that I was a Zwinglian and striving to draw everyone to me and had begun with the head, that is, the principal minister.</p>
      <p>Many said: "It is strange that all these ingenious heads fall into that (i.e., Zwingli's) opinion. Friends warned that the matter would be brought to the prince's ears, and that I might be troubled. I replied that I was ready to give an account and would not abandon the truth, even if I had to turn alone again; but that I would attack the schism (appropriately and opportunely). If I did not yield to so many enemies of the truth in France, I would not yield to a few stubborn ones, insofar as they at least support the schism, even if more rise up. Therefore, I despised what they said, that the papists had conspired with the Lutherans to exclude me, which I do not yet think is true nor do I care whatever it is. Two other things also happened on the last day of January during the promotion of 13 masters of the liberal arts. Invited, I sat second to the most learned and pious Mr. Vergerius, when opposite Gebhard (who reads the 6th of the decretals here) the pro-chancellor of Hieronymus Cadellarius... the prefect papist, as the academy wanted to defend in the letters of Ferdinand, declared that he would promote them by the apostolic authority delegated to him. Mr. Vergerius began to complain to me. I slightly shook my garment and extended my right arm. It was clear to everyone that we disagreed and opposed that apostolic (that is, papist) authority. The pro-chancellor continued (seeing this), but in the conclusion, he did not expressly repeat the word apostolic. Then at lunch, Gebhard sat with the rector and two from the prince's court beside us. Where openly Mr. Vergerius asked me what I thought about the promotion recently made by apostolic authority. I replied that it was against the gospel, an impious and condemned thing, because it was understood about the pope and thus about the authority of the antichrist. Again he asked if I considered the pope the antichrist. I replied openly. Then Vergerius, turning to Gebhard, said: "So you promoted them by the authority of the antichrist?" He tried in vain to defend himself; he objected to me with laws, which I turned back, so that he was forced to be silent; he would have wished to be far away from the lunch. Qu[...] in my next lecture [...], what had been said by authority I rejected, teaching that the school was older than the pope [...] and not founded by him, but polluted and thoroughly to be cleansed. But concerning the matter of the schism, it is more your interest and that of your holy church than mine. In which also with you so many times to the best memory of Mr. Zwingli, you most excellent doctor and most faithful pastor [...] I ask by Christ, the prince of pastors, that you help, not me, but the cause, with your counsel and authority. For if I can do anything (even with my own danger) to disturb this schism, I will not refuse, but I will not rashly proceed further, unless I see that it promotes the matter and peace of the church, not by my own, but by the counsel of good men and especially yours. In the meantime, it is not expedient (as you know) to make these things public, but to communicate them to good, learned, and prudent men (of whom many are with you), lest perhaps they mock that I came here instructed by design, when at the beginning I had thought nothing of this.</p>
      <p>It is dreadful how scandalous this cursed schism is, especially after England defected to the pope, so that the papists triumph, mocking us as discordant, not being disciples of Christ, but of sects and finally to be crushed or scattered. How much gain, how much confusion would accrue to the adversaries if the schism were removed. I ask again and all of yours: Come on, act. In the meantime, while I pursue the ordinary of the Emperor and for the subject matter of book 1, I attack the papacy, restoring ecclesiastical laws to their light, the papists complain that I, professing law, expound theology and histories, which they (but in vain) try to turn away my listeners, some observing Lent even privately teach with emulation of me. However, I did not want to change the form of teaching I had begun, but voluntarily took up another purely juridical on the obligations of words [...] and the matter of divisible and indivisible at the same time at the 3rd hour in the afternoon to be interpreted not without new envy; for the greater part of the audience is content with my two lectures and omits the rest. The prince is about to come here shortly and stay for a long time (which I rejoice), because he is demolishing the castle in Stuttgart to renew it. The Landgrave of Hesse is my friend [...] but if it seems good to you that I should exhort to remove the schism, I will do so. Peace and grace of God be with you and your church. Farewell and I also commend myself to the reverend father Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Zwingli, your son-in-law, Mr. Lavater, and others, especially and chiefly the cause. Tübingen, February 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted jurist of France and Germany and first ordinary of laws in Tübingen, Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful ecclesiastic and doctor of the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich. Zürich.</p>
      <p>You know why I partly wrote by my own hand, since I do not yet have a home, therefore I am forced to lack domestic scribes, I use chance ones. In England, the nobles and the people do not want to admit the Spaniard and want to expel the mass, as a serious Augsburg patrician wrote.</p>
      <p>Even if the enemies burst, on the next Monday the whole academy gathered in the great schools, I will have a solemn speech against the theologasters and canonists for the true theology of the word of God restored and jurisprudence to be cleansed and about their and the Christian prince's and minister's conference, power, and office, which when printed I will send a copy to you.</p>
      <p>Having written these, on the morning of February 18, the Duke of Württemberg sent me a copy of Henry's letters, in which he gives a refusal to five German princes, who had asked that he allow his wife with children and goods to come to me, their counselor, claiming that it was against the tranquility of his kingdom. But the fault was first of the duke's envoy, who contrary to my advice gave the princes' letters to the constable enemy, who after 12 days frustrated, gave such a response in favor of the cardinals, who fear they will be overthrown and France stirred up again by my writings, if it is free for me to write with the family received, which they think is a hostage of silence, which they could not redeem from me with any rewards or threats. On the same day, I received most loving letters from Wilhelm, the Landgrave, concerned about me and the outcome of the said embassy, to whom I will also write about all the above, so that with Ph. Melanchthon he may be present for the cause.</p>
      <p>For on the same day late at a dinner prepared for this by the adversaries in the presence of the duke's envoy, they tried to fish out from me, to convict and shake off Zwingli. But soon in the schism [...] I rendered them astonished and mute. Therefore, since they press with secret snares, I must not delay.</p>
