They will adhere to the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as they have presented it, contrary to rumors to the contrary; they ask him not to take action against supporters of this truth.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and lord, we are your willing servants, always ready to serve your princely grace.</p>
      <p>We have learned through good friends and brothers that our writing, along with the translated book of Bertram, has been published and only recently came to your princely grace's attention, although it was received with your grace's approval, pleasure, and special thanks. This has encouraged us to dare to send this present copy to your princely grace.</p>
      <p>We ask that your princely grace kindly receive this from us insignificant people and not believe the false words that, as we understand, have been spread about us, as if we had regretted the doctrine of the sacrament previously held and acknowledged in our last letter to your princely grace, and had adopted another way of speaking. For we will never speak differently from the words of Christ, "This is my body" [Lk 22, 19; 1Cor 11, 24], than the Lord himself, who immediately said, "Do this in remembrance of me" [ibid.], as also Tertullian, Ambrose, Augustine, and Chrysostom, and this Bertram, by figure. Thus, we here confess and teach nothing but the simple and ancient truth, asking your princely grace not to be incited by anyone to do anything cruel against the distinguished persons who might be attached to such truth under your princely grace's protection. We ask your princely grace to understand our good intentions, for we desire your grace's honor, welfare, and salvation. May God keep you long for His honor [...].</p>
