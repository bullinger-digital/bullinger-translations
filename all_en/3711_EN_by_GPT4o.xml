      <p>Since the person who delivers this has lingered here until now, I thought it necessary to touch upon certain matters, most illustrious men, which have now been concluded in the Vladislav convention by the brothers.</p>
      <p>Firstly, after settling disputes among the noble men and the ministers themselves, the nobles, who were present in great numbers, agreed to a certain liberal contribution for the establishment of schools, for supporting young men suitable for the ministry of the word, and for a special printing press. Then it was agreed by common vote that they would no longer contribute tithes to the papists to support their idolatry and impiety, as they could not do so with a clear conscience: This very thing they intend to propose at the next assembly of the kingdom. Thirdly, it was agreed by them that they would no longer marry their children to unbelievers. Lastly, it was also agreed that their subjects should not be burdened with greater obligations than the ancient laws of the land allow, namely that peasants who possess a full measure of land should work for their lords for two days each week, and those who possess half, for one day.</p>
      <p>There are many other things established, which there is no place to narrate now: but these are the ones that seem to be of greater importance. The rest is for the letter carrier.</p>
      <p>Lord Johannes Bonner, Baron of Balice and Castellan of Biecz, whom I recently recommended to you and urged you to write to, attended the convention, along with many other powerful men, all of whom submitted themselves to ecclesiastical discipline. I earnestly ask you to send him some letters now, to encourage him to act boldly, for much depends on him here. No less, indeed much more, depends on the illustrious Lord Stanislaus of Ostroróg, Castellan of Międzyrzecz, descended from an ancient ducal family: for he alone not insignificantly draws a greater part of all Greater Poland with him. Although he is more inclined towards Luther, I know that he holds Lord a Lasco, whose niece he married, in high regard: and your letters will be welcome to him. He himself indicated this to me, and that he would gladly reply.</p>
      <p>The most authoritative person throughout the entire kingdom is the most illustrious Lord Johannes Tarnowski, Castellan of Kraków and supreme captain of the kingdom's armies, who is most opposed to this mission of Cardinal Pisani, and most offended by the entire order of bishops: to whom you should certainly write now. For it is certain, as the most illustrious Lord a Lasco affirms, that your letters will be most welcome to him, and will greatly strengthen him, who alone (since he is the first to speak in the assembly) if he acts steadfastly, there is no doubt that all the rest will follow his opinion with hands and feet, especially if the noble envoys, whom they call terrestrial messengers, insist piously and steadfastly on their demands. For the greatest importance is placed on the envoys who represent the entire kingdom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will be worthwhile for you to write to those aforementioned men and lords, to prepare the minds of the nobles for the assembly with their authority. Do not hesitate, therefore, dearest brothers and most respected teachers, to expend some effort now in writing to the aforementioned three lords and indeed to all the nobility, who have now embraced the gospel of Christ the Lord, to insist on the unity of minds and faith, and that without any delay, as long delays seem to be entirely harmful. For it is certain that the assembly will not be prolonged under the arrival of this cardinal.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious Lord a Lasco is now somewhat better, but his health is not yet so confirmed that he can write much, so he earnestly asks you not to be offended by his silence. Farewell, most illustrious men and most respected brothers in the Lord, to whom I commend your ministry from the heart. Hastily near Kraków, and too tumultuously. 18th of September 1558.</p>
      <p>Please forgive the blots, for it was not possible to rewrite. Most devoted to your piety, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious Lord a Lasco sends you all his most affectionate greetings and diligently offers his services to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, the pastors of the churches of Zürich and Geneva, my most respected teachers and brothers, to be honored with perpetual observance.</p>
