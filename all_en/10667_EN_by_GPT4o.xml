    <p xml:id="regest1">Welcomes the intention of the people of Zurich to join forces with Basel and Bern to defend against the slanders spread mainly in Württemberg, but advises leaving the different church customs unmentioned. Little is to be expected in this matter from the Bernese envoys at the Diet in Baden, [Peter] Stürler and [Johannes] Pastor; Haller has more hope in the defense paper being prepared in Zurich. Has received another part of Bullinger's commentary on four Pauline letters. Complains about his hernia. Megander would have preferred if Rhellikan had been elected to the parish college instead of [Peter] Kunz. Asks Froschauer to bring him a book from Frankfurt. Melchior Volmar has been appointed as a jurist at the University of Tübingen.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Who could disapprove of your letter along with your counsel, dearest Heinrich, when they breathe nothing but what is beneficial not only for our cause but also for the entire Christian republic! I know that all foreign brothers approve of your apologetic initiative. Nevertheless, since the truth is so maligned under our name that among the Cherusci I hear nothing worse than Zwinglians, the Helvetic gospel, sacramentarians, it is entirely worthwhile for you, who can satisfy the world both learnedly and suitably, and no less modestly, or at least silence the slanderers, to reveal the doctrines and the rites of our churches. We differ in the number of holidays, the rite of celebrating the supper, and the angelic ringing, but since none of these are mentioned, as they are incidental to religion, indeed they contribute little to religion, it would be better to overlook them and allow each church its own freedom in these matters. It is also agreeable that everything should be discussed with the people of Basel and with us, not because we distrust your integrity and learning, but so that everything may be done with more unanimous consent.</p>
      <p>We have warned our senate about the slanders of Schnepf and people of his ilk. It has been decreed that our envoys, now gathered in Baden, should report to your people and other pious ones. But what can I say? The Bernese envoys are Stürler and Pastor, and you can well guess how much they care about the matter or how much they understand it. We will press your apology more strongly (where it has been agreed upon by all brothers) if it also seems to you to be relevant. Therefore, continue, and may what you have compiled be brought to us by a messenger. But if it seems otherwise, I will take care, as much as is in my power, of what the matter requires.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have received the remaining parts on Ephesians and the beginning of Philippians, and once they are composed, I will write to you with whatever judgment I can offer.</p>
      <p>Regarding my hernia, which worsens daily not in terms of pain but in size, I will write in the future. For I can hardly see the city gates, let alone go out.</p>
      <p>I fear discord among the symmists, since Megander is displeased with Kunz, but would have been pleased with Rhellikan, yet it seemed otherwise to the lord and the magistrate. I will take care, if I can, to pacify everything.</p>
      <p>I cannot find Ludovicus Vives' "On the Assistance of the Poor" anywhere. I beseech you to remind Froschauer to bring it from Frankfurt in my name.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell.</p>
      <p>August 17, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, if his own, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>At this hour, I have received news from Doctor Melchior Volmar that he has been called to Tübingen as a lecturer in civil law, as far as Greek is concerned.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind lord and brother.</p>
