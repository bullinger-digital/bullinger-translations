      <p>Greetings. By the grace of God, I have returned home safely and in good health from the baths. I informed you of this immediately upon my return in a letter, which included others to be given to Marcellus Theodoricus, which I hope you have received. Matters here remain in their former, lamentable state, which no one can endure patiently unless divinely aided or utterly impious. You undoubtedly know what recently happened in England. The envoy, who was there under the pretext of arranging a marriage, was able to influence the king's aides to conspire against the gospel. When the protector of the kingdom and the king noticed this, they fled with the king to a certain fortress. However, the counselors spread the rumor that the protector himself was holding the king captive, and therefore, his liberation was necessary. Hence, a large number of armed men gathered, and the fortress, into which the protector and the king had retreated, was besieged, although the traitors to the truth had no hope of capturing it. However, they managed so much with the king's guards and officials that they handed over the king and the protector into their hands. What change in affairs will follow from this is easy to judge. Woe to Bernardino, woe to Peter Martyr, Bucer, and other good men.</p>
      <p>I ask you to write to Basel to inquire whether the volumes of civil law called the Corpus Juris, which were printed a few years ago and most recently in Paris, are sold there, and at what price they are purchased. I will indeed need them to seek a livelihood, although by the grace of God, nothing has yet been lacking for me and mine.</p>
      <p>You are to send this letter along with the Psalter translated into German to Marcellus Theodoricus, as a promised little gift to him; I have indeed felt that this man is led by a singular affection towards me, just as I must confess that I owe him no less in return; therefore, let him be most commendable to you as well.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Lord Gualter, Gesner, Bibliander, Frisius, Wolfius, Zwingli, Pellicanus, and also to the exiled treasurer, as well as to the masters of the citizens, the chief scribe, and each individual to whom it is appropriate, and excuse my recent secret departure. Farewell, my dear man, and pray to the Lord for me and mine. October 29, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my beloved friend, to be delivered.</p>
