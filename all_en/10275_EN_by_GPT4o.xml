    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has not responded to his questions about the situation in Zurich. He has heard from Zurich that all those residents who do not want to purchase citizenship are being expelled from the city, and that Troger was in Zurich to advocate for the reintroduction of the pension system. The discussions on marital law issues should not be kept secret. Regarding Bullinger's letter No. 243: Myconius is not familiar with Bullinger's booklet "On the Shameless Outrage..." and requests its dispatch. Heinrich Lavater will probably not want to stay with Myconius if Otto Werdm√ºller does not remain in Basel. Bullinger should inquire further into the matter. All letters were delivered by Rhetus.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding your situation, which I had inquired about, you have not given a single word. I am concerned about what it might be. You either do not dare or you grieve over the injustice of many. Nevertheless, I will not remain silent about what I have heard in the meantime about your affairs. Firstly: All residents are to be expelled unless they purchase citizenship. This seems to be done with a plan of impiety for two reasons. For thus tyranny can more easily rage against the gospel and prevail. And good citizens are deprived of the help of daily labors, from which, moved by weariness, when they finally see everything is unfavorable, they almost despair with no business at all. Good God, what counsel is needed here and what prayers to God?</p>
      <p>Then it was certainly reported that Troger was in Zurich in recent days for no other reason than to secretly persuade a return to pensions. There is also a rumor born in Lucerne and some money has already been dispensed and received by some unknown person from Zurich. We would all rather perish than allow pensions to return. I know someone who has begun to openly dispute among your people that there is an old proverb in the Swiss that we are such that if we do not wage war abroad, we fight among ourselves. I would name this flatterer to you if I could safely do so. You bear a hard province, my Heinrich. You will incessantly invoke God to be present with you as an aid, if in any way these grave matters can be overcome. Moreover, see and consider the gravity of the matter already accomplished. Good men are called as if to consult on matrimonial matters. After they are present, it is not shameful to confess openly. Meanwhile, nothing was discussed by you on this matter. For vanity! You will consult with your people on how to counter such calamity.</p>
      <p>What I have planned, I will hold against the Bernese. Now I will contain myself until the time is right.</p>
      <p>Finally, regarding your letter. I am quite content with your response, but the booklet, which I also found with Zwingli, I have not seen nor do I find it here to purchase otherwise. What if you send it to the one who will pay?</p>
      <p>It is certainly pleasing, that last part in your letters about the taxes. Otherwise, the whole matter was reported to me. It would have made us completely stumble.</p>
      <p>Regarding Lavater, briefly consider this. If Otto remains, there is nothing I would say against it. If he does not remain, I do not doubt that neither he nor his father would want him to cohabit with me. It is otherwise in my wishes, indeed I would rejoice if I could somehow gratify Lavater's father. It will be yours to consult further on what should be done here. You have my mind.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord. Be strong. God will not abandon His own.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 20, 1533.</p>
      <p>O. M.</p>
      <p>All letters have been delivered by Rhetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest to him in the Lord, etc.</p>
