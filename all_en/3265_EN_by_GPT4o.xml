      <p>S. You may be eager to know what was done at the recent Diet of Chur, reverend father in Christ. Therefore, receive what I have known and explored; for regarding the rest, which are uncertain and about which I have no exact knowledge, I prefer to remain silent rather than write anything. The Frenchman obtained soldiers from the senate, which I could easily foresee would happen; however, the matter was carried out with great contention of opinions and sentiments. There were indeed those who advised differently, but they were fewer in number and votes. Whether the Frenchman will indeed summon our men to military service is doubted by many, and not without reason. The Frenchman requested no more than six banners; however, our people decreed an entire regiment, which, as our people calculate, completes the number of 3000, and the regiment was granted under no other condition than that it should join with the other Swiss and not be led further away than is permitted by the agreement and convention. The Frenchman will reluctantly incur such expenses.</p>
      <p>The pensioners are solely urging the cause, as Mr. Cognetus has reported to me.</p>
      <p>However the matter may turn out, it is certain that our people have not yet received any response from the king, and as far as I can see, the Frenchman is acting more leniently, and those who desire military service are bearing this delay most indignantly. The matter tends towards a point where it would be desirable for it to be resolved at some point, if it could be settled without tumult and popular sedition. However, I am less inclined towards this matter because I see that almost all the more powerful (and whom you would call the best men outside of this cause and who seem to want religion to be promoted slowly) are beholden to French gold. If the morsel were to be snatched from their mouths, it is to be feared that they might be worse disposed towards religion, which has now first taken root, as it were. Now, as long as Christ is preached, something must be conceded to the time; better things are hoped for daily. Certainly, the Rhaetian envoys, who presided over the recent Diet, demanded a crown from the royal envoy every single day as a reward, whereas previously they had only received a single florin each. The royal envoy took this auction so indignantly that he even attacked those who had approached to signify this matter more harshly; indeed, it is said that he was so affected that it was feared he might suffer something human and fall into apoplexy, and thus it was indeed departed. For he plainly rejected all the friendly admonitions by which our people attempted to appease him. Those who were sent reported the response to the frequent senate, which decreed that the exasperated envoy should be summoned and dealt with in person. Therefore, they are sent again to summon the envoy from his lodging to the council, to whom the envoy replied that he would by no means do such a significant injury to his king, whose envoy he is, as to follow them, whose interest it is to follow the king rather, nor could he sufficiently marvel at the insolence of our people, who do not hesitate to abuse the royal envoy so impudently for their own service. Our people took it very seriously that they were being mocked by the royal envoy and thus departed with the matter unresolved. Finally, the senate was compelled to deal with the envoy by letters, in which the demands were written down. Finally, when the envoy had somewhat relaxed his anger, they also agreed with him on the reward.</p>
      <p>The Swiss, who followed the papal side, were almost all miserably cut down and destroyed. The royal envoy affirmed to me that this is the case, and Consul Tscharner recited the entire matter to me, as it was conducted, based on letters sent to him from Italy. There is a town in Italy (the envoy calls it Paliano), which, when the pope had decided to fortify it, he sent the Swiss with Italian troops to support those who were at work. When they rashly advanced without order, they fell upon the enemy, who, having attacked them from ambush, first cut off all escape and flight with cavalry, then miserably slaughtered them by sending in about 1000 musketeers and pikemen. These are the very ones who, when passing through here, had fir branches instead of crests.</p>
      <p>The Colonna family is causing trouble for the pope, who, as Mr. Cognetus affirms, are almost waging war at the very gates of the Romans.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the pope's affairs seem to be in a tight spot. In Valtellina, the business of the gospel is proceeding beautifully, although some are unwilling and resisting (thus?), but in vain. I experience greater humanity and benevolence from our people every day, I have the consuls and senate most ready; all the citizens show singular humanity towards me. Even the adversaries, who come here from elsewhere, diligently attend the sermons, and there is good hope that they can gradually be softened; for they do not refuse to converse with me about certain articles when they have attended the sermons. May God deign to advance all our efforts to the glory of His name and the salvation of our souls. Farewell, reverend father, and if I write less accurately, forgive me.</p>
      <p>Give my very best regards to your most honorable wife, your dearest children, and your learned sons-in-law. Commend me to Mr. Gwalter and other good men.</p>
      <p>If it is not troublesome for you, share this letter with Mr. Collin, your father-in-law, to whom I could not write now due to my occupations.</p>
      <p>Farewell again in Christ.</p>
      <p>We are all well.</p>
      <p>Both consuls greet you, Mr. Cognetus, who I think will come to you soon, and Mr. Philippus, my colleague.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most honored patron.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
