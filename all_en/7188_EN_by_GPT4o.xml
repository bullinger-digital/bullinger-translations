      <p>S. D. Since I have found this reliable messenger, I could not refrain from writing, even though I have little to say, at least to give you the opportunity to respond to those things I sent to you in previous days. We live here by the grace of God quite happily and pray to the Lord to continue to bless us. Two days ago, hail damaged some areas in the part of the lake where the city is located, above the city; however, if the Lord spares us further, we would bear the loss more easily. We hear that the Bishop of Constance is planning grand things and is convening a council or provincial synod in Constance, and a great crowd of prelates will be present. Everyone wonders what this is and for what purpose it is being done. But those who know the acts of the Council of Trent understand that this is being done to reclaim episcopal rights and to restore the bishop throughout all of Switzerland, Swabia, and the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg, even invoking secular power. He will reclaim colleges, parishes, monasteries, and anything of this kind. Therefore, new wars will be upon us. These people want to appear as angels of peace; but in truth, they are trumpeters who call to arms, and indeed under the pretext of religion, they seek the oppression of our freedom. Therefore, the spirits of our people must be strengthened, and we must pray to the Lord without ceasing, that He, having mercy on us, may save us from evil. From the letters of friends, I understand that a Swiss legion is being led into Picardy to defend the borders of the French against Spanish incursions. The Spaniards are slowly descending into Belgium; for they do not trust, not even the governor, let alone the Belgian and German nobles; but they are also said to be skirmishing with plague and dysentery. May the Lord overturn wicked plans.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is bedridden with gout in Possenhofen, and I have not yet heard of confirmed truces with the Turks, which the Prince of Transylvania resists confirming. I hear that the marriage between the Englishwoman and Charles of Austria is concluded; however, there are those who doubt it. They say the Queen of Scots has been beheaded with the adulterer and the king's murderer. Otherwise, it is certain that in the kingdoms of England and Scotland, religion is safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Let us pray, my brother, to the Lord, that He may be with us perpetually. Greet Ganthner and Pontasella and encourage them to write sometime. Greet the councilors most kindly. Farewell. May the Lord bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 9th of August, in the year of our Lord 1567.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
