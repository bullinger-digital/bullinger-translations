      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you, etc. in advance. I received your letter via Leipzig. Since then, I have written from Augsburg and send it to you herewith. Others and I have noticed that the regular post has not arrived from Antwerp since September 13th. Similar reports come from Lyon. This correspondent informs me that both Electors of Cologne and Trier arrived on September 24th with 3000 horses in the camp of the Duke of Alba, so that the Duke of Alba, when the one from Holstein comes to him, who has arrived at Herzogenbusch, will have 12,000 horses, 40 companies of landsknechts, the prince 80 companies on foot, 9000 horses, so that no more will be added without a fight. Someone informed me that the one from Cologne has been captured by the prince. In summary, much is written and said, yet without foundation; as I have it, I share it with you, my honorable, dear sir. This correspondent reports in his letter that the garrison in Antwerp, the Walloons, are burdening the citizens, having to be provided with food and drink. The landsknechts are begging from one house to another. In summary, it is said that much is owed to all the troops; there is no money, the Albanians know of no money; the prince's troops are paid. May God the Lord grant what is good. If anything comes to me in the meantime, I will report to you first; likewise, I am also worthy. Our dear preachers, others, and I send you, Mr. Walther, and others friendly and dutiful greetings. To Mr. Treasurer Thoma, convey my willing service and greetings.</p>
      <p>Herewith, you are commended to the Almighty along with yours. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Hans Liner. To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the Christian church in Zurich, my honorable, beloved sir in Zurich.</p>
