      <p>To Lord Bullinger, most esteemed lord and patron, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Your letters, which you sent to me last, were most welcome to me. To respond to them briefly, I wish you to know that Mr. Peter from Bergamo has recovered; likewise, Mr. Travers and all other friends are well.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you write about my son, that he is like a son to you, and that he conducts himself in such a way that he will someday be a great joy to me, I gladly accept this happy omen from you, such a great man, as I am convinced that with your immense wisdom and precise judgment, you cannot err in any matter.</p>
      <p>However, whatever joy I will ever derive from my son, I will attribute it to God, the best and greatest, as the primary author, and then to my Lord Bullinger, and I will not be ungrateful for such a great benefit conferred not only on my son but also on me (as I am no less a participant in these benefits conferred on my son than he is). But you, most esteemed lord and patron, do not cease to deserve well of all, and may you receive from God himself, who alone can equal your merits towards all, the reward for your labors.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I do not absolve myself, even if I am unable to repay you for the benefits received, even in the smallest part, but I will strive so that you may find a grateful spirit in me towards you. I congratulate the boy, his parents, and indeed all of us, that he has been brought under your paternal care; for I hope it has happened that, having avoided all the dangers of Charybdis and the Syrtes, he has now come as if to a harbor. For I know how important it is to be educated from a young age in piety and integrity of morals by men of proven and exemplary holiness of life; for what is imbued in youth will remain, etc. Therefore, my excellent Lord Bullinger, do not cease to exercise your right over the boy, and I say, do not spare the rod, and I wish you to ensure that the other teachers who are in charge of the boy in school do the same, and I ask this again and again. My father, indeed a very dear friend to you, was most pleased that you have taken his boy into your house and under your protection, and he gives you the greatest thanks he can. And although he is most convinced that you will fulfill the duty of the best father towards our boys, nevertheless, he again commends them to you as earnestly as he can and sends his very best regards to you and your most honorable family. As for himself being grateful for the benefits bestowed on his son, I pledge myself as his surety. But enough about these matters.</p>
      <p>As for news, I have nothing certain to write; for although there is some talk of an attack by the Turks on certain Venetian galleys, it is reported so confusedly that I do not dare to inform you about it; but as soon as I learn anything more certain, I will let you know. Finally, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I will excuse myself with these words, so that if perhaps I do not send you any letters next month, you will not be angry with me; for the reason is that tomorrow I will go with my wife to the baths at Bormio, where I may remain hidden until the Easter festival. May God grant that this journey will be successful for us! Therefore, since the place will be more remote, so that I may not be able to write to you in the meantime, if I do not do so, you will still have me excused, although I will strive to send you some message even from the baths, if I ever have the opportunity.</p>
      <p>If our boys are in need of clothes or books or other necessary things, you will ensure they are provided, and if there is ever a need for money, you will let us know, and it will be sent immediately, as we have agreed. My son had reminded me that if I had a New Testament in Greek and Latin bound together, I should send it; but since I do not have it, I wish it to be purchased for him, if indeed he needs it. Enclosed with this letter are others addressed to Heinrich, the host at the Star in Rapperswil. I ask you to kindly ensure they are delivered to him, although they contain nothing else but to demand in my name 2 scudi from Captain Heinrich Ran, and if he finally collects them, to send them to my son. For those two scudi the same captain owes to my father in the name of one of his soldiers, etc. And I also ask you to let me know if I am being a nuisance to you; for I do this relying on your utmost kindness. But in the meantime, I also ask you to take it in good part that I write so confusedly and always longer than I thought I would; for when I write to you, I hardly know how to remove my hand from the paper. For my mind always longs to converse with you; for when I write, I seem to be with you entirely. Farewell, singular and most distinguished ornament and glory of Switzerland, and may our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you flourishing and unharmed for us, indeed for the whole of his church, for as long as possible! Please greet your most honorable wife and your whole family for me, and my wife also asks you to do the same in her name, and she has instructed me to send you her greatest greetings in her name. Once again, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>I have arranged that if any letters from you and my sons are brought here in my absence, they will be forwarded to me at the baths.</p>
      <p>Given at Samaden on the 8th of March, 1558. Please greet the entire assembly of men distinguished in learning and piety, especially the reverend lords Peter Martyr, Bernardino Ochino, and Rudolf Walther, to whom I also wish to be commended. The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis.</p>
