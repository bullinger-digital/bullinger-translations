      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter to you, dearest compater in the Lord, is Mr. Johannes Thomas Husinger, an envoy of the city of Magdeburg; he has matters to present before your council.</p>
      <p>I think there is no need for me to either explain or recommend his cause in writing; for he himself will explain everything in detail, not without your singular delight and eagerness to listen, and the cause itself of such an excellent city is in itself such that it is already highly recommended to all, not only to the lovers of the Gospel of Christ but also to the enthusiasts of German liberty.</p>
      <p>He has been received here both by the council and the citizens quite kindly and honorably; however, from Haller's letters, I believe, you will understand our intentions.</p>
      <p>My last writing composed for your favor, although it contains nothing that is not true in my judgment, I nevertheless ask that, with your prudence and vigilance, you carefully consider it and, as if it were your own, either correct or suppress it, according to what seems necessary. Briefly, I touched upon certain things in it that could have been explained more fully and supported more firmly; however, I thought it reasonable to deal with them briefly.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest compater. You will hear from this Magdeburg envoy about a certain singular and very large military expedition, if you inquire.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all yours. Bern, January 30, 1552. Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed compater.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
