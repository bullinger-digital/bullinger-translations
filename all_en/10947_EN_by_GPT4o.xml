      <p>When a few months ago in this year 1536, all pastors who did not have their sustenance completely secured complained in writing and most faithfully petitioned and admonished my gracious lords to consider them fatherly and according to necessity, Herr Dietrich, pastor in Horgen, did not complain. Not because he does not have needs, but because he was modestly ashamed and did not want to burden my lords. However, since honorable persons and people who have a good opinion of his character indicate that he indeed needs help and improvement, as he has fallen into poverty due to children, and also sits on a busy road and has many incidents of robbery, I have been moved by the same to present (lay out) this matter to those appointed over these issues. And I ask you, my gracious, dear lords, to have this pious, honest man recommended to you. For he is faithful in all ways and worthy to be helped.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's obedient</p>

      <p>Concerning Herr Dietrich of Horgen.</p>
