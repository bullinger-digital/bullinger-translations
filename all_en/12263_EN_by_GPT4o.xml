    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich has read both Bullinger's letter to the [Augsburg] council [above No. 2208] and Bullinger's letter addressed to him [not received]. Regarding [the appointment] of Erb [to Augsburg], it remains to be seen what the young [Markus Wüst] will report; in the meantime, the [Augsburg] council thanks Bullinger for his efforts. - That Gessner and Froschauer think so honorably of Frölich is due to their decency. Frölich would have liked to speak with them more, but they departed unexpectedly. It is no wonder that [Anton] Fugger, a strict Papist, and the pious Gessner did not agree on an appointment. - Frölich is not aware that Luther has written something against the [Zurichers] again. He only knows the [„Kurtz bekentnis“], which Bullinger [answered so excellently with the „Warhafften Bekanntnuß“]. Should a new writing of Luther's appear in [Augsburg], where Luther also has followers, Frölich would immediately send it to Bullinger. - The Diet [at Worms] has been broken off, to the mockery of the Emperor and the Imperial Estates, for it produced nothing but tricks, which were particularly aimed at making the not particularly harmonious Imperial Estates even more discordant. Neither the questions of [religious] peace nor the legal matters were clarified. Italians and Spaniards indeed want to ruin all of Germany. - [Andreas] Osiander has married for the third time these days, namely the young daughter [Helena] of Doctor [Johann] Magenbuch, and this with such pomp that this wedding has been compared to the pomp of Sardanapalus. - The loyal to Bullinger Nikolaus [Müller, known as] Maier, a good friend of Frölich's, acts as an advisor in [Augsburg]. He represented Augsburg at the Diet in Worms. - Frölich will have Gessner's „Bibliotheca [universalis]“ brought to him from [the] Frankfurt [fair]; likewise the works of Zwingli. - Greetings to [Kaspar] Megander, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Gessner, and [Rudolf] Gwalther, whose poetic talent he could admire in the poem [„De quinque primariis evangelicae doctrinae instauratoribus“]. - Bullinger may forgive the errors [in this letter].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have read your letters, both those addressed to our council and to myself, most esteemed man. As for Mr. Erb, we will wait to see what the young man sent to you will report back. In the meantime, our magistrate thanks you for your diligence and effort in this matter and promises to repay you at some point. Although I am burdened with business, I must not neglect my friends, as I am compelled to do many things of much less importance than those that should always be dedicated to friends, who are more precious than any metal, either by writing or responding. I wish I could satisfy them with decorum and dignity!</p>
      <p>That Mr. Gessner and Mr. Froschauer think so honorably of me, I attribute to their decency, as they kindly accept the negligence and modesty of a little friend.</p>
      <p>I certainly wanted to discuss more with them, had they not left unexpectedly. The call of Fugger, such a great man, namely our Mr. Gessner, gave me various thoughts, knowing that Fugger is an extreme Papist, while he is pious in all things; hence it is no wonder that they agreed little on the condition between them.</p>
      <p>The Lord will preserve this man for us for better fruit. Whether Luther has written against you again, I am entirely unaware, nor have I seen any other example than the one to which you responded so piously and necessarily. However, if he has written anything according to his custom, I believe it will soon come to us. For Luther has here his kind of people who wish to propagate his kingdom; but, thanks to God, in vain.</p>
      <p>As soon as such a thing appears, I will communicate it to you without delay. The Diet has finally been broken off with great mockery of both the Emperor and the Imperial Estates; for it produced nothing but tricks and impostures, especially aimed at making the already poorly harmonious Imperial Estates even more discordant. They departed from Worms with matters entirely unresolved, so that neither the conditions of peace nor the administration of law and justice exist. Indeed, the Italians and Spaniards would like and sincerely wish for all of Germany to go to ruin.</p>
      <p>Osiander is now well. These days he has married for the third time, a very young woman, the daughter of Doctor Magenbuch, with such pomp and display that I have heard this wedding compared to the insolence of Sardanapalus.</p>
      <p>Mr. Nikolaus Maier, once and still very devoted to you, is now acting as our advisor. He was in Worms for the entire time of the Diet. Three days ago, however, he returned and is now staying at home. A pious and excellent man, chosen by me as a brother.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that Gessner's library is brought to me from Frankfurt, and I will not lack the works of the divine Zwingli, that triple-thunderbolt of the Pope. Farewell in the Lord and convey my greetings to the incomparable men Mr. Megander, Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gessner, and Mr. Gwalther, whose delightful vein in poetry I have seen and for that reason, previously beloved, he will be dearer to me.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, August 18, 1545. Forgive the errors.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, perpetual friend and brother.</p>
