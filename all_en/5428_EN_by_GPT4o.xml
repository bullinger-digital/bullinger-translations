      <p>Greetings. If I write nothing (reverend father in Christ), you should take it as me having nothing that I judge worthy of your knowledge. Regarding the council, I have not a word to write, nor is there anyone among us who can discover the truth, not even the priests themselves; for if there were anything, it could be fished out from them by others. It is not likely that they are idle in Trento; however, I fear we will not know what they are plotting until we hear it. I read the response given to our people last month in Innsbruck, and it satisfied me. But now I hear for certain that the imperial forces are strengthening garrisons in the neighboring Engadin against agreements and promises. What this portends, I do not know.</p>
      <p>I know that the spirits of the Engadin people are thoroughly exasperated and so incited by those unworthy words that the imperial forces are said to be throwing around, that, unless restrained by the moderation of some elders, they would make an incursion into those others. I wish to know what is being prepared in Constance.</p>
      <p>Those who come from Augsburg report nearly the same things as you noted in your letter. I ask you, if anything certain is known about the English preparations, do not keep it from us.</p>
      <p>There are those who affirm that Emperor Ferdinand is expected in Augsburg. If the Bernese deny their assistance to Cond√©, I see what mockery they will expose themselves to. Either they should have stayed at home or conducted the matter bravely.</p>
      <p>There are already those who shout that they have coveted Lyon, which I would never have believed, and I reluctantly hear such things; but they will hear much graver things if they return home with the matter unfinished.</p>
      <p>It would be good to win if one always had a guarantor for it, who would win. I see us slow in all things; therefore, as far as human aid is concerned, I have given up all hope of victory. For what could be more cowardly than what is done by our people? But as for the cause itself and divine help, I am still in the best hope. The other consul Tscharner has been absent for several weeks; he is expected today; he was bathing in Fideris. If I hear anything from the prefect of Dietikon, who is a neighbor in those parts, I think it will be this evening. The other was at the Hermit Diet; upon leaving, he sent his son (he left immediately after the wedding), if I wanted anything, to order it; upon returning, he likewise immediately sent his son to announce what was done at the diet. After my serious sermon, however, he can twist and devour everything and is wonderfully charming as usual.</p>
      <p>What should I do? The ride has left me with those sly cats. May your fatherhood be safe!</p>
      <p>Chur, 17th of August, in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his honorable father in Christ.</p>
