      <p>Dear Sir, please send the enclosed letter from my dear brother's son to Mr. Theodor, so that he can immediately send it to Kempten with his own messenger, with the note that Mr. Jacob Funkelin intended to ride out himself today, but as it turns out, there are obstacles, and it is unclear what they are, so he must delay. However, he will soon depart.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he should arrange everything.</p>
      <p>I have given the letter to Ransperger from St. Gallen; he will deliver it safely. Dated February 14.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
