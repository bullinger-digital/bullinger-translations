      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus. I write to you much less frequently, most reverend father, and you, dearest Ludwig, than either I would wish or you might expect. How you might take this, I do not know: I hope, not badly. For the more I feel myself bound to the piety of you all, and the more I have always valued your judgment of me, the less I would wish to be condemned by you for either forgetfulness or negligence. Now, to attribute such long silences to my occupations might seem absurd: although, if you knew me and my concerns, no other excuse would be necessary. For besides my own constant, others', domestic, public, civil, and ecclesiastical troubles, without which one cannot live in this office in these times, I am almost alone forced to contend with enemies, whether foreign or domestic, I cannot say. They are indeed ours, but with a hostile spirit, even on hostile ground. For our exiles from Leuven have begun to stir themselves in great numbers, last year, and to write most bitterly against us all, and to attack me by name. Why so? you ask. I do not know, unless they knew me to be the most vulnerable of all and the weakest to resist. However, six years ago, when I was preaching at court before the royal majesty, and speaking of the antiquity of our religion and the papist religion, I remember saying among other things, that our adversaries, when they accuse our cause of novelty, do both us an injury and the people a fraud: for they both prove new things for old, and condemn as new those things which are most ancient. For private masses and truncated communions, and natural and real presences, and transubstantiations, etc. (in which all their religion consists) have no certain and express testimony either of the sacred scriptures, or of the ancient councils, or of the ancient fathers, or of any antiquity at all. They bear this indignantly: they bark in corners, calling me an impudent, confident, insolent, insane man. Four years ago, unexpectedly, a certain Harding appeared, not long ago a listener and follower of Peter Martyr, and a most ardent preacher of the gospel, now a vile apostate and well known to our Julius; who refuted me from the spurious Amphilochius, Abdias, Hippolytus, Clement, Victor, Athanasius, Leontius, Cletus, Anacletus, with forged letters, dreams, fables. I responded to him last year, as best I could, according to my ability. But O immortal God! What kind of life is this! Ϝσ ερισ εκ τε Ξεςν και εχ ανΞρςπςν απολοιτο. Scarcely had I finished, when immediately a Confutation of our Apology flies out; a huge work, elaborate, and full of insults, slanders, lies, and sycophancies. Here I am attacked again. What do you ask? I must respond. You see, reverend father, how we are not idle; especially I, who by some fate of mine must always fight with these monsters. May the Lord add strength and courage, and trample Satan under our feet! I thought it right to write this at length, so that if letters come from me less frequently than either you expect or I wish, you may attribute it to any other cause rather than either forgetfulness of you or ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Our republic is at peace both from arms and concerning religion. Those Leuven people indeed disturb as much as they can; but the people are in duty, and I hope will remain so. The queen is in good health, and averse to marriage. The past winter so miserably afflicted the growing crops, that now everywhere throughout England there is great difficulty with grain. This year, by the grace of God, everything has prospered most joyfully. I have not seen Bishop Parkhurst of Norwich, Bishop Sandys of Worcester, or Bishop Pilkington of Durham for a whole three years: so far apart are we scattered. Yet we all live safe and mindful of you. Only Richard Chambers has passed away; but piously and in the Lord. That contention about the ecclesiastical linen vestment, which I do not doubt you have heard about either from our Abel or from Bishop Parkhurst, has not yet subsided. This matter somewhat disturbs weak minds. And would that all even the slightest traces of papacy could be removed both from the temples and, much more, from the minds of all! But the queen cannot bear any change in religion at this time.</p>
      <p>The affairs of Scotland are not yet sufficiently settled: several nobles of the first rank are exiled among us: others have remained at home, and prepare themselves to resist if force is used: and from their fortresses they sometimes make excursions, and take and carry off as much as they can from the lands of the papists. The queen herself, although she is firmly set in her mind towards papism, yet scarcely knows where to turn. For concerning religion she has a great part of both the nobility and the people against her: and as far as we can understand, the number is increasing daily. Philip, the king, had sent a certain Italian abbot with Spanish gold in recent months, a cunning man, made and instructed for deceit, who might assist both the king and queen with crafty counsel, and fill everything with tumults. The new king, who had always hitherto abstained from masses, and had voluntarily attended sermons, to ingratiate himself with the people, when he heard that ship was to arrive the next day, suddenly became more confident, took courage, and would no longer dissemble. He goes to the temple: orders a mass to be said for him in the usual manner. At the same time, Mr. Knox, the preacher in the same town, and in the next temple, with a great crowd, cried out against idolatry, and against the whole papal kingdom, never more strongly. Meanwhile, that Philippian ship, tossed by storms and winds, shaken and broken by waves, with its mast torn off, its sides broken, its pilots, passengers, and all its goods lost, empty, tattered, and full of water, is carried to England. I do not doubt that this happened by divine intervention, so that the foolish king might understand how auspicious it is to hear masses.</p>
      <p>Many turbulent things are reported from the French. That Guise family cannot rest without some great evil. But those matters are much closer to you than to us. The Dane and the Swede have fought most bloodily among themselves, and are still said to be in arms. Each has suffered the greatest disadvantages; nor can it yet be said which is superior.</p>
      <p>Your books, yours, most reverend father, on Daniel, and yours, most learned Ludwig, on Joshua, have been safely delivered to me. I give thanks to the most good and great God for you, and to you for these labors and studies and for all your kindness. I have sent at this time to our Julius for an annual stipend 20 crowns, and another 20 to you two; so that you may spend them either on a public dinner according to your custom, or for any other use according to your judgment. May God preserve you, the church, the republic, and your school safe! Greet Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Simler, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Ghesner, Mr. Wick, Mr. Haller, Mr. Hen. and Rod. Bullinger, in my name. Salisbury, February 8, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your loving and devoted in the Lord, John Jewel, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
