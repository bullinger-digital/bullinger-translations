    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's relative Heinrich Wiederkehr, [Deputy Bailiff] in Dietikon [Canton of Zurich], denies that he violated his duty of confidentiality and thereby enabled the escape of a lawbreaker from the village, and claims that his wife, who had warned the lawbreaker, was informed by Bernhard Tratz; Bullinger regrets that Wiederkehr became abusive towards [Bailiff] Schmid when he imposed a fine of 50 pounds on him and 20 pounds on his wife. Nevertheless, he asks to waive the fine in consideration of his loyalty and willingness to serve Zurich, and promises to speak to his conscience together with [Heinrich] Brennwald.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ be with you at all times.</p>
      <p>Pious, honorable, gracious, dear sir, I ask you to kindly receive this letter of mine and consider it graciously. My cousin Heinrich Wiederkehr, innkeeper in Dietikon, has recently fallen into your disfavor and imprisonment because he allegedly did not keep the confidentiality (the duty of confidentiality) entrusted to him by the obligation of his office and oath, as it became known, and that the lawbreaker, warned by his wife, escaped. Although he believes that through his speech, which did not reveal the confidentiality at all, and only happened against one who did not regard it, no warning was given to the lawbreaker, and that the wife made the warning through Bernhard Tratz and not through him or from him, suspicion remains, and nothing of the matter was thought of by many, and his wife would have remained calm. But since this did not happen, you have deemed it worthy, for the sake of your office and duty, that he and his wife should be further punished with a fine, and imposed upon him to pay fifty pounds, and upon her, twenty pounds. Because of this, he has become further unfit out of impatience with his misfortune, and has spoken out of displeasure and anger against you and others, which I could very well wish he had spared. He has also incited you, so that you too have spoken and acted angrily, and both sides have come to peace.</p>
      <p>Now, friendly and gracious, dear sir, since I have never taken pleasure in the fact that what is handled out of temptation may always lead to greater harm, I cannot at all gloss over (justify) my cousin's case or defend it and act for you on his behalf as an innocent matter. It also cannot displease me on your behalf that you, according to your duty and office, protect peace, loyalty, and honesty, punish what is against it and unrest. May God grant you that you always and at all times hold good judgment and justice before God, whose servant you are, steadfastly and faithfully. But I ask you, as my gracious, dear sir, to also consider the circumstances of the matter, and what excuse he might have, and also take his person into account and let yourself be found in kindness and friendliness. For although he has now come into misfortune, he has always been a faithful man, especially loyal and attached to my gracious lords of Zurich, with whom he has persistently endured both wars with great effort and cost, and is still willing to show them and you all honor, loyalty, and service. Therefore, I ask you most kindly to pardon him again, forgive him, and also remit the fine of 50 pounds. He will accept this with thanks and acknowledgment as appropriate. He is also willing to willingly pay the 20 pounds imposed on the woman. I will also earn your friendliness, where I can, for you and yours. No one will be able to say that you have let such a thing go unpunished. So, Provost Brennwald, your brother-in-law, and I will speak with him in such a way that he will henceforth behave more appropriately towards his appointed superiors and follow reason, not anger, in good hope that you have already been persuaded and will always act with discretion towards everyone.</p>
      <p>May God protect you and yours at all times.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, August 17, 1537.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and wise Andreas Schmid, Bailiff in Baden, his gracious, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God of the church of Zurich, your willing servant.</p>
