      <p>S. Regarding the arrival of Philipp (Philipp II.), King of Spain, there are those who think it is spread more by rumors than it is a certain fact, because he is prevented by the French (Gallo) and the seas are closed to him; if he does come, I entirely believe what you write, that either he will not be resisted at all, or, if anyone attempts it, he will be abandoned by the rest, even by the confederates, and will bring confusion upon himself. Let us pray to the Lord that we may be kept from temptation.</p>
      <p>England should be an eternal lesson to all, not to treat the truth offered to them profanely, which many of the English themselves have lamented to me before these times. Yet blessed are those who endure affliction for the name of Christ, persevering in faith, and those who, having been taught, are led captive to Oxford for disputation, are led to certain punishment, having the same judges and accusers with Christ; it is fitting that we commend them to the Lord in the prayers of all churches. Although I favor the Prince of Salerno and wish him restored to his own, since I understand he does not abhor the true doctrine of piety, I nevertheless somewhat fear, lest by the example of the Voivode, the common enemy be more and more invited into the bowels of the Christian world. The French (Gallus) breathes great things, presuming in mind and hope for even greater dominion; but it is strange, unless, being lifted up on high, he is cast headlong into the depths and drags into the company of ruin those whom he has as companions and ministers of insane desires. For he neither thinks of law nor right and is carried with continuous cruelty to extinguish the profession of Christ. Our people have begun to watch over the restoration of discipline, however, by recalling the first decrees from ecclesiastical reformation for this very purpose; but I fear in vain, as long as the door of mercenary military service is open, which, as a school of all vices, introduces every kind of corruption. The plans of Margrave Albrecht to invade France do not proceed, first because Heinrich, Duke of Brunswick, is an impediment, so that his forces cannot easily unite, especially those which the Duke of Mecklenburg had assembled.</p>
      <p>Secondly, because the allied princes have offered through legates certain conditions of peace from the Brussels assembly, which are said to be fair and tolerable to both parties, with a declaration to both sides that whichever party refuses them and continues to wage war will have the whole alliance as enemies. Lastly, because with the death of Duke Bruten, he himself is destined for succession either as heir or as guardian of the orphaned daughter. May the Lord grant peace in our days.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the promissory note of your young men acting in Paris; I have paid 40 crowns to a citizen who earnestly requested it, borrowed from elsewhere without stipulation of interest. I believe he will return to Paris within months, which I mention so that, if you wish to write, you may take care to send letters to me to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Jacobus de Puys had paid them too stingily until now. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, April 11, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord and superior.</p>
