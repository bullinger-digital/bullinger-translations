      <p>Greetings in the Lord. On the eighth day of March, I wrote to you, most esteemed sir, which my son Barnabas, as he later wrote to me, sent to you at the previous Frankfurt fair through Mr. Christoph Froschauer. I hope you have received them before this day: through them, I informed your kindness that your previous letters, which you wrote to me extensively in August of the past year, have long been delivered to me. Today, however, I have received for the first time your most welcome letters, dated in Zurich, February 25, 1571, along with three of your letters addressed to the most reverend bishops of York, Ely, and Salisbury, and also three of your manuscript copies, which you mention in your aforementioned letters; all of which I will now ensure are faithfully delivered to the bishops to whom you entrusted them. I certainly wonder much where they have been delayed so long on the journey: yet I rejoice that I have finally received them; and I thank you for the one German printed book, which you gave me as a gift, inscribed with the title: Uff herren Johansen Brentzen testament, etc. bescheidne antwort etc. Of such books, I have also received two more printed in Latin, five books, and three letters, namely one to our bishop of London, another to the bishop of Durham, and another to Heinrich Butler, along with the three aforementioned manuscript copies; which letters and all the aforementioned seven printed books, which you desired to be given through your letters, I will ensure are delivered as soon as I can.</p>
      <p>As for the cloth, which they call caresex, I delivered two English yards and 3/4 of the finer kind, which our countrymen mostly use only in their stockings, or, as your countrymen - I think - say, in irer nieder hosen, here in the past month of June to Mr. Christoph Mont for your kindness; and I instructed a certain servant of mine, named Simon Tailor, to request and receive from the aforementioned Mr. Froschauer at the upcoming autumn fair in Frankfurt, two French crowns and 7 batz, namely three florins and ten batz, for those two yards with 3/4: because you, sir, in your next or latest letters, wanted me to indicate the price, so that the aforementioned Froschauer would pay it for you in Frankfurt. I have also given here for you to the aforementioned Mr. Christoph Mont one English yard and 3/4 of the thicker kind, (which our countrymen mostly use in their upper breeches, or, as the Germans - I think - usually say, In die brouch oder niedergwand des menschens hosen) which yard, with three quarters of thicker but more durable caresex, I give as a gift to your kindness, and I pray to the best and greatest God that you may enjoy it for as long as possible, although it is not very likely that you will. For Jerome very truly says, quoting a philosopher or poet: "A young man can die quickly, but an old man cannot live long."</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, that work of yours, which you mention, in responding to that entire impudent papal bull, which the Roman antichrist vomited against our most serene queen, will be especially approved by the three aforementioned bishops, to whom you sent those three copies; and they will also publish them, if it seems to them to be in the interest of the kingdom and according to the will of our most serene queen. I certainly regret that you so humbly beseech me to now consider your writing to me favorably, and to forgive you for using my services so familiarly; for you can always use my services as familiarly as possible, as long as I live.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, before the parliament held at Westminster was concluded or finished, the aforementioned Heinrich Butler was here with his lord, Bishop Parkhurst of Norwich, anxiously awaiting letters from his mother, because he had not yet received any from her since he arrived in England, as he himself then told me. However, Dr. Mont here told him in my house that a small package of letters had been left for him in the doctor's house in Strasbourg, in which he thought there were some addressed to that Heinrich.</p>
      <p>In the past month of June, the most learned theologian, Mr. David Whitehead, (who was exiled during the reign of Queen Mary for professing orthodox doctrine,) happily migrated to the Lord. He lived as a widower for about seven years, as you yourself now wrote about your condition. However, shortly before the middle of the year, he recently married a widow, himself being almost eighty years old. Also, Mr. Cole, who at that time was also exiled in Germany for preaching the gospel, died on the second day after he began to be ill, suffering from quinsy.</p>
      <p>The Archdeacon of the Essex diocese of the county of London, before he died, was promoted to the deanery of the cathedral church of Salisbury here in London, as it is said, on the same day or the day before he decided to set out from London to Salisbury to receive induction, accompanied by many servants and friends.</p>
      <p>Thus "All things of men hang by a slender thread, And suddenly, by chance, those that were strong, fall."</p>
      <p>Before I had completed this entire letter, I had already ensured that all the aforementioned manuscript copies and all the other aforementioned printed books were delivered to the most reverend bishops to whom they were addressed, and I hope they will soon write back to your kindness.</p>
      <p>London, July 27, 1571.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed sir, in Christ, our savior.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, whom you know, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>July 31. After my letter was sealed, I saw and read your letter to the three most reverend bishops (namely, of York, Ely, and Salisbury) now printed, and I understand that the first part of your aforementioned work (from that manuscript copy of yours, which you sent to the bishop of Ely) has already been printed, and I have been informed that some other sheets of the same work have also already been printed, so that your entire manuscript copy will be printed and published as soon as possible.</p>
