    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller thanks Bullinger for the advice to preach on the First Epistle to Timothy. He receives much encouragement in doing so. Bullinger should now advise him on which book of the Bible he should interpret next.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He preaches three times a week:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- 1. On Saturday evening, when the prayers and confessions are more detailed than usual. On this occasion, he preaches on the First Epistle of John using the notes he took from Bullinger's sermons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- 2. On Sunday evening, when wealthy [citizens are present at the service] and fall asleep as soon as the sermon becomes complicated. Therefore, it might be good to cover a historical book of the Old Testament, such as Genesis, at this time. Difficult questions are better grasped in the morning, while biblical stories are more suitable in the evening. Bullinger's success in interpreting the books about the Kings prompts Haller to undertake such a project, especially since no one in Augsburg has yet preached on a historical book [of the Bible]. Since the Book of Genesis is currently read without any explanation before the sermon and the people often take offense at it, an interpretation of this book would certainly be appropriate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- 3. On Monday morning. At this time, it would be sensible to interpret the Epistle to the Hebrews after the First Epistle to Timothy. Bullinger knows how well this is suited to refuting the self-righteous and [Roman] priests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller asks Bullinger for advice and for the communication of his notes, through which Bullinger will speak not only to the people of Zurich but also to those of Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Haller now returns Bullinger's treatise, which sets out that the Lord's Supper should not be celebrated in private homes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- He also sends a booklet about Luther's death, which was learned about on the day [February 28] when Haller returned to [Augsburg]. He now hopes that Luther's extreme doctrine in [Germany] will soon be a thing of the past.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- He also sends Melanchthon's funeral oration on Luther in German translation, as he could not obtain a Latin version.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Also enclosed is a writing about the beginnings of the Council of Trent, as such [literature] only reaches [Zurich] late.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- There is no news. Everything is quiet; however, everything is being concealed, which suggests a great evil. In [Augsburg], an anonymous writing is circulating, mentioning Philipp [Melanchthon] and Justus Jonas, and advocating that one should not resist the Emperor [Charles V.], even if he were to begin a persecution. The Emperor must be defeated by patience rather than by force of arms. It is believed that Luther is the author of this writing. Some think it is a ruse by the [Catholic] priests to unsettle the weak and uneducated. The [Augsburg] authorities have banned the publication of the writing, as otherwise, the opponents would only be encouraged to persecute the truth. And should persecution occur, the merchants of Augsburg would likely cause great problems for their city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The fellow pastors seem much milder than before. [Wolfgang] Musculus is silent about Bullinger's letter [No. 2358]. Perhaps now, after Luther's death, the pastors will better interpret their church order (of which Haller once sent a copy to Bullinger [with No. 2295]). [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld has sent a copy of the Augsburg church order to the church council [in Augsburg], which he had annotated with handwritten notes. It was decided not to respond to him, especially since he has not published his slanders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Schwenckfeld's heresy has found many followers in [Augsburg]. It is time to oppose his false doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Bullinger should pray for the preservation of pure doctrine. [Michael] Keller, who suffers from gout, is steadfast, as Megander once was in Zurich. [Georg] Frölich is ill. He has decided to visit the [Swiss] thermal baths [in Baden], where the [Zurichers] can meet with him. Haller is quite familiar with [Hans] Welser. [Jakob] Herbrot was pleased with Bullinger's letter [not preserved] and will respond to it [No. 2392].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- The [Augsburg] mayors reimbursed Haller for all travel expenses and also gave him 50 guilders as the first salary payment. Haller is treated honorably. However, he still fears the jealousy of his colleagues. Bullinger should write to him more often.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [Hans Wilpert] Zoller is now in [Sebastian] Schertlin's service. The latter receives 50 guilders from the Augsburg councilors so that Zoller would also be available to the Augsburgers if they needed his services.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the children, to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, Otto [Werdmüller], [Johann Jakob] Ammann, and [Rudolf] Collin. Greetings from Sixt [Birck] and [Michael] Keller.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. I thank you, venerable father Bullinger, for giving me the advice to take the First Epistle of Saint Paul to Timothy for public interpretation in my sermon. I have begun it and am progressing successfully with great attendance and applause from the people, hopefully with as much fruit and edification. Since it is brief and can be completed in a short time, and your advice has served me so well, I ask you to advise me again on which book of the Holy Scripture I should interpret after this one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have three sermons weekly:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>1. On Saturday evening, when prayers are usually more detailed with the confession of sins; otherwise, it differs in nothing from other sermons. At this time, I am dealing with the First Epistle of John, as I have described from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>2. On Sunday evening, when only the wealthy and more delicate are present, yet many of them fall asleep if they hear about more complex matters. Therefore, I believe it would not be unwise to cover something historical from the Old Testament at this time, like Genesis or something similar. Serious questions are more successfully addressed and understood in the morning than in the evening when the senses are distracted by various thoughts. However, histories, since they delight, would be listened to more attentively at this time. It is a useful and holy delight if someone is delighted by the sacred histories rightly understood and properly applied to our lives. I am also much moved when I consider how much fruit I have seen you derive from narrating the histories of the kings. Therefore, I think it would not be useless or inglorious to also cover something historical in our church, especially at this time, partly because the minds of the listeners, being tired, would become attentive, and partly because no one in that church has yet dared to attempt this. I am also moved by the fact that the Book of Genesis is now read before the sermons without interpretation, and the people are often offended by the unintelligible text. Therefore, I think it would be useful if a convenient and clear interpretation were now also proposed to them, so that the offense conceived would be removed again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>3. The sermon is on Monday morning; at this time, I think it would not be inconvenient to follow the First Epistle to Timothy with the one to the Hebrews. You know how suitable it is for refuting the self-righteous and the priests of our age.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Therefore, I ask for your advice, which, as it has never failed me, I now also hope will be very beneficial. I ask not only for advice but also for help, that you may share with me your notes, through which you will speak not only to the church of Zurich but also to that of Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Furthermore, I return these arguments you collected, that the Lord's Supper should not be celebrated in private homes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Moreover, I send a booklet about Luther's death, whose death was announced in Augsburg on the same day as my arrival. I consider this to be a good omen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>For I hope that his gross doctrine will soon also perish there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I also send the oration of Philipp held at Luther's funeral, which has been translated into our language; I could not have it in Latin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I have also added a writing describing the beginning of the Council of Trent. I send it because these things reach you late.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I know no news. Everything is silent. Everything is feigned and concealed; hence I fear that a great evil may eventually arise. A certain writing is being spread among us without a name, in which Philipp and Justus Jonas are cited, advising that no one, whether prince or state of the empire, should resist the emperor when he begins persecution: for he is the magistrate, whom it is not lawful to resist. Therefore, everything should be offered to him, and he should be overcome by patience rather than by arms. Some attribute this to Luther. Some think it is a scheme of the priests to disturb the weak and unlearned. Whoever the author may be, the lords have prohibited its publication. For it would give great courage to the adversaries to persecute the truth, which they will do with difficulty, when they think the evangelicals will restore themselves by force and arms. May the Lord protect us! For I fear that if persecution were to arise, our merchants would cause great harm in our city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>As for the brothers and fellow pastors, they seem to be much milder than before. Musculus is silent about what you wrote to him. However, I hope that now, with Luther dead, they will interpret their concord more piously. Schwenckfeld has interpreted the form, of which I once sent you a copy, with strange glosses, mocking and criticizing everything. However, he has mixed in many false and impious things; sometimes, however, not deviating from the truth, showing how they have something in everything, but nothing in the whole. This copy was sent (but it is only written from the margin of the form) to our assembly, where many doubted whether they wanted to respond to him or not. Finally, this opinion prevailed: they do not want to respond to him publicly, because he has not published these slanders publicly. I believe this did not happen without divine providence. For they are compelled, whether they want to or not, to interpret this form better, or they cannot avoid these slanders.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>However, this heresy of Schwenckfeld is spreading among us, and many great men are infected with it. To suppress this fire, it is necessary that we, setting aside those contentions, oppose these pernicious errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Pray to the Lord, that he may preserve us in the purity of doctrine, which cannot be mocked except by the plainly impious. Cellarius is strong as always, just as Megander was in Zurich. However, the good man is now weakened by gout. D. Laetus is also occasionally debilitated, I do not know by what disease. He has decided to visit our thermal baths soon, where you can meet him. I am entirely familiar with Welser. Herbrot was greatly delighted by your letters; if he has not replied, he will write soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>All the expenses I incurred on the journey were reimbursed to me by the consuls, along with 50 guilders for the past service as the beginning of my salary. They also treat me honorably in other ways, so that I have nothing to be more concerned about than the envious rivalry of the brothers; with whom I do not willingly contend. However, I do not want to yield even a hair's breadth from the truth. Therefore, it will be your fatherly duty to frequently comfort and encourage me with letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Zoller's business is also doing very well. He is with Schertlin. The lords of Augsburg give Schertlin 50 guilders for him as much as for wages, so that if they need his services, he is ready. In the meantime, he serves him not without great honor, and will someday return to his own.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing to write. I am well with all my family. I also wish to hear that you and your wife and children are well. D. Xystus and D. Cellarius greet you. You will greet in return D. Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, Otto, Ammann, Collin, etc.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, March 23, 1546. Your most devoted Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme head of the church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father. Zürich, to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
