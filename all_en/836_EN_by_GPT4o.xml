      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I hear that you have received a booklet about everything that happened in Vienna, Austria with the baker. I have this story described in a few words; if you do not wish to publish this cruel example, send to me what you have, and if you want to add something, add it, and I will ensure that this cruel story is published with us. However, if you want to know what is happening in Strasbourg, you can ask my relative, the refugee, who will narrate in great detail what has happened so far in Strasbourg and what the future hopes are for both the citizens and the preachers.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is still hidden in Brussels, striving in every way to hinder the alliance between the French and the English, so that he may become the monarch of Europe or at least of Germany. If he is going to invade France, he also has hopes for Switzerland, which has so far hindered his plans. We are expecting the third Decade. You will receive letters from Myconius denying the gout diagnosed by the doctor Gastius. I wish it were so, and that I am a false diviner in this matter. Farewell. February 11, 1550. Greet Theodor and Pellicanus in my name.</p>
      <p>Johannes Gast.</p>
      <p>I am also sending you letters sent from England...</p>
      <p>Note. If you have anything to share, I beg you not to hide it from Gastius. To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
