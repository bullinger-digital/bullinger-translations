    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger could not understand some parts of Myconius' letter No. 295; next time, he should express himself more clearly and openly, as there is currently no danger in expressing an honest opinion in writing. Andreas Schmid was elected to the Zürich council despite public protests from the clergy. Although the council officially professes the Reformation, there is much cowardice, hypocrisy, and complacency among its members. Bullinger is ashamed of the people of Zürich and fears the abolition of the evangelical truth as God's punishment. In his haste, he could not yet learn anything about the ordinance of a Zürich delegation to Bern.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Write more clearly in the future, dearest brother, since there is no danger, both because we entrust our messages to faithful messengers and because we are dealing with useful and honest matters, of which we need not be ashamed, even if the letters are opened. I do not understand what you mean by our plans against the neighbors, which you find displeasing and wish to share with your people. Therefore, if there is anything of great importance, do not hesitate to repeat it and write it down a little more clearly.</p>
      <p>Now listen, dearest brother, to another wound inflicted by recent letters. I do not know with what remedies I can soothe it. For Andreas Schmid, the son of the councilor Schmid, has been elected to the council despite our public protest. Cerberus - you know, I mean the dog - continually calls such people into the council, and there is no one among us who with a strong and fearless spirit opposes these reckless ventures: The foolish are deceived by appearances. I would not begrudge the magistrate if it were clear that they are upright. Publicly, he has indeed confessed our faith, sworn allegiance to our faith, renounced the papacy, broke bread in the Eucharist with the brothers, and promised to continue doing so, but I fear that hypocrisy and some unknown evil are lurking. May the Lord preserve His church. For I see a great storm threatening it, I see much courage growing in the impious cohort, I see too much childish credulity and security, and thus the extreme negligence of our people fascinates their minds, so much so that even when warned, aroused, urged, drawn, and dragged from their slumber, they refuse to awaken. I truly fear, I fear that the Lord will one day avenge this contempt of the word and its ministers by abolishing the truth. I am certainly ashamed and grieved by our people. May the Lord have mercy on us for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>The messenger was in such a hurry that I could not ascertain whether our delegates have been sent.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>December 12, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Oswald Myconius, in Basel.</p>
