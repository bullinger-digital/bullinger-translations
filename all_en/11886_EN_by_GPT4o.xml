    <p xml:id="regest1">The doctor Jakob Lemonius, originally from Graub端nden and employed in Nuremberg through the mediation of Philipp Melanchthon, delivered a report to him a few months ago about the Turkish campaign, in which he himself participated, and wished for it to be improved, translated into German, and published anonymously; since he does not feel capable of doing this, he sends it to Bullinger with the request to assign this task to someone else or to return the report. He has handed over the school to Veit [Kappeler the Younger] and is returning to the Engadin, where Italian preachers have caused unrest. The Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is said to have demanded the handover of some cities from Venice, including Brixen, which lies on the way to Milan. Johannes Blasius will soon come to Zurich seeking advice.</p>

      <p>Philipp Gallicius to his Heinrich, Greetings. Jakob Lemonius is in N端rnberg, a man not poorly educated in Greek and not to be entirely disregarded in general literature, a native of Graub端nden, I say, by profession a doctor, also distinguished by the title of doctorate, and in N端rnberg he is supported by the city with an annual salary of 150 Rhenish guilders, recommended to them by Philipp Melanchthon. He, I say, when he was here a few months ago, presented us with a booklet written by himself about the campaign against the Turks, in which he himself participated. He wished for it to be printed and published, if it could be made a little more correct by someone not poorly versed in the Latin language - for he himself did not have the time -, but in such a way that his name would not be attached, but rather it would be published anonymously. Having read the booklet, I found that it needed not a small amount of refinement and certainly much more than I, to whom he wanted to entrust this task, could provide, so much so that I despaired of its publication. But since he does not cease to demand that it be published and even translated into German, I send it, whatever it is, to you, not that I wish to burden you with it, but so that through you it may be handed over to someone more learned, of whom you have plenty there, to be refined and published with the author's name kept silent, if indeed it can be done. He makes no mention of expenses to me. The reason I send it to you is that he seems to call upon you in a letter sent to me, which I send to you here for this reason, and I give the corrector the authority through the author to change, transpose, delete, and indeed do whatever he pleases in this booklet, in all things, I say, that pertain to diction. But if it cannot be published, send it back here to me or to Johannes Blasius or Comander, who will forward it to me; for today, having left our Veit at school, I return to my Engadin, where I expect not small disturbances stirred up by some Italian preachers. Otherwise, Veit pleases with both learning and diligence; but I can hardly persuade myself that he will remain here long. I fear, indeed, that he may not be able to endure the barbarism of those with whom he will have to deal most. - It is certainly reported from Italy that the Turk is demanding from the Venetians the handover of several cities, and specifically Brixen, which he could conveniently use when advancing on Milan with his army. Farewell, most esteemed man by all good people. From Chur, on the 28th of January, 1544. Johannes Blasius will soon come to you there and seek advice and help from you, the best of brothers.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, a man most esteemed by all good people.</p>
