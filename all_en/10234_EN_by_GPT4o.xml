      <p>May the grace of God be upon us. Amen.</p>
      <p>My dear lord and brother, in truth knowing how my situation stands. Firstly, I have given the bailiff in the Rhine Valley the 200 guilders, for which he himself was with me in St. Gallen and gave a receipt, although some have tried to justify me beyond what the judgment allows. To them, he has once given the instruction faithfully. Yet he persists. Thus, I am waiting regarding the matter of the images. Perhaps something will be found, etc.</p>
      <p>Now, upon your advice and my own thoughts, like Abraham, his name and so forth, and to be of use to the faithful, I am willing. Namely, I have approached the faithful Doctor Vadian and some in secret, informed them of your advice and my intention, that they help me against the hospital of St. Gallen, that he enters my property, located in Altstätten, in a chest. I hope to achieve this, and if it happens, I will be more secure, etc. And since you know, the linen trade for my children, also for me, to learn well, for mine and those close to me, also other faithful, I know myself, as long as God wills, not to settle anywhere but in St. Gallen. The wife is pregnant, the children small, the costs of raising them great, as you well know. Therefore, yesterday I approached the mayor and council of St. Gallen, asking them, as advised, to accept me as a resident, etc., or where they see fit, to become a citizen, to advise me and them. Thus, I am summoned for tomorrow, Friday, before the small and large council. I think I will become a resident; I hear no particular lack. Thus stands my situation, etc. Otherwise, all is well in all tribulation. The Lord loses none. Only that I hope, as do all pious ones, that my gracious lords in Zurich remain with the truth and with fairness.</p>
      <p>Regarding Duke Ulrich and his matters, I am certain without long delay much will happen.</p>
      <p>Master Ambrosius Blarer is this Lent in Lindau. He has accomplished much with humility and goodness there. Praying to God for us all; may we do the same. The greatest official of the abbot of St. Gallen in Altstätten in the Rhine Valley has died; his name was Vinzenz Hasler. Greet your dear wife, the father, the mother, also Leon, and whoever inquires about me.</p>
      <p>Acted in haste in St. Gallen, on Thursday after Laetare in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>I will write to you again soon, God willing, and thank Him, etc.</p>
      <p>Your willing poor Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
