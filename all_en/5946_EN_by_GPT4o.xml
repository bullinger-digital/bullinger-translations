      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, written in Zürich on the 22nd of October of the past year, on which day you also claim to have received mine, sent long before, which I believe lingered for some time with my brother Caspar, a man indeed very negligent in sending letters back and forth, in Chur.</p>
      <p>And because your letters, finally sent to me, were most pleasing to me, as is everything that comes from you, my most sincere friend and most esteemed patron, I therefore give you immense thanks.</p>
      <p>For it was done courteously by you, who, though you are the busiest of all and have less time to respond to each letter sent to you, were not hindered by any business from writing back to me and cheering me with your letters.</p>
      <p>However, my Lord Bullinger, those letters of yours did not bring me complete and unalloyed joy, since, to respond to the last part of your letter, you assert (when I wished to be more certain of your condition and health and you responded to me about it) that your strength is waning day by day and you are often troubled by headaches.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was very difficult for me to hear; for I wish you to be in the best of health and to remain alive for as long as possible, both because of the singular friendship that exists between us and even more so for the promotion of the glory of Christ and the benefit and utility of the entire Christian republic; for in our age there is no one who undertakes such great labors for the Christian republic as you do.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord God, that He may bless all your most pious endeavors.</p>
      <p>But to return to the point that you feel your strength diminishing, I say it must be borne with the most equanimous spirit, as you indeed do; for not only are you worn out by constant labors, but old age also presses upon you, and you should especially find solace in these difficulties, that you can glory in Christ that you have most excellently managed the talent entrusted to you and fulfilled the duty of a faithful servant, and may God, the best and greatest, grant that you may continue to do so for many years through Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, because you so kindly lament the death of the once most renowned man, Lord Travers (my father-in-law), and also console me, I likewise thank you, and because I acknowledge everything you write to be most true, I therefore bear his death with a patient spirit.</p>
      <p>But I pray to the Lord God, that He may raise up someone in the place of the deceased, who may someday equally benefit and serve our country and promote the glory of Christ, as did our same Lord Travers of blessed memory; for indeed our country lost much when such a great man passed away.</p>
      <p>To our God be praise and glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>We have no news here, except that the plague, which has begun to spread a day's journey from here towards Innsbruck and also in some places in Rhaetia, makes us somewhat more uneasy.</p>
      <p>The people of Engadin have long feared this kind of disease beyond what can be expressed and take precautions as best they can.</p>
      <p>But it is the Lord's to avert the evil from us.</p>
      <p>It is said that three thousand Spaniards have arrived in Genoa.</p>
      <p>The reason for their arrival is reported to be that they are to accompany the two sons of the present emperor to Spain, to whom King Philip is to entrust his only son, who is of somewhat duller intellect, and indeed also the administration of the kingdom, since King Philip himself cannot bear such a burden due to weakness of strength.</p>
      <p>There are those who affirm that something else is in preparation, namely that the Emperor, due to old age, intends to abdicate the empire and designate it to his son Maximilian.</p>
      <p>However, in order for this to be done more safely, Maximilian is to be surrounded by a large number of both German and Spanish soldiers.</p>
      <p>But I believe this less.</p>
      <p>For what need would Maximilian have for Spanish assistance if he seeks such dignity with his father's consent, when he has the favor of the Germans? I would rather believe that some rivalry exists between Philip and Maximilian over the imperial dignity, and while Philip perhaps feels that Maximilian aspires to the same, he tries to prevent him from succeeding.</p>
      <p>But such news is spread by uncertain authors, and therefore deserves little trust.</p>
      <p>I am sending letters attached herewith, but I ask that you ensure they are transferred to my son in Basel.</p>
      <p>But I ask more, my Lord Bullinger, that you do not be angry with me for imposing this burden on you, and I indeed confess it is too improper to trouble you in this way.</p>
      <p>But you will forgive the fault for the sake of our friendship, and you will do so more equitably when you consider that I have no more open and safer way to send letters to my son, indeed also yours.</p>
      <p>He will return home, I believe, around the beginning of February next and will certainly visit you then.</p>
      <p>You will inform him, as you will then advise, how I should deal with him; for I have previously requested you to do this.</p>
      <p>I very much wish that you greet your entire family in my name and all your sons-in-law along with their children, indeed most renowned men.</p>
      <p>I would also like to know how that venerable old man, Lord Bernardino Ochino, is doing, to whom, if he is still alive, I wish to be commended.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe, my Lord Bullinger, how much I still long to visit you all; but the burden of business, with which I am overwhelmed, does not allow me to fulfill my desire.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God preserve you as an ornament and honor of Switzerland along with the rest of the most renowned assembly of pious and learned men who are there, and grant His blessing to all of you.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever happily, most esteemed lord and patron, and I ask that you love me in return.</p>
      <p>Given in Samaden on the 18th of November, 1563. My Lord Bullinger, take care to be as well and as long-lived as possible.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted and friendly, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, lord and patron always to be esteemed.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
