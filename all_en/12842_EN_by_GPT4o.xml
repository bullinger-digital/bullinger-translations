    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The bearer [...] will report, among other things, on the deposition of the Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann von Wied, carried out by the imperial commissioners [Philip de Lalaing and Viglius van Zwichem]. Medmann sends three writings, including that "Truthful Account," which unfortunately is all too true! As many people as possible should read these writings, especially the authorities in Zurich. The [evangelically minded] preachers [in Cologne] must leave the city. Medmann is also packing. Perhaps he will move to Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In "Belgium" there are persecutions again. Albert [Hardenberg] was once more accused by the [theologians] of Leuven before Emperor Charles V. Especially [Philip de Lalaing,] the Lord of Corney and of Gelderland, persecuted Hardenberg when he was still active in Kempen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should write back in detail. Medmann will report as often as he can.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] May the [Confederates] understand that the Emperor only has the [eradication of the evangelical] religion in mind!</p>

      <p>Greetings. The one who delivers my letter to you, my dear Bullinger, can tell you many things that have happened here in recent days, such as how our leader was removed from all governance by the imperial commissioners, and other matters. I am sending you three writings, from which you will also learn and read not a few things, which I know well, not without indignation. I wish that the true account, which, believe me, is very true, would be read by many there, especially by the leaders of your republic. It is said that no place will be granted for the preachers to remain any longer. I have also begun to pack, perhaps intending to go to Strasbourg.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In the Low Countries, a new persecution is being instituted. The theologians of Leuven have once again accused Albert before Emperor Charles V, against whom Cornei, the chief prefect of the Duchy of Gelderland, was very hostile when he was still teaching in Kempen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I pray that you write back in detail. I will not neglect any opportunity to write to you.</p>
      <p>February 4, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours with all my heart, etc.</p>

      <p>Would that you truly understood to what end Charles's efforts are directed! For what else did he have against our leader, than the cause of religion?</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent professor of sacred letters in the church of Zurich, a most distinguished man, to be honored. Greetings.</p>
