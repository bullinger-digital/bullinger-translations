      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand. Dear sir and brother, I cannot withhold from you that yesterday evening Johannes Ganthnerus came to me, introduced himself to me - for I would not have known him otherwise - and complained to me much and at length about how his words were understood very differently than he had spoken or meant them. For he is not an Anabaptist nor of the opinion that one should let everyone do as they please, and yet he has been dismissed from his service, even though he has signed the Helvetic Confession and is neither in little nor much against it; he also desires to know from me what he has been accused of and endured against me, etc. I answered him: no one has accused him; an honorable council in Chur has publicly dealt with his case, interrogated and judged him. I have heard this and it is a public matter, so I let it be and do not interfere further; for I believe that an honorable council has done him no injustice, etc. And when he thought he had not been sufficiently heard; that he had not been rightly understood, I said: 'You have been heard, and a mayor has asked you, to which you answered, etc. Dear, if you are so innocent and upright, then write your mind to them correctly and do nothing else or against it.' He said: [I have] done so; but it helps nothing. [I said:] Then I can do nothing further for him; I let it remain as an honorable council has made it: [He concluded:] I ask for Christian love, that you would still show me love and intercede so that I may remain in peace with mine in my little estate; there I will harm no one, place my case with God, etc.' I wanted to inform you of some of this, but have only summarized it briefly. Therefore, I ask very kindly, if it is possible, that you would arrange for David Setzer in Basel, the poor fellow, to be left in peace, so that I too may come to rest. You sent me a letter after Martinmas through Mr. Jacob Geßner, in which there is something of importance, though I do not consider it much, since the letter is smooth and not heavy. I have sent it to Basel at your request and desire; I would have preferred never to have taken it upon myself to send it; for as I provided for it and then learned that nothing was accomplished, I became very anxious; for something happened some time ago that I no longer knew through whom I had sent it; for there are so many affairs and I am now forgetful, that I was quite at a loss until I was informed by the press that I had provided for it through David Setzer of Basel and that Julius Santerentianus had brought it to me, whereupon I called him and asked if he could inform me that I had given the much-mentioned letter to David, of which I also well remembered again.</p>
      <p>Thereupon I wrote at the request of a messenger, Doctor Stupano himself, how the matter had proceeded. Thereupon this week David Setzer comes with a complaint and says he acknowledges that I told him about a letter belonging to Dr. Stupano, in which there is importance, etc., to which he replied, he does not know Doctor Stupanus. Thereupon I said "Then give it now to Doctor Zwingger", and I gave him a package belonging to Doctor Ramus in Paris, and he gave it to Dr. Zwingger and never tampered with the letter of St[upani]. But Dr. Zwingger says, as he also wrote to me, he received the package and sent it away to France, knows nothing of any letter, moreover, I did not write to him about any letter belonging to Stupano, which is true; for I had prepared the package or letter for France beforehand and had forgotten the letter on the table, which Julius reminded me of, so I put it in the package, as Julius saw. Now David is a pious, honest fellow, had received some more importance to send at that time and carried it out faithfully, so I cannot accuse him of any unfaithfulness nor much less the honorable Doctor Zwingger, etc., who says he did not receive the letter. How it has now gone and how it was lost [or] where it has come to, I cannot and do not know to think. If it should oppose the poor fellow, who served me by taking it from me, and I cannot suspect him, I am very sorry and it is burdensome to him, whether it be much or little. Should it then come upon me, I would also not be very willing to receive it for my service, without that I am already more than enough troubled by this matter at this time, and this matter is adverse to me. I also gave no reward to David for sending the letter or package; for he was otherwise very willing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if it is possible, act in this matter as I trust you.</p>
      <p>Herewith I send and present to you and to Dr. Johannes Müller two little books, one for each; it will please you well, I know. Give Müller his; he will give you the newspapers that I have sent to both of you.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you. August 22, Zurich, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, his dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
