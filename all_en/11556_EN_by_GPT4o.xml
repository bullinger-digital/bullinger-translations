    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains that Bullinger suddenly takes Rudolf [Gwalther] away from him, whom he had taken in like a son and also recommended to the Prince [Philipp of Hesse]; even the princely council [Johann] Nordeck and the University of Marburg were willing to further support him. Since participation in the significant Diet, which is far from over despite the agreement on the doctrine of justification, would bring Gwalther lasting benefit, Draconites requests to let him return [to Regensburg].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I beseech you, dear Bullinger, not to be surprised that I, an unlearned man, dare to write to you, a learned man, especially since we are strangers. An overwhelming love compels me to complain to you, as if you were some god who has deprived a father of his son. Why do you write such effective letters to Rudolf [Gwalther] and cheer him up so much that he could not remain here, while you sadden me so much that I almost consider life bitter without him? Nor, my dear Bullinger, will I easily forgive you this offense (for what have I done against you?), unless you persuade me that in loving Rudolf, the rising sun of our homeland, I can be surpassed by you. For although your piety has anticipated me with benefits bestowed upon Rudolf, I too have always intended to bestow no lesser benefits upon him. First, I thought of moving every stone, as they say, so that Rudolf, due to his exceptional talents, would become most pleasing to our illustrious prince. And your wisdom knows that to please princely men is no small praise. But if Nordeck, that excellent counselor of the excellent prince, was no less prepared to do good in the same ways that your humanity now intends to affect him, why, my brother, do you thus hinder our plan, so that, as if hope is rejected, we are forced to say: "Where is he rushing off to now?" Then, what the great patron of talents, the University of Marburg, intended to do for your, indeed my, Rudolf, why, dear Bullinger, should I mention it, if what is done cannot be undone to our dismay? I omit to enumerate other reasons, lest you, like a father rejoicing at the return of a prodigal son, mock me as a little rhetorician and say: "What does it matter to me, as long as I have him now?" But truly, Bullinger, as dear to me as a member of Christ (for I cannot help but write freely what I feel), I consider you to be sinning against your, indeed my, and even our beloved son Corvinus, because you call him away from this theater of the world and, as it were, from confessing Christ before the emperor and the whole world, and do not allow him to see the end of these matters, which, as long as the spirit rules these limbs, it will be a joy to have seen and remembered. For what will it profit either Rudolf or us if you say in Zurich: "If I had known you were in Regensburg, I would not have called you away"? But what good does it do to lament here as if in calamity? Nor am I so foolish as not to know, Bullinger, why I bear so painfully the tearing away of Rudolf, the son of humanity, from me, especially by you, who, if he had been in Zurich, would have had to be sent away by you, so that he would not leave Regensburg before he had seen with his eyes and recorded in writing the prow and stern (as they say) of these assemblies. For although there is agreement from the adversaries on the foundation of our doctrine, I believe the article of justification, yet the end is not yet. And without a doubt, Rudolf could see such things here that would contribute to his being able to conduct himself more holily in the church, more learnedly in the school, and more prudently in the republic throughout his life. For as there have been no assemblies in our time more august than these, so you will scarcely find one or two who will relate the words and deeds of these assemblies to the benefit of both themselves and others as our Rudolf will. And what kind of young man is he? He seems to me to have been born a poet for this purpose, that he should equally benefit the school, the church, and the republic. Therefore, if you believe that we love Rudolf as much as you do, allow yourself, most learned Bullinger, not only to be entreated to send Rudolf back to us for a while, until these august assemblies pass, but also to be promised that if you comply with this request, you will never be affected by regret and we will send Rudolf back to you greater than himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell well in Christ and be well with your fruitful vine and olive branches leaping around the table into eternal life. My brothers Antonius Corvinus, Dionysius Melander, and Johannes Pistorius greet you and all the learned and holy men of Zurich, whom you will also bid farewell in my words, most lovingly.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Draconites.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and humane man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of Zurich, his brother and patron.</p>
