      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written to you for so long, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, is because no opportunity to write has presented itself to me until now, and also because (to confess honestly), I am more than sufficiently slow to write, especially to those whom I know are frequently greeted by the letters of many, as I know you receive quite a few from all corners of the world almost every day. Why then should I trouble you with my letters unless they are necessary? But this, I believe, also corrects my tardiness and negligence, as my spirit remains whole in love nonetheless. I am most rightly disposed towards you and all yours, whether I write or keep myself in silence. If only I could declare the goodwill of my spirit with some certain and worthy service; you would undoubtedly lack little or nothing in my zeal and willingness towards you. Therefore, let my hesitation in writing not bring you any sinister suspicion. However, the reason I am writing now is this: A good and pious young man, Johannes Huber from Neftenbach, has been with us for about a year and a half and has conducted himself so well both privately and publicly that he has gained considerable praise. We all loved him, especially those with whom he had domestic relations. Certainly, while he was with me in the college, I found nothing lacking in him. If the little house, into which I moved a year ago when I was relieved of the college prefecture, could have accommodated him, I do not doubt that he would have stayed with me until today. For we loved him in our whole family as if he had been born of us, nor did he seem to love us otherwise. He came to us quite unrefined; for he seems to have been neglected in his tender years. Considering the rawness he brought to us and the measure of his talent, he seems to have made satisfactory progress during this time with us. If he continues in letters and morals as he has begun, we do not doubt that he will become such a man that, if any learning is lacking, it will seem to be compensated by his goodness and piety. Since he, partly by our advice, partly by his own inclination, has decided to return to you and continue his studies in your school, he thought it by no means proper to proceed to you without my recommendation.</p>
      <p>Although no good and studious person needs a laborious recommendation with you, as you are naturally inclined to help such people, the love with which I pursue him makes me earnestly and repeatedly ask and beseech you to hold him in the highest regard, so that he is not disappointed in his hope, which persuades him that my recommendation will have great weight with you. These are the things I have at present, which you, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, should consider favorably and not forget us in your pious prayers. We must continually fight in the ministry of Christ against the worst kind of mortals and heretics, the miserably deluded Anabaptists, who greatly exercise me and the church I am in charge of. Therefore, we are in great need of those who rest from these men and seducers to pray diligently for us. I will write again (God willing) about what I endure from these most wretched people. May the Lord protect your churches from these and other fanatical spirits and eventually free ours; for they bring the greatest troubles. Farewell with all yours, my dear Lord Bullinger, whom you should greet most dutifully in my words, especially your sons-in-law, Mr. Huldrich Zwingli, our godfather, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Josias Simler, and also all your fellow ministers, Mr. Gualther and Mr. Johann Wolf and others. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Written hastily in Basel, November 17, in the year of our Savior 1555. Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary and most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
