    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer in Bern: his meeting with 120 pastors, his unity with the people of Zurich and Bern, and his successful attempt to reconcile the parties of Megander and Haller. Bullinger's visit would also be necessary. Haller again requests Bullinger's scholia on the Gospel of John. Bern wants to help the people of Bremgarten. Bucer's praise for the people of Zurich and Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. With Bucer, we convened with 120 gathered, just as with you. We discussed the abolition of the law, the Eucharist, the singing of psalms, and other matters. Nothing different was heard from you or from them. How we recognize sins in Christ and similar topics were introduced for the declaration of the past synod. Finally, as Bucer said, by the command of Leo and you, he attempted to remove the discord among us colleagues. How easily he could, since Megander returned to us. We spoke face to face in Bucer's presence, about what we desired in each other. If only we were united in heart as we are in speech, and may happy harmony persist among us. But above all, I would desire your presence. For when you console me so often with letters in your absence, you recall my mind to you, what would happen if I could pour out my thoughts, and at the same time the face of the brothers and the church, from mouth to mouth?</p>
      <p>Furthermore, send these letters to St. Gallen as soon as you find a trustworthy messenger. Therefore, I do not cease to pray "in season and out of season" [2 Tim 4:2] for your commentaries on John. Or send the explained part, if it cannot be otherwise, the first part of the first chapter up to here: "There was a man sent" etc. [John 1:6].</p>
      <p>Farewell. I realized the departure of the messenger too late. Our senate is considering how to assist the people of Bremgarten. When I learn the means, I will communicate with you, although I am entirely of the mind that nothing should be attempted without your and Glarean's input.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Bucer could not commend the ministers of Zurich enough, especially Bullinger, whom he had somewhat feared as a stubborn or obstinate young man, but now found to be a man piously learned and learnedly pious, and also very humane, which he could not praise enough.</p>
      <p>May 29th.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Leo, and others.</p>
      <p>Your B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
