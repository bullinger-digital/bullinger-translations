      <p>S. D. P. Your brothers and fellow ministers, dearest godfather in the Lord, could be a living letter to you from us: but since at the end of the letter, which you wrote to my godfather Mr. Haller through them, you again urge me to reveal what I think about the disciplinary correction and ecclesiastical excommunication, which some brothers today insistently urge, it seemed appropriate to write to you about this matter in three or four words. I believe no sensible person will deny that the discipline of correction and amendment is necessary for the churches.</p>
      <p>Regarding the manner of it, I do not agree with those who necessarily think it should be restored to the form of the early church, in which the magistrate was alien to the profession of the name of Christ. There it was necessary for judicial corrections to be exercised in the assemblies of the faithful, as can be seen in Tertullian's Apologeticus, Chapter 39. But now, after the fulfillment of Psalm 2: "And now, O kings, understand; be instructed, you judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and kiss the Son," etc., I believe the correction of vices and the punishment of delinquents, namely those not acquiescing to the word of doctrine, can be exercised partly through consistories, as they call them, in which both senators and ministers sit, chosen for this by the magistrate, and partly by the magistrate himself in more serious offenses and incorrigible crimes, so that there is no need to look back to the form of the earlier church. And the discipline that is in use in this manner should not be considered heathen, as if the magistrate were alien to the church and did not serve Christ the Lord by correcting vices and punishing delinquents. In summary, my opinion is that it is necessary to correct and amend sinners, but the method to be used should aim at edification, not destruction, and should be able to be maintained according to the quality of each church, and not only be initiated without any disturbance but also endure consistently and fruitfully. You have briefly what I think. And I have not concealed this opinion of mine in my writings, but have touched upon it, albeit briefly, as can be seen in John, Chapter 6, where it says: "There are some of you who do not believe." However, I would prefer to read your thoughts on this matter. Otherwise, by the grace of the Lord, I am well with mine. I hope that you are also doing well there. Farewell and greet your brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 29, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and dearest godfather in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
