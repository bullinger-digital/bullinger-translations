      <p>S. Here are Budaeus and another person from Lyon on behalf of the poor, who are now fleeing from everywhere to Geneva, and although a collection has already been made for them here (although it has not yet been given to them), which they are aware of, they still wish for future provisions as the number of these refugees increases daily. What more they might obtain here, I do not know, perhaps that collections be made in each church of this dominion as well as in the city. However, they will proceed from here to you; I wanted to inform you of this. I am also sending the letters from Lord Beza, which he writes to me; from which you will learn what rumors there are and how they also have nothing certain there. Meanwhile, while they are here, the people of Geneva send another messenger, through whom they write to us that the Duke of Savoy has again granted the passage he had previously denied; then those thousand horsemen, whom he was sending to the King of France, have been stopped by Movantio, and he is now planning to also attack the Swiss with the Italians; for they are cut off so that they cannot reach the king and their allies.</p>
      <p>A courier from our people also arrived the day before yesterday from Heidelberg and brought letters from the prince to our people; but what they contain, I do not yet know. This messenger saw the prince's son leaving Heidelberg on the 7th of December, and it is believed they have already reached France. May the Lord grant grace that they return with peace made! How the people of MÃ¢con handed over their city to the enemies, I think I have already written before, on the condition that they may leave with everything intact. One of them came here, who reports that they were completely lacking in gunpowder; if they had had it, they would never have surrendered. I have nothing else now.</p>
      <p>You will learn everything more accurately from Budaeus, whom I think will follow tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wish health to all of yours; all of ours also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 23, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
