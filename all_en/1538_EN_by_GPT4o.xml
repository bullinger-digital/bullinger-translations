      <p>Greetings. You have been silent for a long time, I do not know for what reason, unless perhaps because I too have not spoken. Indeed, I have been waiting for Osiander's booklet on justification from Strasbourg, where it was promised; but I have received nothing yet. I wanted to take the subject of writing from there; but since I was waiting in vain, it seemed that the silence had to be broken. Although even today I do not know what should be written, I will write whatever comes to mind.</p>
      <p>Today, as we were leaving the church, it was reported in the presence of the consul and two scribes, one from Basel and one from Mülhausen, that Philipp was in Trento with eight servants. We all wished for much grace and effective protection from the Lord, which he certainly needs among the sorcerous men.</p>
      <p>The Pope is said to have created 14 cardinals, and the Frenchman has drawn most of those of that dignity to himself; however, the Pope received from them up to six thousand gold coins.</p>
      <p>Schertlius wrote here more or less 14 days ago to the treasurer; the treasurer shared the letters with the lords to be read. They contained that the king had sent provisions to the Parmesans for 18 months, that an Italian duke had come with Spanish soldiers, who had lasted in Württemberg until now, to intercept the provisions; that the French had met them and killed six hundred Spaniards and put the rest to flight; thus the provisions entered Parma completely unharmed. Therefore, it does not seem likely that the Parmesans expelled the entire unarmed crowd and that a large part of them were captured, killed, and disgracefully treated by the enemies.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a relative of mine writes from Uri: the city of Volpiano in Piedmont was occupied by the French, and upon learning this, the entire army broke out before Parma and came into Piedmont; meanwhile, factions arose among some Lucerne and Sylvan soldiers, they came to arms and three Sylvans were killed, one of whom was the son of my recently deceased sister. A bad omen. Since my relative does not mention the expulsion, I hope again that it is fabricated.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Bibliander these days about Bolsec for a certain reason because we had dealt with that matter, that is, the election of God, among ourselves a few years ago. At that time, I had expressed my mind, as never before, not indeed stubbornly, but to learn if I was mistaken. He had replied then, so that he could never regret that action. And I still wish to know how that controversy pleases you. It seems to me that there is some hatred between the parties. I do not know if I am wrong. A captive wrote to us from prison, wondering why we act against him, since in this matter he clearly agrees with us against the Genevan brothers.</p>
      <p>He therefore requested that we reply, which we did not want to do, because we do not know whether it is appropriate to deal with captives without the consent of the magistrate, and it has not yet been declared by the brothers whether they also say that we agree with him; for while he asserts that faith precedes election, he certainly falsely boasts that he agrees with us.</p>
      <p>However, whatever the case may be, I am more moved by Osiander's dispute; for whatever has been said about justification so far, he tries to subvert. If we have erred, how many souls, I ask, have we led astray, how many have we handed over to hell? If Christ is not our righteousness, as we preach, Paul teaches us falsely, Jeremiah testifies falsely with clear and eloquent words. Indeed, what else does the entire Old Scripture promise? What else does the New assert? But if I see the matter correctly as much as I have seen, the man seems entirely: to be quibbling.</p>
      <p>But he thus disturbs the church. For good minds begin to doubt, not rashly saying: the priests deceive us, as the former ones did. But perhaps I babble too much about a matter which I do not yet understand well. Therefore, I await the promised booklet from Strasbourg. Farewell in Christ with yours. We wish you a good year, I say, and my ailing wife. You will greet Pellican, Theodor, Rudolf, Otto, and the rest in our name. Basel, January 19, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zürich, his esteemed friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
