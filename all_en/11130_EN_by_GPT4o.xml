      <p>Greetings. You have so greatly obliged me with so many services and benefits, most honorable and learned man, that I confess I would be committing many wrongs if I did not comply with your requests and fulfill your pious will. Indeed, I both owe and wish to undertake a task far more difficult, and you will never find me weary, so far from it that I do not comply now, but when a task cannot be completed by me alone, it should not be attributed to me, as it depends on another. Therefore, when Stapfer's will neither can nor wants to agree with mine, you will easily see the root of disobedience. He left the house, took away books and other things; he will be recalled with difficulty without my intervention, especially since I know he will boast that I am so greedy for his money and can be so fattened by it that I would retract him to me with its assurance. I gather this from past reproaches, as he has so often reproached his wife and children with his money, as if we must live off it and he gives out of benevolence. However, I am certain he will not receive 26 florins, which I gave him out of consideration for you and others (who interceded for him). For he alone repeatedly tried to occupy a spacious bed, throwing money in the way. But take the cause of his departure in a few words. We have a certain doctor of medicine, named Sebastian, who is wonderfully learned in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His wife and daughter came to visit my wife, who was not in the best health. My wife was in a very narrow hypocaust (a type of heating system) that could only hold one table. When they came, I went in to receive them. After receiving them, I ordered Stapfer to yield to the guests, as he occupied the better part of the table, from which the honorable guests had to sit in a worse place. I left; I thought he would yield. Finally, returning for the sake of decency, I saw Stapfer sitting in the same place and packing books, whom I again ordered with some irritation to go to his hypocaust, but he replied that the doctor's wife had allowed it. Therefore, he stubbornly held the occupied place, and not content with this, for when I went to read, he began to annoy the company with the smell of bitumen. Hearing these and other things upon returning from reading, I took it indignantly and said that such a disgrace not only fights with sacred letters but with laws, indeed against nature, and that it is better to lack letters than to make them accomplices of crimes. However, he was so moved that he immediately provided for himself, indeed he affected me with a new and sharp injury. Therefore, I did not think it right to retain him unwilling and reluctant any longer, although I thought it little permissible for him, whom I received by the authority of the curator and your intervention, to allow departure without your knowledge. You can gather from these things yourself what troubles he would cause if I took him back, nor do I doubt that you favor Stapfer in such a way that you do not begrudge me tranquility. Therefore, it is better that he be elsewhere, as it is honorable and useful for me to abstain from his company. If he had stayed with me, I would gladly listen to you instructing, whom it is pleasant to serve.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily. Greet your wife and mother and children. I rejoice that you have completed our number of children and congratulate you on all your happiness. Greet my lords, teachers, and brothers.</p>
      <p>In Basel, quickly, on the day of January in the year 1538. Your obedient</p>
      <p>Andreas Bodenstein (known as Andreas Karlstadt).</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief of the churchmen in Zurich, his venerable patron in the Lord always.</p>
