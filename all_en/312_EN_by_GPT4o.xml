      <p>Dear sir and brother. Since my affairs have now arranged themselves in such a way that I must venture to Constance and arrange my affairs in another way, and since my dear sister has shown herself completely willing towards me, also towards my wife and children, and has also shown it in deed, and has also completely friendly and sisterly offered herself, so to speak, always or as long as the dear God wants to have me elsewhere, and I have to give special thanks to God and her for such a loving offer, there are still many and various rumors being spread, as if neither I nor others could have security in Thurgau; for the king will practice with the places so that those who have left Constance may have no maintenance or place in common offices, and perhaps also with all places. This governor is particularly inclined towards the king's side, for he and the abbot of Kreuzlingen are constantly lying in the city with the chief and invite them back into the monastery. Therefore, my heartfelt request to you, according to the brotherly trust we have together, is that you watch over this place as much as possible, and if you hear anything, that you warn me with trust and in time, so that I may also understand in time where security will be. Also, if it could be arranged with propriety and peace that we could stay in Thurgau, to whom one must first bring such a matter, to the governor or to your lords or to the common confederates. For God's sake, we are asked. Wonderful rumors are being spread; but I and many others do not believe that the king, with his so gracious offer, will undertake anything against anyone in Thurgau at this time, or that the governor (be he as he may) will allow such a thing, as many other people also firmly believe; if it is to happen with the consent of the confederates, then one will have to know beforehand and a good man can be warned, as I hope, I may well experience through you in time. It is believed that the next day will bring what the king will undertake to obtain from the confederates; when or if a day is set, let me know.</p>
      <p>No news, except that my dear brother-in-law Peter will be able to tell you well or has already done so. If he has not been with you, Mr. Hieronymus can also tell you well what he has brought with him. May the Lord God grant us a more peaceful time.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus will give you a "Confessionem aquilÄ™" about the Interim; in my opinion, it would be well worth it to be printed and distributed in many copies, since the author himself gives his name and wants it to be a public confession; although the matter is not treated ex professo, but only the calumny is diluted, yet this courageous spirit is highly to be praised; for this man has great danger, indeed the highest here to withstand. May God preserve him, that he may remain steadfast and continue. Do here as you see fit; if you do not want to have it printed, then send it back to me immediately; consider, you may have seen it before as others have. (To you alone). The chief orders a council to write to His Royal Majesty that they wish to relax all arrests of goods in and before the city; also, that His Royal Majesty may lift the ban and re-ban, etc.; also, that His Royal Majesty wishes to protect the city against the bishop, priests, and all sorts of claims they have against it, with diligent narration of the impoverishment of the city and small means. The articles are more and partly have fallen to me; but these are the main ones, from which you can well understand how it will be an unpleasant herb for the bishop and priests that the city has become the king's and he is now the treasurer and everything is his and that he will make a poor compensation to them and cut everything to the nearest, also all other matters will not go smoothly from the city for their sake, as if Constance had remained a free city. Thus God can also excellently embitter the priests' joy.</p>
      <p>Oh, we ask with and very troubled, that the strong Lord God Zebaoth may raise his hand, sanctify and magnify his name, not disgrace the hope and heartfelt prayer of his own, but rather joyfully refresh them and give cause to praise and glorify his wonderful works. Amen, amen, amen.</p>
      <p>Given on October 21st.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
