      <p>S. D. I am very surprised, dearest brother, that, although you have always been diligent in writing, you are now completely silent.</p>
      <p>I wrote and sent my last letter through the most honorable man, Mr. von Cham, the consul. I hoped you would respond to me, but I have seen nothing yet, though I am waiting. Now I am writing to you especially, my brother, because of this Achaz Andreas, who you will understand what kind of person he is and has been from his testimonial letters. He came here and implored my help. Since I could do nothing else, I advised him to petition the most honorable senate; he did, but he obtained nothing except travel expenses. We have often been deceived by foreigners, which is why he also suffered rejection, and I am not surprised; the church is indeed too burdened. While he lingered, petitioned, and promised everything so that he would not be forced to return to where he came from, I took pity on the man, otherwise of excellent appearance; I promised to write to you on his behalf, if perhaps there is any place left for him with you, especially since I hear that the position in Jena is vacant with you, whose patron is our illustrious Georg Karl. If this is the case, I beg you to recommend this Achaz to him in my name. I cannot say for certain what kind of person he is, as I have only seen him for the first time these days. Let them try him for a time, and if he is as he promises to be, he will bring no small amount of benefit. Help him as much as you can, either here or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>As for the news coming from France, you have understood them before. But on November 22, a prominent merchant from Lyon wrote to me from the city that things have not gone as people say; it is true that the landsknechts were defeated; but of the cavalry of the admiral, not 200 have fallen, but he has inflicted on the king's nobility and best 1500 horses, and the admiral is still strong, lying at Montauban. His camp stretches from Rodez to Albi and Gaillac. Count Montgomery and the viscount can now come to him unhindered if the admiral wishes, and on the night of November 15, at two o'clock, the Huguenots stormed and took the city of Nîmes, killing all who resisted and throwing priests and monks into the wells. They took many in Auvergne and Languedoc, so that Cardinal Dornach sent his post on November 19 to the governor in Lyon and complained about how strong and numerous they are. Avignon is well fortified, but has no troops. What will become of this in Provence, time will tell. The Italians, what remains of the 5000, perhaps 800, are withdrawing from the king.</p>
      <p>The one from Lyon writes to me that they are a miserable people. - This is as much as I have from Lyon. Now there is also talk that Captain Cléry from Freiburg has also been defeated, and of the 10,000 Swiss, not much more than 3000 are left, and not even that many; this unfortunately creates many widows and orphans; but this is how people want it. May God have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Similar things are written to me from elsewhere, and I also see some hoping for peace, etc. If you have anything from Italy or elsewhere, share and explain how the matter of the bishop and the covenant of the House of God has turned out.</p>
      <p>Greet most kindly Mr. Karl Gregor, both consuls, Pontesella, Ganthner, etc., especially Mr. Franz, the merchant from Bergamo, who has been with you for a long time. Farewell forever with your household and brothers, and do not forget to commend me to Ruynella and greet him most respectfully.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 2, 1569. I did not reread; I was in such a hurry. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honored and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
