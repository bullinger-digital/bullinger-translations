      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest sir, I have followed up on your letter, called upon the bailiff for help and protection, and presented all my articles to him. He gave me a good, friendly response, etc. In the meantime, the lord of Tobel wrote to me on Easter day, asking me to come to him on Monday, hoping to negotiate with me. For such matters, I went there. He instructed me again to proclaim God's word in Märwil. Thus, I remain with my benefice and will be in Bussnang. I believe I will be at peace regarding the mass. He has also treated me well and received me with friendly words, praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I thank you for your great kindness and friendship, which you have shown me so effectively, and wherever I can repay it to God and otherwise, I shall be found willing. I believe the matter will develop for the best in due time, and the resentment will diminish. For such matters, I will endure and suffer, so that peace and love may be better preserved. And upon your improvement, when my lord's message comes to Frauenfeld, as I learn of it, I will also express my gratitude to them. However, if anything further arises from the adversaries, I beg you, for God's sake, to always keep me under your protection.</p>
      <p>After that, young lord Heinrich von Ulm sends you many good wishes and friendly greetings. And greet master Peter Mayer with all thanks for his help and love.</p>
      <p>Given at Bussnang on the first of April in '35.</p>
      <p>Hans Wähinger of Bussnang.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially gracious and dear lord, etc.</p>
