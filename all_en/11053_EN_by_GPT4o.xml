He requests that the response be sent with Peter Simler. Heinrich Simler has died.</p>

      <p>Grace from God, our Father.</p>
      <p>Regarding my house, about which I wrote to you recently, I say as before: May it please my gracious lords that they either sell it or appoint a hospital master to it, but not before I have another place that is convenient for me and the benefice in the hospital is comfortable. I cannot accept the schoolmaster's house on Kylhgasse and the similar barns. You cannot advise me to do so, nor to move my household items from my house to another, which I cannot accept or move into. For I know well how things will go afterwards. My gracious lords have much to do, and my matter would thus be put on the long bench. To prevent this, I will stay in my house until I am given a comfortable alternative or informed which house will soon be vacant and suitable for me. And if my gracious lords wish to favor me, they should arrange to write to me about it; then I will see where I can take my household items, although I would much prefer to be left in this one until one is suitable. For I think well, I will come sooner than I have ever intended. The water basin in the room I had made myself; I will take it back unless they buy it from me along with the hand basin that belongs to it. It is nothing but the bare empty house; everything else is mine. I wanted to write to you with good intentions and in German, so you can show it. Send me your answer with Herr Peter von Cappel and in writing from my gracious lords, as stated above.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Simler, Herr Peter's brother, has died. Nothing more, except may God always be with us.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the 26th day of June in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Caspar Großmann, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To his very dear lords and brothers Bullinger and Löwen in Zurich.</p>
