    <p xml:id="regest3">- In commenting on the Gospel of Luke, Bullinger proceeded as he did in the already published commentaries on the other three Gospels. He often refers to them. He had to work under great time pressure, but still hopes to have commented on the text conscientiously. If anyone knew anything better, it would not offend him. In his work, he did not disregard the interpretations of the ancient and contemporary exegetes and owes much especially to the late Erasmus and the learned and conscientious Johannes Brenz. [Konrad] Pellikan was also very helpful to him, collecting material for him, among other things. Above all, however, he is indebted to Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger dedicates his commentary on Luke to Hans Welser, so that he may surpass the virtues of his ancestors (who have held important offices in the city of Augsburg for about 400 years [cf. HBBW XVI 150,73-76]), and to strengthen Welser's steadfastness and faith.</p>

      <p>Many today complain about our turbulent times, but few judge the causes correctly. Those who seem to themselves to be the wisest, entangle the minds of their listeners and readers with many things that are of little relevance, when in truth there is only one true cause of all evils. Because we do not believe that all things pertaining to salvation and life are placed in one Christ, nor do we seek all things of life and salvation from Him alone, in whom alone our heavenly Father has given us all things that pertain to the perfection of a Christian man, we therefore turn to many and very diverse means of salvation and life, to which, while we cling tenaciously, and each one wishes to defend the opinion once conceived about obtaining salvation, and desires it to be accepted by all, contentions, party zeal, and wars arise; by which in the meantime the most just Lord severely punishes the unbelief, ingratitude, and rebellion of those who wish to perish of their own accord. However, that horrible punishment would undoubtedly cease and be removed if the contentions also ceased; these would cease if we all understood and believed that in one Christ all things of life and salvation are given by God, and therefore he who has Christ has all things of life and salvation. For thus all turned to the one, having cast aside and trampled upon all other means of life and salvation, we would desire nothing more after Christ, and therefore we would all be in concord in one Christ. I certainly, in order to contribute some counsel and aid to those still seeking truth and concord in Christ, not yet obstinate in the way of falsehood, will simply and with as much clarity as I can in this my preface teach and demonstrate that God the Father has given everything to His church in His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, which pertains to the life and salvation of man, so that it is not necessary to seek them elsewhere. For this demonstration will also illustrate not a little the evangelical doctrine, which we treat in these our commentaries. May Christ, the wisdom of the Father, the fullness of the church, and the prince of peace, grant that many may read these with a candid mind, receive the truth, and be saved in Christ, in whom alone is salvation.</p>

      <p>Christ Jesus, the Son of God, is the fullness of all believers, as the law itself teaches, and all the prophets testify. For what else do the law itself and the prophets propose, urge, cover, and inculcate under so many veils and so many prophecies concerning the perfection of man, than Jesus the Son of God? The apostle calls Him the fullness, perfection, and end of the law. He is covered and proposed in all figures and ceremonies. For whatever is most extensively handed down concerning sacrifices and priests, all that is perfected in one Christ, indeed Christ was foreshadowed by them, who is the true and only and highest priest, intercessor, and mediator between God and men, the only sacrifice once offered for the sins of the whole world. What is more, circumcision itself signified that one would arise from the seed of Abraham, who would truly circumcise and purify the people of God? The blood of the paschal lamb did not save and deliver from the destroying angel [cf. Ex 12, 1-14], but the blood of the Son of God gave life. The bronze serpent looked upon [cf. Num 21, 9] did not save Israel, but Christ suspended on the cross; manna also did not feed [cf. Ex 16 par], nor did the flowing water from the rock give drink [cf. Ex 17, 6], but the flesh and blood of the Son of God nourished believers unto eternal life. Therefore, although the ancients had many things to which the more ignorant attributed salvation, yet they justified and absolved no one, Christ the Lord also absolved and redeemed them as He did us, whom the law and the prophets foreshadowed and promised. Therefore, since He was exhibited to the church by God in His time, who does not see that with all shadows and types once abrogated, the faithful have all things of salvation and life most abundantly in one and only Son of God? Did not the apostle treat this very thing most extensively and show it most clearly in the epistle to the Hebrews? Furthermore, hear what John, the forerunner of the Lord, testifies: "Of His fullness," he says, "we have all received, and grace for grace; for the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ" [John 1,16f]. Hear again what the chosen vessel Paul teaches us: "See," he says, "that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. For in Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in Him, who is the head of all rule and authority" [Col 2, 8-10]. These alone could suffice to confirm our purpose. But we will declare and treat this summary more extensively as if in parts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The evangelical and apostolic scripture presents to us Jesus Christ our Lord, as the Lord, prince, and head of the catholic or universal church. But to be the head of the church is to confer salvation and illumination to the church, to be the perfection of the church, and therefore the supreme prince, who can and wills to be always present to the whole assembly of saints dispersed throughout the whole world, and to confer all things which are of life and salvation most abundantly. We bring forth this testimony of this matter, the apostle Paul to the Ephesians in the first chapter: "God raised His Son," he says, "from the dead, and made Him sit at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come, and He put all things under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all" [Eph 1, 20-23]. Behold, the head of the church is Christ, that is, the absolute fullness and perfection of the church, who indeed fulfills all things that pertain to the fullness and perfection of the whole church in all its members. In the 5th chapter the same apostle says: "Christ," he says, "is the head of the church, and He Himself gives salvation to the body" [Eph 5, 23], I say to the church. For the body is nourished and given life by the head; from the head flows the vital spirit into the whole body; therefore the church is given life and nourished by the spirit of Christ, illuminated, preserved, and governed.</p>
      <p>Those who consider how Christ, the head, prince, and highest priest of the church, has conducted Himself in the church, both by teaching and acting, and still does today, see and understand this more clearly. The Lord Himself concludes the sum of true and orthodox doctrine in repentance and forgiveness of sins, as can be seen in Matthew in chapter 4[17], in Mark in 1[14f], and in Luke in chapter 4[18[?]0] and 24[47]. Now if you distinguish these by parts, how He has handed over each one to the church peculiarly, you will say that the church has received and holds from Christ a doctrine that is as clear and pure as it is most absolute, to which nothing can be added or taken away, and no other better, simpler, or more perfect can be found among any. Repentance is a change of mind, and a conversion from Satan and evil, to God and good. But here, please see how it is proposed and declared to us with elegant examples and certain vivid forms. For the sinful woman of Galilee comes forth in Luke in chapter 7 [36-50]. The prodigal son comes forth in Luke in chapter 15 [11-32]. Zacchaeus comes forth in the same in chapter 19 [1-10]. To these are added Peter the denier [Lk 22, 54-62], and the thief crucified for his crimes [Lk 23, 42f]. For all these repent with a full mind, acknowledge the sins committed against God, seriously regret that they have provoked the most merciful God and Father, and therefore confess openly that they are sinners, and supplicate for mercy, asking for pardon; finally, they renounce Satan, whom they have served until now, and turn entirely to God, in whose holy will they intend to live henceforth. In all these examples you will find nothing venal, nothing that refers to men. God alone hears and receives the confessor; conversion is made to God alone; the whole mind is consecrated to God alone. The priest, the victim, and the satisfaction is Christ.</p>
      <p>The consideration of the law and sin pertains to the place of repentance. The Lord expounds the law in such a way in Matthew and Luke that we all understand that sin is not erased by the law, but is excited and comes into our knowledge; there is nothing in our powers that satisfies the law, therefore we need an alien righteousness and perfection. But this is more fully and perspicuously declared by the apostle of Christ Paul in the 7th chapter to the Romans and the 3rd chapter to the Galatians. From where sin is, what it is, and what it effects, the Lord Jesus Himself has explained in these words in John, than which nothing could be more clear or thought of: "You," He says, "are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, because he is a liar and the father of it" [John 8, 44]. And again: "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever" [John 8, 34f]. And again: "You will die in your sins" [John 8, 21. 24]. With this evangelical doctrine agrees the apostolic. For the apostle James says: "God," he says, "cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death" [James 1, 13-15]. Therefore, that perverse sin is what is done against the law and against the right and good will of God. It arises from our affections and satanic suggestion, and works in us condemnation and death. To this pertains the doctrine of original sin, as they call it, and of the powers of man not yet reborn. "In sins we are conceived and born children of wrath and condemnation; nor are there any powers in us for good, but most equipped for evil" [...]. The Lord taught this simply in the gospel with these words: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Nicodemus, unless one is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God" [John 3, 3]. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" [John 3, 6]. But the apostle says: "Those who are in the flesh," he says, "set their minds on the things of the flesh. But the mind set on the flesh is death, and is enmity against God. For it does not submit to the law of God, indeed it cannot. Therefore, those who are in the flesh cannot please God" [cf. Rom 8, 5-8]. And still more significantly in the gospel the Lord says: "As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. Because without me you can do nothing" [John 15, 4-6].</p>
      <p>Since these things are so, and no hope of life and salvation appears from any flesh, indeed all flesh is subject to condemnation and death, it is clear that salvation and righteousness are conferred on the saints from elsewhere than from us. Therefore, here another place of orthodox doctrine offers itself, namely the forgiveness of sins. Concerning this the Lord says in the gospel according to John: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son for the world, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life" [John 3, 16]. No merit or good work preceded that moved the Lord: It is a free grace that He bestows on the world; hence the apostles taught with one voice that we are justified and saved by grace, without any merit of our own. For the source of our redemption and salvation is the mercy and free love of God; from it He gave us the Son, and in the Son life. For you have in the words of our Savior, in whom is our salvation and righteousness and sanctification and life, in Christ Jesus Himself, I say. To which Paul the apostle agrees: "Jesus Christ," he says, "was made for us by God wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption" [1 Cor 1, 30]. And Peter the apostle says: "There is no salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" [Acts 4, 12]. You see that all things of our salvation are thus entirely and solely ascribed and attributed to our Lord Jesus Christ, so that no one at all is admitted to share in it. Furthermore, you have how the righteousness, life, and salvation of Christ are communicated to us, so that we too are righteous, alive, and saved, namely through faith if we truly and from the heart believe in Christ. Therefore it is repeated so often: "He who believes in Him has eternal life" [John 3, 36]. But the apostles, especially Paul, clearly demonstrate that righteousness is not conferred on us by the law, not by works, or any merits, but by faith alone. For this pertains to the entire discussion of the epistles to the Romans and Galatians. And we have copiously discussed this matter in our preface to the gospel of John. However, the term forgiveness beautifully comprehends all these things, and excellent examples are proposed to us, by which sins were forgiven, it is added through whom and how they were forgiven. Nor do I wish to bring forth any other here than those very ones which we brought forth a little earlier when we spoke of repentance, namely the sinful woman of Galilee, the prodigal son, Zacchaeus, Peter, and the thief. To all these sins were forgiven freely, which they comprehended by faith. It remains therefore undoubted that Christ Jesus is the true and only righteousness, sanctification, purification, salvation, and life of the universal or catholic church.</p>
      <p>To this place now pertains the discussion of the powers of the justified or restored, of free will, of merit and reward, of good works and the office of the righteous or servants of God. With what brevity and clarity, I ask, does our head, the wisdom of the Father and our high priest Christ Jesus, complete this? For His apostle John says: "As many as received Him, He gave them the power to become children of God" [John 1, 12]. And the Lord Himself says in the gospel: "The slave does not remain in the house forever. If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be truly free" [John 8, 35]. And again: "He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit" [John 15, 4]. Therefore the powers of the justified are strong for good, not indeed by themselves, but from the power of faith and the spirit, which they have received from Christ, by whom they are finally renewed and confirmed in good. And what they do, they do not do unwillingly and by compulsion, but willingly and voluntarily, imbued with a free spirit and made free by the Son of God, who has given them freedom, so that all the works of the faithful are free and proceed from the free. However, because all the good things that are in us are the grace and work of the spirit of God working in us, the saints do not boast of any merits of their own, but according to the doctrine of Christ, even if they did all that was commanded them, they would nevertheless say: "We are unprofitable servants, we have done what we ought to have done" [Luke 17, 10]. From the same grace and goodness and the truth of the promise, the faithful know that a reward is prepared for them in heaven, which when they receive, they acknowledge that they receive a gift from God. However, when asked not once about good works, the Lord always referred to the Decalogue. For good works follow from faith. For John says: "He who is righteous practices righteousness" [1 John 3, 7]. But the prophet cries out: "The righteous shall live by faith" [Hab 2, 4]. The same Lord our describes the office of the saints: "All things," He says, "whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them" [Matt 7, 12]. Also: "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" [John 13, 34f]. To this pertains the salutary doctrines of the apostles of the Lord Jesus, to the Romans 12 and 13, 1 Thess. 4, 1 Peter 2, James 1, 1 John 3.</p>
      <p>All these things are indeed brief, but open and simple, which all things whatsoever are of pure doctrine, and can be rightly taught from these heads, they comprehend, and show all true salutary and good things in Christ our head. To what end, I ask, does it now pertain to affix another head to the church besides Christ, namely the Roman pontiff? Is it not blasphemous and extremely impious, that is, antichristian, to attribute to a creature and indeed a wicked man, those things which are Christ's alone, and cannot be communicated to any angel, much less to any man? Certainly, he who believes that Christ is the head of the church will abhor the pontiff; nor will he ever allow himself to be persuaded that the church of Christ, the bride, is a two-headed monster. One head suffices for him, in which he knows he possesses all things of light, truth, and life in the whole. Since finally the doctrine of our Lord Jesus our head is simple concerning repentance and forgiveness of sins, what, I ask, is the need to impose new, convoluted, and alien sentiments from piety on the church, concerning auricular confession, the absolution of the priest, satisfactions, and indulgences; from which the teachers gain more profit than piety. I will not now speak of the thorny disputes instituted by some concerning sin and the law. What has been handed down so far concerning justification by the priests and monks is known to the bleary-eyed and barbers. Justification has been attributed to our works and merits, and to I know not what means. Furthermore, a certain purification has also been invented in another world, which they say is done by a certain purgatorial fire. To these are praised those things as truly good works, which the Lord has not deemed worthy of any honor, but said: "In vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men" [Matt 15, 9]. Thus, however, they depart from the pure simplicity of our head, and foreign doctrines are offered to the church, which while he who falsely claims to be the head of the militant church wishes to defend and persuade all, from there certainly arise innumerable evils, from which we will never be freed unless content with the head Christ, we follow His simple and pure doctrine, acknowledging Him alone to be the head, light, salvation, life, righteousness, propitiation, and sanctification of His church, through whom it is most fully absolved and perfected, so that it is not necessary to adopt anything else after Christ to perfect it from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Thus indeed there would be fewer contentions today in the church of Christ concerning intercession and expiatory sacrifice with God, if we all rightly considered what Christ, the head of the church, has done and still does in the church; if finally we acknowledged what the heavenly Father has given us in Him. For Christ the head is also the priest and sacrifice of His church, as the only one so eternal and always effective. Therefore, while He was acting on earth, He taught to invoke the name of the one Father, with His intercession, saying: "Whatever you ask the Father in my name, He will give you" [Mark 11, 24]. Hence John also said: "If anyone sins, we have an advocate or patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world" [1 John 2, 1f]. The apostle Paul calls Him "a merciful and faithful high priest, who can sympathize with our weaknesses" [Heb 2, 17]. But now, since He sits at the right hand of the Father in glory, He knows nothing, but He has all power. Whom therefore will you find more suitable as an intercessor with the Father than Him who is appointed by the Father as intercessor, who is merciful, who knows all things, and can do all things? Whom will you give among the saints, who can do these things? Furthermore, the priesthood of Christ is unchangeable, nor does He take anyone into participation; therefore He alone appears at the right hand of the Father as intercessor for all; so that the pious now know it is impious to adopt intercessors for themselves from elsewhere. In the same way, since our Lord was offered once for all for the sins of the whole world, and is no longer offered, all the saints in the church acknowledge that all sins are purged and forgiven by the one sacrifice of Christ, since it is always effective; therefore they do not believe that the Lord is offered in those papal masses. For they are content with the one offering. Who indeed from all these things does not gather that all things which are of life and salvation are most fully given by God the Father to the church, in Christ Jesus our Lord?</p>
      <p>For Christ is the priest of His church, intercessor, mediator, victim, and that perpetual and unique. Therefore no other priest and intercessor, no other victim for sins does the holy, pious, and faithful require than Christ the Lord Himself. He is the shepherd of His church, and remains the shepherd to the end, with no other successor or vicar substituted; therefore He cares for, defends, feeds, and governs His own, He is nowhere absent from them, He is everything to His flock. The flock of this shepherd is the faithful church, which leans on Him as the only and eternal foundation, which believes in Him alone, depends on Him, follows Him uniquely, according to that: "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, nor shall anyone snatch them out of my hand" [John 10, 27f]. Indeed, to keep His little sheep in duty, He instituted ministers of the word and sacraments; those to teach, exhort, rebuke, and comfort through the word, and to preserve the faithful in just discipline; these to retain the benefits in memory, to seal them, and to gather us into unity, which being bound to Him, praises and gives thanks to Him continually. For the faithful church worships God alone, supplicates to Him alone, adores Him alone in spirit and truth; it does not worship the dead, much less the images of the dead or the living. It believes it has all things in Christ, and because it believes, it seeks nothing outside of Christ. For concerning this prince, head, and our fullness, the apostle testifies thus: "Through Christ we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, because by Him all things were created, that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist; and He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven" [Col 1, 14-20]. These words of the apostle, as they confirm all that we have said so far, so they also beautifully present the epilogue of all disputations. With these agree both the evangelical and prophetic writings. For in the gospel the Lord cries out: "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water" [John 7, 37f]. "All things have been delivered to me by my Father. Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" [Matt 11, 27f]. In Isaiah the Lord cries out: "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in abundance. Incline your ear, and come to me. Hear, and your soul shall live" [Isa 55, 1-3].</p>
      <p>O therefore happy are we, if we hear the king and high priest to our head Christ Jesus, our all-sufficiency and fullness. In this one our minds, disjointed by various means and opinions, will undoubtedly coalesce. For if we acknowledge from the heart and with true faith that this is our head, our righteousness, satisfaction, life, and salvation, our priest and intercessor, finally our only sacrifice, certainly having dismissed all those things in which we have hitherto trusted and used, we will rest in Christ alone; in Him therefore solid peace and tranquility would be restored to the church. I therefore exhort all lovers of peace and those desiring the concord of the church, to diligently consider these things among themselves, and to turn all their studies to this, that all may understand that God the Father has given all things of life and salvation to the church in the Son. For by this glue, and by no other, the faithful church will finally be joined and retained in holy concord.</p>
      <p>However, I have touched on this argument more truly than I have treated it in this my preface, nor indeed did I think there was need for a more prolix dissertation, especially since all the books of commentaries written on Luke sound nothing else nor urge anything else. Blessed Luke described the sayings and deeds of Christ, and the affairs of the church for thirty-one years, during which the whole world received the evangelical preaching; as the apostle himself testifies Col. 1 [15-23] and 1 Tim. 3 [14-16]. But who would have thought that the world did not receive the full preaching from the apostles for so many years? But during all this time by all the apostles and the disciples of the apostles, nothing else was preached but one and only Christ, and in Him alone all things. For from the 15th year of Tiberius to the 18th year of the same, first indeed John the Baptist preached only Christ, then Christ Himself taught all to seek salvation in Him alone. From the 18th year of Tiberius, and from the very ascension of the Lord into heaven, and the sending of the Holy Spirit until the 4th year of Nero, which was the thirty-first year from the beginning of the preaching of the gospel, all the apostles, as the Acts of the Apostles clearly testify, preached only Christ, and in Him all things of life and salvation. Therefore St. Paul in a frequent sermon in Antioch in Pisidia, speaking about the Christian religion, among other things: "Let it be known to you," he says, "men and brethren, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins, and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses" [Acts 13, 14 and 38f]. Therefore, antichristian voices are those that say not all things are handed down in the scriptures, nor are all things of our life and salvation contained in Christ; and it remains orthodox and catholic that in Christ all things of life and true salvation are exhibited to the church.</p>
      <p>However, I have narrated the evangelical history according to Luke in my manner, in which I have also explained the other three evangelists; therefore I have not infrequently referred the reader to these. I have written all things very hastily; yet I hope I have used good faith everywhere. But if anyone has had it revealed to him better, I will not envy. For I have not despised the explanations of those who wrote before me, I have read and reread the expositions of both the ancients and the more recent ones, which I could have, and they have often been very helpful. Among the more recent ones, I think the first praise should be given to the blessed memory of Mr. Erasmus. Students also owe much to Mr. Johannes Brenz, a man diligent and easy in explaining the scriptures. Our Mr. Pellikan has collected a compendium from the best of all, and has strived to benefit many. But we must give the greatest thanks to our prince and head Christ, who continually gives teachers and interpreters to His church, by whose faith and diligence the mysteries of the kingdom of God are revealed for the salvation of the faithful.</p>

      <p>To you, Mr. Welser, most noble man, I dedicate these my labors, and willingly inscribe them to your name, otherwise most illustrious: for no other reason than that the faith, which you learned from the servants of God long ago and still religiously keep in the Lord Jesus, may be much more firmly retained by you after reading and considering this commentary on the Lord Jesus, and that you may be confirmed in the pure Christian religion. For the very work which I have interpreted was inscribed by blessed Luke to Theophilus [Luke 1, 3] for no other reason than that he might know the certainty of those things in which he had been instructed. You indeed shine with distinguished gifts and virtues, even with the fame of your ancestors. For your ancestors held the consulship of the renowned and ancient city of Augsburg four hundred years ago, whom you strive to equal and almost surpass in virtues; but you excel especially in the pursuit of piety and religion. For you have not moderately helped when the holy church of Augsburg was being reformed according to the evangelical doctrine. You understand that the wealth, which you have otherwise acquired most abundantly, is deceitful, therefore you think about obtaining and retaining the eternal treasure. May the Lord Jesus our Savior grant you to have this mind perpetually. In Him I wish you, together with your most honorable wife, dear children, and your entire famous family, to be well. Keep commended to you, most illustrious man, all those who are zealous for piety, especially the faithful ministers of Christ and the church, whom the church of Augsburg has many, my venerable and beloved brothers in the Lord.</p>
