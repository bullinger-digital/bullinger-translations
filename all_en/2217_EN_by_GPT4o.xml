      <p>Greetings, most esteemed of men. I visited the Engadin at the time I mentioned to you; I was there for a full month, preaching every other day and traveling through the communities. I spoke fervently, as I was not granted the time by my lords here to remain there long. Many people always came from other places to our sermons, indeed they flocked in groups, both women and men, to hear the gospel and to witness the debates between the priests and me. The priests were given the opportunity to speak before noon, while I spoke in the afternoon. But the hearts of all the people were stirred by our Bishop of Chur, who, as soon as he learned that I had gone to the Engadin, specifically to the village where he was born and where his parents and relatives still live, immediately sent two priests from his court there to act against me in some way. However, I found out that they did not say a word against me; what they might have said secretly to their own and the bishop's friends, I am not certain, nor does it seem to matter much. I can assure you of this: if you had seen the sixty and seventy-year-olds (of whom the Engadin has more than any other region due to the healthy climate and moderate lifestyle), with their gray and completely white hair and beards, if you had seen them running and listening with such attention, by the immortal God! you would have been seized with ineffable joy. With us stood Johannes Travers, that man of adamantine resolve in the Lord's work, and with him a great crowd of nobles; for almost all these followed the lord's side, as did many of the wealthy. And to hear of the strength of our Travers: I, who am called the fiercest proclaimer against papism, was at times not fierce enough for him; yet he agreed with the more moderate. But you ask especially what we have achieved through the Lord. After it seemed to me that I should return to Chur and I arrived here not entirely without danger, Travers and the people of Zuoz, acting with votes, emerged victorious, and the number of those who no longer want the mass was found to be far greater than those who want it. Behold, in such a short time, how much work the Lord has done through us unworthy ministers! For there is no greater community in our Confederation than that of Zuoz, nor any more renowned except for Chur. We fully hope for the same from the two other communities and churches near Zutz. The priests (to use your term) fear their chapter more than they have for several years. I am told not to preach against the chapter, which Travers and I are trying to undermine; to this, I respond that I preach the gospel, whatever the Lord may do with it, and I do not seek to abolish the canons and the chapter, but to abolish the mass and remove any abuses, if there are any, and to reform everything to a better and original state, from which some benefit may return to the communities. Therefore, I ask you to briefly outline for me the reform you have made with your canons. - I give immortal thanks for the kind reception you gave my son and for honoring him with your letters. Dr. Sulzer advises me to also write to others who have the power to admit stipendiaries, which I will do, sending a copy to you along with the letters to them in the next eight days. I could not be briefer. I have money here in Basel to send to the students; I will send it when I have found a reliable messenger. Farewell, most esteemed man, and do not cease to love your Philippus.</p>
      <p>Commander, Johannes Travers, who reads your Decades most eagerly and praises them to the skies, Ponticella, Tschernerus, send their greetings to you. From Chur, on the 12th of March, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your devoted Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
