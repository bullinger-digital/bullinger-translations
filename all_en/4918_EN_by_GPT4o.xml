      <p>Greetings. I (reverend father in Christ) am called away with Lord Philipp to the nearby village, to assist a brother who is conducting a legal case against the priests, and therefore I am briefer than I would like. The Pope's and Philipp's envoys are still expected.</p>
      <p>Jodocus Tschudi wrote to a great man of the Upper League some vain news, either fabricated by others or by himself; however, he pretends to have heard it in Solothurn from Frölich. The main point of the letter (which I myself read) was this: Philipp urged the King of France and the nobles of his kingdom through his envoys to return to the bosom of the church; if they do not, he will attempt extreme measures, and from this, it was decreed by the king and parliament that all Lutherans must leave France within a month, with the penalty of death announced to those who would be found after a month. The matter of religion was referred to the Council of Trent, to which King Philipp is considering sending his ecclesiastical nobles around mid-August. Furthermore, the Bishop of Terracina, who is on a mission in Spain, writes that the King of Navarre has abjured that Lutheran sect and returned to his former grace with King Philipp. After this, the artificer adds that it is known to him through certain and reliable witnesses that the Pope's and Philipp's envoys will soon be present; he asks that they be kindly heard. He writes this out of a singular love, with which he is affected towards Rhaetia; for he fears some warlike movements, which threaten unless the Rhaetians comply with the envoys. This is the summary of the letter.</p>
      <p>These things have been so spread throughout the entire Upper League that there is almost no one who has not himself inspected a copy of the letter.</p>
      <p>However, you easily understand with your prudence, to what end all these things are. The assembly will be held not in Chur, but in Ilanz, a place most suitable for these men for this one purpose. Since these things are so (reverend father in Christ), I absolutely wish to know from you what is happening in France, so that I may close the mouths of the malevolent and raise the good to better hope. My relative indeed wrote some things, but more obscurely; I think he himself did not understand the matter. But around the same time, I received letters written in Basel on August 14th by Mr. Gratarolo, which testify that all is well in France. I wrote this in haste; for now, I am called to the journey by Lord Philipp (who also wishes you well). Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, for as long and as happily as possible. As you advise, we will be vigilant, mindful in the meantime of this: Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. He must also be asked to bless our efforts.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 18th, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
