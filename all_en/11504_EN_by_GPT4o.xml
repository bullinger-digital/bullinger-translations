    <p xml:id="regest1">The Worms Colloquy, after a four-day dispute over the second article of the Augsburg Confession, i.e., the doctrine of original sin, has been adjourned without result to the Diet of Regensburg; Zwick finds it concerning if the evangelical doctrine is to be derived from the enclosed articles by [Johannes] Eck [and Melanchthon]. It is to be feared that [Sultan] Suleiman will soon teach us to dispute. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Comparative articles by Eck [and Melanchthon] on original sin.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I have been silent for some time, having nothing to write, there is still nothing of great importance for you to know, except that the Worms Colloquy has ended with great expenses and no results.</p>
      <p>Our side had long ago presented the Augsburg Confession, ready to hear what the opposing side would refute; but after a long deliberation and omitting the article on the Trinity, they moved on to original sin, about which I am sending you what was debated. The rest is to be resolved at the Diet of Regensburg. Alas, the remarkable foolishness of the wisest men! These articles were written by Eck and presented to our side, and the debate lasted four days, and although they agreed on many points, they could not agree on whether the material of original sin in the reborn can be called sin or not. Now, if our theology is to be learned from Eck's quibbles, we are certainly in a miserable situation.</p>
      <p>But now we will wait to see what the coming days will bring us. However, some think that young Sultan Suleiman with the turban on his head will soon teach us to dispute.</p>
      <p>But may the Lord's will be done, in whom farewell and do not cease to love us. Ambrosius sends you his most studious greetings along with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, February 9, 1541. You will greet your wife and mother, and finally the children, in my name most dutifully. Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent pastor of the church in Zurich, his brother.</p>
