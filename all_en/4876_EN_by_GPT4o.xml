      <p>Greetings. Although I wrote to you yesterday through a baptized Jew, I must now, at the request of the bearer of this letter, trouble you once more. He has until now presided over the church among the Rhaetians in that part of the dominion which is called Prättigau. However, having been called by a certain brother of his into the dominion of Margrave Philibert of Baden, he hoped to find a position there. But having been rejected, either due to insufficient education or because of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, or perhaps both, he is now completely exiled along with his pious wife and two children, unless he is taken back by his own people in Prättigau.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask you (since I cannot do more myself) that, if any position is vacant in Thurgau or Toggenburg, you might recommend him for it. I also ask that you encourage him to diligent reading of the Scriptures and a pious life; for I hear from his wife serious complaints, so he needs encouragement, indeed also advice and consolation, lest he think of returning to Egypt to the flesh pots. I also hope that if he had books and were in a place where he could associate with pious and more learned people, he would return to a better way of life.</p>
      <p>What if you were to write to Mr. Haller on his behalf, in case the Lord might assign him a place in some small church in the Bernese territory. You, with your wisdom, will judge what is best to do.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and consider what you do as a good deed. For we owe something even to such as these.</p>
      <p>Basel, 16th of July, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in doctrine and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
