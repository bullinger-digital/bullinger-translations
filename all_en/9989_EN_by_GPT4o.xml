      <p>Although, as I wrote, I traveled to Heidelberg beyond all my expectations, and I add, unwillingly, I nevertheless discussed with Doctor Erastus and other friends how I might have been able to summon Jodocus [Szadkowski] from you to Heidelberg, so that I could have taken him with me in the convenience I currently have, by carriage to our homeland. However, since we could not find any way to bring Jodocus in such a short time, and I am pressed by the grave necessity of returning to the kingdom's assembly, for I have been ordered to return by the Palatine of Krakow and other patrons of our church, I see no other way for Jodocus to return to our homeland unless I know your advice on whether he can be sent from Zurich to Nuremberg with some drivers through St. Gallen, provided it is done safely. There, I would arrange with the Gutteter and our Schlissemberger what should be done next according to the advice of his magnificent guardians, whether he should stay a little while in Nuremberg for the sake of practicing his art, or be sent most safely by the Gutteter to Krakow. But if this cannot be done, then no other way remains except for him to come with Froschauer to Frankfurt and then to Leipzig to Ludwig Camerarius, the son of Joachim Camerarius, and finally to Krakow, although it would not be as easy for us to bring him back from Frankfurt to Krakow as it would be from Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I earnestly request from you, not only in my name but also in the name of the magnificent lords, the guardians of Jodocus, that you inform me as soon as possible by a note which way you think is the most convenient to send him back, and that it be done without delay, so that I can also make arrangements in those places for the people he might turn to, especially if you think he should travel through Frankfurt. For there, a delay would be very harmful to him, just as if you judged he should go through Nuremberg, for nothing would be neglected on that route. However, I cannot make any plans about him unless I am instructed by your letters on this matter. As for the money, if your letters are delivered in time and you indicate how much should be sent, the money will be with our Schlissemberger in Nuremberg without delay. If, however, things turn out differently, or if the money gets stuck somewhere due to the negligence of others and not mine, spend from your own temporarily. I promise you in good and holy faith to repay at least the smallest amount without any delay, and you should believe this as you have ever believed anything from me. In summary, nothing seems safer to me than to discuss by letters once and again about sending Jodocus, so that we can decide on the necessary matters for him. This can be done if you inform me that he can be easily sent through Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>With these, I again and again commend myself to your reverend paternity and most respectfully greet your sons, my esteemed brothers and lords, and your daughters.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you have understood that Johann Miscovius, together with Nikolaus Miscovius, has gone to Italy, while the Cikovii are courtiers, one is at the court of the Transylvanian, the other in Lower Germany with some prince, I do not know which. Laurentius Zemlinus is serving in the ministry and is conducting himself well. Caspar [Malinius] is now with me, and I have decided to leave him in Wittenberg with Esrom, a pious man, for one year, for I do not have the means to support him longer.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, I will dedicate him to the school and the church of God. What just came to my mind is that the treasurer of the kingdom, formerly the cupbearer, to whom you sent your book on the origin of error and who also decided to send gifts to you, has strongly asked me to bring his son, a boy of excellent character, to these regions. If this were to happen, I would visit you all before September and then finally take Jost [Szadkowski?] with me. But since these things are not yet certain, do not neglect to write to me your advice about the journey.</p>
      <p>August, Heidelberg.</p>
