    <p xml:id="regest1">He already wrote to him on May 3, 1534. Since then, there has been a debate among the Bernese theologians with Claude d'Aliod. He denies the divinity or at least the pre-existence of Christ, the divinity of the Holy Spirit, and the persons of the Trinity. Haller adheres to Bullinger's statements on this matter, among others in his commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, but would like to have the term "Person," which was also replaced by others, including Zwingli in his "Commentarius de vera et falsa religione," explained in more detail. He fears that Guillaume Farel might also become an Antitrinitarian. Bullinger should already respond through the bearer of the letter, Hans or Jakob? Funk.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I had prepared another letter while I had some leisure time and the messengers from Fribourg were handling their affairs, most learned Heinrich.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we conversed with this Frenchman, who, although not in his right mind, seems born for stubbornness and contention. He first asserts that Christ is merely a man. Then, when pressed by us with the clearest scriptures, he admitted that Christ is the natural son of God and therefore is God, but not eternal, rather established in time, preordained, 1 Peter 1:20, and made, Acts 2:36, and that this otherwise pure man is the object of our faith. He was answered sufficiently and abundantly, but not satisfactorily. For a stubborn person cannot be satisfied. We warned the man to keep this erroneous faith to himself, which I know he will not do. It remains for us to prove to him that the Holy Spirit is God and eternal, which he asserts is a creature. He denies the Trinity, the persons, both in terms of the word and the matter. I have seen your writings on the Hebrews and other places, which have given me great occasion to think. I am stuck on this, not fully understanding what the word "person" means, which Zwingli calls a notion in "True and False Religion," while others call it names of operations, others relations or properties. I have seen the scholastics in the first book of "Sentences"; but I do not know how to extricate myself from all of them. Thus, I am always compelled to trouble you in all things. You will give me occasion to think in a few words, provided you outline the essence of the matter. I fear that Farel might also be caught in this error. Therefore, you will take care, as soon as you can - and you can through this messenger, the son of our Funk - to respond. I think the matters make us one. The rest is in the previous letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May 7, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his especially beloved lord and brother.</p>
