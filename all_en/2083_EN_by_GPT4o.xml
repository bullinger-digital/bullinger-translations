      <p> Greetings. I suppose, dearest brother in the Lord, that you have already learned that Mr. Bernardino Ochino from Siena was recently in Basel, having fled from England, that miserable and in many ways calamitous place. I have not yet learned where Peter Martyr is, and I greatly fear for him because of the English papists. I ask you, if you have any certain information about him and other good men, please share it. This ruin of the English churches is miserable, which, in their very prime, are subjected to the cross beyond everyone's expectation, indeed they are endangered concerning the truth of Christ. The pope's legate passed through Augsburg at the beginning of this month, seeking England to confirm the slaves of the antichrist there and to harass the members of Christ. We must pray to the Lord night and day for the brothers in danger. </p>
      <p> The people of Augsburg are again enlisting soldiers. The Margrave is said to have been defeated for the third time; Duke Johann Friedrich seems to support his side, and the hand of the Emperor does not seem to be lacking to him. The confusion of our Germany is shining forth marvelously. Mr. Schertlin has returned to Augsburg, under what conditions, I do not know. Meanwhile, I am sending you our Decalogue, namely the waters of the sea; but this must be done when I have nothing better. </p>
      <p> Consider these things well. By the grace of the Lord, we are well. I hope the same for you and yours. Greet all yours, Mr. Theobald, Pellican, Gwalther, and the others. Bern, 1553, November 22, the day on which the Protestant army in the year 46 split from each other and opened all gates to the Emperor. </p>
      <p> Your Wolfgang Musculus. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear brother and compatriot. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
