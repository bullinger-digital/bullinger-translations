      <p>S. The learned man Franciscus Portus has passed through here.</p>
      <p>He reported to me that you had instructed him to tell me that Mr. Coignetius wrote that some part of the pension was paid to our people.</p>
      <p>However, as far as those private pensions are concerned, nothing has come to me; yet we owe this to the French generosity, that our people have learned that nothing right can be done without money. I expected an envoy who would oversee the affairs himself, not a treasurer suitable for nothing but giving away. But even he never came.</p>
      <p>Thus, the most illustrious Mr. Coignetius is mistaken, whose error, however, leads our people to believe that they are either being deceived or that the king himself is not better informed about their affairs than to be deceived by his own. For it has been three months now since these things have been written from France; but even Mr. Coignetius himself has written to our people more than once that the treasurer is ready, on the way, and will be here soon. I would prefer that they had promised nothing at all; thus they would have taken away all hope of receiving anything from our people at once. However, since they promise so magnificently both privately and publicly, it would be of great interest to their glory to fulfill their promise. I would also very much like the most illustrious Mr. Coignetius to be reminded of these things; for this error also reflects on his own name. For it is thought that either he does not know the king's plan or, if he does know, he writes differently. But I hear that the treasurers are meanwhile making a great profit from the money with the bankers, and without a doubt, Mr. Coignetius, who is being deceived by this very thing, will take this action most indignantly.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this so that you could remind Mr. Coignetius.</p>
      <p>He can do what seems best to him afterward.</p>
      <p>I have clearly decided for myself not to write another word about these matters. For I do not wish to feed this otherwise insatiable monster.</p>
      <p>With what intention I have already written all this to Mr. Coignetius, you yourself know well: I referred all this to the benefit of the church. For I feared and still fear that King Philip might tear the Valtellina, the asylum of Christian exiles, away from the rest of the body. For I hear that the envoy secretly dares to bid for it among his own and promises a great amount of gold.</p>
      <p>If he were to obtain it, the Frenchman would be forever excluded from passage. If it is made known among the common people that Philip is offering a great, unspeakable amount of money for the Valtellina with the promise to maintain friendly relations, many will say: by the Valtellina, they have learned to sell offices; the land is worth nothing for a penny; only the great houses benefit from it, etc. You understand the rest.</p>
      <p>There has long been a cry among the common people that if it ever came to it, that one would have to go to war for the sake of the Valtellina, they would want to send those they know; but they themselves would not want to have a war for the sake of the Valtellina. So people are not so silent; such talk has also spread not so secretly that Philip has not been informed of it for a long time; the best among us speak openly and frankly, if they did not have a special consideration for the believers and the gospel, which is taking root in the Valtellina, they would soon come to an agreement with Philip on the other hand, etc.</p>
      <p>To prevent this, I would have gladly tolerated an envoy coming to us. But now, since this and other things do not particularly concern them, I cannot do much for them; may God's will be done; He will not abandon His churches because of it. There are still many pious people in the land; they will consider one thing and another.</p>
      <p>Dr. Philippus and I have been appointed by the brothers to appear at the assembly. We want to take God as our helper, for with human help it is purely lost. - Yesterday, the message of the Pope and Philip was read out before the guilds here in Chur. It was not well received by the people.</p>
      <p>They want to allow the Bishop of Como to pursue his rights, as far as the annual income is concerned; but as far as the other demands are concerned, they would rather risk life and limb than grant the Pope any of them. - The people of Oberhalbstein, who are otherwise very papal, would perhaps do as little as ours. - In the Engadin, there is good hope as well as elsewhere in the Two Leagues; but some in the Upper League (as is feared) may not be quite right. When I wrote this, I had not yet received any letters from you.</p>
      <p>Sülerus had not yet arrived, it was also evening. I wish your paternity well and to be in good health with all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 6, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The one who delivers this to you (Jörg Metzger) is a trustworthy man to whom you can safely entrust any letters you have. To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning, piety, and humanity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
