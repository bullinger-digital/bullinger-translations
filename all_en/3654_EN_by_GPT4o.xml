      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand, especially to the trusted lord and dear godfather and brother. Here comes again Mr. Christen, a very pious, dear man, and since it was necessary for him to show his credentials to the authorities in KÃ¼blis, I inform you, as you otherwise also know, that the city of Bremgarten, where his father resides, would not give him any credentials; since they are not of our religion, they would also not be much burdened to support the good man. However, I know his father; for he is my godfather, as I held a child at baptism for him many years ago. He is a merchant and an honest man; I have nothing else to know about him. So Mr. Christen has his credentials of his honest conduct well with him from Basel, brought from places near Basel where he lived, as I have previously sent you the letters, etc. Therefore, I earnestly request you to speak and act in the best way for him, as I trust you. I hope he will conduct himself honorably and well.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am also sending you the letter that he brought with him from Basel; please send it back to me. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontasella, and especially my lords the mayors. Dated Zurich, July 22, 1558.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Johannes Schmid, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, his dear lord and godfather.</p>
