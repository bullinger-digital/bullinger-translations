      <p>Greetings. The men who will deliver this letter to you are honest and upright, with whom you can safely entrust anything you wish me to know, as it will be less convenient to include it in letters due to business matters.</p>
      <p>Both are familiar friends to me: however, one of them, whose sister is married to our Budé, is more frequently with me. Since he had contracted bitter sorrow from widowhood, I encouraged him to visit you. For knowing that he had long desired this, I hoped it would be a moderate comfort to alleviate his grief. Although I did not hide that my advice also had another aim. For since it is certain that the exiles and condemned from our city recently attempted something at the nearby Helvetic assembly, it is very troublesome for us not to know how they were received and what they achieved. Indeed, we read a document filled with atrocious insults against our senate, but equally filled with vile lies. However, we eagerly desired to know whether any hope was given to them, or whether their accusations were heard by the delegates of the cities. And although we trust that they received the rejection they deserved, not without disgrace and ridicule, our suspended expectation keeps us very anxious. Therefore, this opportunity was eagerly seized by me so that this friend might inform us about the whole action and its outcome.</p>
      <p>Another reason also urged me more to press this journey, because every sensible person from the senate would wish such unworthy scandals to be refuted, but we think nothing should be attempted without counsel. Your consul, however, with his prudence, will best explain in a word what is worthwhile to do: and for his benevolence towards our people, he will not be reluctant to perform this duty.</p>
      <p>It seemed appropriate to preface briefly: From common rumor, it became known that those exiles at Baden falsely and wickedly complained about our senate, and finally, a document was brought, concocted from monstrous and equally futile lies. Although our senate does not doubt that it was severely rejected as it deserved by serious and moderate men, and is also persuaded that the Helvetic cities, as common law and mutual connection between magistrates dictate, would be more inclined to restrain this insolence than to admit an accusation brought by scoundrels and worthless rascals: nevertheless, not so much for the sake of their defense, which would be superfluous, but to preserve their reputation intact, they wish to present the true history of the whole matter in good faith. Two methods of presenting the document occur to us. For sending an envoy to Baden to plead the case does not seem to be in the dignity of the city. Therefore, it would be pleasing to send copies to friends in all directions with some recommendation, so that the senate of each city might understand that there is nothing frivolous in it.</p>
      <p>And here the authority of your consul, or even the most honorable senate, would be called upon for support. However, the second method is more approved, if it pleases you: to send a man who would offer a single copy in the name of our senate to each city, with letters in which our people request that the senators deign to read it. For in this way, perhaps some response might also be elicited. Moreover, the refutation will be no trouble, because they dared to lie so shamelessly and without disguise, that it is easy to make them ridiculous in a few words. In such a serious matter, I implore your faith, favor, help, and effort, so that our friend may report your and the consul's opinion. Since he is unknown, you will ensure that he comes to a conversation.</p>
      <p>A messenger will tell you about our affairs. My colleagues respectfully greet you all. They have instructed me to write this to you: we have been told that there now lives among you someone from the Limousin people, which is a region of Auvergne in France and near the Périgord, a man of tall stature, with sparse and reddish beard, of full and broad body, of a complexion more livid than white: from whom you have been deceived, we regret to hear. For it is said that he has taken a wife among you. If this is true, he is now a trigamist. When he came here five years ago, he brought a woman with him who was considered his wife, until through his long absence it was discovered and proven with clear testimonies that he had married another before. And yet he was one of the pope's mercenary priests, who hire out their daily services by saying mass. Now he is indeed treacherous and a defrauder of creditors, among whom I am one. And yet in France, he boasted that I was a usurer. What I write, if you request, we will take care to send attested by public records. Farewell again, most excellent man and my esteemed brother. Many greetings to your son-in-law D. Gualther and the other brothers. May the Lord bless you and your family and guide you with His spirit to the end.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 3rd day before the Calends of August 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
