    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Travers' inquiry [No. 1768], Bullinger could not find a single host for all four boys, but instead found two who are willing to take in two each; these are Otto Werdmüller, who will thus host a total of six boarders, and the schoolmaster Benedikt Euander. The costs amount to 25 or 26 guilders, with one guilder in Zurich equivalent to the value of 15 Constance batzen, and half of the amount is due every six months. Travers need not worry about the education, upbringing, and care of the boys, as Bullinger will take care of them, and both Euander and Werdmüller are very close to him. Bullinger has no reliable news about the war in Belgium, but there is a rumor that Emperor Charles V has taken the city of Düren with great losses; when more precise news arrives from the Frankfurt fair, he will inform Travers. In the event of a major price increase, [the two hosts Werdmüller and Euander] trust that Travers will not let them suffer harm.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Your letters greatly delighted me, esteemed and beloved Travers, whom I sincerely love and wish to serve. Those young men of yours are my concern; I would like the best for them, and as much as possible, I have diligently ensured to answer your questions. Firstly, regarding a master or host and patron, I could not find anyone now who would take all four; however, there are those who would take two. Among us is a most learned and upright man, the catechist of our church, otherwise an excellent philosopher, Master Otto Werdmüller, who nurtures and instructs several of the foremost children of our city; he has promised to take in two, thus he will have six. I believe Master Benedikt Euander, our schoolmaster, a pious, learned, faithful, and diligent man, will take in the other two. As for the cost, the others pay 25 or 26 guilders, for a bed or lodging a coin - a guilder here is worth 15 Constance batzen; after half a year, half of the amount is paid. Do not be concerned about the education, manners, food, and drink suitable and necessary for the young men, most excellent man. When they come here, they will have me as a father and patron; if they wish for any change, if they need anything, I will devote myself entirely to them for your sake. Euander and Werdmüller are my neighbors, well known. Therefore, if you are going to send them, send them to me; I will then take good care of their affairs. - Regarding the war in Belgium, I have no certain news yet, except that rumor has it that Emperor Charles V has taken Marcodurum, the first city of Juliers, by force and that the garrison has fallen with many Spaniards lost in the meantime. When I have more certain news from the Frankfurt fair, you will not be unaware. May the Lord preserve you with all yours. September 14, 1543. Due to greater expensive increases, they trust you will not let them suffer harm. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Master Johannes Travers, a foremost man among the Rhaetians, his esteemed lord.</p>
