      <p>God's grace first, etc. Favorable, dear lord and brother, yesterday, Tuesday, December 3rd, right around noon, a lord with a servant came riding from Schaffhausen to Stammheim in front of my house. The lord, on a brown horse not too large, carried with him a small firearm, dressed in a short black rider's coat like the Hessian mantles, though slightly cut at the sleeves, a black rider's hat with beautiful wool adorned with a beautiful wart-like cord, a noble person of decent height, of good respectable age yet not gray, slightly pale complexion, with a tawny beard and sharp nose, had a rapier with a black shell knob, a long black sword belt attached, beautiful black gloves, delicate hands adorned with many precious rings, etc. The servant rode a taller brown horse, had a sword and a leather Hessian mantle with sleeves, a fairly tall, strong person with a tawny beard, sharp nose, resembling Vogt Weyman in the face, etc.</p>
      <p>When I greeted them, they led the horses into a stable, the servant stayed there, did not want to come up to the rooms, despite the cold. The lord, however, requested to see my library (as he called my poor wretched collection). When we came into the room, he asked me if I could show him the Salic and Ripuarian laws of the ancient Franks, since I supposedly referred to them in my chronicles (which he, as I noticed, had read through), with words like: Canis Se sius a swine dog, sperwerius, Rachtinburgij, wergelt, etc. So I laid before him Witichindus and in it the book of Hermann, Count of Neuenahr, about the origin of the Franks. Then he requested to see the book of Tschudi, but soon put it aside again, telling me how Munster now had something remarkable, where he had the cities depicted; this was sent to him everywhere, also by the princes, and he spoke in these words: "My lord of Cologne, the elector, had also recently sent him his. He had a small man's voice for old service; his speech is entirely Coblenz-like, speaks good Latin; the servant speaks more upper German. For the second time, he asked me earnestly why the Swiss had allied themselves anew with the French, the enemy of God and persecutor of all truth. I gave him little answer to this at first. I requested that they would take a meal with me (the poor peasant); but they would not deign; only the servant had a piece of bread and wine offered to him on the horse; the lord would have nothing.</p>
      <p>When I went out of the house with him, he brought up the French alliance for the third time with great wonder, that even the evangelical cities had involved themselves in it, although the French had issued such a cruel edict against the holy gospel and our religion, in which he named and condemned us. To this, I gave him a brief answer, that our gracious lords of Zurich, also Basel, were not involved; nor would they be, if God did not go in it. Then he asked if this village belonged to Zurich, and how far it was to there. With that, he rode off. They both said, if I had a horse, I must ride with them; why I did not have a gulden. They were not with me for more than a quarter of an hour, saying they wanted to go to Weinfelden, so that they would come to St. Gallen today, Wednesday; he wanted to go to Vadianus and then ride from St. Gallen to Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>Forgive my long writing. It seems to me, from the appearance of the person, speech, and language, that it is indeed a guest, like years ago at the Sword, namely Mr. Hans, Count Palatine and Count of Spanheim, of Simmern on the Hunsr√ºck. Therefore, I have written to you all the circumstances, in case he comes to you, so that you may learn to know the man and perhaps offer him the state of affairs, for I am driven not only by the wonder of all things to know; since I have otherwise loaded the envy of the nobility around us, others might also boast; if I then sat at the offense, I would always rather have known than unknown guests at home.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend to the dear God and Father, along with wife and children, to grace, who may uphold you, his holy church, and all of us for a long time to comfort, amen. My wife sends you and your dear housewife along with the children friendly greetings.</p>
      <p>Your always willing servant Johann Stumpf wrote.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed patron. Zurich.</p>
