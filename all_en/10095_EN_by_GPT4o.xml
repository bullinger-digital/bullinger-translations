      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The inconvenience of the messenger and the constant demands of my work were the reasons I did not send the letter you requested. However, with the next messenger, I wish to fulfill your request with a rather lengthy letter, which requires effort to transcribe. But as I promise, I will deliver.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and continue to regard Gervasius with your former zeal.</p>
      <p>Given on the twenty-first of February in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Give my heartfelt greetings to your wife, my faithful companion in tribulation.</p>
      <p>Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>To the clearly learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, to be observed with utmost respect.</p>
