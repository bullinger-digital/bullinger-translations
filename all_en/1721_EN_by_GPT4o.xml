      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I am sending two small vessels marked as follows: Ga. C. M., that is Galeazzo Caracciolo, marquis. I have paid for the transport as far as Chur, and the mayor will pay for it to Zurich. I ask you to ensure that they are delivered to Geneva to that marquis, who will pay the remainder, as soon as possible. Farewell and be well; consider it kindly, for I am now using your services in the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, 18th of September, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, honorable brother. [With] two small vessels marked as follows Ga. C. M.</p>
