      <p>Greetings. I commend to you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, Mr. Hubert Languet, a man both pious and learned, again and again. He is the one from whom you will receive this letter, and if you wish to test his piety and learning, I hope it will not displease you to spend a little time with him. For several years, he was very closely associated with Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, to whom he is also intimately dear and privy to even his most secret affairs. I ask you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, to make an effort so that he understands that my recommendation has some weight with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 18th of August, 1557. In haste, therefore forgive me.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>I ask you, also commend him to Mr. Theodor, Peter Martyr, Gwalther, Gesner, etc. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
