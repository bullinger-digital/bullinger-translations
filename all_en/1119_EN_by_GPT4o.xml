      <p>Greetings. This note has brought us great pleasure, which I am returning here through the same person by whom you sent it to us. I do not doubt the Lord's help, provided there is someone who trusts in it. But before we experience it, we despair and lose all strength of spirit. Meanwhile, there is nothing noteworthy here that I have not written about before. The plague has ceased; however, the causes for which the Lord sent it to us, namely crimes, greed, lust, envy, and wantonness, do not cease, from which I fear punishment, since the warning has had no effect on us. May the Lord grant us the spirit of repentance and prayer. Amen. May the Lord make this year most auspicious and happy for you and all yours! All of mine and Musculus with all of his send their greetings to you. Bern, December 23, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely in the Lord, Johannes Haller. To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his revered lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
