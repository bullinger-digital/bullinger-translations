    <p xml:id="regest1">From the letter delivered by Johannes Hensenstein, Bullinger learns that in Zurich, the church and the proclamation of the Gospel, as well as scholarship - as Bullinger's "De origine erroris" attests - are in good standing; Pergener possesses almost all of Bullinger's works and encourages him to write about the Gospels. The Wittenberg city judge [Kaspar Teudel], who was in Zittau with the Hebrew professor Matthäus Aurogallus, will forward the letter. There is nothing to report about the Turks. The Catholics mourn the death of Duke George of Saxony. There will be much to discuss in writing with the people of Zurich regarding the Frankfurt Spring Fair; Hensenstein intends to visit every Spring Fair and will be a good messenger. Greetings. Johannes Heß has delivered the greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter, dearest Bullinger, written on the 13th of March in Zurich, was delivered to me on the 23rd of April this year by the pious young man Johannes Hensenstein from Frankfurt, who recently married in the Ore Mountains in Bohemia. From it, I hear that your church is doing well by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>The word of the Gospel is known to run freely; the Lord continually provides learned and pious ministers, as your writings, which you publish for the benefit of the Christian republic, testify. I obtained two books, "On the Origin of Error Concerning the Invocation and Worship of Saints and Images" and "Concerning the Lord's Supper and the Papal Mass," around the same time as your letter, by the kindness of God. I possess almost all of your other works. You promise that you might write on the evangelical reading; I sincerely pray that this may happen.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to write more at the moment, for the letter was to be delivered to the Wittenberg city judge, who was in this city these days with the most learned man, Matthäus Aurogallus, professor of Hebrew letters.</p>
      <p>There are currently no rumors about the cruelty of the Turks in these regions. The Catholics everywhere mourn the removal of Duke George of Saxony.</p>
      <p>At the Frankfurt Spring Fair, I will converse with you more extensively through letters. Johannes Hensenstein intends to travel to Frankfurt for every Spring Fair; he will be a suitable and faithful messenger.</p>
      <p>Many pious and devoted brothers send their greetings to you and your church, especially Pellican, Leo Jud, Theodor Buchmann, and Megander.</p>
      <p>In haste, Zittau, on the 5th day of August 1539. I also greeted Johannes Heß of Wrocław, to whom your greeting was most welcome.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the renowned church of Zurich, his most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
