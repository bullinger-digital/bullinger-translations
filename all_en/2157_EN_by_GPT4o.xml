      <p> S. I truly wish for you to know everything that is signified to me from elsewhere, my dear Bullinger, because I understand that you desire it so, and I am willing to offer this mutual service liberally and dutifully. From Bavaria, I receive news that the bishops, after careful deliberation, have approached their prince and attempted with many arguments to persuade him to suffocate the sincere religion that is sprouting here and there among his people while it is still in the grass, and to introduce the Spanish Inquisition to the entire dominion. However, the most illustrious and pious Prince Otto Heinrich has resisted this, both wisely and with private exhortations to his relative, and has placed such an obstacle that all good people hope Prince Albert will temper the cruel persecution, although they have managed with their skills and authority to not lightly impede the progress of religion in that duchy, and they will eventually experience how much harm they have brought upon themselves by stumbling over the stone of offense. Meanwhile, the Lord does not cease to raise up those who leave nothing undone in the propagation of Christ's kingdom. </p>
      <p> The Duke of Brunswick has returned to his own, yet he left behind very strong garrisons, not very loyal towards the bishops with whom he was allied, so that having occupied their nests for some time, he will not be easily or without trouble expelled. However, it is said that there are those ready to restrain the audacity of advancing further. </p>
      <p> Johann Friedrich, the most illustrious Prince of Saxony, is at home and in good health, except that he is said to be growing remarkably stout, so there is a danger that, being oppressed by excessive weight, he may not be able to survive long. It is rumored that he was forced to pay many thousands of gold coins to the Duke of Brunswick unless he wanted his dominion to be devastated by fire and sword; such is, alas, the license to do everything according to one's desire and to invade anything. </p>
      <p> I wish to know the state of the Church of Geneva, if you have any information; for although Farel writes that the matter of religion is proceeding happily, yet, since he does not write by what means the once-stirred tragedy has been calmed, I am in fear that, with matters not well confirmed, there may soon be disturbances, and those same ill-disposed men who caused the previous ones will stir them up again. Therefore, if you have received anything earlier, I beg you to let me know at the first opportunity; for I will do the same in return. The Parisian bookseller has not yet come, nor will I easily find one before the Frankfurt fair to whom I can entrust letters and money; therefore, I will await your opinion on what should be done about these matters. Farewell. Basel, January 12, 1554. Greet all your people in my name and in the name of my fellow students. </p>
      <p> Yours, Sulzer. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother. </p>
      <p> To Zürich. </p>
