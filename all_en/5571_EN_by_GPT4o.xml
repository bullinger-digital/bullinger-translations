      <p>If at any time thereafter your piety wishes to send us any letters out of your kindness and love towards us, in which you will either inform us about the French and other new matters or what you think pertains to our church, or at least make us, your servants, aware of your and your family's prosperous health, please direct those letters, most kind and venerable father, by the same route you have previously used to send to Poland, through the people of St. Gallen, who will then, through the people of Nuremberg, ensure they are delivered to the house of Lord Aichler, a jurist and the supreme, as they call it, president of law, instructed by you to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Here, since he is very well known to all people in Krakow and is my greatest friend and has always been most observant of you, he will deliver them to me or, wherever I may be, ensure they are delivered without delay.</p>
      <p>This Stanislaus Aichler is a most pious man, of great authority among our people and one of the presbyters who preside over the governance of the Krakow church.</p>
      <p>And so that you may not be burdened to honor me, your most devoted servant in every way, with this favor and deem me worthy of your more frequent letters, I humbly and with all the affection of my heart, most kind and venerable father and lord, request this from your kindness.</p>
      <p>I have informed Charles Jonville about the same route for transmitting letters to Krakow, so that if by chance he himself cannot ensure the delivery of Mr. Calvin's or his own letters to me by another means, he may send them to you, which in this way will reach our hands more easily and certainly along with yours.</p>
      <p>Your piety, ease, utmost humanity, and incredible kindness, which voluntarily offers itself and is accustomed to gratify and do good even to the most unknown, have persuaded me that this will not be burdensome to you.</p>
      <p>Returning from the Frankfurt fairs, I will again travel through Leipzig, where whatever I learn from your letters about your and all your family's health, I will convey to the Cikow children.</p>
      <p>Unless perhaps you wish to add some little letters to them, by which I may appear more pleasing to them accompanied by your letters.</p>
      <p>Then thereafter, if you include any similar letters in the packet you send to me in Krakow, I will very easily send them back to them in Leipzig.</p>
      <p>For they are there (unless something else intervenes) to remain until Easter.</p>
      <p>And I know with what gratitude and observance towards you and your entire family those very children of yours, I say, your children, are constantly carried, someday to declare their due in every kind of service for your instruction of them.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, they keep you all in their eyes every single hour and constantly pray to God for your safety and well-being.</p>
      <p>That this is so, may you be persuaded, my father, and may you wish to persuade the same to your most illustrious and pious wife, our mother, in their name, I beseech you.</p>
