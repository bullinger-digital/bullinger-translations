      <p>Greetings. As night was approaching, my dearest brother, Mr. Tobias, announced to me, who was expecting nothing of the sort, that he would be setting out at the break of dawn the next day, asking me to write a few letters to you, in which I would bear witness to what he is going to say to you regarding the Gantner matter, etc. Although I know there is no need for me to lend credibility to his words, especially with you, because there is nothing in which I would not most willingly and promptly oblige him and comply with whatever just and fair request he makes of me, I say this candidly and freely regarding what you write that he said to you: that he tried everything to satisfy the synod or the Chur council, his magistrate, by confessing or by any means of obedience, and that it was due to Mr. Tobias or some other unknown person that he could not achieve anything here, etc. In this, I say, the stubborn man does great injury to the aforementioned Mr. Tobias, as well as to the entire synod and the most honorable council, and not only does he say what is vain and false, but also a mere and most shameless lie, which ultimately falls upon his own head. I cannot say more now, as I have to preach tomorrow. Therefore, I ask you, venerable father, to consider these few and rough words kindly. I have no doubt that my colleague will carry out the rest in my name, both towards you and towards others entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 6, 1572.</p>
      <p>Always most deservedly yours, Ulrich Campell. To the most honorable and esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my venerable father in Christ, always to be honored with every respect.</p>
