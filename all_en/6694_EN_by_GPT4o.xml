      <p>God be with you. I thank you for the game pies, etc., and ask you not to incur any expenses, and if God grants you something, that you do not give everything away. Keep some for yourself and your Susanna too; you must not give everything to us. But may God be your reward; I will also, where I can, be indebted, but ask you again not to incur any expenses. Thank young master Hans Peter sincerely for the lemons; greet him and his family for me. I have my hands full with work, and can hardly come away from the treadmill, until I am completely worn out. I would like to write more; I do not have time. Waiting to hear from you what you report to us from Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>May God protect you, Susanna, Elsbeth, and all your household. All our people greet you. May God grant us His blessing. Saturday, February 16, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours, H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger in Berg.</p>
