      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Recently, within two days, I received a letter from you, venerable lord, not without great pleasure; for while it has always been very delightful to enjoy your familiar conversation, it is no less pleasing to inspect your letters. What you wished in the latter, behold, I have done; for Thomas Hoffman was with me, whom I have recommended to my dearest brother in Aarburg. He has not yet returned to me, I do not know how the matter has succeeded.</p>
      <p>As for the sorrow you express in your earlier letters concerning the adverse health of my wife, I easily believe you grieve, since you have always pursued me with such love that you considered what adversities befell me as your own; for which benevolence towards me, I owe you immense thanks, and indeed you rightly advise me to be solicitous and vigilant for the restoration of my wife's good health and at the same time to avoid untimely remedies. I will do what I can and will not easily entrust her to the doctors. She is now somewhat better, because the illness increases and subsides at uncertain and different intervals; but I acknowledge the Lord God, who creates light and darkness; may His will be done.</p>
      <p>The business of Gervasius, as you also advise, I understood and resolved to handle from the beginning; I think you have no doubt about my faith.</p>
      <p>What has kept me anxious about my affairs, you have long known from me and will soon understand more clearly. I have entrusted the whole matter to the Lord, who will provide for me excellently. May I be found a faithful servant of the Lord, which I continually implore from Him alone with earnest prayers.</p>
      <p>Petrus Sartorius still retains your writing against the Interim; I have already reminded him several times to return it, lest it be an impediment to you or other good people; but he has not yet returned it to me. You ask for my judgment on it. Indeed, I only saw your writing briefly because of the business that was pressing on me in those very days; it was not allowed to copy it then, but I hoped to receive it again shortly from Mr. Peter; then I intended to copy it; but he has not yet returned it. However, my judgment, which would be very insignificant and of no moment in such a matter, where you yourself have judged far more rightly and have consulted other men of very keen judgment who converse with you daily, I will not refuse to deposit with you in a few words. Many indeed write many things; but not all are given the same facility and clarity to handle and propose to others what they wish to be seen.</p>
      <p>This writing of yours pleases me greatly and I judge it to be such that I would have wished it to be published long ago. For I see it to be such, in which everything is treated so clearly that the enemies can find nothing to justly criticize nor can our people desire anything. Prudent modesty is present; truth is asserted and vigorously defended, and the arguments of the adversaries are refuted and the attackers of the truth are sought and convicted in such a way that it is done without biting and scurrilous wit and levity, yet not without the addition of salutary salt and just gravity, which has such gentleness joined to it that it easily appears that everything is done in the spirit of Christ, not with a malevolent mind and corrupt affections.</p>
      <p>For Christ Himself always rebuked His enemies in such a way that He sought not so much their confusion and destruction as their conversion and salvation. I therefore ask that you do not delay longer in ensuring it is published; for it will be beneficial in many respects once published. For you are not unaware of the judgment of the ignorant populace, in whose mouth now is this Caesarian Interim; the more ignorant judge that everything in the Interdecree is confirmed by the word of God, so that none of ours dare to oppose it; otherwise, they would not have remained silent for so long, since many were previously very prompt to write. Nor can anyone justly complain that they were never warned; for some things are so disguised that they do not appear to be what they really are, which you propose and bring to light with your diligent consideration. Then others, who understand the matter as it is, who have more discerning noses, are nonetheless quite offended by the pusillanimity and fear either of the ministers of the word, who previously, when all was peaceful, were writing, now are more silent than any fish, or of the magistrates, who prohibit those willing to write from publishing and forbid under severe penalty those things that are contrary to the Interdecree.</p>
      <p>Such as we have certainly known some to be today, who with this their secular prudence, by which they wish to avoid the offenses of the worst men, render themselves suspect to the good, as if they still waver, little certain and confirmed in their faith, soon to change their opinion with fortune. To which now a third and far greater thing is added, that the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who redeemed us with His blood shed for us to eternal ignominy and wished us to be partakers of His glory, is greatly endangered, obscured, and diminished today. We bear these things with a patient mind, nor is there anyone who wishes to expose himself to dangers for the glory of our Lord and Savior to be asserted; for by our silence we both confirm and make the enemies bolder. I have spoken to many pious people about your writing and have shown them these reasons at the same time, for which it was good, indeed necessary, to be published. They therefore await the publication of your writing with the greatest desire, whose expectation I ask you not to frustrate any longer. You know for whom you have labored; the Lord will repay you manifold, to whom all good people will commend you with ardent prayers, that He may grant you strength and constancy, so that diligently, as hitherto, you may return the talent entrusted to you by the Lord with great favor on that day, when an account is to be required of us, where you know how much the angels will rejoice for a single sinner converted; therefore it will not be grievous and troublesome for you to publish this, if perhaps you can by your admonition recall even a single soul about to perish from the jaws of the dragon.</p>
      <p>And yet I hope many will defend the truth far more vigorously, when they see others also finally defending the cause with them. But you do not need my admonition; you yourself understand what is to be done in these matters. I have been longer than I wished; therefore I will now make an end, asking that you consider my writings with fairness and goodwill. I have spoken freely what I feel. May the Lord prosper your endeavors.</p>
      <p>Farewell and in the name of my wife and myself, greet your whole household and Mr. Gualther. Aarau, 24th April, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
