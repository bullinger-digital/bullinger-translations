    <p xml:id="regest1">He did not write his book against the Anabaptists out of self-righteousness - he detests this vice and it has harmed the Church more than anything else at all times -; he writes in the service of truth, aligns himself with his predecessors in this, and wishes that his book be tested against biblical truth. It should by no means replace independent Bible study, but rather lead to it and help to see through the false spirit of the Anabaptists. One should not be deceived by their fine words, and if they gather together, the authorities must be urged to intervene; history shows that they will not have lasting success. The pastors should faithfully perform their duties, as Paul laid out in the letters to Timothy and Titus.</p>

      <p>To all faithful and Christian pastors and preachers of the churches of the city of Bremgarten and the parishes in Freiamt in Aargau, my beloved brothers, I, Heinrich Bullinger, wish grace, peace, and mercy from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>After much persistent and earnest urging, you, dear brothers in Christ, have prevailed upon me to assist you against the Anabaptist sects with this book, according to the grace God has given me. However, consider the danger and suspicion I have placed myself in, as I, a simple man, dare to write after many experienced and highly gifted men. Therefore, it is your duty to defend my work, simplicity, and faithfulness in such a way that it is not turned into a reproach against me, as if I understood how to handle these matters better and differently than they have done, through whom God has shown much good to His church. Such a mindset is far from me, as I hate nothing more than self-righteousness and self-satisfaction. This vice should be abhorred by every Christian, especially by those who lead God's people with the word of the Lord, discipline, and innocence. For consider what has ever and always confused and harmed the church of God more severely and cruelly than self-righteousness and self-satisfaction. It led astray Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, it also planted misunderstandings and divisions in the church at Corinth, all discord and deadly damage that the church of God has ever suffered have originally grown from this, as can be seen in the main heretics, in Valentinus, Marcion, Arius, and the Pope. Indeed, why do many of the supposed learned ones resist the open truth today, if not because they are driven by self-righteousness and self-satisfaction? And what else is our Anabaptist affair than a result of self-righteousness, pride, and spiritual arrogance? Therefore, Paul does not in vain so earnestly beseech and admonish that if there is any spark of the spirit, faithfulness, and honesty in us, we should be of one mind, of one understanding and opinion, so that we do nothing out of excessive honor or out of envy and rivalry. Also, that no one should exalt himself above what he is, and understand himself to be able to do more than he can and faith teaches; but we should be humble and each consider the other higher than himself, that no one seeks his own glory and benefit, etc. All of this should rightly be a faithful warning to us, that we should undertake nothing from our fleshly temptation, but be subject to the spirit of truth. For indeed, the understanding of the prophets is subject to the prophets. And God is not a God of discord and disunity, but He is a God of peace in all congregations and churches. Thus, I have now written this book, not to judge anyone, not to despise or belittle anyone, not to introduce anything self-righteous or to shield anything new with such self-satisfaction, that I do not want to be subject to the spirit of the prophets (who have revealed better things to them), but what I write, I write for the good of the truth, for the peace of the church and the preservation of the simple. In this, I am not ashamed to follow those who have also worked in these matters, so that I have also referred to them in some parts of this book.</p>
      <p>For Paul says: "Do not quench the spirit, do not despise prophecies. Test all things and hold fast to what is good and right" [1 Thessalonians 5:19-21]. Thus, I want this book to be received by you, that you hold all things against the truth, that is, test them with the word of God, and as far as it accords with the same and is confirmed and grounded in it, give it your faith. For what are we poor sinful men otherwise, that one should believe us if we do not speak and show the word of the Lord?</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have earnestly admonished and entreated you that you do not misuse this my work in such a way that you become lazier or more careless in the Holy Scripture and think that you have been provided with what is necessary for this matter. Thus, our ancestors were also led away from the Scripture by the collectors, commentaries, treatises, and summists, so that one took from the other and put it in another form and wrote down what his temptation was. And one could have avoided this if one had not only laid all diligence on the extracts but much more on the Scripture. The Scripture is like a precious inexhaustible treasure and gold mine, from which much gold is brought for the benefit of men, just as from the Scripture many things are made and written for the good of men. Yet the gold mine and the treasure are always more and higher, as one always has a greater view of it. Thus, the word of God should also be for us. For Solomon does not say in vain: "Of making many books there is no end" [Ecclesiastes 12:12]. I say all this, dear brothers, so that no one misuses the work and help that is done for the church by the servants of the word in many ways, thinking that now, since he has a guide, through the institution, annotation, or commentaries everything is right and there is no longer any need for the Bible or diligent study, because the matter is briefly comprehended in this or that little book. For such was never the intention of the one who wrote the book for your good, but he wanted to lead you to the Scripture, that you use all your diligence in it. For whoever has no guide to any matters, also has no desire to handle them. Therefore, a light is given to the church in matters, not that you should now have enough of it, but eagerly and diligently pursue the truth of God with love and faith. Thus, you should now read the help, supports, comforts, and annotations of this mine and all other human books, set the foundation on the truth, and bring the understanding from the Scripture and not carry it within.</p>
      <p>With this, the writings of the faithful will benefit you greatly and not lead you away from the Scripture. For indeed, my intention in this book is solely to show you in passing that the Anabaptist spirit is a false spirit, and thereby strengthen and encourage you to further investigate with and in the Scripture, you will notice the wickedness and their deceit, yes, hypocrisy, more clearly the longer you go, and that they are nothing else but instruments of evil, through which he intends to undermine the gospel with the shovel of humble spirituality. Colossians 2:18-23.</p>
      <p>For it is up to you to be manly and brave in such an attack of evil and also to strengthen other simple ones. Therefore, their chatter and grand words should not discourage you. For what can be spoken more grandly than the magicians speak? Also, when the devil himself said to the Lord: "Ah, what do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? I know well who you are, the Holy One and Anointed of God" [Luke 1:34].</p>
      <p>And about Paul and Silas: "These men are servants of the Most High God and proclaim to you the way of salvation" [Acts 16:17]. Do not the rejected ones in the gospel also say: "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and done many great things in your name?" "And then I will declare to them" (says Christ): "I never knew you" [Matthew 7:22-23]. Therefore, dear brothers, do not let their chatter discourage you nor their poisonous threats frighten you; for thus the papacy also threatened before. And if they separate themselves from the church, remember the word of John: "They went out from us, but they were not of us" [1 John 2:19]. If they then make a party and disciples, remember the word of Paul: "And from among yourselves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them" [Acts 20:30]. If they then gather for rebellion, still admonish the authorities to stop the evil and unrest and rather punish a handful of wicked boys than later destroy a whole heap of seducers. Otherwise, you should not worry or be concerned that they might succeed with their crowd and rebellion. For if one reads all histories, sacred and profane, one finds that such rebellions have begun, but not that they have ever succeeded, but have always been laid low with great misery. Therefore, you should stand secure and comforted, strive for peace and unity, and endure all storms steadfastly and let them pass. And if the work seems too difficult or burdensome to you, rather consider what Moses, the faithful servant of God, endured with rebellions, apostasy, disorder, etc., what also Samuel and Jeremiah, yes, also Christ and Paul especially suffered from hypocrites and such hypocrites.</p>
      <p>And they were unshaken and steadfast; God will grant grace and be your faithful helper. For indeed, all falsehood must surely break.</p>
      <p>Further, there is no need to write about your office, being, and life, or teaching, since Paul has written three epistles to Timothy and Titus. Be diligent in truth, innocence, and faithfulness. Strive that the people may truly know God in Christ, trust in Him, worship Him, call upon Him, and honor Him with piety. That everyone loves his neighbor, no one defrauds or harms the other, but that everyone rests in peace with discipline and honor by the other. With this, you are commended to God and prayed for, that you may be faithful fathers of your people and mindful of the great God, who will require the blood of your sheep from your hands if you do not watch well. Therefore, let your office be important to you.</p>
      <p>Given at Bremgarten, on the birthday of our Savior Jesus Christ in the year 1530.</p>
