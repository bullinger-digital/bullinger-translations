      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, except to encourage you towards piety and to continue diligently in your studies, which I am entirely confident you will do. You have undoubtedly received the letters I recently sent through Mr. Hales, the Englishman, in which I included a coin as a token, because I was pleased with your exercise in Isocrates.</p>
      <p>I am now expecting the account of expenses and receipts from the day you rendered the account around the Lord's nativity. Continue to record everything individually. I will gladly supply what is necessary; but see to it, my son, that you do not incur useless and unnecessary expenses. If you do this, which I am fully convinced you will, you will find me to be most generous to you. Serious dangers now threaten us and you from all sides; pray to the Lord to deliver you there and us from evil. For serious expeditions are underway, and we can expect nothing other than a truly bloody summer. But with the Lord is the safest refuge; let us flee there with secure faith and diligent love, as well as unwavering hope; for the name of the Lord is a most fortified tower; whoever calls upon it will be saved.</p>
      <p>Your mother, Veritas, Dorothea, Brigida, and the whole family send you their diligent greetings. You will greet your lady and the whole family for us. Zürich, March 31, 1554. Commend me to the most distinguished men, Mr. Martyr and Mr. Zanchi, Mr. Dasypodius, Mr. Montius, and the others. Ask each one if they wish to write anything through this messenger, the certain Höniun, etc.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger the Younger, my beloved son residing in the house of Mr. John Burcher, the Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
