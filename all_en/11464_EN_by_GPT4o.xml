    <p xml:id="regest1">Contrary to his announcement, he is already [with Wick and Haller] on the way to Marburg, as the permission for it was expected anyway and a favorable travel opportunity arose; asks for understanding, as the money would not have lasted much longer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>In response to your recent letter, dear Bullinger, I promised that we would await your decision. However, since we had almost certainly conceived in our minds that permission to depart would be granted by you, we could not pass up the most convenient opportunity for travel that presented itself, lest the chance to regain what was lost be almost unattainable. Therefore, after requesting and obtaining the necessary testimonials from the rector and the university of the Tübingen school, together with the most pious printer, we set out for Frankfurt and from there now to Marburg. Therefore, I would very much like to ask you, both as a patron and a father or sacred anchor, not to take what has been done too harshly, since it was all done to avoid the obligation of foreign debt, especially since, due to the scantiness of our funds, it would not have been possible to stay longer.</p>
      <p>Farewell now and love your Wolf as you usually do. Frankfurt, hastily, September 15, 1540.</p>
      <p>Greet the mother, wife, children, etc. Your Johann Wolf, etc.</p>
      <p>To the learned and upright man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zürich church.</p>
