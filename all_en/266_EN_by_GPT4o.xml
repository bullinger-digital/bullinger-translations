      <p>S. Many absurd things are being said about the people of Strasbourg, which I willingly pass over. I read a letter dated September 6th, in which the following was included: the preachers are not neglecting any of their duties and will continue to do so; furthermore, there is still hope, because the matter is to be referred once more to the great council; the Emperor is also unlikely to permit what is being requested of them; then it will be known what is in mind; moreover, the same is hastening unexpectedly to the Belgians, either because his son has arrived or because something has been stirred up there. There is some talk about this, but it is uncertain.</p>
      <p>Three rumors are circulating: 1. There is a Burgundian city on the borders of the French kingdom; inquisitors have been sent there, and those found to be Lutherans have been mistreated; thus, the citizens have gathered and killed all the priests of Baal, I mean the papal ones, and have devoted themselves to the French. 2. Twice the enemy soldiers, led by Count Mansfeld, have been defeated; the Queen of Hungary is so disturbed that death followed her as she fled into a certain monastery. 3. Ghent has been reclaimed by its own people, and this is how it happened; the Governor, who was in the new fortress built by the Emperor, died. A large crowd of citizens gathered for the funeral and, while the fortress was open, the citizens rushed in and occupied it, immediately writing letters to the French to protect the deed. Enjoy these until other news arrives, by which you will be more reliably informed.</p>
      <p>The people of Cologne are said to have brought cannons, etc., to the Emperor, now a hundred thousand quintals. It is serious, whatever it may be, that troubles the man.</p>
      <p>Gastius says he has sent what you have so often requested. Farewell, strong in the Lord, who alone makes strong and steadfast.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 13, 1548.</p>
      <p>May Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, Otto be safe in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most steadfast minister of Christ, lord in his Christ. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
