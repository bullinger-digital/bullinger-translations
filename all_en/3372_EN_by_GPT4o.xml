      <p>Greetings. You have written to me, dearest brother Hieronymus, a most bitter and quite different letter than I would have expected from an elder and from one free from youthful passions. You rail against Ulmius, although he seems to have neither sinned against you nor against the brothers.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he has never made any mention of you to me except in an honorable way. However, I know what happens when minds are divided; Satan joins in with unrestrained tongues and kindles sparks of a future fire, and does not cease until the fire grows immensely. Therefore, I urge you, my brother, to remember that Pauline, I mean apostolic, saying: Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your wrath, nor give place to the devil. I know you have suffered something human here. Return to your spirit (friend?) and embrace in our Lord.</p>
      <p>You will understand more from the faithful minister of the Steckborn church, dear brother, and from public letters. I love you, my Hieronymus, and I wish you and yours to be very well in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th October 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most beloved man, Mr. Hieronymus Kranz, his most esteemed and dearest lord and brother. Diessenhofen.</p>
