      <p>Greetings. Various and perplexing things are being reported.</p>
      <p>Would that our people would someday become wise; a fisherman learns from being struck, yet these people, struck so many times, still do not wish to become wise. But I rely on divine providence, which alone sustains me; He knows Himself, to what end all these things are destined. Mr. Coignetius writes and announces many favorable things; but the good man himself is also deceived. I ask you, if you ever write to him, to greet him in my words and to inform him that his letters have been delivered to me. I have nothing to reply, and I do not wish to send empty words.</p>
      <p>It should not surprise you either, if I write less frequently from now on; for what else should I write repeatedly, that I have nothing to write, especially to you who are otherwise very busy. If I have anything certain and worthy, I will not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>If I should ask this much of you, I beg you, my venerable father, to add the final touch to the others and to teach us something true (which from now on can be entirely certain) about this uncertain outcome of events; I am not devoid of good hope. I have delivered your letters to Hercules; for he is here.</p>
      <p>He gives thanks, wishes you and yours well.</p>
      <p>The most laborious wedding is at hand, in which I must preach; therefore I am brief. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Now, now at about 4 in the evening, Fasel has ridden in with great pomp, among them many from Glarus and Gilg Tschudi. I have been warned by G[regorio] C[arlin], with whom I have come to speak three words, how G[ilg] Tsch[udi] has come alone to make some mischief and practice, and how he has already now spread a writing on the way, which was written to him by the abbot of Einsiedeln from Trent, how the Count has made a foothold for the Guises and has now partly conquered the matter in France. However, I will write about these things from Mr. Landamman Bäldi; Captain Häßi brings the letter. I had not yet received the letters when I wrote this.</p>
      <p>You keep watch, so that we may have the truth.</p>
      <p>What Tsch[udi] spreads at the wedding, I will find out in the meantime.</p>
      <p>The abbot of Pfäfers is also here.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>If the Count of Condé needed soldiers, I would certainly wish for Carlin to be considered; there are very serious reasons for this advice of mine. I would also wish to write to him; I wish no occasion to be given for enmity among great men. July 20, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
