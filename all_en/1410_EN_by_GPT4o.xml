      <p> Greetings, dear brother. If you think that there resides any distrust in my heart towards you, as if your spirit is not entirely sincere towards us and our churches, let me clarify. Although I have urged you once and again to love us and to continue to be in harmony with us, it was done out of love, not distrust. Dear and closest people are not content with asking for mutual love just once, unless they repeat it often. I did not bring Gwalther as a witness, but I repeated my request in front of you and him, knowing that he would do the same with you as I did; therefore, there is no reason for you to be concerned about this. Continue to be towards us as we have no doubt you will be. </p>
      <p> We congratulate you, dearest brother, that things have turned out as you wished and that you are now teaching in that church, where you cannot help but rejoice in the Lord as you hope for fruit; may He preserve you and bless your ministry. </p>
      <p> It would be in vain to write more extensively about our affairs, as you have here a living letter, my most beloved and esteemed brother and godfather Buttler. He knows all our matters; indeed, I hide nothing from him; he reads what we have from Italy. </p>
      <p> In Germany, the Emperor is giving birth to what he has long been laboring over. When Nero, after his infamous robberies, also extended his bloody hands against Christ, he perished, and our Emperor, after never ceasing to persecute Christ for 30 years, now strives to surpass himself in cruelty. Well then, let it turn out as it did with all his predecessors! Even if we fall into his hands because of our sins, He who lives will still protect and avenge His church. Farewell in this with all yours. ZÃ¼rich, September 20, 1551. Writing much and often. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his most esteemed lord and brother. </p>
      <p> Biel/Bienne. </p>
