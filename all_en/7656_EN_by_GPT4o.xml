      <p>S. I am surprised if my letters, which I sent in the meantime while I received none from you, have not been delivered to you; for I wrote to you at least twice last month. Although, since I received those you sent through Lochmann, I admit I have written nothing; for they were delivered to me late. He took them with him to Moudon, as he will admit; from there they were finally sent back to me by the prefect of that place. Since then, I have not been able to have any messenger at all; otherwise, I would have relieved you of your anxiety sooner. Indeed, nothing is sweeter to me than writing to you, since I cannot speak with you in person and I see how much my letters are valued by you; but not always, when I wish, do I have those who travel to you. So, I received those from Lochmann, but only a few days ago. I sent Eglin's letters to Lausanne, so that they may be transferred to Mr. Beza.</p>
      <p>In other matters, there is nothing to which I should respond. Various things are being reported, yet so uncertain that, to tell the truth, this uncertainty makes it quite difficult for me to write; for I know you expect certain information from me. Since I cannot provide this, I prefer to write about other things. Now again, we have nothing. It is commonly reported that Toulouse has been captured by Condé; but I have not yet been persuaded to believe it. Similarly, various things are reported about Andelot, the chancellor of the kingdom, and many others. But why should I feed you with uncertain rumors? What I recently wrote about what happened in Neuchâtel is even much less than what the rumor brought to us, and if things are reported uncertainly from nearby, how much more from afar. This is certain, and I saw with my own eyes two edicts issued by the king, one of which orders all who are of our religion to be removed from public offices and honors; in the other, all who are of our party are proscribed and ordered to leave the kingdom within certain days, whoever is not of the Roman Catholic religion. This is the peace we hoped for, these are the good words given to ours until now.</p>
      <p>It was also reported that Bordeaux was captured by Condé; but that rumor has cooled, indeed it has completely died out, so I fear the one about Toulouse is similar. Your writing on excommunication pleases me greatly, and I have defended and upheld the same opinion for 20 years now against our French, who with the same importunity wanted to impose it on us as well.</p>
      <p>Some have already regretted this. If I do not send it back now, I will send it back with the next messenger, at least by our Martinmas fair; for I must copy it for my own or private use. Erastus also sent me what he wrote on this matter, which pleases me well; I only fear that this matter may turn into a public conflagration. But I hope the excellent prince will, with his prudence, ensure that it is extinguished in time. Moreover, it is such a matter that no princes or magistrates can tolerate, and therefore we have less to fear from it.</p>
      <p>The Platonic republic is something that consists more in theory than in practice, and it is easier to discuss it than to exercise it in reality.</p>
      <p>Hans Friedrich Müßli's case is somewhat settled, yet not entirely. It was initially handled by the court, but I was not present, as it was not my place according to the order; Musculus had to leave because of his brother, so it went rather coldly. The old Huber was sent, he denied some words excellently, but the arrest was based on them. Our students who were there were interrogated; they have some knowledge about it, but half out, half in. The judges did not want further knowledge to be taken out without the council's foreknowledge. The matter came before the council, but also at an inconvenient time, so they did not want to pursue it further, but told Huber to be quiet, and the son had to purge himself with a confession; the old one must also do this. So it stands. Many of my lords were not present because of the autumn, and those who are on the council handle it in such a way and time that it cannot fall otherwise. I would like to pursue the matter again; but I do not find ears with everyone. It also helps that the Musculi are not in good favor with everyone; it is thought they are a violent people, which is partly true. My lord Schultheiss von Mülinen is the godfather of the young Huber, therefore he supports the young and the old as he can and may, which makes it more difficult to handle. You have the whole business. If you think anything more should be done, let me know. Musculus also wrote to Heidelberg; there should still be some letters there, and if we could have them, the matter could be better pursued; we are waiting for that.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I know nothing special now, except that I commend you to the grace of God; may He keep you safe for a very long time. Greet all the brothers in my name, especially Mr. Gwalther, whose letters with money I received again, and I pray to the Lord to restore his health completely. I have lived miserably all this year, yet I have never ceased preaching; now I am beginning to feel a little better by the grace of the Lord. May He keep you. Amen. Diesbach greets you diligently. Steiger is in Münsingen; the rest are gradually returning from the harvest.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 2, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my esteemed lord and compatriot, to be loved without end.</p>
