      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, pastor of the church in Geneva, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Today I receive your letters, my most esteemed Calvin, and at the same time, Zacharias from Breslau indicates that he will leave tomorrow morning. I am therefore compelled to respond briefly to yours. You will hear at some point that the suspicion we had from the confession of the brothers before the princes was not in vain. We fear that our adversaries will use it more freely than we would like. I do not know what Mr. Gwalther has written, nor have I discussed the matter with him. And what I wrote before, I now repeat, that it is not permissible for us ministers to consent to any colloquium without consulting the magistrate. It will be necessary to discuss this matter with him first. For he also does nothing at all in the affairs of the church and religion without our knowledge. For the letters of Philipp shared, I give great thanks, which I now return. I share in turn what I received from him today: "Reverend man and dearest brother. Since our colleagues did not succeed in having us approve the condemnation of your churches, they separated from us and presented it privately to the judge Julius, from whom they requested that it be publicly recited in the assembly. However, the judge was so moderate that he did not want it to be recited in the assembly. Afterwards, they left from here. Now, therefore, we doubt whether the initiated conference will proceed. Whatever the outcome, I hope wise men will not disapprove of our contention, that we did not want to immediately confirm the idols and murders of the pontiffs without the matter being disputed or explained. But I pray to the Son of God to guide us. Farewell well and happily.</p>
      <p>On the 5th of October.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all of you and especially to Peter Martyr and Laelius." These letters of his, faithfully copied, were brought by our students who, returning from Marburg, greeted Philipp in Worms and received these to be delivered to me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not hope for any further colloquium to be established between us unless Philipp comes to Strasbourg. There are absolutely no vacant positions with us. If any should become vacant, there are ten competitors. Meanwhile, on account of your and Philipp's recommendation, support will be given to the excellent man for a time, if he wishes to stay here. We have a great number of poor students. Since you have not been able to read the book of Mr. Jacob Andreae, because it is written in German, I send here the most important parts translated by me from German for the benefit of Mr. Martyr: I also ask that you return them to me by the first messenger that may be offered. I could not read those letters, I think the ones you shared, which I would gladly return now as well, if I did not completely ignore where I placed them in the turmoil of affairs. When I find them again, I will certainly send them to you. I especially commend this Zacharias to you. He is from Breslau. He came to us from Basel, recommended to me by Hermann Pinzinger, who asserts that he is very close to Philipp. He comes to greet you and to see the church in Geneva. Live and farewell. All of ours greet you. Greet all your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Also greet Mr. Jonvill, Badius, and Normand, and the other brothers, and also Budaeus if he has returned. I greatly congratulate myself that I have placed the title of our work on Revelation so well.</p>
      <p>I value the goodwill of both you and the brothers of the Italian, French, and English churches more than many talents of gold, etc. You will commend me to them.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 26th of October, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
