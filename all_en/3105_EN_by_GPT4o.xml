      <p>Greetings. Regarding the letter you wrote to the most distinguished man, Mr. Konrad Zwick, my dearest godfather in the Lord, in my name, I acknowledge it with a grateful heart, and I wish I could repay it with some service. I sympathize with his infirmity; I pray to the Lord to grant this man, useful to human affairs, a longer and healthier life. I embrace his kindness and goodwill with open arms, by which he has deemed it worthy to promise me, through you, the sharing of this woodworking art. It is amazing how eagerly I await until I achieve this desire. Please, convey to him my greatest thanks in my name. For I am as certain of this benefit from him as if I already had in my hands what he promised; for his integrity has been well known to me since the year forty-one, when he first began to become known to me at the Diet of Regensburg.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I have not yet been able to learn what has been decreed by our lords regarding your work on the Apocalypse. If the work is printed here with us, I will ensure it is done with as much care as if it concerned myself; for the printer is my neighbor, making it easy for both him and me to attend to this matter.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about Poland somewhat refreshed my spirit and somewhat revived my former hope for the reformation of the churches there. They must be aided with prayers to the Lord, who are engaged in such a holy and great work.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, it was written to me that Margrave Albrecht... departed from this life on the ninth of this month at the second hour in the afternoon. The judgments of God are marvelous. I have also received news from elsewhere about the Turkish expedition; may the Lord have mercy on our Germany, which is in great danger both at home and abroad. Farewell excellently, my dearest godfather. Greetings to your entire household, to the lords and brothers, fellow ministers, and professors. All of you are greeted by my wife and household.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest godfather. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
