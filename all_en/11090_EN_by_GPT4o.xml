    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter on September 5, the day of his departure to Bern; will only respond from Basel and also send the records of the Bern [Special Synod]. Since Erasmus [Ritter] unexpectedly departed from Bern, Bucer doubts his agreement to the accord, whose validity Megander has testified on behalf of the pastors before both councils. Asks the people of Zurich to judge only after receiving the records. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>We received your letter through Froschauer at home on the day we set out for Bern, which is September 5. Now is not the time to respond; for this knight, your courier, is ready for the journey. We will respond from Basel and send the records of Bern, which have been written there with the authority and trust of the senate and the deacons.</p>
      <p>Erasmus left for Bern without our knowledge, even though the evening before he left, I greeted him at his residence. This indeed caused concern that he has not yet fully professed the restored agreement and utmost charity from his heart, although Megander, by the order of all the brothers, has testified before both councils to profess it with words of truly ample agreement and affection.</p>
      <p>We ask nothing else from you and our other fellow ministers there than to defer judgment until you have seen the records. But fairness itself advises you to keep an open mind towards us.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Capito sends his greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, September 25.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus sends you his most loving greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his own.</p>
