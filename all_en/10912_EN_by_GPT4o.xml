      <p> Greetings. I do not doubt, most illustrious Bullinger and singular patron, that due to your well-known benevolence towards me, you have handled my matter, which I explained to you in detail when I was there recently, more diligently than I would have ever dared to ask of you. However, because we have received no information from there about this, I miserably fear that the matter has turned out differently than we expected. Therefore, I ask you in the greatest manner and even more than you wish from me, not to hesitate to write to me in at least three words how this matter has fallen and what its status is; for it is of utmost importance for me to know. For I will have to (if what we were striving for does not succeed) break away from here and look for other hopes. For how can I endure so many labors any longer? I am Leonard and very much in poor health, not Hercules. I will indeed make an effort that you do not seem to have placed your benefits with an ungrateful person. My brother will tell you the rest. </p>
      <p> Therefore, farewell, most excellent man, and I ask you to continue to be to me what you have always been. If by chance you meet Aman Vogler, a man of the most sincere heart and who has deserved much from me, please convey my best regards to him. Again, farewell and use your Hospinian as you see fit. </p>
      <p> Hastily from Stammheim of the Zurichers, the day after the calends of August in the year 1536. </p>
      <p> L. Hospinianus, yours with all my heart. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, the unique patron of all piety and learning, his most esteemed lord. In Zurich. </p>
