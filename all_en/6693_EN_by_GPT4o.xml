      <p>Reverend Father in Christ, I wrote a letter to you six months ago, intending to satisfy the wishes of many brothers, if only I had received a response from your dignity, as I earnestly prayed at that time. But since either my letters have not been delivered to you, or yours (if you have written any) seem to have been intercepted, I am compelled to write now again what I wrote before. The condition of our church, which has long been reported to you, is such: now, after seven years of professing the gospel, the controversy over vestments has flared up again, in which Cranmer, Ridley, and Hooper, the most holy martyrs of Christ, once struggled. However, the state of the question is not entirely the same, but the decrees of the powerful are more implacable. This indeed pleases our adversaries in Leuven very much; for they extol these matters to the heavens with praises. But to make the controversy more easily understood, I wanted to reduce it to certain questions. They are as follows: I. Has a peculiar dress, distinct from the laity, ever been established for ministers of the gospel in better times, and should it be established today in the reformed church?</p>
      <p>II. Does such a prescription of vestments agree with ecclesiastical and Christian liberty? III. Does the nature of indifferent matters admit coercion, and should any force be applied to the consciences of many who are not yet persuaded?</p>
      <p>IV. Can any new ceremonies be instituted or accumulated beyond the express prescription of the word? V. Is it permissible to renew the ceremonies of the Jews concerning priestly attire, which have been abolished by Christ? VI. Should rites borrowed from idolaters or heretics, and specifically dedicated to their sect and religion, be transferred for use in the reformed church?</p>
      <p>VII. Is conformity and agreement in such ceremonies necessarily required? VIII. Can ceremonies associated with open scandal be retained?</p>
      <p>IX. Should any church constitutions be made that, although not impious by their nature, do not contribute to edification?</p>
      <p>X. Should anything be prescribed to the churches by the prince in ceremonies, without the will and free consent of the ecclesiastics?</p>
      <p>XI. Is it more advisable to serve the church in this way, or to be expelled from the ecclesiastical ministry for this reason, if there is no third option? XII. Can good pastors, who are blameless in doctrine and life, be justly removed from ministry for neglecting such ceremonies?</p>
      <p>Behold! Most esteemed lord, you have our difficulties. Here many and pious men are stuck. For their sake, I now ask you for the second time, to consider the matter well with Mr. Gwalter and the other colleagues, and to openly indicate what seems right to you, and to consign responses to each question in writing. You will indeed do a very pleasing thing for many, especially for me; you will also render the best service to our church. There is also another matter about which I wanted to inform you. Upon the passing of our Chamber, certain writings were entrusted to me, which once seemed to be very dear to Mr. Hooper. Among others, I found Mr. Theodor Bibliander's commentary, indeed extensive and in manuscript, on Genesis and Exodus. Since (as far as I know) this book has not been printed anywhere, I would not want the church of Christ to be deprived of such a benefit any longer. If your dignity would inform the heirs of Mr. Bibliander that this writing is with me, and they wish to publish it, indicate to whom I should deliver the book, or how it can be safely conveyed to you, and you will find me most ready to execute your will. These are the matters on which I will await your response daily; especially in the questions, I humbly ask you to indicate what you think and what the brothers think, in the name of many. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you strong and living for a very long time for His church!</p>
      <p>London, 16 February 1566.</p>
      <p>Your dignity's most observant, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Father in Christ and Lord Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
