      <p>Pious, honorable, etc. My willing service, etc. At this moment, I am being informed from Bern that nothing further has been heard from France than the last news. These days, as some believe, the Bernese are considering withdrawing from the king; therefore, they have deliberated on this matter. The majority believe the situation in France is dangerous, so their people... the Bernese mostly returned home; if they were to withdraw the others, it would be at the king's highest point, which might not bring much except great displeasure from the king. Moreover, they themselves know well what they have to deal with. When they return home, they should be punished more harshly, etc. One has come up from Bern from Heidelberg; he says to Bern that 3,000 black riders are in France, and now another 4,000 are marching to the prince. The king has also sent to Brunswick for riders, but the nobility and cavalry are not very eager, and the campaign has not yet begun. But whether it is so, I do not know; I write to you as it has come to me. God is to be earnestly prayed to, that He may bring peace to France and maintain a pious confederation in unity and prosperity. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on the first of November 1567. Yours at all times.</p>
      <p>Greet my good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Dear, if you can, please also write this to Captain Carli in Chur and greet him for me.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable lord Joachim BÃ¤ldi, former Landammann of Glarus, my kind, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Glarus.</p>
