      <p>Wilhelm, by the grace of God, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Our gracious greetings beforehand. Worthy and highly learned, dear special one, in the manner that we have written to the honorable council in Zurich on behalf of Doctor Hyperius's blessed widow, who has humbly petitioned in writing, of which we send you the enclosed copy.</p>
      <p>Since we now wish to see the aforementioned widow supported in this, her not unseemly request in our judgment, and since she hopes not only to enjoy our recommendation but also your good support in this matter, we kindly ask you, with a gracious disposition, to take this matter to heart and to show her all good support in this, so that her humble request may be granted and she may thereby obtain some comfort for herself and her children.</p>
      <p>We trust you will do this and remain well-disposed towards you with gracious goodwill. Dated at Kassel, the 10th of October in the year of our Lord 1566.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm, Landgrave of Hesse.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned, our dear special friend, Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scriptures in Zurich.</p>
      <p>"Landgrave Wilhelm regarding Hyperius's blessed books, not to be printed, and also a letter to the council of Zurich."</p>
