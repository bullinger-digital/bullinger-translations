      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest Bullinger. You know better than I do, from the letters that Lelio sent to you, about the Saxon churches being in a very bad state due to both the cruel war and the adiaphora, even though Mr. Valentin Paceus, the preacher from Leipzig, wrote little about this matter; you may wish to share more certain information.</p>
      <p>A certain mercenary came to us, who reports that the army of Mr. von Heideck is scattered and partly taken over by Maurice, partly escaped into various regions, and now trying to gather another, but lacking the resources for war. The people of Magdeburg are in great danger, pressed by enemies, so that they do not know where to turn.</p>
      <p>However, I expect letters from you, which will indicate more certain and perhaps happier news.</p>
      <p>Our Myconius is bedridden, and eats nothing, but drinks constantly; for he cannot quench his thirst; he is old, and nature is failing him by the hour, he will hardly regain his former health, although all things are possible with the Lord. Farewell and write back. February 18, 1551. Greet Mr. Theodor in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart. More soon.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schertlin has left, a good and pious man... To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent preacher at the church in Zürich, his dearest teacher. Zürich.</p>
