      <p>Greetings. You will undoubtedly wonder, most esteemed father, what reason or counsel led me, previously unknown to you, to dare to write a letter to your p[aternity], and to confess the truth, I would not have dared to attempt it on my own. However, when the most illustrious man, Mr. Gilbert Cognatus, brought me letters from your most esteemed lord, my younger patron, Mr. Georg von Stetten from Augsburg, written in your delightful Z端rich, and included several crowns, which are usually sent to me annually as a stipend, and he told me that he had received them from your p[aternity], he also asked me to at least write something brief to you, to testify that I had received the letters with the money in good faith from him. Since I had to comply with his request, I did not want to refuse.</p>
      <p>I therefore testify that I have faithfully received everything from him and at the same time I ask that you kindly forgive my shortcomings, and furthermore, I acknowledge with utmost gratitude your care, by which you wished to ensure that they were safely delivered to me.</p>
      <p>What also encouraged me to undertake this more freely was your remarkable kindness, with which you received me last summer, recommended by my most esteemed patron, when I, traveling with Mr. Wilhelm Xylander from Augsburg to Basel, turned aside to your Z端rich. But perhaps this is enough for the present, as neither your most serious occupations nor the brevity of time allow me to be more lengthy. Meanwhile, I earnestly ask your paternity to not hesitate to consider me recommended to you and also to recommend me to my patron, and to take care to transmit this packet along with the enclosed letters, which I have given to him, to Augsburg whenever it is convenient and not troublesome, and perhaps you will write to them yourself. May your p[aternity] fare most happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Written in great haste in Basel on the very Sunday of Oculi, which is the 26th of February in the year 1559. Your excellence's most devoted Emanuel Birck from Augsburg, son of the late Xystus Birck of holy memory.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, professor of sacred theology and most renowned preacher, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Z端rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father and teacher.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
