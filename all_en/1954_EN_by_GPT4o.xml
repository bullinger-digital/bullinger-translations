      <p>Dearest brother. I have little to respond to your letters. They are as follows. I urge you to be of good cheer regarding Mr. Gri[baldus]. I know everything that was done and said. They are not as some have reported. Do you want me to say it in one word? There are old enmities and disputes between Calvin (I learned this from him) and Gribal[dus], as we all carry our Adam (human nature). Therefore, Gribaldus seemed to them sometimes more bitter and turbulent than he is, although they are somewhat more irritable, as you know, sometimes. Keep this to yourself. Let me handle it. I will take good care of the man. If he does not desist, I will make sure that you and other good men understand that I abhor fanatical minds. Do I not satisfy you? I sent your booklet to Brentius along with the words you wrote to me about his book; they were pleasing. I am sending you Matthew in Hebrew (who now speaks Slavic; behold that time, of which Christ said: “The gospel will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to them, and then the end will come”). I hope to work this winter so that by the new spring I can bring the remaining part of the New Testament to the press. Currently, no other evangelist has been translated yet. Indeed, I hope to also bring the Old Testament to light in its own characters. See how much I dare as an exile and a poor man. But listen to how great an injustice your Gasner does to me in this matter: I had nothing translated except Matthew, nor do I hope to have anything until the end of winter. When I was recently there, I discussed with him about printing Matthew itself, I say Matthew; why would I discuss other evangelists? I am not so foolish; moreover, the brothers know that only Matthew was mentioned. We agreed on the price and the number; I said I would return in the summer; for someone had to be found who could correct it. For I have not advanced so much in that language that I could perform that, indeed I barely understand. When I returned to the duchy, I sent a messenger at the cost of 10 florins, given to me by the pastor of the Campidonians, to bring a man from Illyria to me who could act as a corrector; but none was found. Someone who had given hope had passed away; another did not appear. I began to urge that Campidonian pastor if he would come with me to Zurich. I could not persuade him. What then should I do? No one is bound to the impossible. Meanwhile, I wished to provide this sample, to bring Matthew alone to light. Therefore, I ordered the Tübingen printing press to be transferred here at great expense, and with great difficulty, I summoned that pastor, the only one in all of Germany who could accomplish this, and in three or four weeks we completed Matthew and the Catechism. Thus, everything was done. If necessary, I will not lack testimonies. Now, when I instructed Bort[olamaeo] Verzasco to tell all this to Gasner, I hear he began to rage against me and did not even want to listen. Is he such a great man? Does he think me worthy to be torn apart by his insults? Certainly, he did not learn this from the other Zurichers, who have always received me with great kindness and honor. But listen to the rest and be amazed at the audacity of the man. He writes to me, dictated by Sebastian, quite seriously and finally says that I promised to give him “the whole New Testament” to print this summer, so either I should come and print it, for he is ready, or I should pay him for the great amount of paper prepared, some large sum I do not know. For the faith of God and men, are such men where the gospel has been preached for 30 years? Certainly, in the middle of Babylon, there are hardly such printers, indeed I do not think there are such. At most, they would ask for two bales of prepared paper; indeed, if I proved my diligence, which I would have used in searching for a corrector, they would not even ask for that, as they could not rightfully do so. I did not say to the man: “Leave the rest; I will be there in such a week,” but as I have already said. In short: he could not do anything else to me (if he could do that; I think he cannot) than either I would give him the same amount to print, for two bales of paper, I say, or take two bales from him. Whichever he wants, if I did, it would not be a profit of six or eight florins for him, and yet he shouts as if it were about thousands. I wanted to tell you the whole matter as it happened. It is the duty of a pastor to protect guests and strangers, so they are not unjustly oppressed, and good men, so they are not torn apart. Therefore, take up my defense, which you cannot abandon. Do not neglect our friendship and relationship; imagine you have never seen Vergerius, just put before your eyes someone previously unknown and, because he was harassed by your fellow citizens and your sheep, protect him. Or if he wants to contend in court, I certainly do not refuse; I know good men will approve my cause. After this, I will certainly abstain from the man, and Grib[aldus] will abstain too; for he said he expected little profit from the two of us; this is the benefit he will gain from his inability.</p>
      <p>I returned to my region by another route. I wanted to explore these journeys, and I do not regret it, especially since I tasted that good Lindavian church. I arrived here three days ago. Aurelius followed me beyond Lindau. Tomorrow I hope to descend to Chur.</p>
      <p>Here I cannot, for I am pressed by business and the scarcity of time; but I will soon respond copiously to the two letters you wrote to me eloquently, and you will understand something about your books given to the duke and Brentius and about all those churches. The bishop of Bayonne loves you very much, with whom I have spoken much about you. I fear that it is over with England, since the emperor's relative has taken the kingdom; let us commend the cause to the Lord. The French king's fleet invaded and occupied a city in Sicily called Alica, and plundered there about 150 thousand crowns. But what you wrote to me about the lighthouse of Messina being occupied, the bishop of Bayonne does not confirm as true. The pope has sent legates to England and to the bishops of Germany to congratulate them on the victory. Another legate of the same beast came to Como and is pressing for an audience at the diet of the Rhaetians, and what else should we think he will ask for, than that Vergerius be expelled from here? But the Lord will expel him. I sent you a handwritten booklet from Tübingen with a crown inserted and asked you to send it to Basel. You replied that you received it and would ensure it was safely delivered. Now Gratarolus writes to me that he has not received that booklet with the crown, for which reason I earnestly ask you, Henr[ich] Bullinger: inquire into whose hands it has come, and if you can recover it, send it to Gratarolus. If it were lost, the loss of the crown would not move me as much as that of the booklet, which was to be printed. Farewell and be well. I will write more from Chur (as I said). May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 11, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Since the plague is spreading in the Valtellina, into which danger God does not call me, when I have completed my business, I will return here and spend part of my time here, part with you. Meanwhile, write; send letters to the legate.</p>
