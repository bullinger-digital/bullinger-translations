      <p>May God grant you and your dear wife that you both serve well and are well in body and soul; this is what we all wish for you, and I and all my people bless you.</p>
      <p>With this, I send and gift you both in the bath with very good will gold and silver, namely this gold gulden and Zurich Bohemian; please consider it good. Accordingly, I send you a little fish and a ring; I would have liked to have had more beautiful and good or larger ones; but they were not available to me. Therefore, please consider it good.</p>
      <p>We have no new news beyond what I last sent you; may God grant that everything goes well everywhere. If I receive any news, I will let you know. Just now I come from the council and citizens, before whom we (preachers, pastors) have appeared and have admonished them with the utmost seriousness to look at the matter differently and to adhere to the statutes, etc.</p>
      <p>Now waiting for the answer, etc. Eating the fried fish together and are happy; the fried perch is very good. Greet for me, yes for all of us, Susanna and the children. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated on St. Bernard's Day, August 20, Wednesday around noon, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Hans Peyer and Mr. Hans LÃ¶wen, etc. Bullinger. Each of you has a ring and the children also have one.</p>
      <p>And the written booklet, which I also send you in the bath, should be especially dear to you; it is very useful.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
