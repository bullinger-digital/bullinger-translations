      <p>S. D. P. I know you are expecting very detailed letters, most excellent man, about all my affairs and the state of our school, and the situation in the republic. I will briefly write to you about how all these matters stand at this time. The method of my study is the same as it has been until now; from the arts of speaking, which, as far as my condition allows, I understand, if I am not mistaken, I have turned to physics, and the remaining time is spent on the Latin and Greek languages; for I am listening to the speeches of Isocrates, Herodian, and the Philippic 1 of Cicero under the most learned men, and if a greater opportunity presents itself, I will devote myself entirely to the mathematical disciplines. I will acquire knowledge of the principles of medicine and jurisprudence (if so much time is granted) so that I can prescribe a certain way of living for myself in the future.</p>
      <p>In the month of July, a tumult was stirred up by the students over the seized meadow, which they call the clerics'; but since the rector of the academy ordered the students to abstain from arms, the matter did not come to blows. A few days later, through the king's wisdom and the dexterity of the Parisian senate, the tumult subsided, not without great detriment to those by whom the meadow was occupied with buildings; for they were ordered to demolish the houses, and the students devastated the most cultivated fields. Furthermore, on the first of August in the Mobertine district, four men from the town of Langres were hanged and burned because they were believed to have declared war on the papal ceremonies and to have joined Luther's side. I hear that the Sorbonne has obtained greater privileges from King Henry than it had before, which they might use to rage more fiercely against the Lutherans, who indeed lived in great tranquility this summer. The studies of arts and languages would soon be seen to flourish in our academy, if not for the obstacle of the theologians' Aristotle; nevertheless, something better and more perfect arises from these studies every day.</p>
      <p>But I would like to add a few things about my own... here. With the guidance and leadership of God, I will spend the month of October traveling with a few coins received, for otherwise, the expenses have grown enough; I understand that it will be more useful for my way of living to see Orléans and Poitiers, cities flourishing in the studies of law and jurisprudence, than if I were to stay at home in the meantime. Later, I have decided to visit Bordeaux, unless the cold and lack of money prevent me. If a condition not unfavorable to my plans should perhaps present itself there, I think I should stay for many reasons; for many things are imported by merchants, since it is a maritime city, and furthermore, the studies of philosophy flourish... the learned pursue foreigners with great favor, and it would not be useless if I privately devote myself to educating students; for in this way, I would imprint the arts of speaking more deeply in my mind, add more to these beginnings, and prepare myself in this way for more serious studies. However, I will never allow myself to be thrust into any mill; but if the outcome does not meet my wishes and this opportunity for learning slips away, it will still be beautiful to have seen the cities and customs of many people.</p>
      <p>Aquitaine certainly thinks and speaks more freely about religion than the rest of France. Later, if I wish to apply what I understand in the studies of philosophy and engage in the studies of theology and exercise myself in many studies, perhaps I will be able to achieve something more excellent. I have written to you about my way of living and the plan for my studies in the future because I have no one more diligent in my affairs; I have not written to my father, who can judge less about studies, but I judge the same thing, if I write to you, who can report each detail more accurately and diligently to my parents, with whom you have the greatest necessity. In the meantime, I promise you my industry and effort and would like you to be convinced that I will be most diligent in fulfilling every literary duty, and there is no need to fear that I will encounter the dangers of travel; for I know whom I should join and how to travel. The journey to Paris has taught me this; for I would now like to travel 300 miles with less trouble and expense than 50 before. Furthermore, this journey is frequented by students... it is. But how things have turned out, I will explain more fully shortly. Everyone thinks the plague will soon rage, which will drive me out of the city even against my will. I wrote to you and my parents a few days ago; whether you have received the letters or not, I do not know; I recently received yours from the Zurich legate. Paris does not have many who travel to you, which allows our letters to reach you rarely. May the best and greatest God keep you safe for a long time in promoting good studies.</p>
      <p>Do not disdain to convey my greetings to my parents, your wife, children, and the whole family.</p>
      <p>Paris, in the year 1548, September 21. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Antistes of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed patron. Zürich.</p>
