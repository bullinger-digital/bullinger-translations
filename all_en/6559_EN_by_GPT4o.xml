      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you some time ago that, while I greatly delight in your letters, I am quite willing to allow you to consider your health and your occupations, and to write to me only when it is convenient and without trouble.</p>
      <p>The same now, my most desired Mr. Bullinger, I repeat and even more so because, with your last letters, you included homilies on Daniel, with which I can entertain myself for several months, even if I receive nothing from you in the meantime. Therefore, I free you from that care and, as the saying goes, bid you to sleep on both ears...</p>
