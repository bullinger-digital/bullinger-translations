      <p>Greetings. Revered Father, beloved brother in Christ, in my last letter I included the articles of Lord Mauritz, our captive in the Lord, so that you may see the accusation and his defense, albeit in a concise form. I urge him to treat it a little more extensively. On the next Wednesday, October 15th, he will be compelled to present his case again before the court - this is hardly possible today; because they act secretly and cunningly, I have found out, and have also informed our magistrate of this matter.</p>
      <p>I wish that they would intervene with their authority; if they do not, I certainly fear for his life. There is a commotion among us, the bailiff wants - contrary to custom and the very old tradition, as well as the privileges of the town - to appoint other blood judges, I do not know where and which; because he fears that the Lutherans, as we are called, will not judge according to his liking. This is hardly likely to happen, as I hear from some; because that would be a dangerous act. There are also various rumors among us about this matter, because of which I wish that you would seriously (the same captive also desires this) negotiate with our lords, the councilors, and our entire holy senate, so that they send someone to handle the matter strongly and faithfully. I have learned that our councilor from Chur cannot be present due to certain affairs. We will sorely miss him. For it seems to him indeed that the fierce lion will be even more determined to bring him into the jaws. I have written this briefly through many cares and concerns. Longer writings are also not always possible for you to read due to your infinite affairs, with which you are overwhelmed and occupied. Hastily, from Frauenfeld in Thurgau, October 13th, in the year 67.</p>
      <p>Your devoted Christian NÃ¤geli.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, and his most revered father. To Zurich.</p>
