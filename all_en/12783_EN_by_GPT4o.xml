    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Claudius was very touched that Bullinger, in response to his insignificant petition [HBBW XVIII, No. 2699], mentioned him in his letter [not received] to Vadian (the pride of Helvetia) and encouraged him to continue writing. He can only attribute this to Bullinger's scholarship and kindness. He will strive to be of service to him in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He asked his lord [Hieronymus Sailer] if he had any news to report to Bullinger. Sailer said that he had nothing unknown to the people of Zurich. However, he sends his warm regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is now certain that the people of Ulm have abandoned the imperial cities allied with them and have committed to Emperor Charles V not to enter into any alliances with anyone; to return the church properties previously illegally confiscated to the clergy; to once again submit to the yoke of the papacy, the priests, and the monks; and, if necessary, to provide assistance against the Turks. This poses a great danger to Augsburg and all of Germany: it means the reintroduction of idolatry, the desecration of holy things, the misuse of the sacraments, and the denial of Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] From Antwerp, Sailer learned that Landgrave Philip of Hesse had conversed with the Duke Henry of Brunswick, whom he held captive, and then went to Duke Maurice of Saxony; furthermore, that in the Netherlands and elsewhere, a lot of money from the annual incomes of the clergy is being gathered to enable [the Emperor] to resume the war.</p>

      <p>Best wishes for a happy New Year to your eminence in Christ Jesus, etc.!</p>

      <p>Since you, most learned and exceedingly kind man, responded so graciously and amicably to my insignificant and begging letters through Lord Joachim Vadian (the unique pride of Switzerland, if I may say so with your permission), and invited me to continue writing, I would consider myself inhumane and devoid of all gentleness if I did not strive to repay that openness of spirit, which I see is inclined towards me due to your studies in humanity, with some service or letters. Although I am unworthy to enjoy the acquaintance and friendship of such great men, I believe that this should not be attributed to my virtue, learning, or any merits of mine, but rather to your humanity, kindness, and gentleness, which shine forth in you above other virtues. For the true fruit of studies is to have such manners that everyone loves them, and to be endowed with such glory, which, acquired through virtue, invites, captivates, and draws all men to admiration, study, and emulation of oneself. For I embrace, love, and venerate such men, in whom I see the traces of ancient virtue and integrity expressed and shining forth, as I indeed judge you to be in my mind, as if they were some divine presence, and I have declared myself in deed whenever an opportunity to serve your humanity has been given.</p>

      <p>I do not have much to write now. I asked my lord if he had any news to share with you, who sends you his most dutiful greetings. However, he asks to be excused, as he has nothing new that is not already known to you.</p>

      <p>It is certain that the people of Ulm have defected from the imperial cities and have been accepted into submission by the Emperor under these conditions: first, that they confirm by oath never to enter into any alliance with anyone; second, that they restore the possessions of the clergy, previously illegally seized, intact; third, that they submit to the papal yoke or receive priests and monks; fourth, that they send aid against the Turks if necessary. Consider, with your prudence, how dangerous this defection will be for the remaining imperial cities, especially Augsburg. For if they refuse these conditions, surrounded by enemies on all sides, it will not be safe to set foot outside the walls. If they accept, what great sins will they commit, what great offense against God and men will they prepare? What else can be expected but the ruin of noble Germany, the restoration of idolatry, the profanation of all sacred things, the abuse of the sacraments, and finally the denial of Christ? Who doubts this?</p>

      <p>It is written from Antwerp that Lord Landgrave Philip of Hesse, having conversed with Duke Henry of Brunswick, whom he held captive, then went to Duke Maurice of Saxony; also, that a great amount of silver is being collected in the Netherlands and another part of the annual incomes of the clergy is being cut to restore the war much more severely than before.</p>

      <p>May Christ preserve, govern, and liberate His Church amidst a thousand dangers! Farewell. On the first day of January 1547. Matthias Claudius, tutor of the sons of Hieronymus Sailer, most devoted to your eminence.</p>
