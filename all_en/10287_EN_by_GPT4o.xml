    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns Bullinger's Gospel Annotations with thanks after use. Regrets that he cannot give Bullinger anything of equal value, describes his own modest education, and urges the publication of the Annotations. Bucer's Gospel Commentaries are too extensive, but Bullinger's style is understandable to everyone. Bullinger's and Pellican's commentaries are read more by the brethren than those of Zwingli (whose style is too difficult), Bucer, Capito, Luther, and Bugenhagen. According to Claude Farel's report, Pellican's, Zwingli's, and Bucer's commentaries are openly sold in Paris, and Zwingli's Psalms Commentary was even printed in Lyon. Pellican should complete his commentary work, but Bullinger should produce even more. Leo Jud should also publish the Zwingli writings he has in his possession. Cardinal Thomas Cajetan published, according to Farel's report, a Reformation-friendly book, despite the protest of the Sorbonne. Melchior Tilman in Bern. Haller awaits Bullinger's promised visit. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending back with this messenger, a truly pious and poor man, the treasure you entrusted to me for so many days, most learned Heinrich, as a most abundant testimony of your love for me. For, to be honest, I reluctantly offer my very barbaric and unworthy writings to be read by anyone, not only because they lack any erudition, but also because I can hardly do without them and readers are not always kind. Therefore, I thank you as much as I can, with eternal gratitude. I had already explained to you in a certain letter my ignorance and the misfortune of my studies, which the church will testify how much you have now helped with many things. I have never used any living teacher in evangelical matters. Whatever books were published and seemed to contribute to preaching or doing something, I read them. I did not hear any evangelical preacher before our disputation. Sebastian, who is now in Augsburg, began to teach Christ with me with almost similar learning. Therefore, my dear Heinrich, do not regret sharing with me the labors of your spirit and the offspring of your genius. I have copied a large part of the book, reviewed it again, so that if I had omitted anything in the first effort due to negligence, I could make up for it later. If I have handled the manuscript more carelessly than you would like, forgive me. However, I ask you for the sake of the Christian republic's benefit and the brothers, whom I do not doubt are almost countless with similar learning to mine, to consider making your annotations public. But you might say that Bucer has already completed this work long ago. You know in what times he wrote, how he was sometimes forced to treat common topics more extensively than necessary. Those who are less familiar with the Latin language also dislike long periods. Many things in his work also seem to be described more curiously and elaborately. Nevertheless, he completed his task excellently. But since the Lord has granted you this gift, that you excel in a clearer style and with much grace and skill in expressing the genuine meaning - I speak and write this without flattery, as God knows -, you bring forth the light of God's word with such clarity, removing the bushel (I mean the more intricate and obscure sentences), that no brother can excuse himself for ignorance any longer, and you wish to teach us with your annotations. In Zwingli's commentaries, they disliked the gravity of style and the variety of languages, in Bucer the prolixity, as well as in Capito. Very few use Luther, and they complain that they cannot make any progress with Pomeranus's annotations. You two hold the first place at this time, you and Pellican. Pellican's commentary is publicly sold in Paris, as Farel's companion and brother reported at this hour in Farel's presence, who sends you greetings. All your works, but secretly, are circulated in the hands of all the pious. Zwingli's Psalter was printed in Lyon with the paraphrase of Johannes Campensis by Gryphius, suppressing Zwingli's name. It is sold openly and is being reprinted in Paris. Bucer's Psalter is also sold openly. Therefore, continue, one in the work not yet completed; you, however, so that you can benefit all churches and brothers, do not spare your labor, as you do. I know that there are many Zwinglian works with Leo, which he communicates with Megander. If only he would restore and ensure they are published, so that he would not enjoy Zwingli alone, whether alive or dead. You might wonder why I urge you to write so much: there is indeed no other reason than that I see almost everyone at this time so alienated from study, that unless everything is offered to their eyes very clearly and explicitly, there are few who attempt or strive to achieve anything with their own efforts. Therefore, you, to whom this talent has been entrusted by the Lord, do not hide it, knowing the Lord's judgment on the lazy servant. Put the light "on a candlestick" [Mt 5, 15 par.].</p>
      <p>While writing, Farel reports something else, namely that Cardinal Thomas Cajetan, the general of the Dominican order, has agreed with us on many things, about auricular confession, the marriage of priests, divorce, which he admits for the man, not the woman, and that everything in churches should be conducted only in the native language. He wrote on these matters. When the Sorbonne theologians in Paris wanted to condemn it, the Chancellor of Paris forbade them to define anything without the scriptures. The Pope also forbade the Sorbonne theologians under anathema. Cajetan's work was printed by Badius and on the first page it is written: "Seen and approved by the Supreme Pontiff".</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing new with us. Some senators have been riding around our fields these days to inspect the armor of individuals.</p>
      <p>Melchior Tilmann reported many things from your mouth, but since he brought no letters, I did not want to entrust him with either letters or a book. I fear the man's nonsense and would ask you to inform me through this messenger how trustworthy and reputable that man is with you. He would like to settle here; he is on the lookout for advice, I do not know the outcome.</p>
      <p>Finally, you have now completed the Acts. Now it will be necessary for you to complete your journey to us as well and fulfill what you promised once. For I will be expecting you. Please write the truth about your affairs at least once. Many desire this, as many spread many things from here. I will be expecting you, but see that it is not in vain as it was last year.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well forever, dearest brother, not the least part of my soul. May your family be well. May Pellican also be safe, whom you should not pass by without greeting in my name. May all your fellow students be safe, Leo, Carolstadius, and the others.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 25, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his brother, by far the dearest of all.</p>
