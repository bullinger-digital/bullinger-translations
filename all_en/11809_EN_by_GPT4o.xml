    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter. [Archbishop Hermann of Wied] fears the worst from the enemies of Christ, but trusts in God; in Cologne, there is agitation particularly from the [Cathedral] Chapter against [Bucer and his colleagues]. On July 23, the Landtag will meet to discuss the Reformation, the draft of which is available; in case of rejection, the name of Christ will face disgrace; Germany is hastening its fate through godless behavior; may the Lord assist His own! Greetings to Bullinger and his colleagues, also from Philipp [Melanchthon] and [Johannes] Pistorius.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ the Lord, venerable and most beloved Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I give you great thanks for your letters. Our elder has long expected more severe things from the antichrist and others. He has placed all his trust in the Lord; you will pray with us that He does not allow His enemies to say: "Where is the Christ of these people?" For the whole of Cologne, along with the leading members of the chapter and the greater part, rages against us with incredible fury, not merely seeking defeat, but the extinction of the elder.</p>
      <p>The provincial assembly will be held on July 23 to conclude on the reformation, the draft of which has been composed. In this assembly, unless the Lord keeps the three remaining orders from the chapter in their duty, namely the counts, knights, and towns, there will be a great downfall of the saints and an insult to the name of Christ among the impious. Through wars, Epicureanism, and open opposition to Christ, Germany is hastening its fate. May the Lord either bring an end to all things and make a full redemption of His own or preserve and increase His small flock, so that the invocation of His name is not silenced.</p>
      <p>I ask you to diligently commend me to all your colleagues, whom Christ may guard and bless along with your church and school. Amen. The same is prayed for you by Dr. Philipp and Pistorius.</p>
      <p>Bonn, July 21.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
