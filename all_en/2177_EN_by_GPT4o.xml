      <p>S. I am sending my son, about whom I have written to you so many times, bothering your kindness.</p>
      <p>I can affirm that he has never been caught by me in any dishonest act. He is not lacking in intelligence. He has a basic knowledge of literature and needs a little more diligent practice and a more learned teacher; for he has never heard anyone except me. I ask you to give him letters to Sulzer, testifying that he is the one for whom you are being asked. I have also written these words to Sulzer; it seemed appropriate to send a copy to you. If it seems right, return them to him; if not, keep them and delete the ones I wrote to him. I am sending testimonial letters to Vergerio, not the kind he requested, but the kind the brothers thought should be given; he is rather ambitious. - Traversus, having sent letters again, asks that I go there to preach the Lord Jesus; he also asked our council.</p>
      <p>The council has granted that I may go there and preach for a few weeks; I will set out the day after tomorrow, if God wills. I hope for the best; pray to God for success. Comander gave an excellent speech in the temple against the bishop who invited our women to dance. By order of the council, it is forbidden to go there for mass, dancing is prohibited, and torn shoes are banned. Junker Hans von Marmels, the lord of Raezins, has died in recent days. There is hope that the gospel will be preached in that place. There is nothing new with us. Farewell, most esteemed man, and continue to love us in return. Comander, Pontisella, Haymius, and Tschernerus send their greetings to you. From Chur, on the 3rd of February, 1554.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness, Philipp Gallicius. To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and beloved by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
