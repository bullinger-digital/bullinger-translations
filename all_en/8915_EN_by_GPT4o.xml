      <p>S. I am sending you, honorable man, the letters of Mr. Cognetius addressed to you and Mr. Gwalther. If they are delivered late, attribute it to the lack of couriers; for I could not send them sooner. As for my own letters, which I sent to you about my affairs several days ago, I hope they have been delivered to you; therefore, I have nothing at this time that needs to be written urgently. I do not doubt that you have already been informed about the sudden change in the Netherlands. We have certainly heard that Valenciennes, Mons, and Douai have already defected to Prince Orange, and they also add Brussels; may this matter have the desired outcome!</p>
      <p>The King of France, although many of his people are setting out for this war, does not yet seem to act openly in a hostile manner; but when he sees the success of the plans, he might declare himself more openly; for it is without doubt that these things are happening by his nod and will.</p>
      <p>The wedding might be postponed until September due to the groom's poor health; but I cannot write anything certain about this matter.</p>
      <p>The Queen, his mother, has been in this city for three weeks with a small retinue, and I do not think she will leave before her son's wedding. I was delighted by her devotion and piety when I saw her prostrate on the ground with all her attendants during the consecration of the table.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the King of France is occupied with hunting in Orléans and the surrounding areas; however, we expect him next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>From the letters of my noble lord father, I have learned about your Rhaetian tumult; I am indeed amazed at those restless minds; but they receive a reward worthy of their deeds; let the rest be wise, if they wish.</p>
      <p>If you write back to Mr. Cognetius, please, on occasion, commend me to him; for he has given me hope of obtaining those 200 pounds in the future as well.</p>
      <p>I ask you to convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther, Wolfius, Cellarius, and others who know me. Lasicius sends his regards to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Paris, on the first day of June in the year 1572. Johannes Philippus, free baron of Hohensax, etc., your most loving, has signed.</p>
      <p>I have not written to my lord father because I am uncertain whether he is with you; if he is, please convey this to him.</p>
      <p>[To] the reverend and most illustrious man, Mr. [He]inrich Bullinger the elder, [min]ister of the church of Zurich... to his friend and as to his father to be respected. Zürich.</p>
