      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you, dearest godfather in the Lord, on the seventh of this month; at present, there is nothing to add; I did not want to neglect the opportunity to write. Although these cities, Zurich and Bern, are so close, I often wonder why there is such a rare opportunity to send letters; I wish and earnestly desire that there be more mutual commerce and goodwill between these cities.</p>
      <p>I do not know what vexes me; it always seems to me that the hearts do not want to align properly and sufficiently in these difficult times. I groan about this to myself, but silently, and I pray to the Lord that for the sake of His word, He may reconcile the minds of these people. I have not heard anything about our Germany for a long time. I cannot forget so many churches that have both recognized and professed the truth of God's gospel for several years; I still do not cease to hope that soon we will sing a new song to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding England, since Montius left here, I have received nothing; I beg you, if you have anything, share it. I hoped that our Gervasius would be called by the people of Biel, but, as I hear, another was called, namely Funck from Constance. Everything at my home is now peaceful by the grace of God. The envoys, whom I wrote to you about in the matter of our godfather Mr. Haller, were detained beyond the appointed day; perhaps you know the reason from elsewhere: in one evening... the decision was changed.</p>
      <p>What will happen now, I do not yet understand. May the Lord grant that we diligently seek His glory and that He does not turn His grace away from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well, dearest godfather in the Lord. Greetings to your entire household above and below, young and old, all together, also to mother Klunglerin.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you. Greetings to all the lords and brothers and to our Gervasius. Bern, January 16, 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your godfather. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church of Zurich, his dearest godfather in Christ. Zurich.</p>
