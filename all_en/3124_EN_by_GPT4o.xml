      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written about Comander is because Bellinchetti and Mr. Friedrich traveled there, and I did not doubt that they would inform you of everything. Then, when the lords instructed me to write, I replied that it was proper and in their interest for them to write themselves. Regarding your friend and my colleague, I fully hope, as you write; from a single sermon, I perceive him to be very prepared for preaching. May Christ the Lord bless our hope. But why do I say more? You will learn everything from him and from the letters of our lords. Farewell again, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the first day of March in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
