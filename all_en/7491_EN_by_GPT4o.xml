      <p>Greetings in Christ. I believe I have received all your letters of piety, for which I give you the greatest thanks. I did not respond during the last Frankfurt fair because at the beginning of Lent I was suffering from a tertian fever, which was followed by an eye disease; but now, by the grace of the Lord, I have recovered well.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you and the people of Geneva on such a peaceful state of affairs; which can indeed be considered a miracle. For you have the most hostile adversaries on all sides.</p>
      <p>Our vestment controversy, about which you write, had subsided for a time; but it flared up again last winter, due to the efforts of some who are more zealous than either learned or endowed with pious prudence. Some citizens of London of the lower order, joined by four or five ministers who were neither distinguished by judgment nor learning, openly defected from us, and sometimes held their meetings in private houses, sometimes in the fields, and even sometimes on ships, and administered the sacraments. They also ordained ministers, elders, and deacons in their own manner; they even excommunicated some who had defected from their church. They consider Dr. Laurence Humphrey, Sampson, Lever, and others, who have suffered much for the freedom concerning indifferent matters, as semi-papists because they do not join them, and they do not allow their followers to listen to their sermons. Those of this faction number about two hundred; but the number of women is greater than that of men. The royal councilors recently imprisoned the chief leaders of this faction, and are working to ensure that this sect is timely restrained.</p>
      <p>I know you are continually informed about the affairs of France and the Netherlands. In Scotland, new disturbances have arisen. On the second of May last, the queen, who was held captive in a castle situated on Loch Leven, escaped from prison by bribing her guards and fled to Hamilton Castle, where she gathered soldiers. On the 13th of May, the regent of the kingdom (as they call him), having gathered an army, engaged in a light skirmish with those who stood by the queen. The queen's army was put to flight. About a hundred were lost; the rest, who could have been destroyed to a man, were spared as they fled. The queen herself, accompanied by a few, fled to the sea, and having boarded a small boat, crossed the narrow strait at the mouth of the Solway Firth, and reached the city of Carlisle, which is in our kingdom. She still remains in the castle of that city, but under honorable custody.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland asks us for assistance to be restored to her kingdom, which she says she resigned to her son under duress; or at least to be safely sent to France to test the loyalty of her friends there. On the other hand, the Scottish nobles, through their envoys, ask that she be handed over to them again for custody, asserting that it is unworthy for her to reign again, as she procured the death of the king consort and later joined in adulterous marriage with the regicide Bothwell, who still had a living wife. What will be decided about these matters, we do not yet know. May the Lord turn everything to good!</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, if the Lord grants life, I will ensure you are informed. I ask you to greet Dr. Gwalter and the other brothers in my name. May the Lord preserve you, truly reverend in the Lord, and dearest brother! London, June 9, 1568.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>As I was about to seal this, it was reported to me that the Duke of Alba in Brussels on the 5th of this month executed Count Egmont and Horn and about twenty other nobles by capital punishment. It appears that the man, naturally quite fierce, was provoked to such cruelty after the unfortunate battle with Louis of Nassau near Groningen. However, in that battle, Alba lost (as it is said) two thousand Spaniards and three thousand Walloons (as they are called). Also, Count von Orenberg and some notable Spanish leaders fell there.</p>
      <p>Count Egmont admitted a monk as confessor and adored the cross at the place of execution. Count von Horn rejected all this and died in true confession.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother.</p>
