  <input>Rodolpho Wingartero suo in Christo fratri dilectissimo.

Benedictio filli dei et domini nostri Jesu Christi sit super te, frater in Christo charissime.

Effari non possum, quantis gaudiorum cumulis tum me, tum omnis pectoris mei sinus gaudio referserit pulcherrimus iste, qui nuper apud nos spargi de te coepit, rumor de christiano tui animi genio. Macte ergo virtute dei, sic itur ad astra! Evangelion predicas, egregie facis: spetiosissima tuae tuorumque salutis iacta sunt fundamenta. Quid autem hortari incipiam, ut rem divino spiritu inchoatam absolvas, qui id animo moribusque tuis de te spondeas, nihil recusaturum, quod faciat et ad gloriam Christi et ad tuarum ovium salutem? Sic enim ab ineunte juventute seminaria que-dam exhibuisti, quod dei gloriam et proximi compendium spires, atque ob eam rem mirum, quoties te mecaenas [!] noster Volcatius pie quidem laudibus vehat; proinde non erat, quod calcaria tibi admovere necessarium ducerem. Facit tamen incredibilis quidam erga te ardor meus, ut currentem, quod aiunt, incitare compellar. I bone, quo virtus dei te vocat, i pede fausto! Ea certe te nunc aetas tenet, ut possis judicare extincto calore et praecipitantia iuvenili, quae vera piaque doctrina et quid ovibus tuis aut comodo sit aut incomodo.

Esto, proclametur a mundo dei evangelion blasphemum! Verum quid mundus cum evangelio commune habet, quid cum carne spiritus, aut veritas cum hypocrisi? An non ipse Christus, dei filius, cum universa fidelium congregatione hac ignominia deturpatus fuit? Et quid aliud ei obiiciunt impii quam: «demonium habes», quid apostolis, nisi: «musto pleni sunt»? Et quid monet Christus aliud per integra Ioannis capita quam hoc, quod videmus, nempe evangelion male audire apud homines? Quid aliud docet Paulus, quid Lucas in Actis? [Apg 4,1 ff; 5, 17ff u. ö.] Imo in hoc, quod adeo persequtionem patitur evangelion, se ex deo esse palam ostendit. Malorum quidem procellis sic occurrit beatitudinis fons, Christus: «Beati, cum probra in vos iecerint homines» etc. Proinde, cum eorum persequtio seu famae deturpatio, qui verbo dei herent, nihil sit neque novi, fortuiti, neque insperati aut desperati, adeo te persequtio reselire [!] non faciat, ut multo magis attrahat. Ignoras Pauli vocem? «Si adhuc hominibus placerem, Christi servus non essem». Navitae vel aurigae tempestatuum [!] violentiam adeo non verentur, ut certo sciant se non posse nisi sub aeris intemperie negotiari. Iam tu quoque eam subiisti provinciam, in qua non potes non tonitrua atque hominum expectare fulmina. Episcopus es, oeconomus «et dispensator misteriorum [!] dei».

Hic omnino necessum est aut hanc rem cum summa peragere laude, aut cum aeterna defatigari damnatione. Certum enim verbum domini, quod nobis hoc pacto ab Ezechiele prolatum est: «Fili hominis, speculatorem te dedi domui Izrael; et audies de ore meo verbum et anunciabis eis de me. Si, dicente me ad impium: «morte morieris», non anunciaveris ei, neque loqutus fueris, ut avertatur a via sua impia et vivat, ipse impius in iniquitate sua morietur, sanguinem autem eius de manu tua requiram. Si autem tu anunciaveris impio, et ille non fuerit conversus ab impietate sua et a via sua impia, ipse quidem in impietate sua morietur, tu autem animam tuam liberasti.» Hic iam veterum horrendissima damnationum exempla intuere: Nadab et Abiu ignem alienum offerentes in conspectu sanctuarii miserabiliter pereunt; et cui iam dubium, quin omnes simili mortis genere perimantur, quotquot alienum ignem praeter Christi salvatoris in cordibus fidelium deum glorificantem accendere tentant. Animadversionem vero dei sevissimam in Chore, Dathan, Abyron et Hon silentio iam transiliam, quod alias copiose in Numeris Mosaicis descripta sit. Quanto autem verborum pondere, quanta spiritus numerosa verborum turba peccatum filiorum Hell describitur? Quod scilicet deum ignorarent, «dormirentque cum mulieribus, quae observabant ad ostium tabernaculi». Ceterum illud, queso, quid aliud est quam verbum dei negligere, - quo neglecto necesse est, ut omnis cadat pietas et dei cognitio - stuprare item animas deum querentes, quas polluunt et a deo abducunt imundo sacrilego et adulterino semine, quotquot aliam doctrinam praeter verbum dei predicant? Prophetes quoque alius, eo, quod non obedisset sermonibus domini dei, a leone discerpitur, neque adminiculatur refugium, quod alius eum prophetes edere iusserat. Procul dubio neque tibi aliorum episcoporum exemplum, mores et vita in hac re patrocinari poterunt, quicquid tandem illi sive predicent sive dicant. Te constituit pastorem super oves suas altissimus, te vult esse pastorem fidelem, in hoc, ut aquam non lutulentam pedibusque turbatam, pascua item non conculcata pedibus, sed viridem herbam proponas sitientibusque aquas adaperias quovis cristallo translucidiores. Tibi luditur ista fabula: beatus, qui intelligit.</input>
  <output>To Rodolpho Wingartero, his dearest brother in Christ.

The blessing of the son of God and our Lord Jesus Christ be upon you, dearest brother in Christ.

I cannot express how much joy this beautiful rumour that recently began to spread among us about your Christian character has brought to me and to the depths of my heart. So, be praised with the strength of God, thus you will reach the stars! You preach the Gospel, you do it excellently: the foundations of your own and your flock's salvation have been laid most laudably. What then, should I begin to exhort you to, so that you would complete the task that you have started in the spirit of God, and that you shall be sure that you will not reject anything that will lead to the glory of Christ and to the salvation of your flock? For, from the beginning of your youth you have shown such seminaries, that you and those of your company aspire to the glory of God and the benefit of their neighbour. For this reason it is no wonder that our patron Volcatius praises you so piously. And so I thought it was needless to urge you on with a spur. However, my incredible passion for you forces me to urge on one who is already running. O good one, to where God's virtue calls you, go with a lucky foot! For now you have reached an age wherein you can judge with extinguished heat and reckless youth, what is the true and pious doctrine and what is beneficial or detrimental to your flock.

Let the world proclaim the Gospel of God to be blasphemous! But what does the world have in common with the Gospel, what does the flesh with the spirit, or the truth with hypocrisy? Was not the son of God, Christ, and the entire congregation of the faithful defamed with this dishonour? And what do the wicked accuse him of other than: "You have a demon"? What do they accuse the apostles of other than: "They are filled with wine"? What else does Christ teach through the entire chapters of John, other than what we see, namely, that the Gospel is heard badly by men? What else does Paul teach, what does Luke in Acts? [Acts 4:1 ff; 5:17 ff etc.] In fact, in that it suffers persecution, the Gospel makes it clear that it is of God. But the fountain of beatitude, Christ, thus meets the storms of the wicked: "Blessed are you when men shall revile you" etc. Therefore, since the persecution or defamation of those who adhere to the word of God is nothing new, fortuitous, unexpected or desperate, do not let the persecution make you waver, but rather attract you even more. Do you not know Paul's words? "If I still pleased men, I would not be the servant of Christ". Do sailors or charioteers not fear the violence of the storms, knowing that they can only negotiate under the inclemency of the weather? You too have undertaken the province in which you cannot but expect thunder and lightning from men. You are a bishop, an oeconomus "and a steward of the mysteries of God".

Here it is absolutely necessary to either complete this task with the highest praise, or to be exhausted with eternal damnation. For the certain word of the Lord that was thus proclaimed to us by Ezekiel: "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul. "Now look at the horrific examples of the old damnations: Nadab and Abihu, miserably dying when offering strange fire in the sight of the sanctuary; and who would doubt that they all perish with the same kind of death, who ever tried to light a strange fire other than that of the saviour Christ in the hearts of the faithful, who glorify God? But I will pass over in silence the severest punishment of God that was inflicted on Chore, Dathan, Abyron and Hon, since it has been described in detail in the Mosaic Numbers. But what weight of words, what numerous troop of spirit of words describes the sin of the children of Hell? That they would ignore God and "sleep with the women who watched at the door of the tabernacle". But what else is this, I ask, than neglecting the word of God, - and with the neglect of which it is necessary for all piety and knowledge of God to fall - also defiling the souls seeking God, whom they pollute and lead away from God with an impure, sacrilegious and adulterous seed, who preach any other doctrine than the word of God? I will also pass over in silence the prophet who is torn apart by a lion for not obeying the words of the Lord God, and there is no refuge, for which another prophet had ordered him. Without doubt, neither the example, the morals and the life of the other bishops can support you in this matter, whatever they preach or say. The highest has appointed you shepherd over his sheep, He wants you to be a faithful shepherd, to offer not muddy water and a pasture trodden by feet, but green grass and to open up waters more transparent than any crystal to those who are thirsty. This fable is played for you: blessed is he who understands.</output>

  <input>Prophetae Baal, eo, quod populum dei verbo fraudassent, sevissime et crudelissime ab Helia iugulantur; extat eius rei testimonium 3. Reg. 18 [1 Kön 18, 21 ff]. Sed et Jesaias clamat: «Quod si non dixerint iuxta verbum hoc, non erit eis matutina lux. Et transibit per eam et corruet et esuriet, et cum esurierit, irascetur et maledicet regi suo et deo suo; et suspiciet sursum et ad terram intuebitur: et ecce tribulatio et tenebrae et dissolutio et angustia et caligo persequens, et non poterit avolare de angustia sua.» Subsequitur Hieremi as: «A minore quippe usque ad maiorem omnes avaritiae student et a propheta usque ad sacerdotem cuncti faciunt dolum. Et curabant contritionem filiae populi mei cum ignominia, dicentes: «pax, pax, pax!» - et non erat pax. Confusi sunt, quia abominationem fecerunt; quin potius confusione non sunt confusi et erubescere nescierunt. Quamobrem cadent inter ruentes; in tempore visitationis suae corruent, dicit dominus.» Adiicit et Ezechiel: «Quia loquti estis vana et vidistis mendatium, ideo ecce ego ad vos, ait dominus deus. Et erit manus mea super prophetas, qui vident vana et divinant mendatium. In consilio populi mei non erunt» etc. Acclamat et Micheas: «Haec dicit dominus deus super prophetas, qui seducunt populum meum, qui mordent dentibus suis et praedicant pacem, et si quis non dederit in ore eorum quidpiam, sanctificant super eum praelium: Propterea nox vobis pro visione erit et tenebrae vobis pro divinatione; et occumbet sol super prophetas et obtenebrabitur super eos dies» etc.

Quare, cum his et clarissimis et certissimis dei verbis certo certius poenam intentatam habeas, si ab ipsius verbo desciscas, summa ope adnitendum, ut, quam purissime fieri potest, ovibus tuis verbi dei purissimum pabulum proponas. Cogita te unum esse, quo omnium tuorum spes pendet et doctrina; perpende te non modo animarum dei esse ductorem, verum et fratrum charissimorum. Sanguineus, profecto sanguinarius, neque lupus modo, sed et latro omnium sevissimus, quos terra tulit, fores, si post agnitam veritatem dulcissimo pabulo tuos illos defraudares; non homo, sed tyrannus truculentissimus, si etiamnum veritatem illis occluderes! An non tum quidem in te quadraret truculentissima domini vox, ita intonans: «Vae vobis, quia clauditis regnum coelorum ante homines. Vos enim non intratis, nec advenientes sinitis intrare». Aut ut Lucas refert clarius: «Vae vobis legisperitis, quia tulistis clavem scientiae; ipsi non introistis, et eos, qui introibant, vetuistis.» Apertus est et apostoli textus: «Propterea quod, cum deum cognoverunt, non ut deum glorificaverunt neque grati fuerunt, sed frustrati sunt per cogitationes suas et obtenebratum est insciens cor eorum. Cum se crederent esse sapientes, stulti facti sunt» etc. - Nescio, quid magis probum virum movere possit. Intuere vel hoc etiam, quot habeas quotidie piarum animarum centurias, quas ceu derelictas cernis coram te assistere ac ardenter salutem spirare.</input>
  <output>The prophets of Baal, because they had deceived the people of God, were most severely and cruelly slain by Elijah; the testimony of this remains in 3 Kings 18 [1 Kings 18, 21 ff]. But even Isaiah cries out: "If they do not speak according to this word, there will be no morning light for them. It will pass through and fall, and when it is hungry, it will become angry and curse its king and its God; and it will look up and look to the ground: and behold, trouble, darkness, dissolution, distress and darkness chasing it, and it will not be able to flee from its distress. " Jeremiah follows: "For from the least to the greatest, all are greedy for avarice, and from the prophet to the priest, all do deceit. And they healed the breach of my people's daughter with disgrace, saying, 'Peace, peace, peace!' - and there was no peace. They were ashamed, because they had done abomination; rather, they were not ashamed with shame, and they knew not how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among them that fall; they shall fall in the time of their visitation, says the Lord. " Ezekiel adds: "For you have spoken vanity, and have seen lying divinations; therefore, behold, I am against you, says the Lord God. And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity and divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people" etc. Micah also acclams: "This is what the Lord God says about the prophets who deceive my people, who bite with their teeth and proclaim peace, and if anyone does not give them something in their mouth, they sanctify war against him: Therefore night shall be unto you for a vision, and darkness unto you for divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark upon them" etc.

Therefore, with these very clear and certain words of God, you have a certain and certain punishment if you depart from His word, you must strive with all your might to give your sheep the purest food of the word of God. Consider that you are one in whom all the hope of your people and their doctrine depends; consider that you are not only the leader of the souls of God, but also of your dearest brothers. You will surely be a bloody, bloody wolf, not only a wolf, but the most savage robber that the earth has ever borne, if you deprive your people of that sweetest food after the truth is known; not a man, but a most cruel tyrant, if you still hide the truth from them! Would not the Lord's most cruel voice fit you at that time, echoing: "Woe to you, for you shut the kingdom of heaven before men. For you do not enter, nor do you allow those who are coming in to enter "? Or as Luke more clearly reports: "Woe to you scribes, for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and those who were entering you forbade. " The apostle's text is clear: "Therefore, because when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful, but their thoughts were futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. When they thought they were wise, they became fools "etc. - I do not know what could move a more honest man. Look at this too, how many hundreds of devout souls you have daily, whom you see before you as if abandoned, and breathe salvation ardently.</output>

  <input>Quid, si hedos aliquot habeas? Ergo ne pastor es? Ergo ne oves perdende omnes, quia hedi aliquot recalcitrant? Et quid dubitas adhuc? Ecce adsunt praesidia, quibus provinciam delegatam regas. Res est nedum facilis, sed et utilitatis plena; dominus enim clamat per Hieremiam et dicit: «Tu ergo accinge lumbos tuos et surge et loquere ad eos omnia, quae ego praecipio tibi. Ne formides a facie eorum, nec enim timere te faciam vultum eorum. Ego quippe dedi te hodie in civitatem munitam et in columnam ferream et in murum aereum super omnem terram, regibus, principibus et sacerdotibus et omni populo terrae. Et bellabunt adversum te, et non praevalebunt, quia ego tecum sum, ait dominus, ut liberem te.» - Neque est, quod dubites ad te ista pertinere; certe ad te spectant. Nam D[ivus] Paulus ait: «Non scriptum est autem propter Abraham tantum, sed propter nos etiam»; item: «Quecumque scripta sunt, ad nostram doctrinam scripta sunt, ut per consolationem scripturarum spem habeamus». Saltem apostolo fide: «Iam si deus nobiscum, quis contra nos?» Persequi [!], capi, puniri, aut etiam occidi possumus, vinci non possumus, quia «vicit leo de tribu Iuda» [Apk 5,5]. Et quid durum, quid difficile reputares, quod mollit et levigat spiritus ille dei corda nostra renovans et fortificans? Clamat Paulus: «Omnia possum in eo, qui me confortat». Quid vero praemium describere pergam, cum «oculus non viderit nec auris audierit, quae dominus praeparaverit diligentibus se»? Et si non plura, certe vel hoc pręstat diligens ovium custodia et digna verbi dei tractatio, ut cum Paulo possimus in ultima illa necessitate, quando mundus nutat, amici ad auxilium torpent, divitiae evanescunt et omnia mundana pereunt, interim sola et misera anima nunquam moriens et tamen morti destinata ei sistitur iudici, qui unicuique retribuit iuxta sua studia; ut, inquam, tum possimus dicere: «Mihi vita Christus est et mors lucrum», «cupio dissolvi et esse cum Christo». Nam «bonum certamen certavi, cursum consumavi, fidem servavi. Quod superest, reposita est mihi iustitiae corona, quam reddet mihi dominus  in illa die, qui est iustus iudex, non solum autem mihi, sed et omnibus, qui diligunt adventum ipsius».

Proinde te, charissime frater, per sanctam dei persequtionem et salubrem eius crucem, quam electis suis imittit [!], per sacrosanctum episcopale offitium et per terrorem minarum et iuditii dei, per sanguinem domini nostri Jesu Christi, quem copiose pro suis ovibus fudit, quas tibi tradidit pascendas, per auxilium et inflammationem spiritussancti et illam nunquam marcessibilem [!] vitae aeterne [!] gloriam, perque salutem misere [!] animae tuae et omnium tuarum ovium: obsecro et obtestor, ut coeptum negotium absolvas, in veritate dei praedicanda crescas, sic, ut gloria dei et salus ovium verbo et doctrinae tuae dent testimonium. Deus pacis, misericordiae et infinitae gratiae corroboret te et instituat iuxta ipsius sanctissimam voluntatem.

Cappellae, 15. octobris anno ab orbe redempto 1524.

Salvum te volunt fratres in Christo omnes.</input>
  <output>What if you have a few sheep? So you are not a shepherd then? So you don't need to lose all the sheep, because a few of them are disobedient? And why do you still doubt? Look, there are resources by which you can rule the province entrusted to you. It's not only easy, but also full of benefit; for the Lord cries through Jeremiah and says: “Gird up your loins and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, for I will not make you afraid of their faces. For behold, I have made you this day a fortified city and a pillar of iron and a wall of bronze over all the land, to the kings, the princes, the priests, and all the people of the land. And they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail, for I am with you, says the Lord, to deliver you.” – And there is no doubt that these words concern you; certainly they refer to you. For the blessed Paul says: “Now it was not written for his sake alone, but also for us”; and also: “whatever things were written were written for our instruction, that through the comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope.” At least trust the Apostle: “If God is with us, who can be against us?” We can be chased, caught, punished, or even killed, but we cannot be defeated, because “the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed” [Revelation 5:5]. And what would you consider hard or difficult, when that Spirit of God softens and smoothes our hearts, renewing and strengthening them? Paul cries out: “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” What shall I say of the reward, when “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him”? And if not more, surely this is sufficient: that diligent care of the sheep and worthy administration of the Word of God, so that with Paul we may be able in the last necessity, when the world trembles, friends are sluggish in helping, riches vanish, and all earthly things perish, and only the poor soul remains, never dying yet destined for death, and is presented to the Judge, who will render to each according to his works; so that, I say, then we may say: “To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain”, “I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ”. For “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.”

Therefore I urge you, most beloved brother, through the holy persecution of God and salutary cross which He sends to His chosen, through the sacred episcopal office, through the terror of His threats and judgment, through the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which He poured out abundantly for His sheep, which He has entrusted to you for care, through the help and the enkindling of the Holy Spirit and that never fading glory of eternal life, through the salvation of your wretched soul and of all your sheep: I beseech and implore you to finish the work you have begun, to increase in the preaching of the truth of God, so that the glory of God and the salvation of the sheep may give testimony of your word and doctrine. May the God of peace, mercy, and infinite grace confirm and establish you according to His most holy will. 

From Cappella, 15th of October, in the year of the redemption of the world 1524.

Your brothers in Christ all wish you well.</output>
