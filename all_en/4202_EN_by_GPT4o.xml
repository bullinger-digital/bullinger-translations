      <p>The business of the Glareans, as much as I could, I have recommended to our people, and it has wonderfully concerned me, and I am not even now free from fear, lest, if peace is obtained at the next assembly, it should be on more unfavorable terms or lest, by duration, they be broken and gradually yield to the adversaries the acknowledged profession of Christ, even those who have hitherto stood firm in the Lord. But the Lord is the one to whom we should continuously commend the church for protection and be all the more vigilant against all the machinations of Satan.</p>
      <p>In Trier (Augusta Treverorum), the situation is such that it could not be worse, and this is due to the fault of the citizens, who, in order to oppress the best and most prudent men breathing the gospel of Christ, have become supplicants to the tyrant archbishop and have voluntarily surrendered certain ancestral and illustrious privileges from their hands and have called upon voluntary servitude. Such fury has raged in their minds due to hatred of Christ.</p>
      <p>I grieve for the fall of the very ancient city, once the host of Athanasius, which now makes exiles of its own people, whereas once it provided refuge to exiles for Christ's sake.</p>
      <p>The life of the captives of Christ could scarcely be redeemed through any serious intercessions of envoys sent by princes and cities. There are those who affirm that a war for the sake of religion is certain to break out in Germany, but from where and from which side, it is not clear. They say soldiers are being enlisted in Saxony, especially cavalry; but under whose auspices and for what purpose this is done, no one says clearly; I am expecting letters that might indicate something. I hope my people of Bern will return to favor with the people of Geneva, after the Genevans offered themselves to an amicable settlement even after the sentence passed by the arbitrator. I believe both parties understand how necessary their union is, unless it is not necessary for them to protect their city and their rights, freedom, and religion, and for the others to maintain their occupied territory. This year seems to be one that will have unusual movements or memorable machinations.</p>
      <p>May the Lord direct all things to His glory and keep us safe! I commend to you the bearer of this letter, so that, if you can, you may assist him with advice at least; I do not understand the legal business he is conducting.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 26, 1560.</p>
      <p>Greet all your colleagues with my respectful words. Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed and beloved brother.</p>
