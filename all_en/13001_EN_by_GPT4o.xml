    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Frölich would have much to report if the letter transmission were secure. But Bullinger knows that one must be cautious. His letter, which arrived today from June 27 [not received], is very comforting, indeed also encouraging, as Frölich was thereby admonished to steadfastness and loyalty. He also intends to behave accordingly. Bullinger should plead with God for a mitigation of the overly strict trial. Frölich does not want to praise himself, but he can assure that despite the storm threateningly approaching the boat [of the church], he has not become negligent. The heavenly helmsman will guide it to a safe harbor! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The Imperial Diet will take place in Augsburg. Crowds of foreigners are flocking to the city, especially courtiers of Emperor Charles V, even though the date is not yet set. The Emperor is in Nuremberg. He has dismissed some of his troops, others are still with him, especially Spaniards and Italians, who have devastated the entire Nuremberg area within a 5-mile radius and continue to commit unspeakable atrocities to this day. Should they also come to Augsburg, then the already barren Swabia is completely lost! However, Frölich is more of the opinion that they will spare the area around Augsburg because its yields benefit the Catholic clergy. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] It is confirmed that Counts Albrecht of Mansfeld and Christoph of Oldenburg inflicted a severe defeat on the Imperial forces near Bremen. In the battle, the imperial troop leader Duke Eric of Brunswick-Calenberg was either killed or drowned in the Werra, as he has never reappeared. Approximately 3000 Imperial soldiers were captured, all the others killed. Only a few managed to flee. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Frölich has no information about the negotiations between the Emperor and the Hanseatic cities or about any possible peace. It is certain that Landgrave Philip of Hesse has surrendered and, like Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony, was captured by the Imperial forces. Subsequently, the Emperor withdrew from Saxony and Meissen. He is supposed to come from Nuremberg to Augsburg soon. Allegedly, he is planning something in Italy or even the reinstatement of Duke Charles III of Savoy. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Johannes Haller is very dear to Frölich, even though they rarely meet due to the current dire situation. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings. </p>

      <p>If it were as safe as it is necessary, most distinguished man and brother in the Lord, I would now have a very rich subject for writing. But you know what the times demand. Your letter dated June 27, which was delivered to me today, brought me much comfort and refreshment. Indeed, you faithfully place the word of the Lord before my eyes, urging me to steadfastness and piety; these heavenly gifts, if I have ever followed them, you will now sense that I will follow by God's grace. Cry out to the Lord with me, that He may temper the excessive trial for us. I do not seem to have become at all more negligent (far be it from me to boast) in such storms of upheaval, which, alas, have not yet been calmed by any means, but are now approaching our ship more fiercely than before! Yet I hope that the one heavenly helmsman will bring it to a safe harbor.</p>

      <p>The Imperial Diet will be held in Augsburg. Although the exact date has not yet been announced, many foreigners, especially courtiers of Emperor Charles V, are flocking there daily. The Emperor is still in Nuremberg with his troops, some of which he has dismissed. Those he still has with him are mostly Spaniards and Italians, who have devastated the entire Nuremberg area within a 5-mile radius and continue to commit horrendous and unspeakable acts; should they come to Augsburg, then our already barren Swabia is completely lost. However, I believe they will spare the area around Augsburg because its revenues belong to the Catholic clergy.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt that Count Albrecht of Mansfeld and Count Christoph of Oldenburg have defeated the Imperial forces near Bremen and inflicted great slaughter. Duke Eric of Brunswick, the leader of the Imperial legions, was either killed or drowned in the Werra River; he has not appeared anywhere. In that battle, about 3000 soldiers and horsemen from the Imperial forces were captured. All the rest were slaughtered, except for a few who escaped by fleeing.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am completely unaware of what has been negotiated between the Emperor and the maritime cities, nor do I hear anything about peace. However, it is certain that Landgrave Philip of Hesse has surrendered and is now, along with Johann Frederick, Duke of Saxony, being led captive among the Imperial forces. Consequently, the Emperor has long since left Saxony and Meissen and, as rumor has it, is soon to depart from Nuremberg to go to Augsburg. Some think he has business in Italy, while others suspect he is considering the restoration of Duke Charles III of Savoy. Time will tell.</p>
