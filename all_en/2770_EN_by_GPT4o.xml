      <p>Greetings. You have conveyed to me the most welcome news through your letters about the suspended matter of the oath, in which, as in many other things, we rightly recognize and proclaim the work of God; for it is infinitely better to have the confirmation of treaties delayed than to have them undertaken with offense to the name of God. I praise your people for their demonstrated faith and constancy and pray to Christ that they may be preserved and advanced in it. But I received with great pleasure the news that the torch of the gospel has been lit among the Sarmatians; therefore, it will burn by the power of Christ even against the opposing gates of hell. Letters have also been written to me, which abundantly testify to the same. The disturbances in Geneva are reported to have been well quelled by the grace of God, and the fervor of contentions is also gradually subsiding among the Bernese, especially as the vanity of accusations and detractions against our Calvin refutes itself and the innocence of the excellent man becomes clearer day by day. Thus, that church is preserved by the singular protection of God, fluctuating among waves and continually severe storms. The people of Konstanz have requested an evangelical pastor from Ferdinand through a delegation, even with the consent of their governor, but, as I hear, they have been refused, fearing that this example might be given to others to urge the same. However, it is not yet despaired of success, provided they do not desist and are aided by the counsel of the good.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is pressed by the Turk, who recently captured a fortress deemed by nature and art to be most fortified and considered impregnable by human judgment, and from there has prepared a more suitable passage for himself. They write that he is planning a massive expedition to Hungary at the approach of spring, intending to inflict great disaster, unless the Lord averts that rod of His fury. They affirm for certain that the Emperor is looking towards home and will proceed through England to Spain; but about these things, I know you have long since been informed from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Our Lycosthenes, about whom you inquire, is in moderate health, but such that he cannot use his right hand, nor is the bond of his tongue loosened so that he can teach sufficiently fluently; hence, he is compelled, even unwillingly, to abstain from the usual exchange of letters with friends. However, he works on some things and digests what was previously gathered, and that with the hands of others. Our church suffers a great loss in this holy instrument of God due to his unique gifts combined with utmost integrity and a candor as pure as snow. But since it has seemed so to the Lord, let us bear His will. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, November 14, 1555.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
