      <p>Be well, my Bullinger. It was fortunate for me that I heard first about your recovered health rather than about the illness and danger to your life; for such news would have afflicted me most severely. I give thanks to the Lord God, who has preserved you for His church and for all of us who hold you dear. Oh, how miserable we would be, oh, how miserable the church would be, if we had lost you. Now take care to regain your former strength, not for leisure, but to be restored to your former labors. I received your letters written in bed and clearly recognized the wavering characters and at the same time recognized your love for me, since you wished to write to me even while still weak. As soon as I read the letters, I initiated a prayer in the church for you, and about two hundred and fifty brothers prayed (for that is how much the church, to which the Lord has given me as pastor, has grown so far), that the Lord Himself may restore you unharmed to His ministry for His glory, and we hope He will do so and we will not cease to pray for you. The province I have now undertaken is great and arduous; for I am the only pastor in such a large valley and there are many adversaries and they are powerful. I was already forced to speak for myself in the middle of the forum before the magistrate and I prevailed with the Lord's help. But they will attempt another way and will think of preparing ambushes. Yet I trust in our Lord God. The valley has about 30 cities and towns; from the benefices (as the courtiers call them) the annual revenues are more than 12 thousand crowns, and all these fight against me, a mere man. But the neighboring Venetians also fight, seeing the nearby cities burning. Now what do you think the Pope will do, who has realized that the Gospel has descended from the Alps into the open fields? The hatred of all these is kindled against me because they have heard that the Lord, through my ministry, has so far completely driven out the mass from eight towns. I tell you all this now, Heinrich Bullinger, so that, knowing the danger I am in, you may be more inflamed to help me with your prayers and those of your church. But it is remarkable how little I am affected by all these truly serious dangers; I recognize it as the work of God. The Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg sent his own messenger all the way to Chur to seek me out, to bring me to him. However, I did not think, even if a thousand Caesars and kings called, that this station should be deserted at this time, for it is clear that it is about this valley. But in the summer I hope to visit that prince; in the meantime, the Lord will send workers into this harvest. I will diligently take care of Camillo, as you write, especially since I daily recognize him as worse. Recently something new has come out against him, which was hidden. For two who were lost Anabaptists have returned to us (as I wrote) and they clearly affirm that they were infected by Camillo, indeed that all the Anabaptists who are in Italy depend on that monster. Now I end my writing. Farewell and be well, with your whole family, school, and church.</p>
