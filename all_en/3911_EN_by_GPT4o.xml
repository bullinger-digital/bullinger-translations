      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on March 27.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has entered into an alliance with the Turk under rather unfair conditions. There is still nothing certain about peace between the King and the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Everything has been settled with the Englishman.</p>
      <p>Calais remains in the possession of the King; but the more accommodating the King was, the more obstinate and difficult the Spaniards were. For this reason, so that the King is not ensnared by the adversaries' tricks, he ordered me to request six thousand Swiss for the defense of the kingdom and some insignia for Piedmont. The hearts of princes are in the hand of God, who knows how to turn the greatest tumults into good.</p>
      <p>To Him be the glory.</p>
      <p>Endless crimes are being attributed to the Pope's nephews; he himself has fallen into dropsy.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her regards and thanks you for the concern you show for our son. Please greet Mr. Martyr and Mr. Walter for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 2.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as you know me.</p>
      <p>I will leave nothing undone to ensure that the guest of the Stork is freed from his pledge and that what the Danish envoy borrowed is repaid. I will write to the most honorable council when I have something worthy of their attention.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless them.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich, to be delivered by hand.</p>
