    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not write much, as [Nicholas] Partridge will provide information and answer questions. King [Henry VIII] as well as Thomas Cromwell have received the work [„De scripturae sanctae authoritate... libri duo“], which Bullinger dedicated to the King, well, which Bullinger would have learned from them themselves if they were not so busy; Bullinger's works have gained high esteem in England and elsewhere. Thanks for the kindness as well as for the letters to Lord Maltravers and to the two Polsteds; sends gloves as a gift for Bullinger, for his wife, and for the mother through Partridge and sends greetings to them.</p>

      <p>Since at this time our Partridge is coming to you, who will tell you much more than I can convey through my letters; and you also know that he is a man who does not know how to lie, nor can he feign or dissemble anything; I trust you will not be displeased if your Eliott does not write as much to you now as the duty of friendship would otherwise require. Therefore, I earnestly ask and encourage you to listen willingly to Partridge, who is now acting in the place and duty of our letters, and to diligently inquire about everything. As he will tell you the truth about almost everything that is happening here, know this one thing to be most true, that your books are wonderfully pleasing to our King, and no less to Sir Thomas Cromwell (who is the keeper of the privy seal to the King and the Vicar General of the Church of England): you would have received evidence of this from them themselves before now, if only this one thing (as far as I can understand) had not hindered it, that in monarchies, where almost one person is accustomed to settle the disputes and causes of all, they are compelled by necessity to either entirely omit many duties or certainly fulfill them only late. As for the reputation, praise, and glory your writings have brought you among the English (for I say nothing of foreigners), it is indeed beyond what anyone can credibly say. Therefore, I pray to God Almighty that He may keep you safe for a long time and not let you lack the spirit to continue writing more, not only for the benefit of the English but for the utility and aid of His entire church. Amen. Farewell.</p>
      <p>For your great benevolence towards me, your favor, and your most ample merits, and for the letters written to Lord Maltravers and to my two Polsted cousins, I give you immense thanks; by which you have ensured that they not only pursue you with the greatest benevolence and zeal but have also made them the most friendly of friends to me. I ask that you kindly accept these gloves, which I have sent to you and your most chaste and honorable wife and mother through Partridge, as a small gift from a poor friend: in addition, please convey many greetings in Eliott's name to them and to your entire family. Farewell again. Year 1538, August 21.</p>
      <p>Yours, N. ELIOTT.</p>
      <p>To his most dear teacher, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
