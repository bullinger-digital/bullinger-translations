      <p>S. Joachim here, by the surname Fuerterius Vitudurensis, has very amicably introduced himself to Fortmüller and Antonio Zilio, our ministers, asking that if any position in the ministry were vacant, they might take a chance on him to see whether he could preside over it with benefit and honorably fulfill the duty of preaching, etc. However, he denies ever having preached to any church before, but he has nevertheless spent a good part of his life engaged in honorable studies and in some literary schools. Therefore, both of them asked me in his name to write to you and request that, since it is difficult for such a novice to be admitted to any pastoral care position at present, he might be supported for a while by the generosity of your city (for he is, after all, from the territory or, more correctly, the jurisdiction of the Zürichers), until he could at least be more exercised in school and made more learned by listening to you daily, and finally be appointed to some populous church; they are thinking of the Arbore Felici (Happy Tree), whose church is indeed very populous, and whose beneficence could provide for him very liberally, so that, as some are wont, he would not be driven to any mendicancy and seem to preach Christ for the sake of gain or act as a tavern keeper to anyone. But if you declare him suitable for such a position even for a short time and signify to our ministers by your letters that the man is esteemed and approved by you, they will promptly assist Joachim, so that he himself can be present and preside over the faithful with great benefit. Farewell and write back sometime what you judge and consider should be done. Our people will approve of this one thing, which seems best to you to do.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 12th day of May, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
