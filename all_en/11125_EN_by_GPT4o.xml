    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the prevailing sentiments in Bern, his concerns about leaving the Bernese church and returning to Zurich have become obsolete. He asks to be received without fear and promises loyal behavior. He wishes for the forwarding of a letter to the Zurich council; he himself will announce his resignation tomorrow. He requests help in finding accommodation; he has instructed [Hans] Hager and his brother to buy wine and wood. He refers to Erasmus [Ritter's] report [No. 1081] on the situation in Bern; the Bernese church is now largely separated from that in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Until now, I have not been allowed to return home, either because of you or my conscience, fearing that our church would be left without support if I departed. But when I consider everything carefully, I find quite the opposite, namely that my presence is more harmful than beneficial to our church, especially at this time when everything is conducted not by reason, judgment, zeal, and the Lord's study, but by emotions, and this not only to the hatred of one, but of many pious men, whom we see do not agree with our studies, efforts, and inventions. And having been stuck in a dilemma, not knowing what to do, now finally, God seems to show me very clearly where to turn, namely to Zurich, to you, my dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I implore, ask, and beseech you by the Lord, that with your consent I may come to you and migrate. I beg you, pull me from the lion's jaws, and do not be afraid, fear, dread, or shudder at my coming to you, I implore you by the Lord. I will be entirely the Lord's and yours; I will not follow myself and my own, but the precepts of the brothers even unto death. It will not be words, but I will prove everything with deeds.</p>
      <p>The letters I am sending here, I implore you by the Lord, to present them to the council yourselves and to advocate for my cause there, unless some better advice seems to you. But do not delay; for tomorrow I will approach the council to ask for permission to return home with their peace. Once that is done, I will hasten my departure. May God turn it to good.</p>
      <p>Regarding finding a house, I ask for your help, brothers. I have instructed Hager and my brother to purchase wine and wood.</p>
      <p>Erasmus says he has described the whole matter to you, so I will skip everything. In summary: The Bernese church is now largely separated from the Zurich church. The Lord certainly wanted this, so that the Zurich church alone would remain in the light.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers. I implore you by Christ to take care of my matter.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 22, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger and Leo, the most vigilant ministers of the Zurich church, his dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
