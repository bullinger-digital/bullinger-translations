    <p xml:id="regest1">The sending of [Capilupi's "De vita monachorum"] did not offend Gast, but rather amused him and dispelled his sadness. - Gast conveys a letter [No. 2178] from Gilbert [Cousin], which shows that Cousin is well-disposed towards Bullinger. - Emperor [Charles V] is in Worms and is trying with the bishops and abbots to harm the religion of Christ and to expand papal rule. Bullinger will probably have learned how [Charles V] forbade the Worms preacher [Leonhard Brunner] from celebrating the Lord's Supper, how gathered women murmured against this prohibition and it almost led to an uprising, how the Emperor immediately went hunting to have nothing to do with the matter, and how ultimately the devil failed with his plan. - The Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] has hastily set off for Rome with nine horses. - Landgrave [Philip] of Hesse is said to be in Worms. He is also said to have thrown his preacher Dionysius [Melander] into prison because he advised him to commit bigamy. - Bucer and another pastor in Swabia [Hans He√ü?] are said to be in great danger because the Emperor is annoyed with them. - If Bullinger has not seen the booklet [by Franz Xaver] about the [missionary activities of the] monks in India, Gast will send him his copy, which he received from Dole. - According to a rumor, Luther is said to have died. At the Strasbourg fair, it will soon be known whether this is true. - Best wishes for Bullinger's newborn [Dorothea]. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and Rudolf [Gwalther].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>As I honestly confess, you did not offend me with the cento sent against the monks, but rather you delighted me with that pleasant reading and dispelled my conceived sadness. Therefore, be of good cheer and think better of Gast, who is not so easily irritated. Perhaps my silence increased your suspicion, but even in this matter, you are mistaken, and I thought it better to remain silent than to write uncertain things.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Gilbert's letters, which will declare a sufficiently kind disposition towards you. The Emperor is in Worms. He is seriously dealing with the bishops and abbots to undermine the religion of Christ and expand the papal kingdom. You undoubtedly know how he forbade the Worms preacher from celebrating the Lord's Supper and how women gathered and murmured against the Emperor's edict, and almost everything led to sedition. The Emperor, to avoid being entangled in I don't know what evils, devoted himself to hunting; but Satan could not prevail.</p>
      <p>About which matter perhaps more extensively soon, when I have been more certainly informed about this matter. The Bishop of Augsburg has hastily set off for Rome with nine horses; what he is going to do, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave of Hesse is said to be in Worms, and there is a rumor that he has thrown the preacher Dionysius into prison because he advised him to take a second wife.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Bucer is said to be in great danger due to the Emperor's indignation, and also another preacher in Swabia, about whose name I can have nothing certain.</p>
      <p>You may have seen the booklet about the Indians, who are being converted to the faith of Christ by certain monks, who are establishing new schools. If you have not yet seen it, let me know, and I will share my copy with you, which was sent to me from Dole. A marvelous work of God!</p>
      <p>Some spread the rumor that Luther is dead; we will hear from the Strasbourg fair, but I think the rumor is false.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that your wife has made you a parent of a beautiful child these days, praise be to the Lord, to whom I pray for the spirit of Christ, that she may imitate holy women in all things and be an example of Christian piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. June 18, 1545. Basel.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to Theodor and Rudolf in my name. Yours, Johannes Gast from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich in the great city, my dear, kind lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
