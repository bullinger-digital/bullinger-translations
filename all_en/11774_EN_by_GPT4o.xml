    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains about the lack of messengers and apologizes for his awkward remark in a letter to [Ambrosius] Blarer. Encloses a report on the death of [Johannes] Eck and requests its return. Quotes from a letter by Bucer [dated February 18]: In Andernach, Erasmus Sarcerius is preaching, and evangelical preaching is also taking place in [Cologne] and Linz [on the Rhine], and at Easter, it will be possible to receive the Eucharist according to Christ's institution. However, the university, clergy, and council of Cologne are hostile towards [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] because of Bucer's appointment; in a letter to [Jakob] Sturm, Bucer also wrote about the lack of willingness for peace from the poorly equipped [Duke Wilhelm of] Jülich. Myconius requests more precise information about the threat of outlawry from the Imperial Chamber Court, as he hears nothing from council circles; the pastors are accused of hypocrisy after the university's beadle was imprisoned for adultery, but despite his preaching activities, he was never their fellow brother. Greetings; lets [Theodor] Bibliander know that he still does not possess a Quran, as Oporin in Basel [due to the governmental ban] will not sell it at any price.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You see in the letters, to which I am responding to your last ones, how lacking I am in messengers. I do not know how it happens: No one has come to me in such a long time who wanted to go to Zurich. I was somewhat afraid that perhaps something unfavorable about me might reach you while I remained silent; but I immediately dismissed this thought, considering that love does not easily suspect. My foolishness, which would gladly have great men as friends, had pushed this word to Blarer, not considering that there is nothing in me that could attract them. For believe this: As soon as this occurred to me, I began to withdraw and regret if I had said anything imprudently. But the word flies irrevocably, for which reason foolishness must be spared; I will be more cautious in the future.</p>
      <p>I would have sent a description of Eck's death, if Gastius had not ordered that I give the letters attached to mine in full, under the condition of returning them. It seems to me that the pious should weigh this with a more severe judgment.</p>
      <p>From Bucer's letters received these days, these are the contents: "Now Erasmus Sarcerius, a man of serious and prudent zeal, is preaching in Andernach. There are also some among the princes and in Linz who faithfully preach Christ. At Easter, the Eucharist will be given to those who request it and are learned in this mystery by the command of the most reverend according to the institution of the Lord. Meanwhile, however, the school and clergy of Cologne are plotting the worst against the good old man. They accuse him of violated religion and perjury because he employs me in his diocese for sacred sermons, as I am one of the Protestants, a bigamist, a primary Lutheran, and have given advice to the Republic of Cologne against the clergy. However, the old man stands firm with remarkable constancy. The Senate of Cologne is said to be acting with the clergy, although the majority of the people and senators favor the word of God." So far, he. About the war, he writes nothing except this to Sturm, that the Duke of Jülich does not have ears for counsel. Recently, they could not obtain a truce for more than eight days, while in the meantime, he is minimally equipped. Against Brabant, they have both a large and prepared army.</p>
      <p>As for the ban of the Imperial Chamber Court, I indeed know not a word. If you have anything, you would do me a favor by sharing it. Our leaders pursue us with such hatred that they would rather share their plans with evil than with us. The beadle of the university was taken to prison four days ago for adultery; this, because he acted as a preacher in the episcopal district without being sent or examined, burdens us so much that I cannot express it. They say: "The shameful, scandalous priests can do nothing but beat us and drive us out of the city, and what they forbid us, they do themselves," etc. I say nothing else but this: "He was not a preacher, he was not a fellow, he did not communicate with us, he did not listen to us, indeed he pursued me with hatred and the lord Grynaeus to the extreme; but he was the beadle of your academy. What then to us, that he designated? Go away together, where you are worthy; for your mind is not right, which the Lord will one day show not without your most serious harm." And I wanted you to know this calamity of ours; I am pressed, I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours and with Theodor, to whom you should say that after so many vexations I am without the Quran. Oporinus did not dare to sell it here; for he had answered me when I inquired: "I would not take the whole city," not knowing that if the city had been his, and the dominion of the city had been his. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 6, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
