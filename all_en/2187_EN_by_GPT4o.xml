      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger. I wrote to you eight days ago and sent the letter to Lindau; I hope you have received it. I mentioned that your Blessed one was seen in Regensburg and was safe, having returned from the war in Hungary. You might call these Halcyon days, as everything is peaceful both here and throughout all of Germany (as far as the gospel is concerned), and I wish we were more diligent in promoting it; but we are too cold, and I would not have believed there could be so much cold here. Let us pray to the Lord, that by sending His Holy Spirit, He may warm our hearts.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Stuttgart is soon to come here and will stay for several months. We will be filled with new things every day, if the world produces any. I devote my whole days and my whole mind to my studies; but it is strange that I cannot avoid envy. For there are here (I speak among the professors) some notable papists, who cannot bear me even when I am silent and almost hidden; although I am not entirely hidden nor silent. I wish to have your book On Justification; if you come across any opportunity, send it to me as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The Prince has ordered that I delay my journey to Augsburg; he says he fears that I might be overwhelmed, and indeed he orders that I take care of myself on all sides.</p>
      <p>I am indeed not entirely afraid; but so that I do not seem to disregard the advice of his highness, I do not leave Tübingen. But I will not be able to restrain myself for long, without going somewhere and shouting and rousing the sleepers. Farewell and be well with your whole family, your relatives, with the whole school and church, pastors and professors. Help me, I beseech you, with your prayers to our Lord God. Tübingen, February 15, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
