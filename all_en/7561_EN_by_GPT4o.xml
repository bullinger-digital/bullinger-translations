      <p>Greetings. I gratefully receive your exhortation combined with consolation, most esteemed lord, and I will never fail in my duty, if the Lord helps me. But it must be feared that much graver things may befall us, than if God, whether by plague or by the scourge of another disease, delivers us from this valley of tears. As for the present disease, there are very few who do not decide to seek safety in flight (if it breaks out). But how few are there who are ashamed to incur divine indignation or attempt to avert it by amending their lives? My maid began to feel better on the fourth day with the medicines she used, including the royal egg and some others, etc. The attack was more severe than we could have hoped for such a decline. But God is strong in protecting His own. - The rumor about the creation of our knight of the golden spur is confirmed more and more every day. Most certainly these insignia have been offered to him by a similarly gilded knight; whether he will accept them or not is unknown to me. However, the brother of Friedrich von Salis openly says that Mr. Baptista will never accept that honor. But we foresee the order in which he will act: he will deny that he will accept it unless the Confederates consent; meanwhile, he will secretly ensure by his own means that it is granted and he accepts it. But even if he completely refuses, no one is so blind, although the darkness is great, who does not see and feel the mutual and close friendship that exists between him and the pope, especially since at this time and in the handling of this cause such incentives are offered that I pass over in silence what is being done with the wretched Cellarius in Rome in the meantime, whom at almost the same time (as was announced from Pregallia, but less certainly) they cruelly roasted over a slow fire for an entire day or more while he was hanging. Such human offerings are most pleasing to the pope, which he then beautifully rewards with golden gifts and largesses. The suspicion is increased by the unworthy and frivolous release of the monk of Clavenna from chains, which was recently decreed here by 24 men at the minor assembly after the return of the legates. The rest wanted the monk to be brought here; but as inferiors, they were forced to yield to the others. Thus they broke what was established at the fairs by the entire Confederation, namely that the monk should be detained in chains until the end of that cause; those few released him. Meanwhile, however, this whole business, which even the relatives of the monk publicly handle, is referred to the communities, and yesterday in our tribes the cause was discussed quite splendidly, as I hear. For other tribes have decreed to invade and capture the monk again, and to ask those legates, whom he used as supporters, more deeply from where they received the power to release him, whether from their communities or not; to these things, they also agreed to inquire under oath from the prefect of Plurs how the matter was conducted with his own monk, who was in chains at Plurs before Cellarius was captured, because of certain letters treacherously written by him, as I once reported to you, and for what reason, by whose instigation he released him, although the common fame of men sustained a treacherous process, as they say. To these things, they agreed that the watchtower of Morbegno should be leveled to the ground after first scraping off all precious things into the hands of the Rhaetians. Tomorrow, finally, the votes collected in each tribe will be brought together into one, and what will be more fortified will be retained. But I hear that most agree that the monastery of Morbegno should be destroyed and all the monks expelled. The entire populace also takes care of this. The 10 Jurisdictions will also (as I hear) be involved in this, as well as all the Engadin; only the Upper Confederates will resist. One of our tribes also wanted all the cattle from Como and Milan, which graze our Alps according to ancient custom, to be retained until 200 intercepted loads of rye are returned by the people of Como. There is, however, among us a certain honest man, called Dom√§nius; who, being also suspected by the monks in the name of religion, they invaded his trade or goods and intercepted all his sacks full of rye, intending to return them if he renounced the Lutheran faith or immediately paid three hundred crowns.</p>
      <p>But since he said he would do neither, they retained the goods until he sent letters to them testifying that he was not a Lutheran, etc. These things are true; for he complained to the magistrate about the injury inflicted. - The cause of the Engadiners is far different than was first reported. For now, they certainly say that the legates from Innsbruck or Hall dealt amicably with them about granting a certain forest for the salt mine according to the tenor and argument of the mutual pact, that is, the "Erbeinung," as our people call it. For it is thus: if the prince labors in want of woods necessary for the salt mine, then the Engadiners, being peacefully asked, are bound to grant the forests to him. Therefore, with a splendid legation now sent to Zernez, they very amicably asked to obtain that forest. What did the Engadiners do? They acted harshly with them according to custom and, forgetful of the pact, received this petition rather harshly. Therefore, the exasperated legates said that the soil and ground belonged to the prince, let alone the forest. Our senate prudently advises them not to act against the pact, but to hold to the "Erbeinung," yet if he demanded anything beyond, not to refuse. But I am too fatigued. I beg you, forgive me; for I wrote all these things very quickly, as is evident. There are not lacking here those who affirm that the people of Basel and Bern are sending 2 standards in aid of the exiles; we wonder if it is true.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, forever.</p>
      <p>Chur, very quickly, August 9, 1568.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your lordship, Th[obias] Eg[linus].</p>
      <p>As far as I know, there will be no collections here. Our consul did not want to refer these letters to the senate, I do not know for what reason; what the rest will do, we will hear in due time; for not everyone has yet understood the matter. But what about the pumice stones?</p>
      <p>Farewell 3.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in every kind of piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the supreme teacher of the Church of Zurich, his lord forever to be esteemed.</p>
