    <p xml:id="regest1">He lacks the leisure to revise his booklet, and an eye ailment troubles him, yet he hopes to be able to send Bullinger the small work by the upcoming Lent. The title is "De quatuor christianismi aetatibus et quid in his potissime spectandum" [St. Gallen Cantonal Library (Vadiana), Ms 48, 122-155; Ms 28,2; Print: Melchior Goldast, Alamannicarum rerum scriptores, Vol. III, Frankfurt a. M. 1606, pp. 159-190]; Vadian assigns the history from the birth of Christ to the beginning of the reign of Constantine the Great to the first, golden age; the second, silver age encompasses the time from Constantine to Justinian [I.], the epoch from Justinian [I.] to Henry III forms the third, copper age, and the remaining time until the death of Maximilian [I.] the fourth, iron age. In his work, he comprehensively describes the nature of each epoch and their transformations and emphasizes the increasing depravity in life and doctrine; he also deals with the princes and bishops, is reserved with source references, and adheres with utmost fidelity to the truth. After the depiction of the different ages, it is explained what one must pay attention to: Through a comparison, it is shown that the last age was different from the previous ones and that the state of the church has greatly deteriorated in this one; Vadian lastly also points out what can be done about it, defends the recently begun church renewal, and calls [the old believers] to compare [the former and current states]. He dedicates the work to Johannes von Planta, the chancellor of the Chur Bishop Lucius [Iter], to ensure better reception of the book in [old-believer] circles and possibly to favorably influence the [confessional] stance of the two.

      <p>Dear esteemed lord and friend, I intended to send you my booklet without delay and to receive your judgment and report. I wish to improve it as much as I can, as far as necessity requires. I may not be able to write and send it as soon as you might be expecting and hoping. Therefore, I do not want to delay you, and I ask you not to be annoyed with me or suspect me of inconsistency; for I am in countless disturbances and more business than I ever expected. I have also been afflicted with an eye ailment; this persistently prevents me, especially in the light, from reading or writing. Thus, I am entirely stuck; yet I do not want to let it go out of hand. The devil cannot prevent me from ensuring that you will see it by the upcoming Lent and deal with it as you please. The title of the work is: "On the Four Ages of Christianity and What is Especially to be Observed in Them." The entire course from the birth of Christ to the beginning of the reign of Constantine the Great is attributed to the first age, which I call the golden age, and I show the reasons for this; from there to Justinian, the nephew of Justin, I lead the second age, which is called the silver age; the third from there to Henry III, which I call the bronze age; the fourth the iron age, which I have calculated up to the death of Maximilian. I encompass the state and condition of each age and focus on making it clear that the first was by far the best of all, the next exceptionally good due to the purity of doctrines and discipline. From there, I demonstrate what was lacking in the later ages of the customs of the ancestors, what errors were added. I am entirely engaged in delineating the studies of princes and bishops and show, not negligently, how each age has degenerated or varied from the previous one. And although I testify to everything most abundantly with the old ecclesiastical history and the best chronicles that followed, which I refer to, I nevertheless cite authors sparingly, so as not to provoke those who may be little prepared to accept our views, as few support the truth. However, I hold the utmost faith in rendering the truth and conduct myself so that I cannot be found to have attributed anything to emotions. As soon as the ages are completed, I explain what is to be observed in them. There, through comparison, I prove that the last age is different from the first and middle ones. I also cite the complaints of the best authors, who, for the past five hundred years, have most unjustly and with great sorrow lamented the state of the church declining and inclining to worse. I then deduce that those complaints would not have been necessary if, as is commonly believed, the condition of the church had responded to the old purity as much as it has deviated from it. Finally, I advise what should be done to secure peace, assist the fallen matters of religion, hold on to the true and old and undoubted, and most aptly console the conscience terrified by present dissensions. Meanwhile, I excuse the recently undertaken innovation in many churches; I encourage those to comparison who trust so much in their own as true and old, who overwhelm us with insults and reproaches, etc. I dedicate the book to Johannes von Planta, a jurist, chancellor of Lucius, Bishop of Chur, who began to love me. He will love it less, I believe, the more candidly I feel about religion; but the book will be more favorable to the impious if I inscribe it to a less pious person. I will have made the effort worthwhile if I convert Planta, a most excellent man, and make his bishop more lenient. Farewell. St. Gallen, February 3, 1543.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian, suffering from an eye ailment.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious church of Zurich, lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
