      <p>Greetings in the Lord, I wrote two letters to you and to Mr. Theodor, which I enclosed in a container with peas, and the carrier deceived me nicely, who left my container in Basel without my knowledge; but soon you will have it, in which you have Gerbel's book along with some other things that pertain to your wife and Frisius.</p>
      <p>You will find the news I had in the written letters. The plague is spreading little among us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord increase our faith. What are you now writing, dear Bullinger, for the benefit of the church?</p>
      <p>Great evils threaten the church, and if it were allowed to predict, the greatest would be from hypocrites who act among us. There is a great and abundant crop of false brothers everywhere, whom the Lord will eventually destroy.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand has begun to promulgate the Turkish tax. There is a rumor that the Maltese lords have suffered a great defeat by Dragut, the king of Africa, and that Maximilian is in great danger in Spain. Various rumors are spread about these matters; but we have nothing certain. I wanted to write these few things to you, so that this young man, who visited me and offered himself to deliver letters to you, would not return to you empty-handed.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, November 21, 1550.</p>
      <p>My wife sends your wife a pair of knives for a fair and asks that she consider it kindly. They are included in the container, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>Write back. Hastily at nightfall.</p>
      <p>To the uniquely learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
