      <p>S. D. I received your last letter, most illustrious man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, written on August 15th, mainly concerning our Stultz, on the 20th of the same month. On that day, Mr. Consul Peyer reported to our senate at the request of Stultz, that someone from the order of senators should be chosen to accompany him to the church in Bernang and at the same time commend him to the people with the letters of your most honorable senate.</p>
      <p>However, since Stultz was called by your most honorable senate, not ours, it was decreed that the whole matter should be written again to your senate. Everything was disturbed by the negligence of Consul Rinck, who made no mention of Stultz to your people, as he had been asked. Therefore, after I informed Mr. Consul Peyer of your opinion about Stultz, namely that you promised through your consul to ensure that we know what the will of your senate is and how Stultz can be freed from danger, he judged that all action should be suspended for the time being until you have written back about what has been accomplished by you. We are therefore awaiting your response, and not without anxiety, because at the beginning you wrote that Stultz should hasten to the church in Bernang. Various obscure rumors are spreading among us, and it is said that the Albanian troops have been repeatedly defeated by our forces and that soldiers are gathering around Frankfurt, who themselves profess to be ignorant of which leader they will serve. I give great thanks for the booklet of Mr. Haller given to me and praise his work, which can benefit many of our people in using their own weapons to slay the minions of the Antichrist. If Mr. Froschauer had informed me about the edition of the booklet on the authority of the word of God, I would have prefixed a little letter; but it happened rightly that, just as the author wanted it to be published with his name suppressed, so the translation also comes to light without such a letter. I would have preferred my name to be suppressed as well, if it had pleased your kindness, although in the preliminary letter the reader could have been instructed about the usefulness of the booklet and why it was translated into the German language. A few days ago, Mr. Froschauer sent the first two pages, to which I replied asking that he not deviate too much from the orthography and idiom which I have diligently used; for thus the reading of his booklet will be more pleasing to the simpler people abroad. Today, the pastor from Sulgen was with me, also complaining about the tyranny of the canons of Constance and the prefect of Liechtensteig, Tschudi. With your people remaining silent and conniving, many churches will soon be deprived of pastors, and papacy will be restored everywhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Mr. and all the brothers. Mr. Consuls Martin Peyer, Burgover, Beatus Leo, and all the fellow ministers reverently send their regards to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on August 27th, in the year of our Lord 1572. Your most devoted in kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the most faithful Antistes of the church in Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, to be honored with the highest reverence.</p>
