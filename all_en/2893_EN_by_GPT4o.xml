      <p>Many thanks are to be given by us exiles to the Lord God, most illustrious Lord Bullinger, for appointing you as such a preacher to His church in this most sorrowful age. For we see that you are the one who can bring all possible consolation to the afflicted members of Christ from there. However, the merits you have towards the remaining English have bound them to you, and I prefer to embrace this with my mind rather than with my pen, lest, while I strive to explain the great services you have rendered to them, I seem either to obscure their magnitude by speaking or to diminish their dignity by treating them lightly. But to speak of myself, an exile and oppressed by the manifold cross of the Lord, I can neither remain silent about how much your consolation has helped me, nor can I give thanks worthy of the matter. Master Burcher often conveyed greetings to me in your name, as did others.</p>
      <p>My friend Cheke also showed me greetings from your letters to him, and Samson showed them in his own; in which I read many things from your pen that are most dear to me. For I saw there your sorrow and intense anguish of mind for the whole flock of Christ. I saw there your sorrow and intense anguish of mind for the whole flock of Christ. But I also saw a remarkable testimony of your benevolence and zeal towards me. I confess that the Lord God has taken away from me all things, which were certainly very great; but why should He not? He who gave, has taken away. But what? Worldly, earthly, perishable things; He will grant, I hope, indeed I do not doubt, heavenly and never-dying things.</p>
      <p>What is exile? Certainly a thing bitter only in imagination, provided there is something to live on. I know it is the rod of the Lord: yet I willingly learn from this that He deals with me with gentle and paternal affection, because He provides comforters like Bullinger, Melanchthon, Martyr, and such illustrious lights of His church. Happy was the widow of Zarephath, who felt the kindness of God through the consolation of Elijah: unhappy and most unworthy are the lepers who did not embrace their only comfort, Christ. Since it has seemed good to my God to raise you up, such an Elijah, to be with me in my cross, I write these things to you, not so much to thank you for the great and truly Christian care you take of me (although those thanks are also especially due from me to you), but to repeatedly inform you that I have derived the greatest pleasure from those letters of yours to my friends about me, and to acknowledge that I am perpetually obliged to you for them.</p>
      <p>As he was leaving here, my friend Cheke ordered me to convey his greetings to you in his name: he also said he had heard that Ignatius the Greek had been handed over to a certain printer in Zürich to be printed: if this is so, please allow me to trouble you to have the passage from the letter to the Philadelphians about the marriage of Paul and the apostles described for me. I am already engaged in a matter concerning this with a most shameless papist. I am hindered by modesty from asking you about this matter in more words. However, you should know that I am driven here by a certain necessity: for I could not find any other way to obtain what I want. But whenever I consider how Bullinger is spoken of by everyone, my mind predicts that this will not be any kind of unpleasant burden to you. Forgive, I beg, my audacity. Forgive also my tumultuous pen. Farewell, and please count me among your number.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 14 April 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, John Ponet, Englishman, formerly Bishop of Winchester.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church</p>
      <p>Master John Ponet, Bishop of Winchester, April 1556?</p>
