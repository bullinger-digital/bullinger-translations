    <p xml:id="regest1">Is grateful that Bullinger supported his wish not to be sent to Tübingen. Complains that certain people from Zurich have long met him with distrust and envy, and calls upon the scholars in Basel, Strasbourg, and Lausanne as witnesses to his impeccable conduct. His clothing is largely the same as before. Still feels obliged to enter church service. He has only been partially compensated for his translation of Pollux. Intends to continue caring for the students entrusted to him, requests a Greek [New] Testament, refers to [Johannes] Fries for news about the university, and praises Grynaeus and Myconius; the latter is gradually seeing through the machinations of the people from Strasbourg in the dispute over the doctoral degree. Greetings. Wonders why Christian [Hochholzer?] does not respond.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am immensely grateful, most kind father, for your generous promise regarding not having to go to Tübingen, and I will express my gratitude if I have any means to do so; I will ensure that you will not regret this effort of yours in the slightest. For since I have always regarded and still regard you as one of my dearest friends, not as a patron but as a father, I will, with the Lord's help, ensure that I do nothing that could be blamed on you.</p>
      <p>I am well aware, as you write, that there are those who have little trust in me; but being well aware of my own conscience, I easily disregard their suspicions. Although I wish such people were more diligent, not to say more prudent, so that they would not allow such rumors to spread without having verified the facts. They had little trust in me when I was with you, indeed they always whispered that I would leave them, although I never gave any sign of this to you. And indeed, this is not the least reason why I am so affected towards them. It pains me that my labors and vigils result in nothing but the evil suspicions of envious people. Rumors were spread while I was still in Zurich, which, if only they were as true as they are false, have caused me no small amount of envy among the young men of your college. There were those who said both in Basel and Strasbourg, indeed two years ago in Lausanne, that I receive more than sixty florins from you each year, which certainly upset those whom I always considered my dearest friends; indeed, they hold this opinion so tenaciously that I have not been able to dispel it from their minds with any form of denial. You yourself know what fruits envy brings. I cannot guess what I have done against these people that they should envy me so. But I can certainly swear that I have always been and still am today of a brotherly mind towards all. If I saw any wrongdoing, I would admonish them in person; they, however, secretly sting with false lies. Yet, lest I seem too inclined to defend my own cause, I willingly remain silent; for to defend one's own cause to many is both suspect and indeed unusual for me, who have written very few apologies. I desire not to be questioned about these matters, but rather those with whom I have lived. Let the most learned men of Basel complain, and (as I certainly know) they will not complain about my life. I have always applied the utmost diligence in my studies, which you know cannot be joined with lust. Let all the people of Strasbourg complain, from whom a testimony of my studies sent by Bedrot is still kept with Mr. Myconius.</p>
      <p>Let the brothers in Lausanne and the Count himself, with whom I lived until he was falsely accused and taken captive to Bern, complain, from whom I also have his own handwritten document here with me, in which he offers himself entirely to me and wishes to be a pledge of perpetual friendship, which he certainly would never have done if he had ever known me to be given to vile morals and wickedness. I would not wish to say more about these matters, except that you should pass this on to them to read, if you should hear such things being spread about me. Let them trust as they will; with the favor of the most good and great God, I will present myself in such a way that they will never be able to satisfy the rage of their envy.</p>
      <p>My clothing is the same as it was with you, except that I had a cloak made from a larger tunic (because the border is now completely worn out), as it was more convenient for daily use and especially for travels. If this is a sin, I confess to having sinned.</p>
      <p>Do not believe that I have regretted the service to which I am bound to the church. I have always desired to serve my homeland and especially the church, and you have never found me disobedient to your commands, provided that I may live honorably.</p>
      <p>This year I received 5 crowns from Pollux, which I immediately spent on books. Another 5 will be paid at the Lent fair; for my translation will not be printed before then.</p>
      <p>I have and will continue to care for the young men entrusted to me, and my efforts will not be lacking for them. If I must remain in Basel, I would like you to send me the Greek Testament. Mr. Fries himself can tell you the state of this school. Grynaeus is most kind to us; Myconius acts entirely as a father. He is finally beginning to see through the ambitions of the people from Strasbourg; for they are responsible for whatever disturbances there are about the doctorate, as they support the opposing parties with the Basel magistrate. But I write this to you alone.</p>
      <p>Greet my wife, mother, and children in my name. Mr. Butler and our young men send you their most dutiful greetings. Farewell, dearest father, and keep my cause, if it deserves it, commended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 4, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that Christian has not yet replied; for this is unlike him.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
