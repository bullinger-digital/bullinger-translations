    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller wrote to Bullinger four or five days ago [not received]. Actually, the city clerk Georg Frölich wanted to travel [with the letter] to Zurich, but he only made it to Constance, where he met Hans Wilpert Zoller and returned with him to Augsburg. Zoller has been here for six days now, but still hasn't visited Haller! Frölich is currently preparing the wedding of his daughter [Anna] with a standard-bearer [Christoph Wilbrecht].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser show a completely different face to the Augsburg pastors than to the imperial ones. They are pretending and want to please both sides. In doing so, they harm the glory of Christ and the Church. Herbrot has deprived Leonhard Beck von Beckenstein of his magnificent house out of greed (everyone sees it that way!) and almost forced him to emigrate. As a result, he has made himself hated by everyone. His son-in-law [...] soon committed suicide, bringing the whole family into disrepute. If only Herbrot would not place his hope on uncertain riches, but on God! Paul rightly called greed the root of all evil.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony wants to take Erfurt with three regiments to secure the grain supply. Duke Maurice of Saxony is said to have made peace with him and used his brother August as a pledge. However, this is hardly credible. There is a severe famine in Leipzig. Many people are dying. Duke Wilhelm of Jülich-Cleves and King Christian III of Denmark are trying to negotiate peace between the Elector and Emperor Charles V.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is assembling an army and is seriously considering resuming the war. Allegedly, he has explained his previous inactivity in a printed document. It is said that he plans to invade the Netherlands while the Bohemians and the Elector fight the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He is [on the way to] Weiden. He lacks provisions. As Haller recently wrote, up to twelve companies were destroyed for Duke Maurice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Troops were mustered everywhere in the Kingdom of Bohemia. They are to be armed by April 4th. The forest was blocked by felled trees to prevent a connection between the imperial army and that of King Ferdinand. The colonel [of the Bohemians] is named Kaspar Pflug [von Rabenstein]. The king's children are also to be held in Prague. It is reported from Nuremberg that by April 4th, 50,000 men are to gather in Prague. The Elector has already concluded a treaty with the Bohemians. This will still trouble the Emperor!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Whether King Francis I of France is really dead, as merchants from Lyon report, the people of Zurich will know better than Haller. It is certain that King Henry VIII of England has died. The Parliament, which governs on behalf of the young King Edward VI, is now allowing the Gospel to be preached in the South German manner. In Venice, the Doge [Francesco Donà] and the council are said to allow two preachers to proclaim the Gospel. It is also said that the old King of Naples [sic] is invading the kingdom for the Emperor. King Sigismund of Poland is also dead. So many changes are happening!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] May the Lord protect his Church. In haste. Greetings, also from Sixt Birck, Sebastian Lepusculus, and Thoman Ruman.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote four or five days ago. I thought the city clerk would travel to you (as he certainly intended); however, he only made it as far as Constance. He also brought back with him Zoller, who has been here for six days now and has not yet visited me! I do not know the reason. Laetus is now preparing the wedding of his daughter, whom he has betrothed to a standard-bearer.</p>

      <p>The mayors are very different towards us than towards the imperial ones. While they want to satisfy both sides, they do not do what would be for the glory of Christ and the benefit of the church. They pretend and conceal everything. Herbrot deprived Beccius of Beckenstein of his most expensive and splendid house through usury (no one judges otherwise) and almost forced him into exile; hence he is spoken of very poorly among all citizens. Soon after this act, his son-in-law, whom he had from a very wealthy family, miserably killed himself; hence his entire family is greatly defamed. May the Lord grant him grace not to place too much hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who provides abundantly, etc.; for Paul does not call greed the root of all evils in vain.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have news that the Elector sent three regiments to Erfurt to take it, so that he has a granary behind him. There is also a common saying that Duke Maurice has reconciled with him and pledged his brother Augustus to him. But I do not believe it. Leipzig suffers great distress from hunger and death. The Duke of Jülich and the King of Denmark are negotiating for peace between the Elector and the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Landgrave is hiring soldiers. He wants to get serious. He is also said to have had a booklet printed in which he explains why he has been sitting still until now. It is said that he wants to let the Bohemians and the Elector deal with the Emperor and meanwhile fall into the Netherlands. But it is uncertain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Emperor is at Weiden. He lacks provisions. Duke Maurice's forces have recently been reduced to twelve companies, as I wrote earlier from the rumor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Bohemians have mustered troops throughout the entire kingdom. By April 4th, everyone should be armed to march into the field. They have also cut down the forest so much that neither the Emperor nor the King can connect with their forces. Their chief commander is named Kaspar Pflug. They are guarding some of Ferdinand's children in Prague. They do not want to let them out. By April 4th, as written from Nuremberg, 50,000 should be in Prague. It is also said that they have taken the Elector into their alliance and have already sealed it. In summary: The Emperor will have enough to do!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The King of France is said to be dead. You will know better. Our merchants have written from Lyon. It is certain that the King of England is dead. The governing lords of the parliament, who rule for the young king, allow the Gospel to be preached according to our upper German church form. In Venice, two are also said to preach the Gospel with the favor of the Doge and the entire council. It is also said that the old King of Naples is invading the kingdom for the Emperor. The King of Poland is also dead. In summary: Many changes are appearing in all realms.</p>

      <p>God protect his church! Amen. All this in haste. Farewell and take it well! March 13, 1547. You know where I am. Sixtus and Lepusculus with Romanus greet you. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
