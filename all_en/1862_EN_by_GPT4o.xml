      <p>Greetings. In response to your letter delivered by Mr. Rost, I have nothing else to say except that I pressed you for my Jonas without consulting and, unless good men had advised it, I would never have dared to ask you for such a thing. You are abundantly excused with me. However, I am now uncertain about what I will decide regarding Jonas; for he has begun to suffer greatly from his bladder, so much so that I fear for him not a little. If he does not feel better within four days, I have decided to send him to his mother until he recovers or something else is provided by the will of God. This will take away my opportunity to visit you at this time. However, I will make an effort to visit you with Jonas this summer.</p>
      <p>Margrave has inflicted a moderate defeat on the Bishop of Würzburg, captured Bamberg, and instilled great fear in the people of Nuremberg. Duke Maurice is hastening to the Swabians and the areas adjacent to the Hercynian Forest. I am being recalled home by my people due to impending dangers, although I can be of little help to them. I pray that you Swiss see and beware, lest such things and worse happen to you as they have to us: I would speak more openly if the Lord permitted.</p>
      <p>Your paper gift is more precious to me than gold and topaz; for I began reading the book yesterday and will not stop until it is read and reread. May the Lord preserve you for the church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus) etc.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger etc., uniquely beloved friend and brother.</p>
