    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the help of Bullinger and others in his time of need. Was well received in Biel, especially by [Rudolf] Rebstock; no one has inquired about his departure from Laufen so far. There are pension recipients in the council, selfish and depraved people; they must be fought against. The council has - following the initiative of Schnyder and [Jakob Würben] - taken action against the Anabaptists, who wanted to introduce the ban. In the Concord text - Bullinger will have seen the Biel statement in Basel - he is disturbed by "Transubstantiation" and other words, and he is also surprised that more emphasis is placed on Luther's words than on Christ's words; he is decidedly for the truth, regardless of persons, and recommends reading the writings of Zwingli and Jud as well as Bullinger's commentary on the 1st Corinthians. He has experienced much suffering with his family through [Heinrich] Rahn, but will continue to faithfully perform his duties. He reminded some [mercenaries] from Zurich and Bern - among them [Wilhelm] Frölich - in his sermon of Nikolaus [von Flüe's] well-known [warnings against foreign lords and their money]. Niklaus Wyttenbach told the story of the pastor [Eimer Beynon], who was called to [the newly conquered territories of Bern] and successfully defended himself during an attack by enemies of the Reformation. Greetings. Bullinger should hand over the three guilders to bailiff [Stefan] Zeller, which Schnyder borrowed as travel money.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, so that I do not appear to you and my other dearest brothers in Christ to be among those ungrateful people who, after being rescued from dangers by the grace of God and the counsel of good men, and having aspired to happier things, consign all received benefits and acts of kindness to oblivion, I have decided to inform you of the state of my affairs through this unpolished letter.</p>
      <p>First of all: The magistrates and people of Biel received me kindly upon my arrival, and I reached them safely and happily with my family; they have assigned me a stipend of no less than one hundred florins, partly in money, partly in wine, wheat, etc., along with pleasant lodging; moreover, up to this day, both the magistrates and the citizens have treated me with great kindness, being diligent and eager to promote Christian discipline and to hear the word of God; especially Rebstock, who pursues me with singular love, certainly in your name. Up to this day, they have not asked me for any testimonial letters, nor how I left Laufen.</p>
      <p>However, there are some in the council infected with the French salary, whom we call pensioners, who, as we have learned, are concerned with wielding the sword of the divine word to uproot and teach the glory of God and the homeland recovered by force and arms. It has always been and will always be my duty to curse and anathematize that bloodthirsty and wicked kind of people, always seeking their own advantage, from God and all the pious inhabitants of the homeland.</p>
      <p>Moreover, upon my arrival, that detestable kind of Anabaptists had secretly crept in, publicly protesting that Biel was not a Christian church. We confounded them with the sword of the Lord before the council, which expelled them from both the city and the countryside, as they attempted to establish some sort of excommunication due to certain soldiers, wanting to purify the Lord's area, which belongs to the Lord alone, before the time.</p>
      <p>You have seen our confession regarding the actions of Luther and Bucer in Basel; I wish it had been pleasing and acceptable to you. The word "transubstantiation" and other papist terms displeased me. I cannot sufficiently admire how we all cling more to words than to the meaning of Christ's words, and more to Luther than to that solid truth, as if, if Luther agreed with our opinion, all princes would agree, if he believed, all would believe, as if the entire Christian religion depended on Luther. Behold how dangerous it is to be so attached to persons without judgment. Therefore, my brother, you should take my opinion on this controversy as follows: I will subscribe to the prescriptions of the holy church's doctors, as well as to men endowed with piety and learning no less than those of old, teaching and interpreting the simple truth candidly, purely, and truly, free from papist suspicion and Luther's leaven, and those who are attached to them are attached to solid truth, not to persons; I speak what is true, without any simulation, God knows. I wish that all the pious (and not those who seek material for contention rather than simple truth) would freely read and ponder the writings of our father of the homeland, Zwingli, and our Leo, and your nocturnal and diurnal labors of commentary on the 10th and 11th chapters of the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians. Certainly, if those glory-seekers sought simple truth with sound judgment and not rather detestable ambition, they would find where that tumult could be calmed, they would find where they could quench their hunger and thirst for justice, they would find where they could refresh the burning desire of their soul to know the truth. Thus, pious brother, I feel about these men: I fear there is a deceitful pope behind them; this is what they cannot accomplish without us. Thus feels, and indeed piously, the church of Biel, almost the first fruits of our Gallic religion, not only rejecting the papacy with its unfruitful works of darkness but also words that smell of papism, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, my intimate and beloved brother in Christ, I do not dare to trouble your ears any longer; what I did on the last day when I bid you farewell; for they added sorrow upon sorrow to me and my wife and family, Rhon and others like him. An opportunity will be given someday to speak about these matters. The same Peter, as I have always been, with the help of my God, I will remain his faithful minister of the holy church and guardian and observer of my homeland. Meanwhile, let the haters of ministers plot whatever they want. The whole business is the Lord's, indeed everything that we are. He will give serpentine prudence and dove-like simplicity. Piety and impiety will eventually reveal themselves.</p>
      <p>Some from Zurich are staying in Biel until spring with some from Bern, among whom one is named Frölich, and indeed they are frequently present for public sermons, hearing the word of the Lord; when I see them standing by, I recite the song of brother Nicholas, the father of the Swiss homeland.</p>
      <p>Then Nikolaus Wyttenbach, indeed a pious man and an ornament of the city of Biel, recited to us on the 16th of January while we were sitting at lunch, namely yesterday, the 15th of January, in Neuchâtel, that he had heard in truth from certain persons that a priest had called the Bernese to the new Bern to preach the gospel from the jurisdiction of Biel. When he arrived there with his wife, staying overnight in a lodging, twelve priests came at night, attacking the priest with force and arms. This evangelist killed two with a sword and left a third half-dead; the others fled. As I heard this from a pious man, I did not want to keep it from you.</p>
      <p>Moreover, greet Leo, Pellican, Theodor, Battus in my name, and all my dearest brothers, your wife, and beloved mother, Christoph.</p>
      <p>The prefect from Andelfingen lent me 3 florins for travel expenses for me and my family. I want you to communicate this to him. May the Lord give him a worthy reward. I commend myself to your faith and charity, and may you have Peter commended, which I have always wanted and now and always want. Peace be with you.</p>
      <p>From Biel, the 17th of January 1537.</p>
      <p>Peter Schnyder, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To my trusted dear lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
