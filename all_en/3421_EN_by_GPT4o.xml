      <p>Greetings, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>When evening had already fallen, these letters were delivered to us by a brother minister, who seeks our opinion and advice on the matter that is inscribed in them. After consulting with my brother colleague, I judged that the boy should by no means be rebaptized, lest we confirm the entrenched error of the Anabaptists, who have derived their name from this most pestilent act. The reason is clear, as the dignity of both the word and the sacraments depends not on the minister, but on God himself. I added: "Provided the boy was baptized properly, that is, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But if otherwise, the infant should not be considered baptized.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I thought that the act of the layperson who baptized should be judged by civil law, and that since the sacraments pertain to ministers, his act should not be approved, as it originates from the common belief that infants who die without baptism are condemned. Therefore, I judged that Christian listeners should be more fully taught about the use and purpose of baptism. Master Philipp holds a completely different opinion and insists that the boy should be rebaptized, lest the ministry be discredited. However, he finally wished that I write to you about his opinion or both of ours and seek your advice on this matter. Which I do, albeit late at night and indeed hastily, and I ask and beseech you, most kind father, who holds much authority and piety among us, not to hesitate to write your opinion on this matter to Master Philipp and me, even if only briefly.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that I have drawn my opinion from you, my teachers, and I could provide many reasons for it, which I learned from you. Yet, my judgment should rightly be set aside for yours.</p>
      <p>However, you will temper your writing so that it seems to pertain to both of us and that you appear to have considered the truth. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Master Philipp, my colleague, sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>In other matters, we agree well with each other; we have also conducted this amicably. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Chur, 29th of November, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and patron, to be greatly respected.</p>
