      <p>Dear beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Know that the discord in Solothurn is still not resolved, and all the envoys of the Confederates are making great efforts in this matter, with our lords having 6 of the councilors and 4 of the citizens there. And this is the beginning of the matter, as I have heard: Three years ago, when I was preaching in Solothurn, there was also a rebellious uprising. It was settled (resolved) through Fribourg, Basel, Biel, and Bern, and letters and seals were established on how both parties should behave towards each other, where our side complained greatly that they were never kept to it, but were increasingly oppressed, and even in the city, they were not allowed to hear God's word, and then they understood in the countryside, where over 30 parishes had accepted our religion, to make them apostatize with more and intrigue. Recently, a false evangelical priest has fallen back to the mass, which greatly displeased our party. In the meantime, it happened that 2 evangelical peasants brought rent to a mass priest, who did not know the peasants, but let them go, and before three days had an end, one would see wonders in Solothurn, and the Lutheran faith would have an end. Our party is said to have been warned by the 2 peasants and is very concerned about violence, and therefore on October 30th, they gathered in a day, took the armory, but the pontificals also partly stood against them, partly with guns in the houses, and immediately, that I do not speak to them, they also wanted to do that against their countryside in the GÃ¶w and wanted to take the churchyard of St. Ursen, but their plans were betrayed. In the meantime, the mayor in the city, Brosi von St. Gallen, and others intervened and their desire was nothing else than that the letters and seals be kept to them, heard and ordered to receive a decision before the great and small council tomorrow. So they moved together, about a hundred well-armed, across the bridge into the suburb, threw down the bridge. As soon as our peasants, their neighbors, heard this, they gathered in large numbers. So our lords were informed of this, sent their envoys, who did not want to let them speak in between, but then held back their own. This has now happened. In the meantime, the pontificals have told our lords within the confederation and alliances that they want to help them punish the perjured traitors. What answer was given to them, I do not know. In the meantime, we have received many warnings about who would come to help them and want to pass through our territory; we are therefore prompted to urge you and others to have a loyal watch over us. There is a response written to us from you that is so mocking and scornful that it pains us. We cannot know or think from what reason this happened, whether we cannot rely on you for anything, neither help, advice, nor comfort, or how it stands. It is my earnest request that you inquire with trusted people how it stands, for we have not yet taken sides in anything, helping to make peace as we can, but that God's word is not harmed, for, as I hear, our envoys have no further commission. But if it cannot be otherwise and Antronii understand, adversaries want to pass through our territory, it would be very inconvenient for us, also not tolerable, but we would resist as we could. Here we want to be concerned, for much is said, many warnings come, whether you would sit still, send mediators, or as soon as we worry about each other. Please inform me for the honor of our God from your trusted people what can be expected from you. I do not know, but I think, however, from no one, nostros will not be easily let go to ruin, yet no war will be started. But if it were started with us, we would do as God gives us. They are just beginning to articulate. The pontificals of Solothurn have brought all their people, whom they can reach in the land, to swear to the banner, whatever is more, to obedience, all old mandates and envoys are gone. They have also demanded 8 men from the evangelical party (about 800 lying in Wangen and Wiettlispach, for they are not safe in the suburb), whom they want to punish with life. The rest should surrender at mercy and disgrace. Among the eight men, the most prominent are: Hans Hugi, the banneret, Urs Starch, the former treasurer, Hans Heinrich, Master Lewen's friend, two brothers named Roggenbach. I think if they remain steadfast, all matters will come to good, if not, there will be great lamentation, haste, scandal, and we are surrounded. Now do not delay and write clearly. Quod facio non ex me ut antea.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>7th of November, year 33.</p>
      <p>Write me a response to all things with this messenger. He is trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my dear godfather.</p>
