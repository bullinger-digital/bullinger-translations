      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ our redeemer.</p>
      <p>Reverend man and esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Our dearest Christophorus, your son, delivered two letters from you to me, along with a booklet by Adam Christian, a pious and learned man, published this year to the electors and states of the empire, which I could hardly satisfy my mind with during this interval of time. For I skimmed through everything rather than read it, and I extracted some things that I wanted to compare with others, for which reason I cannot write my opinion about this booklet to you at this time; for you would say that I, so unprepared, approach such a great cause, driven by a certain blind desire, not moved by reason or zeal for piety. The cause began with angry insults, is conducted and defended by most with clamor and fury. I fear it may one day have a tragic end; for the matter is on both sides most miserable and such that we should lament it night and day. For from that long and most harmful controversy grows hatred between the parties worse than Vatinian, so much so that on both sides some angry revilers rather than preachers wish all those who have not joined their party to be destroyed. The apostles did not plant the gospel in this way, nor did they establish the church by these means. But the devil has found this unique way of suppressing the gospel of Christ and persecuting brothers, so that one accuses and cries out against the other: This one is a Lutheran, this one is a Zwinglian, this one is an Anabaptist, this one is a fanatic, not because he is, but because some very wicked slanderers wish him to be. However, my Bullinger, I do not write this to you because I desire anything of this kind in you (as far as your genuine probity and modesty are concerned), but because I grieve for the calamity of the Christian religion. May Jesus Christ our Lord help the struggling Christianity, collapsing under its own weight, unless the only Atlas, the Son of God, is present. Moreover, I give and have great thanks to you for this book.</p>
      <p>You have indeed done a pleasing and perpetually deserving thing; for there is some use of this book and certainly not a small one. There is no need for you to be anxious about your son.</p>
      <p>I offered him my service; then my house is open to him whenever he pleases. I will not fail him, as long as he pleases, whatever you wish.</p>
      <p>Many people are chattering about novelties.</p>
      <p>Someone came from Bern the other day, who says that the artillery was standing in the market and everyone was armed; yet the king is said to have written to them to wait for further instructions.</p>
      <p>You know this better than I can write to you. The pope desires the staff, they say; for the Duke of Alba, I believe, has a son; he would like to make him a bishop, where he has an income of a hundred thousand crowns. The sword does not prick the pope so.</p>
      <p>Some say that troops are being raised in Hesse, in the Palatinate, and Württemberg; but I do not yet believe it, although I do believe that the princes mentioned here were in danger; for there are some who would like to have the Palatinate.</p>
      <p>Thus the king would like to have the land of Württemberg. If only you and the king of France were at peace, then we would have foreign hands in our hair. The colloquium in Worms is waiting for this.</p>
      <p>But God Almighty knows well how to do right; He can break the plans of men and turn everything to water. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>Say greetings from me to Master Bibliander, Gwalther, and all good people.</p>
      <p>In haste, Augsburg, September 15, 1557. Your humanity, Johannes Ehinger.</p>
      <p>With much piety, outstanding learning, and sincere...</p>
