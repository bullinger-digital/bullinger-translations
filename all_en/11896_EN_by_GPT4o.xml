    <p xml:id="regest1">His intention to resign, criticized by Bullinger, was based on his weakened health and impending poverty, since his annual salary was reduced by 33 guilders six years ago due to his criticism of the pension recipients; after being granted an increase of 20 guilders in the meantime, he now intends to persevere until his imminent death. His colleague [Johannes Blasius] wants to resign from his position due to an injustice he suffered and will report on it orally; Bullinger should dissuade him from this step.</p>

      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. I received your kind letter, dearest Bullinger, although it was not delivered in its due time, in which you encourage me not to renounce my duty or calling and not to rashly abandon the little sheep of Christ entrusted to my care. Much could be said about these matters; but I lack the strength, nor am I fit to write due to the illness of my head. This, therefore, is the primary reason that I am henceforth entirely unequal to this calling, being almost exhausted of all strength; for it far exceeds my strength, filled with cares and labors. Another reason: six years ago, when I opposed the pension-receiving scoundrels in a sermon, as my duty required, I had aroused their rage against me, so that they deducted 33 Rhenish guilders annually from my priestly stipend, which was otherwise meager and slight. I have endured this injury until now; but in the meantime, as much as they deducted, I was forced to add from my own and my wife's goods, so much so that, if it had to be endured any longer, my children would be reduced to begging and exile after my death. However, before I attempted anything, I informed the senate of my poverty and my intention, who added an increase of 20 guilders annually. Content with this and because I am near the grave, I will await the day of the Lord in this calling. However, my colleague, my most beloved brother, has been gravely wronged, as he will explain to you in person, and is so offended that he has proposed to resign and has firmly resolved in his mind. I therefore ask and beseech your kindness to dissuade him and deter him from his intention as much as you can; for unless God is going to grant me better health, I am to be considered as if deceased, and with his departure, the church would be entirely destitute. He will recount the rest to you himself. Farewell. From the Court of Rhaetia, February 18, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Antistes of the city of Zurich, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
