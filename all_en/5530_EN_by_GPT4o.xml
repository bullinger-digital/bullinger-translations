      <p>Greetings. I recently received your letters sent through Bränvaldum, by which we finally learned for certain that Mr. Martyr has passed away.</p>
      <p>This has greatly dismayed us.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musculus is so affected that I am convinced he too will depart from here all the sooner; for he held this man in the highest esteem. I do not grieve so much for him, because the Lord has taken such a light from us, as I sympathize with you, for I know well how you must be affected by this. However, I pray to the Lord that, content with this chastisement, He may preserve you, Musculus, and others with us for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Today I also receive your other letters along with those pertaining to Mr. Steiger; I will deliver them to him as soon as he returns. He has gone to Neuchâtel; for there were negotiations there about entering into some truces with the Prince of the Allobroges; but as far as I hear from the arriving messengers, nothing has been accomplished. They themselves may come tomorrow or the day after, and whatever they bring, I will share with you; meanwhile, I will also remind others of what you write about Schliniger. Whatever can be obtained from France, you will learn from our Liner, who brings these to you.</p>
      <p>We have heard nothing yet from Frankfurt, due to the death of the Bishop of Cologne; however, they say another has now been elected and is expected in Frankfurt. Sultzer writes that there is a Turkish delegation there, which reports that the Turkish Emperor will take up the cause of the King of France against the rebels. But all sensible people understand these to be the schemes of Cardinal Lorraine and the Guises.</p>
      <p>Liner confidently asserts that 25 Spanish galleys, which were being sent to France and were supposed to land at Marseille, have perished, and only 5 (for there were 30), though damaged, have landed. It is written that in Spain several English merchants have been executed; hence the English have captured and slaughtered 4 Spanish ships loaded with goods in the English Channel, killing all the Spaniards on board; thus, there is now an open war between Spain and England. I am returning Bäldii's letters; our senate has seen what the enclosed note contains; all good men rejoice that this man has been freed and hope for more peace as a result.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to add now; for everything else, as I wrote, you will hear from Liner. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends, brothers, wife, children, and indeed your entire household in my name. My mother, father-in-law, Haller, Hagius, and especially Diesbachius, whom I have also informed about those matters from Glarus, greet you. You know Mandossa has gone, called to France; everyone wonders what this portends.</p>
      <p>Coignetius will also depart; for he has just sent letters to the senate bidding farewell. Farewell. Bern, December 6, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
