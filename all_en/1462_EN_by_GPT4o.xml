      <p>Greetings. I will write these few things to you, and more when I have more leisure. Our prince has been made Duke of Suffolk: it is most certain, as he promised me yesterday, that he will write to you along with his daughters within a month. Today I met with Cheke, the tutor of the royal majesty; however, I could not speak to him clearly about your matters; I was therefore instructed to return tomorrow. Stumphius and Andreas, who are just about to board the ship, make it so that I too cannot write anything to you at this time. I beg and beseech you to forgive the brevity; I will make up for everything with singular diligence and zeal in the future. November 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>Especially regarding the sister of the King of England, you should be reminded by me most diligently. However, you will learn everything better and more correctly from this Andreas of mine: therefore, inquire of him.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and outstanding man, H. Bullinger, his most esteemed master.</p>
