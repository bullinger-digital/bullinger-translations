    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the received letter; eagerly awaits the news withheld out of caution. [King] Ferdinand arrived in Nuremberg on July 22, for no other reason than to collect money again; he may also want to discuss how to prevent [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse from further harming [Duke Henry of] Brunswick; regrets the capture of a Christian city by the Turks, who - it is said - are leading 200,000 armed soldiers against Hungary; as soon as [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa attacks Italy, the Frenchman [Francis I], if possible, will occupy Milan. Rumors about English support for Emperor [Charles V] against France and about his marriage to Mary [Tudor]. Yesterday, the Zurich notary Burkhard Wirz died. On August 6, the Confederates will gather in Baden [for the Diet]. Inquires which parts of the Matthew commentary [HBBibl I 144] Vadian still needs.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Your letter was welcome, most learned and esteemed brother Vadianus; but it would have been more welcome if you had shared what you have, but did not wish to entrust to just anyone. I await what you will give. Ferdinand came to Nuremberg on July 22, for no greater reason than to collect a large sum of money through a new levy. Everything that was laid out has been snapped up. Perhaps there will be a consultation on how to prevent Hesse from harming Brunswick further. I grieve for the capture of the Christian city by the Turks. May it not be an omen of future events for us! It is said that the Turks have armed 200,000 soldiers against our people and are moving with a well-prepared army into Hungary. Barbarossa, with a well-prepared fleet, will invade Italy, and on this occasion, the Frenchman will occupy Milan, if he can. It is said that the Emperor has entered England, the English have armed against the French, married Mary, and carried off several myriads of gold with him. An Englishman, who was in England within the month, reported about the myriads; he had heard nothing about the new marriage in England; he finally heard the rumor in Antwerp, Brussels, and Mechelen; he could not report anything certain about the army armed against the French. Yesterday, Burkhard Wirz, the notary of our city, passed away. I could not write more. On August 6, the Swiss will convene in Baden, etc. August 1, 1542. Let me know which is the last section in Matthew.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, most esteemed lord.</p>
