      <p>Greetings. Although the iniquity of the times has for some time prevented my hand from writing, dear brother, my spirit and sincerity towards you have never languished for even a moment, without ceaselessly desiring with deep affection to enjoy your most beneficial company, if not in person, then at least through letters. I wish I could spend just one hour with you before I endure more difficult challenges.</p>
      <p>The Emperor released and absolved me and those like me on the 3rd of August from public duties and from the previous oath given to the magistrate, so that it has been up to me to seek another position. However, as an old and experienced servant, it seemed to me that such a serious matter should be handled with the utmost modesty and humanity, lest I fall into Scylla after having once overcome the Sirens. Therefore, I have frequently appealed to and requested the new magistrate to inform me whether, through the Emperor's release, I am completely free from my duties and the contract I entered into with the city council 12 years ago or not. To this inquiry, I have not been able to obtain any other response to this day than that it is solely the Emperor's decision to discern such matters; therefore, I must wait for the Emperor's declaration. In this way, I am still suspended and very uncertain about what I should do and where I should turn, especially because I can hardly conceive of a place that would accept me; everything around is in such a precarious and dangerous state. I implore you by our faith to be present with your advice on how and where I should seek a residence. By God's kindness, my family is numerous, my means are modest and almost ready. If there are any pious exiles or refugees among you or in the vicinity, please inform me of their circumstances and greet and console them in my name as diligently as possible. Greet your councilors, the chief scribe, Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, Gessner, Gwalther, and the entire circle of the Muses there. Here we seek salvation from the Interim and have peace.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Haller and Musculus, if he is in Zurich. If you wish to write back, send the letters to Lord Vadian, who will give them to Hieronymus Sailer, from whom they will safely reach me. Farewell again and again. 28th of August 1548.</p>
      <p>Gregorius Laetus, etc., yours, residing at the Ulrichian monastery in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To my gracious, dear lord and friend, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
