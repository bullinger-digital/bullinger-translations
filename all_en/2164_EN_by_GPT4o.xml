      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ the Lord sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Our Laelius brought me your most welcome letters, in which I always recognize your love towards me. What you write about your son Heinrich, to remove that worry from me which was troubling my mind, I completely trust you, even if you did not show Laelius the time of my and your son's departure in the diary. Therefore, I will henceforth convince myself that no offense has come from me towards you, nor has anything diminished of your love for me. As for my dialogues on the greatness of the kingdom of God, I do not see what disturbance this subject could bring, especially to the pious, since it serves to amplify the glory of God, which all the pious wish to illustrate and exalt as much as possible, nor can it be amplified as much as it deserves. For there is no new doctrine here, but only a discussion on that question in both directions, and that without obstinacy. However, as I wrote in other letters, I greatly value your advice and will not do anything rashly, but will await the will of the Lord, to whom, having once commended myself and all my affairs and consecrated them to His glory, He will not allow me to go astray. And I also thank you for your advice, so far from being offended, I cannot persuade myself that it comes from anything other than your love for me. My wife, children, friends, and especially Laelius greet you from the heart, and I also reverently greet you and all yours, to whom I wish all happiness.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 19, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and wise man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
