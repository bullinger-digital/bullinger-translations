      <p>Greetings. I also received the latest letter when I returned home late, uncertain whether the messenger is still here; I will try as soon as possible. You pray for us and forgive that I write less; for I cannot do more, even if I were to die. What I wrote about our consul Gaisberg, that he fled from here, I now correct with more diligently obtained information, so that you know he departed of his own accord, as he is unwell and not useful for any purpose; for this is what some now affirm.</p>
