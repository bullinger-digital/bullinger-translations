    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The servant [...], who is delivering this letter to Bullinger, was supposed to deliver a letter to Arnold in Konstanz. However, when he stayed overnight in a village not far from Zürich, his boots, with the letter sewn inside, were stolen. Arnold, who does not know how important this letter was, although he has a suspicion about its content, earnestly asks Bullinger (since he himself is not a confidant of the Zürich city leaders) to listen carefully to the messenger's report and then conduct secret investigations to find out whether the boots have reappeared, and if so, to send him the letter sewn inside. He will gratefully pay for the resulting costs and, with God's help, repay Bullinger for his efforts.</p>

      <p>Favorable and trusted, dear lord and friend, I cannot hide from your honor the confidential manner in which this servant, the bearer of this letter, had a letter and command to deliver to me. However, when he came to a village near Zurich on his way here, his boots and the letter sewn inside were stolen from him at night. And although I do not know what was at stake, I have a great suspicion (especially in these times, when the outcome might be burdensome for many people, etc.), earnestly and friendly pleading, since I am not known in that place, nor to the leaders (city heads) in Zurich, that you would listen to this messenger's oral report of his loss and have a serious inquiry, also secretly make efforts to see if the boots can be retrieved and the letter sewn inside sent to me. Whatever results from this will be gratefully paid by me, and your effort will be kindly rewarded (repaid) with the help of the Lord.</p>
