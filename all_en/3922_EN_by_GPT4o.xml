      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you the speech that was delivered at the Imperial Diet by Mr. Charles de Marillac, Archbishop of Vienne, a pious envoy of the king. When I receive the conditions of peace, I will send them to the most honorable council, to whom I wish all things beneficial and happy, as well as to Mr. Martyr and Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 14.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
