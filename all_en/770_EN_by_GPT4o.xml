      <p>On the second day after leaving you, I arrived in Bern, most honorable Mr. Bullinger, where I had the most uncomfortable lodging due to the crowd of people gathering for the fair; for there was no corner of the inn free from guests, and what was most burdensome of all, I had to live according to the manners of those who, as if released from cages, spent days and nights in gluttony, drinking, and other behaviors that usually accompany such indulgence. In the coldest weather, I was forced to wander the fields. Johannes Haller kindly invited me to his home, but I did not want to be a burden to him, especially because I hoped for a quick departure, and yet I was forced to stay there for four whole days. I left so eagerly that I even disguised the given response in a more elegant form, which I send to you faithfully transcribed. I wish all responses were given in the German language; for our countrymen have more refined tastes than to approve such insipid and moldy things, and yet this ignorance, however undeserved, reflects on the lords' reputation. Treasurer Haller received me kindly and provided advice and assistance; he was always afflicted by gout, which was as inconvenient for him as it was for me.</p>
      <p>For his presence might have advanced my cause. Musculus treated me with the utmost kindness; but both he and Haller, being engaged in their vocations, are not involved in public affairs.</p>
      <p>I admire and revere the integrity and prudence of your council; I wish I had touched upon the calamity and utter misfortune of that war, which now enters its seventh year to the great delight of some, to see if I could discern any interest or concern in him for resolving this tragedy, whose settlement would not be insignificant for the Swiss, and in my opinion, they would not be ungrateful peacemakers, and although the greater part of the Swiss are sworn to the King of France, yet if something honorable and useful were sought on both sides and that fairness was seen in the conditions offered, then the suspicion of confederation and alliance, with justice and equality obtaining their place, might perhaps prejudice the cause among wise men. I discuss these things with you not as a servant of the King of England, but as a lover of peace and an enemy of wars; if you perceive any hope of this action being successfully initiated through your republic, inform me at the earliest opportunity. Send your letters to Strasbourg and here to the bookseller Herwagen, who is called Hans Herwagen in the German language; he will send yours to Strasbourg by a quicker route than anyone else (as far as I can guess) residing in this city. I will thank you for the various benefits you have bestowed upon me when I return to you; I will return, however, as soon as I receive any hope from you that seems worth the effort and journey; for no one understands better and more clearly than you alone how much it concerns the entire Christian world, let alone the Swiss, that peace be restored between those two kings. In this most honorable matter, test the strength of your intellect, the diligence of the Zurich magistrate, who is accustomed to preside over the Swiss assemblies, and the efforts of friends. I know with the most certain arguments that this negotiation will not be ungrateful to the most serene King of France. After a more diligent inquiry, I learned that no one would more conveniently send our letters back and forth than Froschauer's agent residing here, to whom you should send yours to be forwarded to me under this address: "Peter von Mecheln, bookbinder, residing in Basel by the Kaufhaus. I reside in Strasbourg by the cloister of the Brothers of Our Lady. I most dutifully commend myself to Mr. Gualter, also to Halesius the Englishman, his companion, and the other Englishman, excellent men and my very good friends. I do not wish these letters to be shown to everyone; you know the reason yourself. Use my services as you wish. Farewell. December 23, Basel, in the year 1549.</p>
