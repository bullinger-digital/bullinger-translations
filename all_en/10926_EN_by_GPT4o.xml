    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks, also on behalf of Grynaeus, [for the kind reception in Zurich] and for the copy of a letter from [Johannes] Zwick [No. 879]. Although he has received the writings left behind there from Bern, he has not yet received a response [to the Wittenberg Concord]. Kaspar [Megander] and Erasmus [Ritter] are overly suspicious. He intends to forward Zwick's letter to Bern. He quotes explanations on the article of the Lord's Supper of the Concord from a letter by Bucer to Grynaeus. He asks to remind the people of Bern and promises to work towards postponing a possible meeting. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Grynaeus and I thank you for everything you have bestowed upon us, especially for sending the copy of Zwick's letter. We see from this both your diligence and your commitment to us. Moreover, we understand and rejoice that you have heard nothing from this that did not come equally from us. From this, we hope it will not be our fault if concord is not achieved.</p>
      <p>Up to this day, we are waiting for a response from the people of Bern. Indeed, I had sent the articles with declarations, our response along with yours, to be returned with their opinion. They sent ours today; I see no response, although the one who brought it said he had written down the response and understood the agreement, but where it has gone, he does not know. He brought letters to the senate; what they contain, we do not yet know. Kaspar advises me not to trust Luther or the people of Strasbourg too much. It certainly pains me that so much is attributed to emotions. Before God, I regard no one but the truth of Christ. Erasmus is working to prevent concord; I do not know what he fears. I wish he had never entered Bern! This is for you. We are ensuring that the people of Bern also have Zwick's letters.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bucer has also written, which I would give in full, if time permitted. However, from many things, hear this one: "Now," he says, "this presence of faith and understanding does not bring Christ down from heaven, does not mix him with bread, does not enclose him in a place, but embraces him reigning in heavenly glory, yet reigning in such a way that he presents himself to us here, exiled, detained in this body, through this supper, these words and symbols (he himself, however, not excluded or enclosed in any place and in no way changed) administered here as our savior and truly offers himself." About the unworthy, he writes in this manner: "About the unworthy, you know, as the article expressly names them, who do not pervert the words and institution of the Lord, who have faith in the sacrament. I ask you, if someone willingly betroths a woman to himself with a ring and gives her the ring, she understanding the mystery receives the ring and at the same time the right of marriage, yet is not of the mind to keep the faith of marriage, shall we say, however, that she has not only received the ring but also the right of marriage itself? Although unworthily, because she does not rightly cultivate the marriage or even intended to cultivate it when she received the marriage with the ring. So it is with the sacrament," etc. Consider these things. If necessary, I will send the entire letter next, although it belongs to Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>I wish that Kaspar and the others would be reminded by your letters to beware of Erasmus, and then, to look towards concord and truth, leaving everything else aside. It seems to me that peace in the church will be complete. As for the people, you see there is nothing to fear, since no one prescribes ways of speaking. We will handle the meeting with as much diligence as we can, to have it postponed. For I am anxiously awaiting Luther's judgment on Vadiano.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family, and greet all the brothers in the name of Grynaeus and myself.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 26, 1536.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be respected.</p>
