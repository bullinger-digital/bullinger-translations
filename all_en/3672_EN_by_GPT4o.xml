      <p>Greetings. Your letters have greatly cheered me, my dearest and most esteemed Bullinger, both because they were long and much desired, and especially because they were faithful witnesses of your constant love towards me. Your work, in which the spirit of Christ has been used, has honorably accompanied the most learned and fitting sermons of the divine prophet Jeremiah for our deplorable age. For these, I have no worthy thanks to offer you, except that I will never cease to intercede with the heavenly Father with perpetual prayers, that He may always be present with you with His most immediate presence, guiding and moderating your tongue to speak and your hand to write with His Holy Spirit, so that all who are truly Christian may always recognize His voice when you speak and His hand when you write, and may they diligently and happily prepare themselves for the obedience of faith. What you wrote about the laws of the military among you openly refutes the splendid lies attempted by some among us. Our people here are completely inactive, and although they seem to want to follow the Bernese, they do not imitate what they do. The one who delivered my last letter to you is among those who disturb almost all efforts worthy of a Christian magistrate. I had written to you a few things in characters unknown to the public, whose figures I once sent to you, fearing for myself from the doubtful faith of a man; but they slipped from you, I suspect, so that you could not read them, although it did not matter much.</p>
      <p>Everything among us is daily deteriorating, especially those things that concern the magistrate and his function, so that we experience the truth of what Isaiah said: the Lord will give children as princes to the people whom He has decided to destroy. Although this is a common complaint with most ministers of the word everywhere, that the zeal of the princes and magistrates, which once was, has completely cooled, that all seek their own, that they are unfaithful and companions of thieves, that they have completely thrown off the yoke of divine obedience, and many other things of that kind, which are read in him and other prophets. We can easily guess what evils this portends for the churches of Christ, especially since the destructive dissensions among our preachers and teachers greatly weaken even the good and pious princes, of whom we have few left, and they begin to be less consistent with themselves. I have no doubt you have heard about the decree of Prince Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg, in which he, with astonishing cruelty and prejudice, included the so-called Sacramentarians along with the Anabaptists and Schwenckfelders, condemning them all to capital punishment, and imposing the penalty of loss of country and confiscation of all goods, which they call proscription, on anyone who receives any of them. They think that all those who subscribed to the Augsburg Confession as if it were a heavenly oracle will soon follow this example. What do you think will happen from this, I ask you, my soul, except that the evangelicals will stab each other with their own swords and fall by mutual wounds, and thus the gospel itself will have no more cruel and harmful enemies than its own professors. I have not received any certain news of new things from anyone, except for those common things known to no one. You have undoubtedly already understood what the fortune of the French is in the Netherlands, and hence the studies of the monarchs on both sides are burning all the more ardently, who, while they rage against each other, there is no small danger that they may prepare the Christian world as a sacrifice for the Turk, whom some Italians write has already occupied an ancient port in Italy, and nothing is expected but endless calamities from the Lord, who is so angry with our sins and has long extended His hands to us in vain to call us back to Himself.</p>
      <p>Nothing worthy of note is heard from the orders of the empire, as far as I know, except that they look at the calamities of others more securely than is appropriate. It is written that the Emperor has provided auxiliary troops, namely several thousand Bohemians, to his nephew Philip. The Frenchman is raging excessively, intent on the destruction of the saints, whom, however, our King of Kings, Christ, will soon destroy, having been bravely conquered and defeated with the other most cruel enemies of His kingdom, triumphing gloriously over all these things, with the long-desired peace finally restored to His own.</p>
      <p>I hear that all of Saxony is most odiously boiling with ecclesiastical contentions, with bishops tearing and lacerating each other, who ought to have applied those splendid gifts of Christ, in which they excel, to far better uses, so that we are rightly admonished from this to cultivate holy unanimity and peace in the Lord more diligently, with His spirit, who is the Prince of Peace, being ardently invoked with perpetual prayers and sighs. But farewell now, my soul, always remember me and mine in your sacred conversations with Christ.</p>
      <p>May your household be well, may all your fellow ministers be well, especially Rodolph Gwalther, Theodor, Wolf, etc., and especially the incomparable old man of learning and piety, Dr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>I wish to be most diligently commended to the holy patronage of all of you at the throne of grace. May the Lord Jesus Christ always preserve you as firm and unshaken pillars of His church eternally! Farewell again. August 13.</p>
      <p>I commend to you, as lovingly and dutifully as I can, Master Johann Ulm, and indeed to all of you, whose situation I would grieve more vehemently if I did not know that all that has happened will turn out for his good by the Lord's kindness and your benefit. Greet the good young man with my words, whenever you happen to meet him; I wish him to be cared for in every way as much as anyone else. Our people greet you reverently and honorably and commend themselves to you as diligently as they can. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
