      <p>To the honorable lord and father. Your letters have reached me faithfully, about which you should have no doubt. The reason I am responding so briefly is that I could not delay the swift departure of Master Wegman and Lord Vogt Ã„scher. In summary: I earnestly pray to God that He strengthens you and keeps His church for a long time. I do not bear the twentieth part of the burdens with which you are daily laden, and I often begin to feel weak and weary. May God, who has granted you so much grace, be your help and strength! Otherwise, the handling of a certain writing displeases me. May God give those people greater seriousness. - I send everything back with the greatest thanks. About our affairs, your people will inform you, especially Heinrich Murer, who has been thoroughly instructed by me about everything. The envoys from the Five Cantons or the messengers from the Seven Places, among other things, proposed: if one does not submit to the Council of Trent, one should consider what happened to those who opposed the Council of Constance. You will hear about the response and many other things from Murer, but soon from me personally. I will write everything more diligently, but now I am in a hurry. Those people ask many things and speak shamelessly, they want to subject us to the Council of Trent; but I hope they will be thwarted. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. I add this: Letters have arrived in the name of the Emperor for Beatus; he writes to the God's House (his subjects). This matter troubles our people.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the Monday after the Purification of Mary, etc. The calendar was not at hand, hastily, in the year 1566. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I send the letters of Dr. Beccaria, so that you may see what hope there is for the new pope. To the most honorable man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
