      <p>S. I have nothing to write in such a silence of affairs, brother Bullinger, except that some people from Antwerp do not cease to write to our people that we must be wary of the Emperor; but regarding this matter, I recently sent you letters sent from Noricum to a certain friend of mine, transcribed by my hand, through a senatorial courier. It is said that he is now approaching Speyer and that those who enlist common soldiers have been sent ahead. We have not yet heard anything about the new pope.</p>
      <p>The French and the Spanish are eagerly striving to lead that bride, whoever she may eventually be, home and to enjoy the harlot of confusion softly, and the French court passes no other judgment more fiercely against the blood of Christ than to ensure that the opportunity to obtain that prostitute is not taken away; for indeed, all who seem to love Christ are rejected by her. But we will be informed about these things by the event itself. Meanwhile, I solemnly beg you to carry out, in my name, with utmost faith and utmost silence, what I subscribe in German, with Lord Lavater.</p>
      <p>Wishing to do well and inform my gracious lord Lavater that our ship returned home on December 20th and brought great thanks from all places, with very friendly offers; and if he has not yet arranged to offer anything here, that he should remain completely silent. My lords will arrange either a secret message or a letter during the holidays, from which he will understand all the dealings, and then my lords can secretly advise what seems best to them, etc. May the gracious God grant you and us a happy, good, and prosperous new year. Amen.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, quickly, December 23, 1549. Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>Antronius and my lords are getting along well together; however, there is some lack concerning the increase of the field and forest money. In this matter, they will gladly allow themselves to be advised.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
