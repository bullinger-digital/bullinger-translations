      <p>S. P. D. I cannot, most illustrious men and most honorable fathers, refrain from sending a common letter to both of you, through which you may receive some joy from me, even though I know well that Mr. Tobias, my most beloved colleague, will do the same far more thoroughly. The decree or decision of our lords in Graubünden, made in response to our speech and petition in the name of the synod held before them, is this: that those communities be brought into order, which, whether among the free Rhaetians or in the provincial valleys of Valtellina and Chiavenna, have persisted in retaining inept or pernicious preachers excluded or not accepted by the synod, against the decree and will of the lords; so that the judgment now established by the lords for this very purpose may act against them with power and authority, and punish them until they comply and obey; likewise, that the insolent and petulant Moerus be exiled and move entirely outside the jurisdiction of the Rhaetians; and finally, that the equally contumacious Gantner subscribe to the sentence passed on him by the synod and abstain from the duty of preaching for a whole year, after which the synod's sentence on him, depending on his conduct in the meantime, will stand; and if he refuses to subscribe any longer, he is ordered by the Chur council to be stripped of his citizenship and seek his residence elsewhere, etc. - This tragedy, or its scarcely completed catastrophe, was followed by another, authored by the Pope and the Rhaetian lord as the director, whose prologue has only been acted out so far, the climax to be conducted before the communities to which the matter must be referred, and the catastrophe to find its outcome again in the assembly of the lords according to the will and command of the communities. For when the son of the Rhaetian lord was in Rome for a long time last year, he obtained two diplomas from the Pope for his father, or the Pope, as he testifies in them, delivered them to him of his own accord, or privileges, one of which grants him full power to recover, indeed to snatch from the hands of the Guiciardi, a certain noble family, the benefices of a certain provostship in the Valtellina in the name of the Roman See, which had been given to them by the Rhaetian lords 15 years ago, so that they should be spent for pious uses according to the evangelical doctrine, which credible witnesses affirm has been done, and to confer them on whomever he wishes, even his own sons, etc. The other diploma, not fortified with any greater strength, grants him similar power over all ecclesiastical benefices existing throughout Graubünden and its provinces, with judges, if any wish to resist, endowed with ample power designated to the bishops of Como and Chur or either of them, indeed so that he may also invoke the Patriarch of Alexandria, whom I do not know, and the bishops of Constance and Basel, who, from the duty enjoined upon them, should assist him with the aid of the secular arm, if necessary.</p>
      <p>However, when he, relying solely on papal power, dared to invade the possession of that provostship in recent days without consulting the Rhaetian lords and without any regard for them, since he undoubtedly persuaded himself that there would be no one who would dare to oppose his power, with his heart indeed snatched away from Christ, his enemy, and a blasphemous man who does not hesitate to call his gospel diabolical with another word: behold, the Guiciardi come to Chur at this fair to complain of the injury and at the same time to request that what was given to them long ago be preserved. However, in the meantime, when the rumor of the papal diplomas obtained spread among the people, which the wretched man thought would be nothing less and happened beyond all his hope, he was reduced to such fear divinely instilled in his heart from the sudden event, having been previously admonished by us quite amicably, that he came to us almost trembling, or in his name, his brothers, offered himself and promised that he would tear up those diplomas in our presence immediately, provided we agree that he may at least take away that provostship, to which alone he pretends to aspire so greatly. When we denied him this for reasons of no small weight, urging him to desist from his plan, lest he bring great harm upon himself, he, however, uncertain of his plan and at the same time hindered by shame if he had desisted, continued to seek, persuaded that he would persuade the greater part of the lords; from which hope he is now cast down, since according to the senate's decree the matter must be referred to the communities. Behold, how and how gloriously God chooses those who are foolish in the world, weak and despised, to confound the wise, powerful, and noble of the world, and to bring their plans to nothing, and through those who rely not on carnal weapons but on those powerful before God, demolishes fortresses and what opposes the knowledge of Christ. To Him alone be eternal praise and glory. - What gift the lords have destined for you, Lord Simler, for the books sent or their dedication, is not for me to write, since the lords themselves will undoubtedly do so or Mr. Tobias. But instead, I will report something else, which I know will affect you more, namely that in Bergün too, the Mass, along with the remaining Roman superstition, awaits imminent ruin, having entirely inclined to fall, since a certain man, hitherto consular and not unlearned, seeks from the synod the faculty to perform the office of preacher there, so that the Mass may be abolished.</p>
      <p>In Chur, hastily, on the 21st of November, 1571.</p>
