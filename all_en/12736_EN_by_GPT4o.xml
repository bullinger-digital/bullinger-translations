    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich will hardly ever be able to thank Bullinger appropriately for his frequent and useful writing activities! Although he also never lets a messenger leave without a letter, he recognizes from the responses that some of his letters are intercepted. This explains why the people of Zurich are sometimes unclear about the course of the war. However, this is insignificant, especially since hardly anything significant has happened in this war. The enemy [Emperor Charles V] has always tried to avoid a battle with cunning and to prolong the war so that the [Schmalkaldic League] runs out of resources, while he can count on the financial support of the papal world. Yet, God willing, the [Schmalkaldic League] will continue to do as much as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Due to the harsh winter and the lack of provisions and fodder, especially among the imperial troops, soldiers and horses can no longer endure in the field camp. The imperial cavalry is almost twice as large as that of the [Schmalkaldic League] and is supposed to receive a reinforcement of 1000 horses from Naples. However, in this weather, this will hardly benefit the Emperor, only causing more harm to the poor farmers. As soon as possible, the [Schmalkaldic League] will withdraw, but leave behind 2000 riders and 10000 foot soldiers. These are to provide defense for [Southern Germany] until spring. May the Lord save Germany from this threatening situation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should not work so much, especially not for Frölich, who has already admonished him about this recently [with No. 2684]. Bullinger should also dedicate his writing [„Underscheid des Altten und Nüwen gloubens“] to a more esteemed person than Frölich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Zurich pastors [Lorenz Meyer, Rudolf Schwyzer, and Thoman Ruman] are doing well. The circumstances of their appointment are not ideal, but they will be taken care of in a brotherly manner. Only God can make the Augsburgers' endeavor succeed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger's admonition to vigilance and caution is being followed. So far, the [Schmalkaldic League] has proven to be persistent and courageous. It is also clear that this war can only be decided by the victory of one of the parties, without any negotiation, otherwise the entire German people would suffer. However, if a [peace] treaty were to come about, Frölich would wish to be poor and far away from Augsburg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Frölich has forwarded Bullinger's information about military leaders and troops, as well as the news from Luxembourg and about [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, to the responsible persons. He has also written to Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. Bullinger's letter to Hans Wilpert Zoller [not received] and the book intended for the Hessian preacher [Theobald Thamer] [„Endtchrist“ by Rudolf Gwalther] he has promptly sent to the field camp. May God richly reward Bullinger for his merits in the cause of religion and the fatherland already in this life!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] At no time did the [Schmalkaldic League] intend to enter into an alliance with the French [King Francis I] or with the English [King Henry VIII]! They only tried to cause difficulties for the Emperor and to obtain money. Efforts will now also be made to thwart Granvelle's machinations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [Johannes] Haller, Zoller, [Hans] Vogler [the Younger], and all the people of Zurich are very dear to Frölich. Hopefully, he can be of assistance to them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, [Johannes] Fries, [Theodor] Bibliander, and to all scholars.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [Wolfgang Lavater], the son of the mayor [Hans Rudolf], has long since departed from Ulm and will hopefully have arrived home by now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and to the children. May the Lord be with them all. Amen!</p>

      <p>S. How I, most devoted friend and brother, will ever be able to respond to you for so many and such diligent and useful writings and services, I do not know. Even though I never knowingly allow anyone to leave here without my letters to you, I easily perceive from yours that mine are sometimes intercepted. Hence, you are often uncertain about our affairs. Indeed, writing about the events of this unfortunate war more often than I have written was of no use. For nothing memorable has ever happened in it, as the enemy has always avoided conflict with his cunning (by means of tricks), moving his camp now here, now there, and prolonging the war to this day, easily persuading himself that our resources cannot last long, while he is aided by money from the entire papacy, and no one aids us; which is certainly not unfounded. In summary: We have done what we could so far; we will continue to do as much as the Lord will grant in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now the harshness of winter will prohibit the camps. Neither horses nor soldiers can endure this cold for long; I am silent about the enormous lack of provisions and fodder in both armies, yet greater in the enemy's than in ours. The Emperor surpasses us in cavalry by almost double, and now a thousand Neapolitan horsemen are flying to him, although in this weather he will achieve little besides the plundering of poor farmers. Our forces will soon return home, if it can be done conveniently, leaving us with 2000 horsemen and 10000 foot soldiers, with whom we will defend ourselves until spring returns. In the meantime, may the best and greatest God place this most serious and ruinous matter for all of Germany in a healthy state! Amen. I know you all, the pious, will implore this with us from the depths of your hearts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your most holy labors, brother, are excessive, especially those done in my favor. Indeed, someone more worthy than I should have been chosen to whom you dedicate your divine writings. I know myself to be lesser in this regard than to be held in such honor. But your ardor and love for me rightly take precedence. Therefore, I advised you a few days ago in a letter not to burden yourself too much with labors. I wish to repeat this here in passing, and I pray that you set a limit to your affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your preachers, indeed now ours, excellent men, are here and conduct themselves diligently and honorably. However, the reason they were summoned is not in the state it should be. Yet the Lord, for His glory and kindness, can still abundantly prosper our pious endeavor. Nevertheless, we will support those excellent men fraternally.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As you faithfully and kindly write and remind us to be vigilant and not to trust too much, this is indeed done with all diligence. We have held ourselves stiff and bold, and I hope that, as much as God grants grace and as far as our ability extends, nothing will be lacking. The war can and may in no way be ended by any means without finally destroying the German nation, but one side must prevail. However, as soon as a treaty is made, I would like to be poor and far away from here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What you have written to me about the guidance and report of captains and troops, as well as the news from Luxembourg and with Granvelle, I have immediately reported to the places where it is appropriate and have also written to the Landgrave. I have also sent your letter to Hans Hilpert Zoller, as well as the booklet to the Hessian preacher, promptly to the camp. I thank you for all this. May God grant that your faithfulness, diligence, care, effort, and labor in the cause of God and the fatherland be recognized here in time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>At no time was it in our minds to enter into an alliance with the French or the English, but we tried to persuade them to make trouble for the enemy and to lend us money. We will also now strive to counteract Granvelle's cunning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>D. Haller, Zoller, Vogler, and all the people of Zurich are most commendable to me. If only I could properly gratify them!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>You will greet the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, Gessner, Fries, Bibliander, and the entire circle of scholars most earnestly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The son of the mayor Lavater, as I recently wrote, has long since left Ulm, undoubtedly to return home. I hope he has now arrived.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable wife and children. May the Lord be with you. Amen. November 23, 1546. Yours, Georg Frölich, etc.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my beloved lord and brother, etc., Zurich.</p>
