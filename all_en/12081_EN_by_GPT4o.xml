    <p xml:id="regest1">Regrets that he bothers Bullinger so often, but it is not about private matters, rather a public issue, namely the truth of Christ. Has heard almost nothing about the writing of the [Zürich] council; he only knows that it was somewhat welcome and has infused new strength in many to avoid the dispute - the actual goal of the writing -; he also notices how the dispute has decreased from the pulpit. The [Bernese] court clerk [Hans von Rütte] requests a large-format German Bible; Bullinger should send it through the same messenger; the money should arrive by Lucia's Day [on December 13]. Wishes Bullinger all the best in the renewed dispute with [Johannes Cochläus]. Bullinger should preserve his strength for the confrontation with Luther; he must be approached modestly, but with solid scriptural evidence, in such a way that in the zeal for the truth every mask is unveiled and nothing [false] is spared. Rümlang should also not be spared by Bullinger; he is ready to endure everything together with him and [the people of Zürich] and wants to fight fearlessly for the truth; he is and remains a Zürcher. Bullinger should recommend him to the mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and all [others]; will write Bullinger any news.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Most learned and excellent Bullinger, it pains me not a little that I must so often be a bother to you and interrupt your more serious affairs. However, it is not a private matter, but a public issue and the truth of our Lord Christ that is at stake; which requires these exchanges of letters, etc.</p>
      <p>I have heard almost nothing about the writing of your council. It is still kept in utmost silence. I have only understood this: It was not entirely unwelcome; it has encouraged many and therefore compels to avoid disputes and disturbances; so that this matter may be expedited. But I have understood and inferred enough from the words of some: The arrogance and ferocity of the preachers, who foster dissensions, have subsided, etc.</p>
      <p>The scribe of our judicial court requests a large-format German Bible; send it through the bearer of this letter; he will send the money by Lucia's fair. He did not dare entrust it to this boy, lest it be lost, etc.</p>
      <p>As you once again wrestle with the foolish lawyer, I pray for success for you and for all of us.</p>
      <p>I also wish for your strength to be preserved for Luther, with whom you must contend in utmost modesty, yet with robust scriptural testimonies, in such a way that every mask is uncovered and nothing is spared in the zeal for truth.</p>
      <p>As for me, do not spare me in any way, nor spare my name. I am prepared to endure even the worst, if God wills it, together with you and all of you. Therefore, I pray that you deem me worthy to be included in your list. Here, I will fearlessly defend and protect the truth with all my strength, which God will supply, if only the opportunity arises, so that I may not seem to have acted beyond duty. Although the cause of truth does not always exclude importunity, I strive for this one thing, to gather and build up and not to scatter or destroy. I am and will remain a Zürcher. And I am delighted if I must engage with the pretentious and vain talkers and triflers.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Commend me to all the learned, to the mayor Lavater, and to all. My spirit foresees all good things; for I also find that the leaders, whom I once felt were hostile to me, are now more gentle. Farewell. Whatever happens, I will write to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily, on Thursday after the feast of Martin in the year 1544. Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most upright, learned, and faithful man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zürich, his ever-observant friend and patron. To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
