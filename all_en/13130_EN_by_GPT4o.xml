    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Gast feels compelled to add the following to his letter [not received]: There are unmistakable indications that Emperor Charles V is planning an attack on the Swiss Confederation! Nobles claim that he will seize the Confederates just as he did with the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is also said that Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach is courting the widowed Duchess of Lorraine, Christine of Denmark. Maximilian, King Ferdinand's son, is allegedly to become Governor of the Netherlands and marry [Maria], the Emperor's firstborn, while the Polish King Sigismund II Augustus is supposedly courting a daughter of the Turkish Sultan Suleiman. The deceived Landgrave Philip of Hesse is abandoned by everyone. Only the Duke of Brunswick still supports him and is trying everything possible to free him. The fortress of Kassel is being demolished.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] What if the Emperor takes the fortress of Hohentwiel? Then it would probably be over for the Confederates! The Duke Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg, [so to speak] captured by the Emperor, must agree to everything because he proved indecisive during the Schmalkaldic War, even though he had a powerful army. He was afraid of losing the [battle?] and eventually lost his entire principality! What if the Imperial forces gradually occupy Breisgau, Alsace, and the towns of the Black Forest and attack the Confederates with united forces? Charles V also has troops in Milan, Piedmont, Swabia, and Burgundy! Yet the Confederates remain blind and will only become wise when they are attacked, and it will probably be too late! May the Lord protect them from the enemies who threaten their freedoms and can utterly destroy them. Who will oppose the Emperor, who wants to avenge his ancestors and reclaim his original homeland?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Strange! What are the Venetians and the papal envoys doing at the Baden Diet?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In Frankfurt, there were new outbreaks of plague, even though the godless troops have left the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Queen Maria of Hungary is returning home because her brother, the Emperor, has asked her to, so as not to fall victim to the plague raging in Augsburg. If only he would realize that the plague breaks out everywhere his army appears, and therefore admonish his advisors to propose measures that serve peace and the Christian faith in Germany and all of Europe, so that they can finally unite against the Sultan! If he wants to be a special Emperor, he must depose the Pope, force the bishops to reform according to the Word of God, free the Church from the harpies, and appoint god-fearing, learned church servants everywhere in Germany and elsewhere, who truly proclaim the Word of Christ, namely faith in Him alone, without any falsification.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Constance will probably reconcile with the Emperor, as the troop leader Sebastian Schertlin withdrew to Basel on November 19. He is staying at the inn "Zum [Roten] Ochsen".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Charles V is planning an alliance that will include all of Germany, and this before anything is decided about the council. All the imperial estates nod in agreement and dare not make a peep against his orders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings once again!</p>

      <p>S. in domino. I am compelled to add this to my letter: There is a widespread rumor that Emperor Charles V intends to attack Switzerland. The signs are unmistakable. The nobles are spreading the word that Charles will soon deal with the Swiss Confederation as he did with the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, it is said that Albrecht Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, is courting the widowed Duchess of Lorraine. Maximilian, the son of Ferdinand, will be the governor of the Netherlands, and he will marry the Emperor's firstborn daughter. It is said that the Polish King is courting the daughter of the Turkish Sultan. The Landgrave is deceived and abandoned by everyone except the Duke of Brunswick, who is doing everything possible for his release and freedom. The fortress of Kassel is being demolished by the Emperor's forces.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What if the Emperor could capture the fortress of Hohentwiel to the detriment of all of Switzerland? For Duke Ulrich is the Emperor's captive and is forced to say amen to the Emperor's will, as he did not want to act otherwise, having a very strong army with him. He feared losing the battle and lost his entire principality due to his timidity! What if the Emperor's forces gradually occupied Breisgau, Alsace, the cities of the Black Forest, and then attacked the Swiss with all their might? He also has his garrisons in Milan, in the Piedmont region, in Swabia, in Burgundy. But we do not want to learn until we are struck, and perhaps later than would be convenient for us. May the Lord protect us from those adversaries who can harm or utterly destroy our freedom. Who would curse the Emperor if he were to undertake something against us? He wants to avenge his ancestors and intends to draw part of his homeland back to himself.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What are the Venetians and the papal envoys going to do at the Baden Diet, I wonder?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The plague is beginning to break out again in Frankfurt, and it is strange, as the city is empty of those impious soldiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor's sister is returning home, admonished by the Emperor not to be seized by the plague in Augsburg. If only the Emperor would consider that the plague follows everywhere his army goes, and thus also admonish his advisors to propose the best measures that would benefit the tranquility of the Christian faith and Germany, indeed all of Europe, so that they might finally resist the Turks with united forces. If he wants to be the sole Emperor, it will be necessary for him to depose the Pope from his seat, compel the bishops to reform according to the Word of God, defend the church from those harpies, and appoint pious and learned ministers everywhere in Germany and other places, so that the Word of Christ, that is, the one true faith in Christ, the Son of God, is preached solidly, purely, sincerely without any deceit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not doubt that Constance will return to the Emperor's favor, as Captain Schertlin came to us on November 19 and was received at the inn "Zum [Roten] Ochsen".</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Emperor will establish an alliance throughout all of Germany before anything is concluded about the council. All the states of the empire agree and do not dare to speak against the Emperor's decrees.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell once again. November 21, 1547.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
