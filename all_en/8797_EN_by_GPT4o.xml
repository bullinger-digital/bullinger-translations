      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>From your letters, most noble lord, which you sent to us on the thirteenth day of January, we have received great pleasure in our hearts. For the expression of your illustrious goodwill towards us and our church was pleasing to us, and your letters seemed to us to be from a man no less pious and religious than vigilant and industrious. You write that when you heard about the concord between your churches and ours, you were filled with great joy with us, because you believe that this will contribute greatly to the expansion of God's kingdom. And although you believe us to be most inclined towards this, you earnestly request, both to further kindle this zeal in us and to meet the adversaries of Satan's efforts together with you, that we give as much effort as possible to preserve this union and concord among us, and in what the most Christian king considers about entering into an alliance with our city, we should consider the common benefit of the church. Finally, you ask that we commend you with pious prayers to the best and greatest Father, who in turn will offer us your grace and assistance in all matters. To this, most noble lord, we respond by first giving you the greatest thanks for attesting to your most inclined goodwill towards us with those kindly written letters, offering us all your efforts, and sharing your pious studies and plans for the Christian public cause with us so confidently and openly. Although we are less able to repay the favor, we are certainly able to proclaim and hold it sufficiently.</p>
      <p>As for the Christian agreement and concord, which you especially encourage us to preserve with your churches with your most faithful and loving admonitions, we ourselves, as our church and these times especially demand, consider it most necessary and to be nurtured with mutual acts of piety and charity. And whether we choose to take necessary lessons of caution from the dangers and inconveniences of other people, which is prudent, we are easily taught by the sad memories of the ancient church's distractions and by observing recent examples how much dissensions hinder and harm the progress and growth of the Christian kingdom. Or if we prefer to use the foundations of Christian agreement divinely laid for us, there is a confession of faith and doctrine made and even published long ago among our churches and your primary teacher, Dr. Johannes Calvin, a brother to be respected by us, and this has been cultivated by both sides and defended against the bites of malevolent people. It pertains to the same thing that your people clearly profess in the confession presented to the king that they agree and teach the same in this part of doctrine as in most others with the English, Scottish, Swiss, and Rhaetian churches, and even with the Genevan church itself. If both your people and ours, and all of us, refer our plans and studies to this agreement, there is no doubt that there will be a stable and firm concord among us that will remain forever.</p>
      <p>We have done this so far with our letters to those with whom we have some old acquaintance, and do not doubt, lord, that we will continue to do so, so that you will find our desires, our prayers, our studies, and our efforts fully responding to your so pious will. But since you yourself excel in dignity and authority and especially in your great merits towards the French churches and the kingdom itself, and therefore can do much both with those to whom God has given peace with you as leader and administrator, and with the king himself and the nobles of the kingdom, we consider you alone to be more suitable and able to preserve and maintain concord than anyone else. For if, as Satan is wont to do at the beginnings of emerging churches, some wish to study new things and doctrines or to deviate too much from moderation in establishing church governance, or to indulge their passions too much and either relax or tighten discipline more than is fair, or to vex others with harsh beginnings and rashly exclude and condemn either natives or foreigners without first trying gentle remedies, you, most noble lord, imitating Constantine the Great, who first gave peace to the ancient churches, can restrain them with your authority and encourage them to the studies of ecclesiastical peace and edification; and unless we were confident that you would do this diligently and continue to do so according to your piety and prudence, we would ask you to do so with more words.</p>
      <p>As for the alliance, although we are most inclined to expand the kingdom of God as is fitting for us, and we also greatly favor the flourishing kingdom of your France, yet, since this matter is outside our office and is placed in the will and power of our senate and people, we have nothing else to respond except that we believe our senate and people, when the matter is referred to them, will do what seems fair and just and most suitable for the safety of the Christian public cause, as is fitting and expedient, without reluctance. Finally, you do not so much earnestly solicit us to commend your health and dignity to the protection of the best and greatest Father with our prayers, lord, as we are ready and prepared in spirit to do so.</p>
      <p>For we recognize and also experience how important it is for the princes to be safe and unharmed, especially those who, in these corrupt morals and times, strive to defend the Christian public cause, which is almost exhausted in resources and strength, against both the hidden snares and the open and violent movements of the antichrist and his parasites, and to restore it to its former integrity. Led by this reasoning, we are accustomed to commend you, most noble lord, and all magistrates to God with our constant prayers. We earnestly and repeatedly ask that you kindly and graciously receive these our studies and efforts towards you and your churches, and especially these letters, however simple and sincere, as witnesses of our respect towards your excellence, and that you continue to embrace us with perpetual goodwill as you have begun.</p>
      <p>Farewell and enjoy the peace acquired by divine means through your greatest cares, labors, dangers, and especially prayers, for as long as possible, as you deserve and as we ourselves desire.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted pastors, preachers, and professors of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
      <p>To the most noble lord and truly illustrious Gaspard de Coligny, Count of Coligny, Grand Admiral of France, his most honorable lord.</p>
