      <p>Greetings. I write to you less frequently, dearest father and co-father, because I write more often to my brother, whom I know shares everything with you. From him, I believe you have also learned of the death of my dearest and best father-in-law. What I have lost in him cannot be said or written; for he was present with me in all decisions to be made, in all matters to be undertaken, and as he helped me with his wisdom and great experience, so too did he protect me with his virtue and authority against all malevolent and envious people, whom no one is without. But it pleased the Lord to call him to a better life, so that we may learn to swim without this support until it seems right to Him to transfer us to him. Meanwhile, it pains me greatly, as I learn from my brother, that you too are not enjoying good health; yet I am amazed at how you can still devote yourself to these labors of writing. I therefore pray to the Lord to strengthen you more and more and to preserve you for us and for the entire church. As for the Schaffhausen matter, I still do not fully understand it; I hear indeed what you want, and also what you fear. But if it were to be addressed, on what grounds, what the counterarguments of the people of Schaffhausen are, this I do not yet understand, nor do I willingly inquire about this from our people, lest I seem to anyone to be meddling. Regarding Hasler, he is not making much progress; he cannot yet be so easily caught. Nothing has been lost or withheld in this matter; we have also bravely defended ourselves before the appointed schoolmasters of the council several times. But his patrons have still supported him until now. I hope, however, that God will soon bring his matter to light in such a way that he will be put to shame with them and they with him. They now want to count it against us as envy, as is commonly done, that we otherwise do not want to grant him a reward; but that is not the case, God knows, to whom I would much rather give thanks if he knew well, than that I would hinder him in any way. But he has absorbed the poison, yet he can dissimulate so skillfully that one must now catch him with tricks like all other similar eels. I wish I could be with you for a few hours; I have much to discuss with you that cannot all be written. But I must overcome much with patience. I thank God that everything else is going well and that unity is still maintained among us; may He grant further grace. My brother will inform you about other matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet all the brothers and friends. Bern, March 2, 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my dearest and most esteemed lord and co-father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
