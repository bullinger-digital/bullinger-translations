      <p>Greetings. I was entirely hoping that these brothers would dine with me; for then I would have been able to write more extensively. Now, I write only this to you: the House of Brandenburg is inquiring with the Emperor whether Albert was outlawed by his authority and whether the same Emperor intends to punish Heinrich of Brunswick for waging war against the 32 orders of the empire in violation of the peace treaty; for if he does not do it himself, they will ensure it is done. Heinrich is enlisting soldiers, but he cannot gather them together.</p>
      <p>The princes of Brandenburg, Saxony, and Hesse are meeting in Neuburg to renew their old confederation and to discuss other matters among themselves. In Augsburg, Ferdinand, along with the priests, is pressing for the same peace in Frankfurt that the Emperor wishes to achieve. On the other hand, the electors of Saxony, Brandenburg, and the Palatinate, along with many others, are declaring that unless the agreements of Passau proceed, they will adopt a different course of action. Therefore, the priests are greatly afraid, because these agreements openly grant the free profession of religion. Let us pray to the Lord to strengthen and confirm the spirits of His people and to mercifully protect us from evil. Farewell in the Lord, my venerable Bullinger, and continue to love and support Sulzer with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of March, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
