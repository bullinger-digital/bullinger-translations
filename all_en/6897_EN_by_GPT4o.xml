      <p>Greetings. You should truly believe, my reverend lord and dearest brother in Christ, that our letters were not written by us with the intention of being published, nor to inflame the controversy that has arisen among you regarding vestments, but, if it could have been done, to extinguish it. We believe that this is evident to anyone, provided they read them candidly without bias. We dealt solely with the matter of vestments; we did not engage in any discussion about other issues, which we now understand are being questioned and disputed among you. Our sole aim was to persuade those who thought it better to abandon the churches of Christ rather than use those vestments, that it would be more prudent to use the vestments and remain with the churches entrusted to their faith, etc. However, we did not wish to impose this on the brothers rashly, but only to express what seems to us to be more fruitful, leaving them free to follow what seems best. Furthermore, since we now understand that our letters are being interpreted by some as if they address all the controversial articles among you (which, however, we were unaware of at the time we wrote our letters), we are writing to several pious and prudent men, whose authority we hope will prevail in this matter, asking them to ensure that no one abuses our published letters, nor that, under the pretext of them, as you say, impurities are established in the assemblies, but rather that they faithfully strive to maintain the full freedom of the churches, that faithful ministers are not harassed, and that the Anglican Church is cleansed of those things that are alien to the purity of true religion. Meanwhile, we will pray to the Lord that He Himself may moderate affairs and happily quell these disturbances, restoring tranquility to the churches once the contentions are dispelled.</p>
      <p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you! Master Gwalther greets you. Pray to the Lord for us. Given in ZÃ¼rich on the 10th of September in the year of our Lord 1566.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, yours wholly from the heart. To the reverend man, Master Miles Coverdale, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
