      <p>Greetings. I received your last letter, which included another addressed to Georg Laetus, promptly and ensured, as diligently as I could, that it was delivered to Laetus, as you instructed. I thought he was still in Augsburg; but your address made me aware that the man had moved, whom I do not doubt has now received your letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the affairs in Hungary, we hear nothing else than that King Ferdinand has fortified certain castles with a few small towns by placing garrisons. This indicates that he trusts the Turk little, even though there were rumors of a truce for several years being agreed with the Turk. However, it is certain that even that part of Hungary which professes Christianity and is not in the hands of the Turk is very concerned about receiving the gospel, just as is Sarmatia, despite some bishops opposing it.</p>
      <p>It is reported with certainty that Charles has issued a proscription against the Saxons and published it in many places of the empire. If there is any truth to this rumor, I will soon find out and inform you of everything.</p>
      <p>Our people are frequently reminded by letters from friends from various places to be vigilant about their affairs and to guard against sudden attacks. And finally, it is said to be true that Emperor Charles intends to attack with such a well-organized and powerful army that we will hardly be free from the heavy yoke of all kinds of tyranny unless we resort to some means, accept and uphold them, etc. And there is only the rumor that Basel has a secret understanding with the emperor, which I find very unbelievable. Also, they are said to have absolutely submitted to whatever will be decided in the upcoming council, intending to accept it without objection. But your letters show me that they think differently. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, January 16, 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>Make sure, I pray, that I receive through some trusted messenger the response of the people of Basel to the cantons and yours, and what they intend to promise each other. You would do a most welcome service to our council if you would inform me in good faith about all these matters; we, in turn, will entrust everything to you for mutual trust and safety. I would also like you to send me, as you promised, the advice of your college regarding holding a council and to what extent it should be obeyed, etc.; for this is also what our ministers desire.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt that we will request all these things to be communicated to us alone. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his lord and most beloved friend.</p>
