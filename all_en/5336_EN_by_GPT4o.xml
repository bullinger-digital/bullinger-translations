      <p>Your Reverence (reverend father), I send back everything with the venerable brother Mr. Julius, who is setting out for France; you will hear the reason for his journey from him personally. Mr. Vergerius is still with us, and as far as I understand, he will remain here for several weeks; for he cannot or does not wish to leave before the arrival of Mr. Coignetius, so that he can handle the common affairs of Rhaetia together with him.</p>
      <p>I am expecting more certain news from France; but in the meantime, the adversaries are strengthening themselves. But let the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council, I will omit no diligence, especially at our fairs, I will make an effort to have some certainty.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I have entrusted this business to several people.</p>
      <p>I am sending the letters of Mr. Traversius, from which you will understand that nothing has yet been accomplished; there is no need to return the letters, just destroy them. I am now entirely occupied with sermons and other business related to the upcoming market; therefore, I cannot write more, nor do I have anything else to write. I am most grateful to you for sharing the letters of such great men.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 25, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
