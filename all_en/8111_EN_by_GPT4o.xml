      <p>Greetings. Today before lunch, most esteemed Lord Bullinger and dearest brother to my heart, I received a response to my letters. I give and have the greatest thanks I can for such benevolence towards me, intending to reciprocate, and to write back to your son-in-law, a most dear man and a very good friend to me (God willing), as soon as I have more leisure time. Although I reluctantly trouble you, knowing well the affairs that burden you, I will now explain my request, which perhaps I proposed too obscurely in previous letters, more clearly and as briefly as possible.</p>
      <p>A future synod is expected, as I learned from a great man; however, the exact timing is uncertain, but I believe it will not occur before winter has passed. Friends therefore advise me to prepare myself against slanders, among which is not the least that in the matter of justification you do not approve of my opinion and that I am so contentious that you have not yet settled this matter with me. However, as far as you are concerned, the matter is quite different, the longer I think about it and the more diligently I seek out and understand what has been done between us through letters, the more I find and am confirmed. I trust, therefore, that you, the doctors of the Zürich church and school, my venerable lords and beloved brothers, will not be burdened to impart testimony of our agreement, so that, if necessary (for otherwise I will not display it, but will keep it secret as long as I am not forced and provoked), I may silence the mouths of detractors and also happily defend the truth in other matters.</p>
      <p>I also wrote to Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Wolf, and Mr. Haller, from whom you will learn more.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable lord, and forgive my importunity. In Basel, hastily on the very day sacred to the Apostle Thomas in the year of human salvation 1569.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johannes Hospinianus. To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, light and pillar of the Zürich church, my most esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
