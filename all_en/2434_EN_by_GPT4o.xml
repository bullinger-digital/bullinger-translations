      <p>S. P. I would write more news if I had any; but I rather expect from you; for we are always awaiting the outcome of the German assemblies, in which the Roman king is acting much against the Emperor for the succession of the empire. Meanwhile, Augustus has made peace with the marquis. From France, everything is now quiet; in Picardy, the Emperor has dismissed all his soldiers without pay as before. Before Metz, and in this, he is entirely focused on calling his son from Spain, who is preparing for a journey, not for the benefit of Germany. I would write to your lords about the broken truces in Piedmont; but since this is the only news I have, I entrust it to you. If you ask why they were broken? Because the Emperor wanted truces only between himself and the king, without including friends, which the king refused to accept. For what could be more disgraceful to a friend than open betrayal. The island of Corsica, large and wealthy, is entirely ours; there remained two very fortified and impregnable fortresses, which the Spaniards and Genoese defended; but partly by force, partly with the help of the citizens, they were taken, and thus now the whole island, which has 24 cities... and countless villages, is ours. The king already has ten thousand foot soldiers there, which the Emperor takes very badly... not easily in Spain, later they descend into Italy.</p>
      <p>I would write to Lord Vergerius; but he gave me hope through his last letters that he wishes to visit us, which I hope. Meanwhile, farewell, good man. From Solothurn, October 21st.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassafontaneus.</p>
      <p>Those very fortified fortresses in Corsica are called Bonifacio and Calvi.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and friend, Lord Bullinger. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
