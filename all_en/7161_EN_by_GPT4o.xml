      <p>Greetings. I have absolutely nothing to write at the moment; besides, Mr. Tretius will be a living letter. He himself will tell about the soldiers dismissed in Geneva, and what talks are being held there about the war declared on the French by the emperor for the recovery of the city of Metz.</p>
      <p>I still cannot bring myself to believe it; I am waiting to have more certain information from you about these and other matters. It is not yet clear to us where the Swiss are going to set out. I wrote the rest recently through Mr. Zuleger; if there are other things, I will write later.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tretius is in a hurry to leave, and I have not been feeling very well for three days now. Therefore, farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet my brother and all yours in my name; ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 19, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my lord and godfather, always to be greatly respected.</p>
