    <p xml:id="regest1">The money for Gwalther and his fellow students should not be sent to Constance, as the Marburg councilor mentioned in the previous letter [No. 1430] is ready to advance as much as the Zurichers agree to. He asks to support him for another year; afterwards, he will enter the service of Zurich. Their scholarship should be brought by Froschauer when he travels to the [Frankfurt] fair. Gwalther's Epicedium on Eobanus [Hessus] will be published soon; he promises to send it promptly. He asks again for pictures of Zwingli, as the circle of those who support his teachings is growing daily; the prince [Philip of Hesse] is also said to be among them.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>After we had sealed all the letters, a very honorable senator from Marburg, who is traveling to Constance, heard about the money and instructed us to write either to you or to another of our parents, so that the money would not be sent to Constance, but rather that our parents would grant us the opportunity to borrow it through letters. He offers himself (as he is very well disposed towards students) to assist us in every matter, even though we are unknown to him. Therefore, dearest father, I ask you again and again to write to Gregor Mangolt, the bookseller in Constance, in our name, who will inform him of this in your name. If this is done, we will easily extricate ourselves from the great necessity we are currently laboring under. It is also necessary that you inform the parents of Wolphius and Wikkius of the same.</p>
      <p>Please, my father, ensure that I continue to have you and others as my patrons as I have had until now; I will certainly do my utmost to ensure that neither you regret your kindness nor anyone else regrets their benefit to me. I am ashamed, by Hercules, to borrow from strangers if I am deprived of domestic assistance. I ask for this one year to live more freely; for after this, I offer myself with the most ready mind for the service of your republic.</p>
      <p>Also, ensure that our stipends are paid to Froschauer, who will be going to the fair, so that at the very beginning of the fair, our creditors can be satisfied. Farewell, dearest father.</p>
      <p>The Epicedium on Eobanus dedicated to your name will be printed in these days (as Mr. Lonicer affirms) in the name of this university, which I will send at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>If, however, you can now send the images of Zwingli, please do so. For now, every day, both among the citizens and the learned, those who openly testify as supporters of our religion are beginning to emerge, which everyone also affirms about the prince. Farewell again, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rodolphus Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, his most esteemed father.</p>
