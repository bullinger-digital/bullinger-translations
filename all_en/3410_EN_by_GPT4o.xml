      <p>S. Most distinguished sir and reverend father, I would write to you more often and repeatedly if I had a suitable subject to write about. I confess indeed that your merits towards me are so many and so great that, if I wished to duly express them in my letters, I would never lack a proper subject for writing. But because I know that your nature is so good and that you possess an innate humanity, as if handed down from your ancestors, that in giving benefits, you are accustomed to consider not what each person returns, but rather how gratefully someone receives from you, which is the unique and almost exclusive praise of princely men, that they measure the rewards of benefits solely by gratitude. To avoid the charge of flattery, from which I have always recoiled as from a most pestilent poison, I will not extol your services with greater praise, but I will embrace them with such great goodwill and willingness. What then remains for me to write? You will say, news, especially those from nearby Italy, which is now entirely ablaze with wars, that are brought to you directly by reliable messengers. But those, reverend father, which have been brought for a long time are so widespread that I think they are no longer hidden from anyone, and some are so uncertain that they lack reliable witnesses and authors, which I am reluctant and ashamed to write to you, a prudent man. Certainly, to speak briefly, there is nothing even now that greatly concerns your knowledge. I did not hesitate to inquire of the consuls, as our conversation led, but even they said not a word. Everything among us is whispered and silent.</p>
      <p>But Johannes Heinrich Ronna, who had been lying mortally ill for some time in Ferrara, now having somewhat recovered his health, passed through here yesterday. Since he stayed at the same inn where Beatus von Bonstetten, who has been known to me familiarly for many years, resides, I was pleased to learn the truth about the state of Italy from Ronna through him. Ronna, however, set out on his journey from Ferrara fifteen days ago.</p>
      <p>He reported to Beatus von Bonstetten in these words, etc.: The Swiss cohorts, which had been stationed as a garrison at the castle that the Duke of Ferrara recently placed on the banks of the Po, were withdrawn from there and distributed in three parts to more fortified towns, 4 companies went to Ferrara, 3 companies went to Reggio, 3 companies went to Modena. The leaders of the forces, because the cohorts were very depleted, thought of writing for reinforcements and reported this to the duke, to which he replied that he indeed desired the cohorts to be filled, but seeing that it would take a longer time to recruit German soldiers, he abandoned that thought, especially since he hoped to have peace before the arrival of new soldiers.</p>
      <p>This is what Hans Heinrich Ronna said.</p>
      <p>But he also added that the Duke of Florence is preparing for an expedition to Piedmont and is thinking of recapturing Santjan or Sant Johan by force. And indeed, Rodolph von Salis, the leader of the cohort and himself once of the Rhaetian, came to us from Solothurn three days ago, who says that some leading men, from certain indications, conjecture and predict something about a new expedition into Piedmont; it is supposed that another campaign will go into Piedmont in the coming December, etc. These are the things I had, which, although they are slight, I thought should be recorded here in a few words so that I would not write nothing. I would have written more, but behold, the most distinguished man, Fridericus von Salis, is here and drags me with him to dinner. He sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished sir and revered father. Chur, November 22, 1557.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, lord, patron, and his most esteemed benefactor.</p>
