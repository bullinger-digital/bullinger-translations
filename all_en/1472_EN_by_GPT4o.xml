      <p>S. There is a certain Hieronymus here, who, having cast off the monk's cowl, has become one of the itinerant doctors, who acquire so much impudence by deceiving and frustrating that they are ready and prepared to dare anything. He, already eight months ago, attempted to undermine the doctrine of God's free election, which we teach with you as received from the word of God, in the public assembly of our church. And then indeed, the man's insolence was quelled with as much moderation as possible, but afterwards, he did not cease to clamor everywhere, so as to unsettle the simple-minded on this head of faith. Finally, he recently vomited out his poison with open throat. For when, according to our custom, one of the brothers was explaining that passage of John, where Christ declares that those who do not hear the words of God are not of God, and had said that as many as are not reborn by the Spirit of God persistently resist God to the end, because the gift of obedience is peculiar, with which God honors His elect, that rascal rose up and said that a false and impious opinion, whose author was Lorenzo Valla, had arisen again in our age, that the will of God is the cause of all things; but in this way, sins and the blame of all evils are transferred to God, and a tyrannical lust is attributed to Him, such as the ancient poets invented in their Jupiter.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, he descended to another point: that men do not attain salvation because they are elected, but are elected because they believe, and that no one is reprobated by the mere pleasure of God, but only those who deprive themselves of the common election. In discussing this question, he attacked us with many and atrocious insults.</p>
      <p>The city's prefect, having heard the matter, took him to prison, especially because he had tumultuously urged the people not to allow themselves to be deceived by us. Now the case has been brought to the senate, where he continued to defend his error with no less obstinacy than audacity. Meanwhile, since he boasted of having several ministers on his side in other churches, we requested from our senate that they should not pronounce on the whole matter before obtaining a response from your church, recognizing that rascal's improper use of your support. Initially, overcome by shame, he did not refuse the judgment of the churches, but he caviled that you might justly seem suspect because of your familiar association with our brother Calvin. Nevertheless, the senate, as it was requested, decided to consult you. It was also added that he implicated your church; for, condemning Zwingli above all others, he falsely claimed that Bullinger was of the same opinion with him. He also cunningly sought to sow discord among the ministers of the Bernese countryside. We indeed desire our church to be purged of this pest, lest, if it is not driven away, it harms our neighbors. Although it greatly concerns our and public tranquility that the doctrine we profess is approved by your consent, there is no need for us to implore your faith with many words. You are not unaware of our brother Calvin's Institutes, which he particularly undertakes to attack here. There is no need to proclaim how reverently and soberly he discusses the secret judgments of God there, because the book is a sufficiently clear witness by itself; nor indeed do we teach anything here except what has been established in your church from the time the light of the Gospel was restored, as revealed by the sacred word of God. It is sufficiently agreed that we are justified by faith; but the solid mercy of God appears in this, when we understand that faith is the fruit of free adoption, and adoption flows from the eternal election of God. However, this impostor, when he pretends that election depends on faith, then claims that faith itself arises no less from man's own motion than from heavenly inspiration. Again, it is beyond controversy that the perdition of men is to be imputed to their own wickedness; but in the reprobate, whom God, by His secret counsel, passes over and forsakes as unworthy, He presents a notable lesson of humility. This Hieronymus, however, concedes that nothing is done justly by God unless its reason lies exposed before our eyes. Finally, it is fixed and confessed among us: that it is not lawful to ascribe to God the blame of sin in human sins, nor can the name of sin in any way be applied to Him. This, however, does not prevent Him, by a certain marvelous and incomprehensible judgment, from exercising the power of His hand through Satan and the reprobate as instruments of His wrath, now instructing the faithful in patience, now inflicting punishments on His enemies, such as they deserve. This profane trifler cries out that God is involved in guilt when we make His providence the arbiter of all things. Finally, removing all distinction between the remote and hidden cause and the proximate ones, he does not allow the calamities imposed on holy Job to be considered the work of God, without making Him equally guilty with the devil and the Chaldeans or Sabean robbers. Therefore, as our mutual connection demands, do not hesitate to lift and assert the doctrine of Christ, burdened by the sacrilegious insolence of a wicked and malevolent man, with your subscription. Because we confidently trust that you will do this willingly and gladly, it is superfluous to address you with anxious or elaborate prayers. In turn, wherever our assistance will be of use to you, you will always have us ready for every brotherly duty. Farewell, dearest and most esteemed brothers. May the Lord guide you with His Spirit, bless your labors, and protect your church. Geneva, November 14, 1551.</p>
