    <p xml:id="regest1">[The Zurich scholars] have indeed presented the council with a favorable opinion on the Confessio Tetrapolitana, but they continue to adhere to the [First Helvetic] Confession and see no contradiction in this, provided that the Tetrapolitana and its apology are rightly understood; moreover, Zurich has followed Bern's proposal to exclusively commit to the [First Helvetic] Confession. Kaspar [Megander] has received a copy of the opinion.</p>

      <p>To Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You should not be troubled, venerable teacher and brother much beloved in the Lord, because of the advice we presented to our council. We did not subscribe to the Confession of the Four Cities in such a way that we rejected the Basel Confession. For we continue to adhere to the Basel Confession. However, we can accept the Confession of the Four Cities and recognize it as not contrary to ours. And if we subscribe to it, there will be no danger to fear from it. For in the apology of this confession, it is openly and clearly stated that the body of Christ is outside this world in heaven and therefore in the supper is present only in power and efficacy, especially if the participant of this supper is faithful. What else have we confessed in our Basel Confession? Truly, as I said: we have accepted the Confession of the Four Cities, but we have not denied ours in the meantime. Therefore, we have said openly: "We find it beneficial therein, as it is not contrary to our confession, teaching, and faith; therefore, we can well tolerate it and accept it in the right Christian understanding." If you consider this, my dear Rhellikan, you will not say that either a sin or a prejudice to the truth has been committed. Furthermore, since it seemed better to your people that our acceptance should be concealed and only the Basel Confession should be perpetually upheld, our people also agreed with your opinion and did not separate themselves from yours. Therefore, be of good cheer and expect from us what you would from faithful, truthful, and steadfast ministers of the word.</p>
      <p>Kaspar has a copy of our advice. For we communicate all our matters to him. Give him my greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May 12, 1536.</p>
