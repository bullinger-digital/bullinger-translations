      <p>To the reverend, learned, and well-versed in the best arts, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of Z端rich, his most esteemed lord and teacher, Johannes von Ulm sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>OH, YOUR welcome and delightful letters, full of zeal, love, and diligence! What can I say? I have never seen anything more timely happen in human memory. For your recommendation was brought to us at the very moment when the law about not admitting foreigners into the colleges was being passed, and we were beginning to have some doubts about our status and condition. But you, most excellent and dearest man, not only removed all fear and anxiety from me, but also so confirmed the mind and judgment of Doctor Cox and many other most learned men towards me, that I can be most certain of my condition for several years without any obligation (if I so wish). Thus, I understand that I am bound to you in every way by your golden and paternal recommendation: but, good gods, neither letters nor words suffice for me; yet I give you the greatest thanks I can. With your prudence, recognize the greatness of your merit in the weakness of my talent; for you surpass me by far in that humanity which I have always proclaimed about you, and indeed I know nothing in me that should have led you, a man of such learning and dignity, to write to the most noble men on my behalf: in this indeed you have no equal, this is the integrity of your mind, this is the kindness, this is the humanity towards a vile and abject man. All these things, as I have just said and will always say hereafter, have so bound me to you that I can no longer express in any speech how much I value you, how much I owe you, how much I see I must strive in every way, so that you may always understand me to be grateful and mindful. I would indeed have you persuade yourself that I am so inspired by your letters, that I am now about to embrace our leisure, which seemed least possible, with much more ardor, and indeed I will hold you in that place of reverence and sanctity, where he should be with me, whom I know to be most benevolent to me and placed in the most distinguished position of all Switzerland, flourishing with a singular and exceptional commendation of the best arts and virtues, and indeed also with the praise of a certain divine eloquence. But these things in their place, at their time, more conveniently.</p>
      <p>Now I come to those things which I think should be communicated to you. And first, you should know that the state of Edward, the most excellent and holy king, is still safe, and that he is with the greatest industry and zeal [Greek] propagating Jesus Christ, and restoring the true use of sacred things. Then, about [Greek] there was a serious dispute here in Oxford, in the very presence of the king's ambassadors, the matter was so presented and explained, that anyone with a moderate intellect could easily recognize the truth of the question and detect the absurdities of our adversaries. We have decided that a copy of these disputations should be sent to you, the first two of which were copied by Johannes Rudolf Stumphius, a young man most fond of you, and I took care of the last two; in which if anything is less beautifully written, I would like you to attribute it not to us but to the time and the haste of this messenger. Furthermore, I will write to you about [Greek]: you will perceive it more shrewdly. [Greek].</p>
      <p>You will hear all this more correctly and subtly from your Butler, to whom I sent the booklet I mentioned above, on the condition that he recounts this whole matter to you in detail. The last thing will be that you provide Ambrosius Blaurer, a most excellent and learned man, with this copy of the disputations to read at the earliest opportunity. I ask this of you as earnestly as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Oxford, 7 August 1549.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Pellican, Gwalter, and Bibliander, most excellent men, I would like you to convey my many greetings, and I would like you to promise them all that can be expected from a man most devoted to our religion and also most grateful. I will ensure that you have not rashly undertaken anything about me with them.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the man of singular virtue, piety, and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of Z端rich, his best teacher and patron. Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Z端rich.</p>
