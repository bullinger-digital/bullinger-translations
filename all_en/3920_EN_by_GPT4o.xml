      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>In the matter of the Netherlands, the proceedings have advanced as follows: After the seven (to whom the questions of the captives are entrusted) visited them for the third time, but only in a friendly manner, and dealt with them without torture, two of the foremost finally confessed that the old man was David Joris and not Johann von Brugge, as he was called. Also, many people were killed because of his sect, including his mother, who was executed in a chair with a sword. Likewise, one confessed that it was held among the people that they could well simulate under all religions, just as Jacob put the goat skin on his hands and thus came to the blessing. So Abraham also lied that Sarah was his wife, etc.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the handling of the matter was entrusted to the four pastors and the doctors of theology, so that they, along with two from the council, should go to them all in the towers, also to the women and servants, to Binningen, and question them in all parts, comfort those who need comfort, learn the truth, and instruct them, etc.</p>
      <p>And as we find them, we report to an honorable council. Thus, we have dealt for three days, found some who confessed enough that they were misled, abjure all other beliefs than ours with words, some that they never understood the horrible articles and never knew that he was David Joris, some that he promoted his sect in many nations until his end, etc. Now at this hour, all proceedings, good and bad, will be proposed before the council; how it will go, you will hear later.</p>
      <p>Now accept this my poor miserable writing; for I do not want more; so Froschauer wants to go on. Given in Basel, April 13, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>I would gladly send you the articles as they appeared to me.</p>
      <p>But, as they have been drawn up and now captured by the state scribe, I have not yet been able to obtain them. To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>G. David the third.</p>
