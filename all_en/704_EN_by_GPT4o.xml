      <p>Greetings. I am finally sending you the books that you have long requested.</p>
      <p>Eusebius is sold for 1 florin and a quarter of a florin. I am also sending a document from the French camp sent to Mr. Sertlinus, which you can read with others and return. All these books that I am sending cost 10 Constance batz, and I could hardly obtain such. Our booksellers have the previous edition, so I sent letters to Strasbourg and obtained what I wanted. Here is some news: Johannes Frede, whom you might know from his writings, has left his position at Sund, which is the first and most magnificent city in Pomerania. "Now," he writes in a letter, "I am at the University of Greifswald teaching law; for the council of Sund had ordered us not to criticize the interim document in sermons, and they added that anyone who did not want to refrain from criticism should move elsewhere. There, I and another good man named Alexius Magnus, when we said we could not in good conscience obey the council's order, were immediately forbidden to ascend the pulpit from that time. Having changed location, I am now at the University of Greifswald. Among us, the same doctrine is preached in all churches as has always been preached until now, and we hope for peace. This doctrine is also preached in all maritime cities. We have very pious princes, so I hope they will never accept anything impious or allow the papacy to be restored in our churches. Among the people of Sund, nothing has changed in doctrine or ceremonies, and they want to appear as anything but Interimists; they say they prohibited criticism of the Interim only because of the danger." So he says.</p>
      <p>From Leipzig, this: "That Sidonius, the supreme bishop of the papists, will soon arrive, elected as the bishop of Merseburg, which is a town located in Meissen. However, that bishopric has an annual income of 30,000 florins. I fear for our schools and churches, although good men still resist in every way against antichristian people. Amsdorff has vehemently published a document against the Pomeranian, in Gotha, which is 11 miles from Leipzig. A meeting of the Magdeburgers was held because of many nobles and princes" etc.</p>
      <p>The church in Strasbourg is still in the same state as it has been for several months; the bishop does not seem to be pressing matters as he had begun. What he will do next, we will hear in due time.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he is waiting for the arrival of the Emperor, who is already on his way to Speyer. In Hungary, certain seeds of war are growing.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is in great leisure, engaged in hunting in Meissen. Disputes are arising among the Wittenberg brothers, which will undoubtedly cause great harm to the churches. I wanted to write to you briefly about these things, more soon.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 10, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor, Bellicanus, Gualther, and the other brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of ZÃ¼rich, his perpetual lord to be respected.</p>
