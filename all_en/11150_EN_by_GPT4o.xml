    <p xml:id="regest1">The endeavor of the popes to limit the rule of kings to worldly matters and to place themselves above them is based on disgraceful affections; according to God's law, the care for religion is the highest duty of the king and is associated with the promise of temporal goods. The exemplary rulers [of the Old Testament] also took care of religion and were rewarded for it. The objections of the Anabaptists should not be heeded; Augustine rightly sees the special task of kings in intervening against false religion, and not only according to the Codex [Justinianus], but even among the Persians and Egyptians, rulers were responsible for religious matters. As a God-anointed king, Henry is therefore called upon to continue to work for the well-being of the Anglican Church in view of God's promise; therefore, Bullinger dedicates this book to him, directed against the enemies of the common faith.</p>

      <p>To the most serene prince Heinrich VIII, King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, Prince of Wales and Cornwall, Defender of the Catholic Faith, and Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England, grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>If, according to the judgments of the wise, nothing is to be believed by a grieving mind, undoubtedly no faith should be placed in a greater emotional obligation. But what emotions, most serene king, do you find more severe than love, desire, avarice, and ambition? It is certain that those who have seized the book of God's law for themselves from the popes, leaving only the book of political laws and the sword to the kings, are distracted by such perverse affections. For what else did they intend with their most cunning scheme than to place themselves above kings in the highest rank and to exercise a divine dictatorship over them? Who does not see the shameful desire in this? Who does not notice the disgraceful and even monstrous ambition, not to mention avarice, a disgraceful crime? Therefore, if anything else seems suspect and unworthy of faith due to more serious affections, it must be false without controversy that it is said to pertain to the ministry of bishops in matters of religion or spiritual affairs, and to the administration of kings in lower judgments, namely the care of temporal matters and the right of the sword. For the first and foremost thing that pertains to the care of kings is religion and faith. There is a law of God promulgated on this matter in these words: "When the king sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law written for himself in a book, from the priests and Levites, and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and to observe all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them, and not to turn aside from my commandments to the right or to the left, that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children" [Deuteronomy 17:18-20]. "The priests and Levites," he says, "shall not keep my law for themselves alone, but shall also present it to the king as the executor and guardian of the laws." But in the law, not only is it commanded concerning temporal matters, but also the care of religion. Therefore, it is added: "And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it" [Deuteronomy 17:19]. As if to say: "It is not that he should only receive it or keep it closed with him, but he must read in it." For what purpose, I ask? "That he may learn to fear God and keep all my words and statutes." Therefore, God requires fear, that is, complete and true religion from kings. He requires that they observe and cause to be observed all the words and statutes of the law. Since these include, indeed are the first, the heads of religion, the book of the law and the care of religion certainly pertain to kings, not only the book of human laws and the right of the sword. What is more, he requires not just any, but an absolute and most moderate care of religion and says: "He shall not turn aside from my commandments to the right or to the left" [Deuteronomy 17:20], signifying that kings must be religious with just reason. For one goes to the left when all religion is neglected, to the right when it is turned into superstition. Indeed, to arouse more spirit and diligence in kings, he adds the most ample promise of temporal things: longevity, a happy offspring, and a durable kingdom.</p>
      <p>The same law is repeated in almost the same words and commended to the prince Joshua. Among other things, it is said to him: "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will act wisely" [Joshua 1:8]. The examples of the most holy princes, especially Gideon, the renowned hero, who, as soon as he was called by God to power, immediately overthrew foreign religions and initiated his kingdom with the purification of faith, are relevant here. Then, indeed, about to fight for the assertion of the people and liberty, he took up the sword. There is no need to mention David and Solomon, as they were most diligent in caring for religions. Of Jehoshaphat, the most glorious king, the sacred history reports: "And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David and did not seek Baalim, but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments. And the Lord established the kingdom in his hand, and all who were in Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and glory in abundance. And he set his heart on the ways of the Lord and removed the high places and groves from Judah, and in the third year of his reign he sent his princes to care for the teaching of the law of God in the cities, and with them he sent Levites. And they taught in Judah, having with them the book of the divine law, and went around all the cities and taught the people, and the fear of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they did not fight against Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat went on and grew to the highest degree" [2 Chronicles 17:3-10, 12]. Behold, most holy king, that glorious prince of God cares for religion above all. For he removes the foreign worship of God and restores the true one. For this reason, he sends out teachers or preachers, adds to them princes who protect against violence and assist in demolishing and restoring religions. By this diligence and effort, he won God's favor, so that now all the neighboring kings, driven by God's power, feared him, and his subjects willingly brought gifts. For by diligent and pious care of religion, kings prepare for themselves authority, invincible strength, just obedience, firm peace, and immortal glory. Those who have taken away the care of religion from the administration of kings have defrauded the holy princes of this.</p>
      <p>Nor do I think that the disturbers of affairs, the Anabaptists, the most destructive pest of evangelical truth, should be listened to here. For Isaiah, speaking in chapter 49 about the matters of the Church of Christ and the calling of the nations, among other things, says: "Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations and set up my standard to the peoples, and they shall bring your sons (O Church or prince of the Church) in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders. And kings shall be your foster fathers and their queens your nursing mothers; they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth and lick up the dust of your feet" [Isaiah 49:22-23], that is, they shall worship. Therefore, most religiously, Saint Augustine, the Catholic doctor, citing that from the Psalms: "And now, O kings, serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling" [Psalm 2:10-11], says: "How do kings serve the Lord with fear unless by prohibiting and punishing with religious severity those things that are done against the Lord's commands? For he serves in one way because he is a man, in another way because he is also a king. Because he is a man, he serves by living faithfully. Because he is also a king, he serves by sanctioning with appropriate vigor laws that command just things and prohibit contrary things. As Hezekiah served by destroying the groves and temples of idols and those high places that were built against God's commands. As Josiah served by doing the same things himself. [...] In this way, therefore, kings serve the Lord, [...] when they do those things to serve him that cannot be done except by kings." These are the words of Augustine. Today, there are many laws in the imperial code made by the most holy and Christian kings for the orthodox faith and religion against superstition and impiety. It seems relevant here that among the ancients, kings were also priests. The king of the Persians, when he reached the age of 14, was handed over to tutors.</p>
      <p>They were chosen from among the Persians, and there were four of the wisest, most just, most temperate, and most courageous men, of whom the first taught the magic of Zoroaster, not indeed that impious and superstitious one, but that which taught the worship of God and royal institutions. The second advised that he should be truthful in all his life.</p>
      <p>The third, that he should not be overcome by any desire, so that he might become accustomed to living freely and truly ruling over those things within himself, serving no one. The fourth finally made him fearless and intrepid, so that he might never become a servant by fearing anything. The author of this is Plato in Alcibiades. I think the same applies to the Egyptians, who represented the image of a prince by painting an eye with a scepter, signifying that wisdom in divine and human matters is required in a prince, and that a wise and pious prince in the kingdom is what the eye is in the body. Therefore, it is confirmed not so much by divine as by human law that the primary duty of kings is to be religious and to care for religion accurately and above all.</p>
      <p>Now, since the Lord has chosen you, O most powerful king, and anointed you over his people, you understand what is fitting for you and what needs to be done. You are a king, therefore you are the father of the country. You are the head of the kingdom, therefore you will be wise for yourself and the kingdom. You are the soul of the English body, therefore you will animate your people to the duties of a holy life. You are the eye, the sun, and the light of the Anglican Church, therefore, rescuing the church redeemed by the blood of Christ from the jaws of the Antichrist, you will illuminate it with the word of Christ, with superstition overthrown and true religion restored. You have begun the work of Christ beautifully, it succeeds excellently through the grace of the Lord, you proceed fearlessly in the hope of God's promises.</p>
      <p>Those who desire the glory of Christ to be promoted pray for you and your kingdom and help you laboring for the gifts given to them by the Lord. For this reason, I have also dedicated these books to your name, O most Christian king, which I have written against your enemies and the enemies of the common faith concerning the word of God and the institution and function of the ministers of the word of God. I pray, however, your clemency, most merciful king, that you consider my work favorably. I think there is nothing contained in these that is contrary to the orthodox faith. Moreover, I present these always with the judgment of the orthodox church intact and inviolate. May the Lord Jesus keep you, along with the newly born prince, safe for a long time for the kingdom and his church.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, in the month of March, in the year of the Lord's incarnation 1538. Your Majesty's most devoted H. Bullinger.</p>
