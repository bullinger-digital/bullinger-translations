      <p>Greetings. I had no doubt about the letters, that you would have faithfully ensured what was your duty, that they would be safely delivered to me. However, that Jew deceived, or at least did not fulfill what you hoped.</p>
      <p>He finally came to us, but complained that he had been robbed in Freiburg, and could not assert anything certain about the letters. Since the situation here did not offer what he desired, he crossed over to England. I warned him that things there were turbulent and tried to dissuade him from his intention: yet I achieved nothing. But let him fare well.</p>
      <p>The kingdom itself rightly makes us anxious, indeed torments us. What will become of such a great multitude of the pious, who have gone into voluntary exile from there, and also of the many natives who have already embraced Christ? Unless the Lord miraculously intervenes from heaven, there is a danger that we may soon hear the most sorrowful news. The same rumor about Reginald Pole is also prevalent here. However, because I have always heard that the beast who now holds the kingdom is most arrogant and equally cruel: sometimes this divination creeps upon me, that it might be possible for her audacity to bring her down: you know that nation is spirited. She will eventually be hostile to almost everyone. If she attempts to change the state recklessly, there will be not a few who will oppose her.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the church of God will be miserably tossed about, as if in various storms. Therefore, as you say, let us commend such confused disturbances to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Soon our senate will send the doctrines of Servetus there, to understand your judgment about them. Although we protest, they cause you this trouble, but they have reached such madness and fury, that whatever we say is suspect to them. Therefore, if I were to say that the south shines, they would immediately begin to doubt. More from our brother Dr. Gwalter. For since many are present, whom I found at my home upon returning from lunch, I am forced to make an end. Farewell then, most distinguished man, and brother to me in the Lord, to be honored. Greet your fellow ministers and sons-in-law, and the whole family. May Christ keep you all, govern you, and bless you. Amen. My colleagues send you many greetings, all very sad. Geneva, September 7, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of the Lord Jesus Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and fellow minister.</p>
