      <p>Greetings. I recently forgot to write to you, most illustrious man, about the elder Antonio Cognetio. He recently fled with two others, one a Frenchman and the other unknown to me, while his teacher Philipp was ill; I do not know whether he incited them or they incited him, or if they all incited each other. Certainly, Philipp, an excellent young man, or anyone else gave him no reason. He behaved very badly here in the end. As gladly as I would keep the other with Philipp, it was certain that because of Antonio, unless he had fled, I would have dismissed them all. The boy is frivolous, fierce, and will be bloodthirsty unless he changes his nature; he thinks that because of his nobility he is allowed everything; he has been instilled by I don't know whom that no one is noble who is not ready for revenge and slaughter. Often rebuked by me, he seemed to be moved as much as a stone.</p>
      <p>He never wanted to obey his teacher in anything without murmuring or insult while I was watching, from which I infer what he was accustomed to do in my absence. I hope well for the younger one, but very badly for him; for he hates piety so much that he never allowed himself to be driven to prayers, indeed he often laughed at us while we were praying. Therefore, I write this so that you may excuse the excellent young man Philipp when the opportunity arises, so that he is not thought to have provided the reason for his departure.</p>
      <p>I frankly confess that I have erred more by leniency than by severity... May God bless you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erastus.</p>
      <p>To the most virtuous and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed like a father.</p>
