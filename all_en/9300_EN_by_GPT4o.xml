      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, dear brother, that I am performing a duty pleasing to you by writing to you again through such reliable men. I do not doubt that you have received my letters enclosed with Mr. Haller's, written by me on April 24th, regarding the upcoming assembly on May 3rd in Baden. Now I add to them what the most distinguished men, Mr. Beza and Mr. Hotman, have sent to me, so that you may share them with the faithful. The fact that I receive no letters from you, I attribute to the decree of the judges, which prohibits anyone from writing about the current controversial matters of the Rhaetians to foreign places. You are doing the right thing; be careful not to fall into the hands of slanderers and accusers. The snow, unusual cold, and severe frost have destroyed the vineyards, trees, and almost stripped us of the hope of crops far and wide. May the Lord have mercy on us! No one can express how great the lament of the wretched is; meanwhile, few refer these things to our sins and demerits, thinking of repentance. Therefore, they lament more impotently. May the Lord enlighten our hearts and preserve us, who live in the most calamitous age of all and among the most miserable of men. Come, Lord Jesus, and deliver us!</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your family and fellow ministers, Mr. Campell and the rest of our good friends and companions.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 27, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
