      <p>There is frequent talk among our people about not only your humanity, but also that of all the orders and the entire republic towards the English, who stayed there at that time due to the change in religion. I consider it not only humanity, but hospitality that is especially pleasing to God, approved by men, and never to be forgotten in the memory of our people. As for me, if I can offer anything to you, to the pious, or to your republic, I promise to be ready to do so, so that the eagerness of a grateful mind and the desire to return the favor may appear evident; although for other reasons as well, I owe so much to you, D. Bibliander, D. Bernardino, as I should owe to learned, pious friends who have deserved well of the Church of Christ. Therefore, this praise is not only praiseworthy in itself, but also more admirable when compared with the savagery of others. For I do not think it is unknown to you that those who want the body of Christ to be everywhere, in no way allowed the members of Christ to be anywhere, whom they harassed with all kinds of savagery and brutality: so that with the absurdity of the opinions they have absorbed, they also seize a certain harshness of manners and a beastly ferocity against the gentle children of God. But if the truths of opinions are judged by their fruits, and there is as much difference between opinions as there is in Christian life, then indeed they should have long since been convinced to depart from such a stubborn opinion. But about the stupor of those people another time, whose blinded mind may God illuminate with the light of His Spirit, and lead from such thick darkness of error to a better perception of truth and a milder agreement of minds.</p>
      <p>I hear that Ignatius has been sent to you there, to be translated and printed, which I think is advisable for certain reasons. I had seen him in Augsburg, and had noted some places where the name of the mass was mentioned, and he speaks about the wives of the Apostles. I ask you, D. Bullinger, and I urge again and again, to ensure that the Greek book is printed along with the translation: for it is of great interest to the learned to read the author himself in his own language, especially where serious and controversial matters are to be weighed. I never read a translation without seeking the author himself as if he were the explainer of the translation.</p>
      <p>Would that the author were not only seen in this, but also in all other cases, and that it had been done in Procopius. It would have removed the suspicion of many things, which seem to have been injected by the one who translated, where some Hebrew and Latin matters are discussed by a Greek man, unskilled in these languages. But now translations are so imposed, the authors themselves are discarded, that this necessary inconvenience follows, which the papists object to us in the Eucharist, [Greek]. Therefore, if you ensure that good authors, who are committed to letters and types, are printed either with translations, as D. Gesner took care to do rightly in Stobaeus and others, or even separately, if it is better so, so that translations are not sold and the authors themselves perish; you will bring great and many benefits to both the present and future age. You see how familiarly I address you: forgive me; I was only thinking of greeting you, discussing humanity towards our people, and when Ignatius and other writers whom we have been deprived of came to my mind, I could not help but commend the cause of the authors to you, and almost pray in their name, that you do not allow them to speak as if through interpreters, when they would gladly be seen and heard by many in their own language, and be vindicated from the injury of destruction, which is accustomed to follow the Greeks. I am in your power: if there is anything in which I can be useful to you, command me. I ask you to say the same to D. Bibliander and D. Bernardino in my name: would that the opportunity were given to me, that I might satisfy them by fulfilling my promises. Please greet D. Pellican, the good old man, D. Rudolf Gwalther, D. Konrad Gesner, and especially your wife. May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg. March 12, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your friend and brother in Christ, John Cheke.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man and faithful minister of the Church of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
