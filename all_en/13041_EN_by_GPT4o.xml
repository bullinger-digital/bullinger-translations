    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received three letters from Vadian [No. 2975, No. 2983, and No. 2989 from August 1, 10, and 12] and is particularly grateful for the last one, the letter delivered by Franziskus Studer. Although he had already received the documents [concerning Prague] delivered by Studer through other friends, he greatly appreciates Vadian's faithful helpfulness. He is now sending everything back. For his part, Vadian should please return the documents that Bullinger lent him [with a letter not received] through one of his own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The shooting festival has started well. Decent and interesting people came from most parts of the Confederation, including many from Bern, many from Zug, Glarus, Basel, and Schaffhausen, 35 from Lucerne, 15 from Solothurn, and several from Schwyz. All these places sent council delegates and their own musicians, who brought their silver badges. It is also noticeable that the visitors mainly came to establish friendly relations. Urner and Unterwaldner are still expected. No one has traveled from Freiburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, 300 citizens armed with firearms and pikes paraded in honor of the visitors. Today, the first shooting competition was held. The people from Appenzell, St. Gallen, the area of the St. Gallen Abbey, and from Konstanz were the first to compete, as they were drawn first. Schwyz and Zug are next in line. Bullinger hopes for much good from this event. People are treating each other very kindly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] God's blessing! On the Ascension Day of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Bullinger has specifically tasked the current student [...] with returning the transmitted documents [to Prague] so that Vadian will also be inclined to provide him with such documents in the future.</p>

      <p>S. D. I have received three letters from your kindness, most esteemed man, for which I am immensely grateful to you, especially for the ones you sent last through Studer, who delivered everything in good faith. Although I had already received all those documents from friends before, I commend your faithfulness and diligence and express my deepest thanks; I am returning everything in good faith. As for the documents you received that need to be returned to me, please send them back to me through one of your own, and farewell forever.</p>

      <p>The shooting festival has started very well. It is a very honorable and beautiful gathering of people from most parts of the Confederation. Bern has many people, Lucerne 35, Schwyz a good number, Zug many, Glarus many, Basel many, Solothurn 15, Schaffhausen many. All these have sent their council delegates, their own musicians, very beautifully equipped with the cities' and cantons' silver badges. They also show that they have come more to make friendships than for other matters. People from Uri and Unterwalden are still expected; it is said that some of them are also coming. No one from Freiburg, etc.</p>
