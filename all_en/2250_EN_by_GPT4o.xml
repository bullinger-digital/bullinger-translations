      <p>Greetings. I received the letters you wrote to me on the penultimate day of March, along with the letters from Travers and Brenz.</p>
      <p>Indeed, you always do what befits a humane and friendly man. Relying on this, I dare to shamelessly take advantage of your virtue; for I am sending you some money to be sent to Basel for the students, specifically fourteen Portuguese ducats, two crowns, and two thalers. I would not be so importunate as to burden you with such matters (I know who you are); but I am compelled, as there is no one there whom I know. The letters added to that money instruct to whom they should be delivered. I have also written to my son there and to the deputies for my son. Furthermore, I am sending letters written to Vergerius, knowing that you will send them to him. The people of Surselva in the Engadin persist in their good undertaking. The king's envoy here, the Lord of Bayonne, has requested soldiers. A meeting is called in Davos on the sixth day of April; however, it is not known where he wishes to lead us.</p>
      <p>He affirms that the king wishes well to the Confederates above all others and will therefore not lead us to a worse place. We hear nothing from Italy.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen the English and German brothers. That harlot (the Catholic Church) is not yet sated with the blood of the saints. Farewell in the Lord Jesus and continue to love your Philippus. Commander, Pontisella, and Tschernerus send you their respectful greetings. From Chur, on the 3rd of April, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your integrity, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all the pious. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
