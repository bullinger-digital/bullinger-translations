      <p>S. I owe you great thanks, my venerable Bullinger, for your recent letters sent to me, in which you also informed me about the hereditary rights of your city and the legitimate successions of heirs, as I had requested from you. I am sending back that part of your letter from which a doubt arose for me, which I would like you to remove, and please return this fragment of your letters to me soon. I was very surprised that in this matter you do not agree with the people of Bern, Basel, or even with written law, which in all such matters seems to have established everything based on reasons of natural equity. Meanwhile, I am not unaware of how much custom prevails here.</p>
      <p>Regarding new matters, nothing so certain is written to me by friends that is free from doubt, since hardly anything can be written for certain in these turbulent times of human affairs, where things that are now announced as certain and sometimes are certain, soon change into another form, altering the subject for the writer, so that not only different but sometimes contrary accounts of events occur.</p>
      <p>Thus, what was recently written from England, not of bad omen by some good and truly worthy men, to equally good and trustworthy men, is now again being written as overturned by the most impious Athaliah's efforts, about which there is no need to write to you now, who could have learned all these things both sooner and more accurately than I. Let us implore the King of heaven and earth, Jesus Christ, with perpetual and supplicating prayers, that He may graciously be present with some most immediate remedy to these, however deplorable, affairs of England and mightily assist, lest the kingdom, recently illuminated by such a great light of truth, be entirely occupied again by the prince of the world, who is the father of lies. Indeed, we too, warned and terrified by such a horrendous example, must be very careful, lest, if we persist so stubbornly in ingratitude, this most splendid kingdom of Christ be taken away from us as well, and this dry wood be consumed by the flames of divine vengeance with less effort than that green one.</p>
      <p>I am very glad about the grace restored again, previously severed for some unknown reasons, among the people of Ulm, as you write.</p>
      <p>We wish your brother Germano firm and truly robust health, unless the Lord sees otherwise. Meanwhile, we know, with the confidence he has towards God through Christ, that his inner man is being renewed day by day, the more the outer man is corrupted according to his condition, until he too is conformed to the glorious body of Christ. Farewell, my dearest and at the same time venerable Bullinger, with your whole household and all your dear ones. Greet all your fellow ministers and assistants in the work of the Lord reverently. My Funck, who is now taking his little wife to Baden, from where he will take care to deliver these to you, sends you very honorable greetings.</p>
      <p>Fuchs, Valerius, etc., also send their greetings. Commend us diligently to the Lord, to whom I wish we could prove our ministry as is fitting, being vigilant in His house, which is the church of the living God, but alas, torn, scattered, and utterly disordered, since in such a pitiable manner all discipline has ceased in it, for the happy restoration of which I see that your work and that of men like you is greatly needed, to whom I wholeheartedly wish that the Lord may grant the spirit of His counsel and zeal, so that they may desire and strive for it with all their might, and also successfully accomplish what they strive for, which unless done promptly, I foresee that soon our Germany, indeed most cultivated with the gifts of the Lord but meanwhile most ungrateful, will fare worse than Sodom of old.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, my soul. July 5, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and by far dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
