      <p>Pious, honorable, and etc. (?) especially gracious lord, my willing service and all good things be with you beforehand.</p>
      <p>I would not have written to you if this little letter had not come to me this week from the Bündner (Grisons) with the request that I should send it to you, which I hereby do. Otherwise, I have nothing at all, beyond what I sent to you 8 days ago; I hope everything has been well received by you.</p>
      <p>However, it is written from Chur that the rebels have set fire to and burned down the castle of Ramosch belonging to the bishop.</p>
      <p>As soon as this news arrived, my lords sent it down to Baden; only tomorrow will the messengers depart. Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus are to ride to the Bündner (Grisons) in the name of all the Confederates to mediate; may God grant that much will be resolved and all will be well. I know nothing more at this time.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 9th of March, in the year 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable lord Joachim Bäldi, former Landammann (chief magistrate) of Glarus, my gracious, dear lord. Glarus.</p>
