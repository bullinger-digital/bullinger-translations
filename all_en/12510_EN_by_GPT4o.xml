    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer should confidentially forward the enclosed letter [No. 2464] to [Georg Fr√∂lich] in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Bishop of Lund and Roskilde [Johann von Weeze] spent several weeks in the Five Places, where he consecrated and confirmed. However, it is feared that he had evil intentions and incited the [Catholic places] to show opposition to the Schmalkaldic League and to provide mercenaries to the Pope [Paul III.] to protect the old faith and suppress the new one. However, nothing is known for certain. On [June 10], von Weeze stayed overnight in Zurich while passing through. Some councilors dined with him at the inn as usual, but achieved nothing. He pretended to be not entirely satisfied with King [Ferdinand] and Emperor [Charles V.] because they wanted to appoint a count in Reichenau. All pure deception!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Blarer should not trust the Emperor [Charles V.]. Furthermore, he should keep Bullinger informed, which he will also do in return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The participants at the [Council] of Trent are not to be trusted; they will not rest until it comes to war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger is working on his commentary on Luke, which is being printed section by section. He is currently at the third chapter of the ninth book. Blarer should excuse him for writing less frequently as a result.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- He should admonish the letter carriers from Constance to be willing. Bullinger does compensate them.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I earnestly ask you to confidentially forward this letter to the city clerk in Augsburg and ensure that it is delivered. It is somewhat important to us.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, know that the Bishop of Lund and Roskilde has been in the Five Places for several weeks. There he consecrated and confirmed. However, many honest people are concerned that he has engaged in strange practices, yet at least turned the places away so that they are less inclined to join the Schmalkaldic League, perhaps providing mercenaries to the Pope to protect the old faith and suppress the new one. Nothing certain is known. However, people do not think well of it. One cannot trust the people at all, for they behave accordingly. When he passed through Zurich, he arrived on a Thursday night, never left the inn, and hurried away in the morning. Some councilors dined with him and, as is customary, presented gifts, but left everything to the nearest. He acted as if he was not well satisfied with the kings and emperors, and how they wanted to appoint a count in Reichenau, which was unpleasant to him, etc. All pure deception.</p>

      <p>Dear friend, be careful not to trust the Emperor too much and take precautions. Always let me know how things stand; I will do the same for you. I could not write more at this time.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Those at the Council of Trent are deceitful rascals; they will not rest until they draw the sword from the sheath. One finds that they think and speak: as long as they do not leave it in the sheath, they are not unfit to separate!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am now writing on Luke and what I have written is being printed simultaneously. I am now in chapter 9 of the third book. Therefore, you will forgive me for writing less frequently until now.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Zurich, June 18, 1546.</p>
      <p>Dear friend, speak to the matter when your couriers come here, and I would gladly give them a letter, that they may be willing and obliging. I do not ask this for nothing.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, and faithful Master Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Constance, his beloved lord.</p>
