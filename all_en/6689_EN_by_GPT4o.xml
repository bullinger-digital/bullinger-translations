      <p>S. I have read your letters, dearest Bullinger, which you also sent to Ehem and Erastus, our mutual friends. From these, I have abundantly recognized your dedication and concern for us, which you can be entirely sure is pleasing to our prince, something he himself will soon testify with a brief argument; for now, he is absent for an entire month in Saxony, staying with his sons-in-law, whom he is trying to reconcile as they are in disagreement. I have not yet decided what I should think about the diet (assembly). As far as I can infer from slight indications, I see that the Emperor is currently only thinking about money and will ask for it from the estates. He might propose the matter of religion, but, compelled by the difficulty of the matter, he will defer it to another time. The new pope, as I hear, promises him much, following the custom of his predecessors. I greatly approve of your decision to dedicate the Books of Kings, illustrated with the commentaries of Martyr and Wolf, to our prince, and I plainly encourage you to do so. Since you have asked us to provide some reasons for the dedication, I have written down certain points at the urging of Erastus, from which you can insert into the dedication whatever seems suitable to you; they are not courtly or born from flattery (from which I entirely recoil as from a most harmful plague), which I testify and share with you here in the presence of the Lord, yet I would not want them to be spread; for you know the condition I endure. However, we are not free from vices, which we both acknowledge and ask the Lord for forgiveness. Briefly, I entrust what has been noted to your prudence; for I was not allowed to arrange them in order due to other business; I wrote these as they came to mind. Pick from them what pleases you, or consign them to Vulcan (destroy them). Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet Gwalther, Wolf, Simler, Haller, and Lavater in my name with due respect. Heidelberg, February 14, in the year 66.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Stephan Zirler, secretary. To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the Church of Zurich, his much-esteemed and respected friend, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
