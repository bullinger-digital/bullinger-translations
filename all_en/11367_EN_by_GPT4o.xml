    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for his comforting letter [No. 1321]. The situation of the [Basel] church has further deteriorated, as the now unassailable rhetorician [Karlstadt] and the circles supporting him apparently want to devalue the pastoral office; Myconius considers it his duty, as a preacher, to denounce vices, while the former expounds on biblical geography in his sermons on Joshua. He is grateful for the news about [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa and fears that, due to the tarnished reputation of Basel, he will no longer receive letters. He is pleased that the rumor about a conflict between Kaspar [Megander] and Bullinger was false. He is well-disposed towards [Adam] Frey. His wife [Margret] is ill. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Although the Lord consoles us excellently, we nevertheless gladly and with great joy receive consolation from the pious. Therefore, I wish this to be as frequent as possible; it is not the case that one can uplift another here with a single word. The church lies in ruins; as I lamented, it is utterly overthrown. The Word is still free, but I fear that it may soon be taken away; for the aim of the entire temptation was to give the wicked freedom to speak from the pulpit. They used this man for that purpose. About whom, lest I say more, he is one of those to whom the prophet's words pertain: "Speak pleasing things." He is so diligent that I cannot believe any other aim is set. Today a good man came to me with these words: "We must be careful not to offend this man; for he has such authority among his people that, if he had killed a man, he would have gotten away with it." Indeed, I think this madness must be overcome with patience. Soon another song (or with the Lord suggesting) will be sung. After such a long struggle, it has been achieved that the ministry is despised. I do not know if that was sought; indeed, I know nothing else was sought. They have what they sought, and yet they run to my sermons except for a few, whom I certainly do not wish to be counted among mine. What they want, I plainly do not understand.</p>
      <p>They hear the old Myconius and are even more diligent in correcting vices than before. To suffer evil rather than endure the injustice of men, as much as is in me, I prefer. It is enough that I sin myself; I cannot bear the sins of others; thus duty commands, and they fight against the precepts of God and dishonor His name.</p>
      <p>What about him? In recent days he preached how the land was divided among the Jews by Joshua; he spent two days on this exaggeration. Christians ought to know this, but after geography and cosmography teach it, even these arts are necessary for a Christian. Thus he consoles consciences in the Lord during this miserable tempest. May the Lord give him a good heart and a sound mind, which I sincerely pray for.</p>
      <p>What you write about Barbarossa, it is amazing how pleasing it was; there is so little news here. I believe the bad reputation about us deters pious and friendly men from writing. I beg you, do not be deterred as well.</p>
      <p>I had heard about the dissension in our house; the one who told me is from your preachers, if I know correctly; I do not know the name. He said that Kaspar wanted to abolish many things that Zwingli had instituted, you resisted and had fewer supporters than the other, and I do not know what else. I am glad the rascal, whoever he is, lied.</p>
      <p>I am indeed well-disposed towards Phrygioni; may the Lord be present in his cause, if he acts in it. My wife is gravely ill; you will pray to the Lord for both of us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ the Lord. Greet Pellican and Theodor. Basel, hastily, October 29, 1539.</p>
      <p>Os. Myconius, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed Antistes of Zurich, in the Lord.</p>
