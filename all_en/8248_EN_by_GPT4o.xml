      <p>Even though I have not received any letters from you this week, most esteemed lord, I still consider it my duty to trouble you with letters whenever the opportunity arises. First, I am sending you serious letters that we have received from elsewhere, which may bring you much new information. Then, if the gods please, I have judged it necessary to describe the piety of our people to you. You know that Mr. Rhetian not long ago, along with other Rhaetian syndics, held the Baden assembly; however, I do not know what he secretly conspired with the Pagans, neighbors of the Mesolcina Valley, in Baden. For soon after he returned to Rhaetia, letters were written in the name of the Upper League to the Mesolcina Valley, granting the power and commission to the leaders of that place to expel all exiles.</p>
      <p>They named certain individuals in their own name, whom they should drive out as quickly as possible without any delay, and among them, they included Mr. Beccaria and Mr. Giovanni Antonio Viscari or Dranton. The reasons they give for the expulsion are the complaints and orders of the five Pagans, which must be obeyed if they wish to preserve the peace and tranquility of the country. Therefore, they should see to it that they obey and expel the aforementioned without any hesitation. Our most esteemed consul was asked whether he had heard anything about this complaint in Baden, and he replied that the whole matter was unknown to him. From this, it is inferred that this is a clandestine agreement. Mr. Giovanni Viscari appeared in the senate of this city and obtained letters to the Upper League, advising them not to rashly decide anything against the exiles, remembering the privileges and security with which they were once honored by common votes. The same Mr. Giovanni Antonio Viscari has now lived in that valley for 16 years, acting as a private tutor and preacher, living an unblemished life and bringing much fruit from his labors in those border areas, which the papists and malevolent people now seek to hinder with these arts and to afflict those who have deserved well with such cruelty. The senate of Davos also wrote in the name of the Ten Jurisdictions, urging the Upper League not to lightly attempt to rescind the ancient diplomas, of which Viscari has three. We will hear soon what they intend to do; for today, Viscari presents letters of recommendation to the League, which is little allied to our faith, at Trun, where the leaders and magnates meet. - While these matters were being reported in the senate, a new calamity wounded our ears. For the praetor of Poschiavo came with some exiles, whom the Bishop of Brescia, as Mr. Pergula Tiranus wrote to me, expelled from the village of Gardone for the sake of religion, from which they are called Gardonese. They fled directly to the village of Tirano in the Valtellina, which is governed by the praetor Jacobus Planta, a citizen of Chur. There, when they began to practice their craft of artillery preparation, the praetor, driven by the requests or arguments of some from the community, ordered them to leave the borders of Rhaetia, citing some burdens, which they would be troubled with if they were to receive any passersby, although Mr. Pergula and many other very wealthy people are ready to vouch and satisfy for them with several thousand crowns, if they had fled for any other reason or were to be a burden to anyone. But why should they receive new ones when they are trying to expel the old ones? They also obtained letters of admonition to the president of Tirano, not to attempt anything against them, but to tolerate them until such matters are more fully decided in future assemblies. - The third thing I decided to write, I learned at this very hour, as I was writing this. Mr. standard-bearer Mr. Baptista from Pero came to me, for whose cause you have faithfully labored with your most esteemed senate, and showed some examples of letters written by Conradin Planta to the pope, to the supreme leader of the papal guard, and to the emperor, as well as to the son of Mr. Rhetian, the dean, who recently left here for Rome. The pope is asked to be an assistant in redeeming the goods of the Perons; the others are solicited to press the pope. Thus, what the Perons could perhaps have done with greater success, they neglect, and persuaded by these servants of the pope, they consider it advisable to deal with the pope alone on this matter, so that such wounds, which are inflicted on us against all laws, are not revealed to the people. Thus, those cunning ones always provide excellent service to the popes and most diligently ensure that the incarnate Roman devil is not offended in any matter. Thus, our people in Rhaetia, imbued and educated by the work of the good brothers concerning the cause of the Perons and others, would have achieved whatever they wished without any trouble, if only they had proposed it. The communities of the Valtellina have also ceased from their complaints about the extortion of the praetors being revealed to the people; for some have persuaded the peasants that the matter would be of such great expense that they would hardly be able to bear it. - Our bookseller was ordered by the senate to leave the city unless he renounced the heresies of Anabaptism and Schwenckfeldianism within eight days. He had a son born to him these days, whom he did not want to ask me to baptize. Finally, he came and asked me to baptize him in the way Christ commanded in Matthew 28, that is, as an adult and understanding the doctrine of faith.</p>
      <p>But with this, he did not satisfy the senate, before whom he was not ashamed to declare that he did not recognize our baptismal rite as Christian. He has seduced many into Schwenckfeldianism so far, openly saying that Christ is not a creature, urging this plausible reasoning: a creature is not to be worshipped; Christ is to be worshipped: therefore, Christ is not a creature. Such a man, extremely rash and shameless, has been tolerated so far, whom Mr. Fabricius and Mr. Philippus, our predecessors, publicly convicted of error. The bookseller, however, returned to his vomit and joined Schwenckfeldianism to his former error; thus he corrected his former error. He has a wife who has never entered our churches in four years, and yet no one has been found so far to bring her to a better way of life.</p>
      <p>But to finally stop troubling you, I am sending what news from Italy, printed in Italian, has reached us, which Mr. Müller can conveniently translate for your pleasure and use.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, May 1, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your dominion and excellence's most devoted Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>Mr. consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Charles, who again urges and desires to be instructed by your letters, greet your excellence; whether doctors are also created in the profession in Basel and what kind; for he has a relative with a certain abbot not unfavorably disposed to our religion, who wishes to promote it, and that in Basel for less expense. You would do Mr. Charles a great favor if you once judged him worthy of your letters; he is called Charles von Hochenbalchen, lord of Haldenstein and Aspermont, etc.</p>
      <p>I most dutifully bid Mr. Müller and Mr. Ernius farewell. To the most esteemed man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary and most vigilant antistes of the church of Zurich, his lord and father, to be honored with singular reverence.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
