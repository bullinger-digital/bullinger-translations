    <p xml:id="regest1">The gifted [Johannes] Haller was heard, examined, and found suitable in [Augsburg]; he should bring his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and his [child Agnes to Augsburg] as soon as possible, because many [Augsburgers] highly value his sermons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- To prevent their interest [in Haller] from cooling due to an overly long delay and to give Haller's enemies no opportunity to scheme, Haller should hasten his return journey; Bullinger should urge him to do so. Keller, for his part, will make an effort to ensure that Haller's reputation among the good does not diminish and that the wicked cannot harm him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller will have noticed himself how much Keller, who returned from Kaufbeuren, appreciates him. Therefore, there is no reason to fear [Wolfgang Musculus, Wolfgang Rehlinger, Bucer, and Luther], even if they bring forth [countless] slanders against the enthusiasts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The rest will be reported in detail by [Georg Frölich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger's affection for Keller should not diminish. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We release Haller, a young man adorned with many gifts, who was heard and thoroughly examined here, to bring his wife and family under the condition that, after settling his affairs, he will return here as soon as possible. For it can hardly be expressed how many pious people, indeed the greater part of the church, are held by the desire to hear him due to his pleasant speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, so that their fervor does not cool due to a long delay, and to prevent those for whom true religion is not only not dear but who, for the sake of some ill-disposed towards the professed and confessed truth (and who have sworn allegiance to them), from plotting deceit and laying traps against him, urge Haller, I say, to hasten his return. Meanwhile, I will do my utmost to ensure that his authority among the sincere is not diminished and that the conceived hatred of impostors against him does not take root.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>For Haller is not only entirely mine due to your pious and true recommendation, but also highly commended to me for his pious and learned education and integrity of character. I have no doubt that he himself has tasted this with no slight evidence after my return from Kaufbeuren. Therefore, we will not easily fear mice, dormice, cats, and even unclean otters, even if they are about to hurl six hundred insults at the enthusiasts. Meanwhile, these will harm us as much as flea bites. Although their darts may threaten us with death, the shield of evangelical truth will skillfully deflect them from us. Let them write, let them rewrite, and, if it pleases the gods, let them even reveal their absurdities to the world; they will perhaps have those who will respond to these sweet little men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will learn the rest more fully from our Laetus, which I will now gladly omit. I beg you, as you have begun, to continue to pursue your Michael with mutual love, and to greet all the brothers and fellow ministers on my behalf.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Augsburg, January 4th, in the year 1546, at the Annenses. Your most devoted brother in the Lord,</p>
      <p>M. Keller.</p>
