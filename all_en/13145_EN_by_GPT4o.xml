    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Jesus, the Savior of this world, grant that the new year may begin well and end even better for Vadian and his household!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Alexius] Knoblauch did not deliver Vadian's letter and came by three times afterward to inquire if Bullinger had a letter for Vadian. However, there was nothing to report at that time, and Bullinger also did not have the time for it. Vadian should therefore forgive his silence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Zurich council has complied with the request of the St. Gallen council and has written to the fellow believer Jean Merveilleux [in Neuch창tel]. He will ensure that both letters, that of the St. Gallen and that of the Zurich council, reach King Henry II of France as quickly as possible. The world is full of spies and traitors! Bullinger feels sorry for the good merchant [Octavien Blondel]. Hopefully, he will be freed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Johannes Stumpf has sent his "Swiss Chronicle" to the councilors of the Five Places. The messengers dispatched for this were received and sent off very kindly. Everywhere, gratitude was shown. The people of Lucerne and Schwyz gave the author 10 crowns. The people of Uri gave 12. The people of Unterwalden and Zug promised a considerable reward. They intend to appoint someone to bring the amount to be determined. Bullinger does not know that anyone has complained in the slightest. Only Aegidius Tschudi (but this is entrusted to Vadian alone) has complained about the sections he recognized as excerpts from Vadian's writing "On the Origin of Monasteries." He believes that Vadian's statements about the merit [of monasticism] will trigger a new dispute among the Swiss Confederates. Bullinger asked Stumpf to try to skillfully appease Tschudi. Stumpf will consult Vadian on this. Bullinger knows very well that if Tschudi does not instill his reservations in anyone, no one in Central Switzerland would notice anything. Oh, if only Vadian would write to Tschudi, if he belongs to his close circle of acquaintances!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] At the Baden Diet, it was decided to appoint only four envoys to the baptism of Princess Claude of France: one from Zurich, one from Solothurn, one from Schwyz, and one from Unterwalden. Jakob Stampfer is to mint three gold medals worth 400 crowns. It's a pity that no one from St. Gallen is allowed to join these four delegates! The people of Zurich would have welcomed this, especially since it would have brought greater success to the business of the Swiss Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] There is nothing new to report, except that it is claimed Emperor Charles V is expected in Strasbourg. Bullinger does not know if this is true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In case Vadian does not know: Otto Werdm체ller was appointed in place of [the second archdeacon of the Grossm체nster] Erasmus Schmid, and Johannes Haller in place of [the first archdeacon] Heinrich Buchter. The two pious and learned colleagues now assist Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] All pastoral colleagues send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [P.S.:] Of the enclosed German booklet, four copies are intended for Vadian and three for Hans Widenhuber.</p>

      <p>Knoblauch brought yours to me and was diligent in inquiring about others. For he knocked at my house once, twice, and thrice, but I had nothing to write, nor, if I had, did I have enough leisure. Therefore, I pray you to take my silence in good part.</p>

      <p>The most illustrious council of our city has agreed and consented to the requests of your most noble council. Letters are being sent to Johann Wunderlich, the most sincere supporter of our religion. He will ensure that both letters are delivered to the king with the swiftest speed by courier. Everything is full of spies and traitors! I pity that excellent merchant. But I hope he will be freed.</p>

      <p>Stumpf has sent the Chronicle to the magistrate of the Five Cantons. The messengers were received and dismissed most amicably. Thanks were given everywhere. The people of Lucerne gave the author 10 crowns, as did those of Schwyz. The people of Uri gave 12 crowns. The people of Unterwalden and Zug promised a very generous reward. They will therefore send what they wish to donate. Everyone praises the undertaking. No one, as far as I know, is complaining at the moment. Only Aegidius Tschudi (which I want to tell you alone) is upset that those things he collected from your writings "On the Origin of Monasteries" were included. And he thinks that from those things written about merit there, a new disturbance will be stirred up among the Swiss, etc. I advised Stumpf to soothe the man with skill. He will seek your advice. If he does not instill what torments him in anyone from the Cantons, I know no one will notice it. If only you would write to him, if he is familiar to you.</p>

      <p>At Baden, they say delegates have been chosen to enter France to receive the queen from the sacred font, 4: Zurich, Solothurn, Schwyz, and Unterwalden. Stampfer is minting 3 gold coins, weighing 400 crowns. If only someone from St. Gallen had been added! It would have pleased our council, so that they might have gained more favor with the king in trade, etc.</p>
