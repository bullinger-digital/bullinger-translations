      <p>Greetings. I have not yet responded to your letter, most esteemed sir, written on the 20th of March, always waiting to see if any more substantial news about the state of our affairs would come up. However, very little has been discovered so far that I would consider worth informing you about; nevertheless, I am sending whatever there is, enclosed in the included note. There was no need for such diligent thanks for the cup sent as a gift from your daughter, as it is more than enough for me, your most devoted, to be received so kindly by you. The rest of your letter, which contains both unique consolation and no less instruction and admonition, is most pleasing to me, for which I also thank you, as you are not at all reluctant to discuss such matters with me so familiarly amidst all your other great affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on the 1st of June in the year 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>A rumor has reached me concerning the affairs of Moscow and Hungary, therefore I have detained my messenger for an entire day, hoping to learn something certain about these matters to inform you. But I have not yet been able to discover anything certain; as soon as I do, I will share it with you, as I think is appropriate among friends.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, pious, and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
