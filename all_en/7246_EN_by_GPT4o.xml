      <p>On the twenty-seventh of September, Mr. Zanccus left here in the morning. In the evening of the same day, letters from England were delivered to me by the reverend Bishop of London to be forwarded to your greatness, which I did not want to send without my own to your greatness. I believe the bishop writes to your dominion about the murder of the Queen of Scots and her most deserved punishment, namely that she was captured, then forced to abdicate the throne, having confessed that with her help and advice her husband was removed, and that the most wicked adulterer also fled to a certain maritime fortress situated on a rock. The example and zeal of this ignoble nation in avenging crimes is commendable, which learned Italy would have excused by the impulse and madness of desire. The astonishing massacre among the Belgians cannot be unknown to you; I do not know if those to whom the power of the sword has been entrusted by the Lord can be excused as idle spectators and dissemblers in such a great outpouring of innocent blood; if waging war against the Turks has been permitted and approved in all ages and by all popes, cardinals, monks, clerics, and scholarly writers, because they bring arms against the true religion, and in that war, glory and immortal honor have been attributed to the dead, whether he should be considered seditious and a traitor who takes up necessary and just arms to defend hearths and altars, to repel unjust force, to preserve the true religion, and to transmit it to posterity. What if a legitimate king degenerates into a tyrant, can he still be called a minister of God? Peace must be cultivated, obedience must be rendered, and at the same time, the natural rights, laws, and customs of kingdoms, dominions, and territories must be observed, and above all, what is God's must be given to God.</p>
      <p>The excellent constitution of Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian is a voice worthy of the majesty of a ruler, to profess that the prince is bound by laws. Thus, our authority depends on the authority of the law, nor are princes freed from laws so that everything is permissible to them according to their desire, but, as Aristotle asserts, they must excel others by such a great abundance of virtue that the virtue of all others is not comparable to this, and who excels others in justice and equity as much as the sun does the formless and crude elements, for such a one there is no legislation at all, since he himself is a living and animated law.</p>
      <p>The Swiss are worthy of praise, who have asserted themselves into freedom from oppressive domination and tyranny. I would not wish the trumpet to be sounded against legitimate and justly ruling princes, but against the false gods, who, out of lust, greed, cruelty, and pride, wherever they turn, corrupt, mix, disturb, and contaminate everything, turning and shaking everything with a mere nod, most worthy to be brought into order by the Swiss and Scottish censors. I ask that you convey my greetings to your son-in-law Rudolf Gwalther on my behalf. Indeed, I offer all my services to you.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, October 11, 1567.</p>
      <p>From whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
