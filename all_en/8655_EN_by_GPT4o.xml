      <p>Greetings. When I was returning from the Palatinate, I had planned for certain reasons to pass through Zürich; however, since I was delayed longer than expected here and there, I had to change my plan and head home. Therefore, the letters that I had received from good men in Heidelberg, I handed directly to Mr. Haller upon my return home, so that he could forward them to you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I recollected myself and remembered seeing the latest response on excommunication at the home of the most distinguished man, Erastus, in which he replied to Mr. Beza; I wished to have it copied for me, but he replied that I could more conveniently obtain it from you. I therefore ask, honorable sir, that a copy of it be given to me; for I will read it most eagerly and soon return it to you. The Italian writings were given to me by the noble Count Odoardo Thieneus, to share with you, which were not at hand when I recently gave letters to Mr. Haller.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 28, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Benedikt Aretius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, sincere doctor and interpreter of sacred theology, his honorable lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
