      <p>To the most vigilant bishops of the Church of ZÃ¼rich from the ministers of the word, grace and peace. Augustine Talpius came to us, who for many years served as a minister of the word among us, indicating that he was recalled by you and that this calling should no longer be neglected by him. He requested letters from us so that he might return to you accompanied by our testimony. At first, this was troublesome for us, as we wished for him to remain with us longer and asked him to do so. However, after he explained the pressing necessity to us, it seemed inappropriate to retain him longer and unjust to deny him letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we give him this testimony, not begged nor with blinded judgment, as often happens, but following only the truth. Moreover, it would be superfluous to extol his faith in ministry or integrity in conduct with great praises; for these are most well-known to you. We thought it necessary to add this: he left us leaving behind a great longing for him, not only in the church, while he presided, but among all the citizens of our religion, who, although they tried with many prayers to dissuade him from his decision, thought it unwise to resist him after hearing of the necessity; for our condition is not equally with yours, as with either old age or illness, little hope remains concerning sustenance; but we must trust in God, and he must not miss his opportunity.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is no need to commend him to you, that you may receive him kindly, as you are already inclined to do so; however, we ask that you keep our region in mind, should a shortage of ministers occur; for concerning the church over which Augustine presided, he himself will inform you. Farewell. From Glarus, January 5, 1552.</p>
      <p>Most ready at your commands, the ministers of the church in Glarus.</p>
      <p>Valentin Tschudi has sealed it.</p>
