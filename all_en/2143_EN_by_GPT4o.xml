      <p>S. P. Dearest father and teacher, I recently wrote to you from Tübingen; however, I did not want to neglect this opportunity with Raphael Seiler, a learned and honest young man. By the consensus of the entire academy, the first chair of law was soon conferred upon me in Tübingen, and I began in the great schools on the first day with a new and analytical approach; I have the enthusiasm and fervor of the listeners. Meanwhile, while accommodation is being prepared, I came to Augsburg during these holidays; I was greatly delighted and gave thanks to the Lord, seeing the holy and beautiful order of the church on Christmas Day and thereafter in the Church of St. Anne.</p>
      <p>On the next Thursday, I will return to begin the ordinary course on the first day from the first title of the Corpus Juris, which is about the Holy Trinity, so that I may have a discourse on the excellence, duty, difference, and agreement of theology, jurisprudence, princes or magistrates, and ministers, and about the power and use of laws that establish matters of religion and ecclesiastical affairs, translating and refuting papal abuses in this part, as I began to touch upon in the first discourse in the great schools on December 18, but only briefly, with the entire academy present. Although I have the position and stipend of one, I will nevertheless exercise a triple profession, so that, as long as the years are vigorous, I may devote myself to the schools and the church. In an extraordinary free and suitable hour, I will undertake to explain the labyrinths of law anew and will ensure that the doctrine of law comes forth accessible, expeditious, and brief, according to the standard of good and fair and suitable for the practical uses of men. I want to cut off the school and the forum, as I have often said, so that henceforth jurisprudence neither opposes theology nor does the study of the word of God get hindered by tediousness, entanglement, and prolixity, but rather helps. Thirdly, I will pursue the war undertaken against papism, striking especially at France. I commend myself to your princes and those of your church.</p>
      <p>The liberation of my family is now in France with the letters of the princes' envoy (to whom I have finally fled as to a sacred anchor). In my name, I wish to greet the reverend father Mr. Pellicanus, the most learned and polyglot Bibliander, the patrician Lavater, Zwingli, your son-in-law, and others. I ask that, given the opportunity, you have the enclosed brief letters sent, so that they may take care of my large chest of books and registers, which was to be returned to me from Neuchâtel five months ago, to be safely received at last. May the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ always increase and better prosper you and your church. Augsburg, on the calends of January 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient ancient legal consultant of France, now also of Germany, first ordinary professor of law in Tübingen, Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>Lord Peter Paul Vergerius would have come here if the harshness of winter had allowed it. Lord Peter Martyr, together with Jerome Sanctus, stayed with me for one day as I was leaving Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious ecclesiastic and most learned doctor of the church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
