    <p xml:id="regest1">Renews his recommendation made last month for [Wolfgang] Haller and for the other appointed [students who were staying in Marburg]. He turned to the study of law due to slander from theologians who call him an enthusiast and sacramentarian, and because of the amenities provided to him by [Johann] Oldendorp, but he cannot give up language studies, especially Hebrew, especially since friends [of the Zurich church] gave him hope for a professorship; when he heard that Paul Fagius (who was and still is helpful to him) would soon move to Strasbourg (where there are already three learned language professors), he decided to go where the Hebrew and Chaldean languages are neglected, to request a professorship directly from Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] through letters of recommendation from learned men, including those from Zurich, especially since the [Marburg] professorship has long been vacant, [Johannes Lonitzer], who also teaches Greek, is not instructed in rabbinical commentaries, and the Landgrave does not want to pay double salary to a person who teaches two languages with only moderate success; should Happel's plan succeed, he will continue to work theologically. Meanwhile, he still wants to attend a civil law lecture by Oldendorp; Bullinger would certainly appreciate him as well; like hardly anyone before him and not relying on the glosses and strange interpretations of predecessors, Oldendorp justifies the laws through divine and natural law; should Bullinger have a different opinion, he should let it be known. The rest Bullinger will learn from [Wolfgang] Haller. Happel had discussions with the visitor, his relative, Adam [Krafft] and with Theobald Thamer, who threatens to write something against [the Zurich church]; the opponents insist on their Lutheran standpoint. Johannes Pincier lent three [students from Zurich] 40 talers, which were advanced by a relative [...] for their journey to Leipzig and Wittenberg; the students possibly wander around Germany to the displeasure [of the Zurichers] at great cost and danger; Bullinger should ensure that they repay the money by the next fair at the latest. In the future, care should be taken to help only when indicated by Bullinger or Froschauer; asks for forgiveness for Pincier's imprudence; more details about the matter can be found in a letter from Pincier to Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Last month, most illustrious man, I presented to your kindness my opinion and expectation regarding Haller, perhaps more freely than was appropriate, but nevertheless in good faith, and certainly not otherwise than I felt with my whole heart. Therefore, I want to ask you all again, that my testimony and recommendation may find a place and trust with you, as they have come from a sincere heart, and not entirely from some blind love or any corruption of my judgment.</p>
      <p>Now, I have nothing to write except that I have tasted the study of jurisprudence, partly moved by the inhumanity and envy of certain theologians, who call me a sacramentarian and enthusiast among themselves and within private walls, and therefore unworthy to be admitted to any ecclesiastical office, etc., and partly also by the convenience of the teaching of Dr. Oldendorp, who is praised and admired. However, the love of law and equity (as they call it) has not yet so invaded and occupied me that I would want or even be able to abandon or postpone the study of languages, especially Hebrew, especially since certain good men, your friends, have diligently given me certain hope that the province of teaching the holy language will be assigned to me, even if all those who follow Luther's camp oppose it, through our prince himself, if I become known through the recommendation of certain learned men. Since I have learned that Paul Fagius, who once offered me his help, study, and faith in this matter and promised it, is about to come to Strasbourg in a short time - and already before him, that school flourishes with three learned professors of the holy language - I have decided to go there, and when I have acquired a moderate knowledge of Hebrew and Chaldean speech, I say also of rabbinical commentaries, which lack points, from them, equipped and fortified with the testimonies of such men and yours as well, I will go straight to our excellent prince and request the professorship of that language from him, since for many years now our university has lacked a just and learned professor. For the one who has hitherto professed it also teaches the Greek language, never had rabbinical commentaries, so far is it from being able to engage in them with profit, promoted more by the private favor of some until someone else could be acquired who would devote all his strength to cultivating and teaching the holy language with profit. And the most illustrious prince has often commanded the school in person and in writing to look out for another; for he does not want to support someone in his university with a double salary, who, while being held by diverse and various studies or presiding over the teaching of two languages, might perhaps profess neither with profit to the listeners. If this my plan and intention should have a successful outcome, I will use the forum, opportunity, and convenience of the profession of this language, whose study does not seem to be infinite nor to require the whole lifetime of anyone, unless perhaps of someone too morose and curious - I will also devote myself to theology - and I will ensure that I can not only demand individual words and phrases according to grammatical precepts, as much as possible, and interpret bare words, but also that I can sometimes examine and explain the mind and sense of the author. May the best and greatest God make it so!</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, I will nevertheless listen for one hour to Dr. Oldendorp, while he lives, discussing and examining civil matters, so that I may also be able to judge and form a judgment about them. For there is no doubt, if your kindness had heard this man and jurist once and again, that afterwards you would by no means neglect him, unless perhaps occupied with more serious matters; he teaches with such grace and faith! Nor does he rely on the commentaries and opinions of the learned, but he proves the laws themselves from the laws and precepts of nature and God - which few have done before him -, and if he did not do so, and followed the glosses, as they call them, of the commentators and often foul opinions of the interpreters, I would never have listened to him. You have my plan. If you think anything else, which is more in accordance with my interest and honor, I beg you, do not withhold it from me.</p>
      <p>You will be able to learn the rest of my affairs especially from Haller; for he is more familiar with me than the others; he is more aware of them.</p>
      <p>I have debated twice with Master Adam, the chief visitor, my relative and godfather (Taufpate), often with Theobald Thamer, your threatening (so to speak) adversary. For he threatens to write against you. But I have never succeeded with reasons among stubborn and obstinate minds, that when they could not escape with a just solution, they would flee to the omnipotence of God, the last refuge of the Lutherans, and extol and extend it more than God himself ever wanted or did, or even mix, confuse, and unite divinity with humanity and this with that.</p>
      <p>It remains that I still remind you of one thing: Johannes Pincier lent your three young men forty talers for their journey, which they undertook towards Leipzig and Wittenberg. Whether he did you a favor, I doubt, for it is probable (as I also learned from our Pellican) that it is displeasing to you that your young men wander and roam through Germany, especially in this dangerous time, at great expense, risk to health and life, and loss and damage to their studies. Although I was not unaware of this, I would have lent them myself, if they had asked me as they did others, from whom they should have asked less, so that they would not have had to complain about our inhumanity and ingratitude. But, however the matter stands, I ask again and again, urge the young men to be concerned about the repayment to be made at the next fair, if not sooner, for that money cannot be spared by Pincier's relative without detriment.</p>
      <p>In the future, it will be our care not to relieve anyone's need, unless in some necessity and with your or Lord Froschauer's written or spoken intercession. If you testify and request in one word that we assist any of your young men with money, we will be ready to help with an even larger sum. If Pincier's imprudence has already been a sin, I ask you to forgive him, and if you wish to know the whole matter better, you can do so from the letters of Johannes Pincier to Pellican, our father in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell and please consider me commended to you. Given from Lichtenberg around the Ides of September in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours with all my heart, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and most worthy bishop of the church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
