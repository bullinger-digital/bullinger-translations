    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger probably does not need to inform the Bernese how Luther, in his [“Short Confession”], accused Oecolampadius, Zwingli, and the people of Zurich of being heretics. - Since the churches of Zurich, as well as the [reformed] preachers and [scholars] at the Bern Disputation [of 1528], are or were of the opinion that the true body of Christ is not physically present and received in the Lord's Supper, the people of Zurich felt obliged to refute Luther's attack and to assert that the claim that the bread of the Lord's Supper is the natural body of Christ, which would be received with the mouth by both believers and unbelievers, is not in accordance with Scripture. - The resulting [“True Confession”] is enclosed with this letter, and they request acknowledgment of the booklet. - The Bernese should hold fast to the truth of their disputation and not be impressed by Luther's writing. Just as Cochlaeus’ publication [“To the Lords Mayor and Council of Bern against their supposed Reformation”] could not achieve anything among the knowledgeable, so too will Luther's attack fail, especially since neither the fourth article nor the nine others [of the Bern Disputation] can be refuted based on Scripture, and the wise adhere solely to the truth. - The Bernese should strive to promote truth, unity, and peace. Since they are hopefully admonished in this sense by their preachers, this letter does not need to be more detailed. - May it be received benevolently.</p>

      <p>Noble, steadfast, pious, prudent, honorable, and wise, gracious, dear lords, our willing service, friendly greetings, and all good things be ready for your wisdom beforehand.</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that your wisdom has mostly seen and read the booklet by Dr. Martin Luther, which he wrote against our common faith and had printed. Therefore, it is not necessary for us to recount its contents at length, since your wisdom retains in fresh memory that the aforementioned Dr. Luther publicly and expressly calls and condemns Dr. Johann Oecolampadius, Master Ulrich Zwingli, etc., and us here in Zurich - indeed all those, whoever or wherever they may be, who do not wish to believe that the Lord's bread in the Lord's Supper is the true, real, natural body of Christ, which the wicked as well as the good eat orally - as unrepentant heretics, with whom no believers can or should have any fellowship.</p>
      <p>However, since 17 years ago in your wisdom's city, a commendable public disputation was held, in which the opposite was upheld by your wisdom's preachers, also by Oecolampadius and Zwingli of blessed memory, namely that the true, natural body of Christ is not physically eaten or received in the Lord's Supper - to which we mostly and commonly subscribed to your wisdom's disputation and also offered, as much as we could and received grace from God, to defend and answer it -, and since we have so far in the churches we serve, led no other teaching of the Holy Supper than that upheld in the aforementioned disputation, we have been moved by all these reasons and grounds to respond to Dr. Luther's booklet, to defend the honor and innocence of ours, indeed of all those who adhere to the aforementioned teaching, to confess the Christian teaching and true faith, to refute Luther's insults poured out against us and to prove with the truth that Dr. Luther's teaching, namely that the Lord's bread is the natural body of Christ and is also orally received by unbelievers, has no basis in God's word, would turn against itself, and is a new, not the old teaching of the holy Christian church, whereas our teaching is founded in God's word and is the teaching of the holy old church, etc. All of which your wisdom may see and understand more fully and completely from our response and confession of the true faith. We hope hereby to have done a service and favor to your wisdom and all other believers, and not a disservice and displeasure.</p>
      <p>Such our response and confession of faith, set and printed for the protection of our common church, we hereby send to your wisdom humbly with a humble request that your wisdom may graciously accept and receive it from us, your entirely willing, benevolent servants, and also, if it were possible without inconvenience, willingly and diligently read it.</p>
      <p>Hereby we exhort your wisdom very faithfully and friendly to remain and persist at all times unmoved by the truth, upheld by the much-mentioned disputation, and not to be swayed by such writings of Dr. Luther or other learned men. Years ago, Dr. Johann Cochlaeus wrote against your wisdom's reformation. However, his writing did not achieve anything among the knowledgeable, as it has no firm basis in Scripture. Even though Luther has now also written with great scolding, which directly contradicts the upheld truth, it will not prevail among understanding people, who judge not by temptation but by the truth. We trust in God and the truth that no one will be found in the future who will bring forth anything with biblical scripture that would not only break the fourth conclusion but also harm the other nine, so that your wisdom is in the safest position if they steadfastly adhere to the upheld truth.</p>
      <p>Such plants, also maintaining unity and true peace. End all discord and strife, if there were any. Thus, we also hope that your wisdom's preachers, our dear brothers - who undoubtedly know well about Luther's writing, how it contradicts your wisdom's held disputation, and therefore have no pleasure in Luther's writing with us - will exhort your wisdom very diligently to persist in the truth upheld in the disputation, so that we may leave it at this our brief, friendly exhortation.</p>
      <p>And we humbly ask your wisdom to understand this our exhortation as friendly and to receive the booklet, having graciously entrusted us to them, for we do all this out of love and good friendship towards your wisdom, as those who are entirely willing to serve your wisdom and to promote everything that may serve their peace, good, and salvation. May Almighty God keep your wisdom along with all their associates through Jesus Christ in truth, in peace, and in all good.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, March 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's all-time willing servants, pastors, preachers, readers of the Holy Scripture, and common servants of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the noble, steadfast, pious, prudent, honorable, and wise lords, mayors, and councilors of Bern, our gracious lords.</p>
