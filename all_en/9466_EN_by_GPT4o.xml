      <p>S. I am glad that all my letters, even those common ones, have been delivered to you, my beloved brother, and to Campello, my singular and dear friend and brother. I always fear that something might be lost or maliciously intercepted on the way. Therefore, you will have done well if you always indicate that my letters have been delivered to you, just as I never fail to do diligently. I have now also received news from Lentulus, our brother, and I thank both you and him equally. And as I testified in my previous letters, I now repeat that you gratify me greatly. Froschauer has returned; but I have not yet discussed with him the book of Mr. Lentulus and your prodigy. God willing, I will write something certain after eight days.</p>
      <p>He did not bring any other news besides those which I sent to you in order from here; he confirms the same. Froschauer brought the printed articles of the French peace, which I sent to you eight days ago, in the German language. Those who came from France in recent days and passed through here affirmed that they saw the Swiss troops greatly reduced not far from Lyon; they will soon return to their homeland; many are dead, many more are sick and continue to die on the journey.</p>
      <p>If these things are true, the outcome will prove them. We hear not a word here about the eruption of the people of La Rochelle; thus nothing about new troops being conscripted by the king. The royal envoy wrote to me from Solothurn at the end of last month that the new King of Poland took an oath in the main temple in Paris to the Polish envoys, who, after the oath was made, offered him the crown and scepter, and now everything is being prepared for the departure to Poland through Germany.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London write to me that everything in England is peaceful; the Queen of England has also pacified Scotland and subjected it to the young King of Scots. For recently Edinburgh, the primary city of Scotland and never before subdued and therefore called a virgin, - having been conquered by the Queen, surrendered to the Virgin Queen - in it, all the disturbers of the Scottish kingdom and the rebels against the young king were apprehended, but also the French were suppressed. There is now the utmost concord between England and Scotland, etc. However, the bishops indicate that they are troubled by the Anabaptists and minds inclined to new things. Therefore, they propose many questions to me to be explained, so that no trouble and labor may fall upon me, etc. I have not yet read all the letters that Froschauer brought, written from many places. If there seems to be anything else to communicate, I will do so later. Now I am forced to break off this letter because of business.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and children. Greet Mr. Campello, both Pontisellas, the consuls, Karl, Viktor, Bonett, and our others.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 2, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>After these were sealed, new letters are brought from Heidelberg. If the new things sent to me from there can be copied, I will add them to these; one person is not enough for all these labors. Those many letters from many places wear me out, etc.</p>
