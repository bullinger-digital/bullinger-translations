      <p>God be with us, beloved son, there is no need for thanks for what I consider good; I indeed consider it good and thank you and Susanna diligently for the song, which is beautiful and right. I have received one letter from J. Michel Beldins, and I would like to endure it, my copies and the other letter could also be given to me by Mr. brother-in-law Vogt. As you desire that godfather Hans Go√üower sets the core for you tomorrow, it shall happen; if only we had a vessel for it. For the meal today, I invite you in, so that everything can be properly discussed. My Dorothea and I thank Susanna very sincerely for the peas.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing to write at this time, this morning reminiscere before 6 and before the sermon. Everyone greets you; greet Susanna and the children for us, etc. God be with you all. 1573.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Ludwig sends you his commentary; I have enclosed it for you.</p>
      <p>It is a book most worthy of reading and the best and most learned. Thank him for it.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
