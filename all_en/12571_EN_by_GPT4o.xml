    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller only received Bullinger's letter from July 10 [No. 2494] on July 28 (along with a letter from Blarer), which contained information about the Diet in Baden. Before this letter arrived, Haller had already heard about the decision of the Nine Places. But now he knows more details about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- It pains him to see how much the Confederates lack foresight. Perhaps God has hardened them to punish them for their infidelity. Whether Emperor [Charles V] or the [Schmalkaldic League] wins, it will have dire consequences for them. If the Emperor triumphs, they will feel his innate hatred against them. How foolish must one be not to understand that the Emperor and his accomplices have only one intention, namely their subjugation! Haller already knows that the [Protestant city cantons] would have done everything [to help the Schmalkaldic League] if the [Catholic places] had not prevented them. If only there were no tensions between the Zurichers and the Bernese, as well as between the Zurichers and the Schaffhausers! For if the [city cantons] had been as united among themselves as the [Catholic Inner Swiss] are, the latter would not have dared to oppose them. Although Haller tries to defend the [city cantons] in Augsburg, many accuse them of being too timid towards the [Inner Swiss], and this in a matter that concerns both them and the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] has been in Augsburg for ten days. When he returns to Zurich, he will report remarkable things. Tomorrow he will go to Donauwörth, where Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] will unite his forces with those of the [southern German] cities. Also present are Elector [John Frederick of Saxony], his son [John Frederick II], and his [half]brother [John] Ernest [of Saxe-Coburg], about three princes from Brunswick (and not the captured [Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his son Charles Victor], but those who have always supported the Landgrave, as [Rudolf] Gwalther well knows), Duke Francis of Lüneburg, a Duke of [Schleswig]-Holstein, brother of King Christian of Denmark, Prince [Wolfgang] of Anhalt, and many other counts and barons. They have 6,000 cavalry and 25,000 infantry. The [southern Germans] have 75 companies. Such a large army has probably never been seen in Christendom! What happens next is secret. The [Schmalkaldic League] holds some bridges over the Danube. Meanwhile, the Emperor is gathering his troops around him. The Italians and Spaniards are coming. The [Schmalkaldic League] has probably delayed their attack to prevent the Emperor's escape and thus a protracted war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Yesterday, a relative of [...] Michael Kellers, born in Donauwörth and fled from Regensburg, arrived. He reported that [Charles V] still knows nothing of the attack plans of the [opposing] princes. The priests have not dared to inform him, as they have not kept their grand promises. However, they are making great efforts to assemble the imperial troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Apart from a few localities, Bohemia does not want to help the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- There is strict discipline in the [Schmalkaldic League's] army, which gives hope for their victory. Every day, men are arrested or beheaded for theft, murder, and rape. Currently, 40 soldiers are imprisoned for the rape of a Jewish girl [...] and another 40 for sodomy. [This] was written by field preacher [Johann] Meckart.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [Zurichers] should stand firm. In this war, which also concerns them, considerations of alliances are not appropriate, for it is solely about God and His holy Gospel! If only the [city cantons] would send envoys to the [Schmalkaldic League], explain the reason for the delay, possibly ask for assistance against the [Catholic places], and in return offer the Schmalkaldic League full support! Haller writes this based on what he hears every day. The alliance with the [Catholic places] has already been the downfall of the [Protestant places] more than once. Against this embassy, it may be argued that the [Schmalkaldic League] did not demand the help of the Confederates for now, but for later. But they did so because the latter demand too much money for their participation in the war. However, since this case (unlike the deployments in France) is about the truth, the Confederates should be content with less. Bullinger should not take offense at this candid opinion. Haller is not concerned with the current dispatch of soldiers, but with the dispatch of an encouraging, confederate embassy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Haller will report in detail when Vogler returns [to Zurich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger should send Haller some copies of his "Resurrectio" translated by [Johannes] Fries, as well as some more copies of the "Relatio fidelis" (with which [Theodor] Bibliander refuted the "Coniecturae de ultimis temporibus" by [Andreas] Osiander).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to the fellow ministers and the family. The [Augsburg] pastors are well-disposed towards the [Zurichers].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Bullinger should inform the father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli] that everything is going well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Has Haller's letter from July 24 [No. 2511] arrived?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [PS.:] There are no more Zurichers in Augsburg. In Memmingen, there were ten Swiss companies, which have now moved towards Kempten. Among them are all the Zurichers still involved in this war. At the main troop in Donauwörth, there is a banner of the Toggenburgers and one of the Thurgauers. Some of the mercenaries from both companies stayed in Augsburg, where they willingly listened to Haller's exhortations to piety delivered in Swiss German. Augsburg currently has six companies, among which are about 100 Swiss, some of them from the Five Places.</p>

      <p>Salvation, peace, and courage through our Lord Jesus, our Savior. Your letter dated July 10, in which you describe what happened at the Diet in Baden, which I greatly feared had been intercepted, was finally delivered to me on the 28th of the same month, along with others that Blaurer wrote to us. Before I received them, I had already learned what was concluded among the nine Swiss cantons. However, your letters explained everything more fully. Therefore, I thank you for diligently informing me of everything that happens with you. I, in turn, will make sure that you are not ignorant of the events here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It pains me greatly that the Swiss do not better consider their future and the impending destruction. Perhaps God has made them so reprobate that they will eventually suffer the deserved penalties for their impenitence. For it is most certain that whichever side prevails, they will not escape unpunished. If ours (God willing), you will see what they are going to attempt. If the Emperor (which the Lord mercifully avert), he will eventually manifest his innate hatred towards the Swiss on any occasion he seizes. For he does not easily forget how much harm this nation has caused him over many years. Hence, I marvel at their foolishness, who do not see what these rascals are seeking: Certainly nothing less than their friendship, but to subjugate the Swiss along with the entire empire. As for the others (that is, the Swiss of our party), I know they would do whatever they could if that burden hanging over them did not pull them back. I wish only that the discord between the Zurichers and the Bernese, as well as the contention between the Zurichers and Schaffhausen, would be removed. Work hard, brothers, I implore you! For on this one thing the others rely. If they were as united as the others, they would be so feared that they would not dare to speak against them. However, as long as these contentions are not removed, we will not easily be able to resist their schemes. I defend our people (that is, the Zurichers with the other evangelicals) everywhere. For there are not lacking even among the highest, those who greatly accuse your timidity, that you do not act more strongly against them in this common danger of yours and ours. I am forced to hear many jests everywhere - which, if they are unworthy, I elude and excuse as much as I can; if worthy, I nevertheless diminish them with some modesty.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Vogler will report to you, when he comes, remarkable things. He has been with us for ten days now. Tomorrow he will go to Donauwörth to see both our army and that of the Landgrave, who will join his forces with ours tomorrow. The Elector himself is present with his son and brother Ernest, several princes of Brunswick, three I think (not from the number of those rascals who were captured, but those who have always been with the Landgrave - as Gwalther knows), Francis, Duke of Lüneburg, Duke of Holstein, brother of King Christian of Denmark, Prince of Anhalt, and a large number of counts and barons. They bring 6,000 cavalry, 25,000 infantry. Ours have 75 banners. Such an army has hardly been seen among Christians for several centuries! What they will do first is unknown. They are besieging several bridges over the Danube. Everything is done in secret. The Emperor is gathering his forces. Italians and Spaniards are arriving. I believe ours are deliberately waiting for them, so that the Emperor does not prolong the war for many years by fleeing, but by standing against them, he may finally come into their hands, so that Christianity may be freed from this tyrant. Let us therefore pray fervently to the one Shepherd, whose voice we recognize, that He may do His duty. No shepherd has ever handed over a sheep to a wolf, so that He may do the same with us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Yesterday, a certain refugee, who escaped by night from Regensburg, born in Donauwörth, a relative of M. Cellarius, came. He says that the Emperor still does not know that the princes are present, or that any resistance will be made. For the priests are ashamed to inform him of this, because they have promised him much, but have delivered nothing. Therefore, they diligently intercept all letters, so that they do not reach the person of the Emperor. Meanwhile, they are doing everything they can to gather soldiers. And he affirms this truthfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Bohemians are said not to want to assist the Emperor except for a few cities. But this is uncertain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Military discipline is maintained strictly in our army. Men are hanged, beheaded daily for theft, murder, and rape of virgins. 40 soldiers are already in prison, whom I do not think will be released, for the violent rape of a certain Jewish virgin. Mecardus, who was sent as a preacher with the army, also wrote to us. 40 others have been captured for the sin of sodomy. These sins, unless they were punished with such constancy, would make me very doubtful of victory. Therefore, pray with us, brothers, that He may not cast away the wheat because of these chaffs and uproot the crop along with the weeds.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Be strong! In this common war, no alliances should be considered, but only God and His holy Gospel! I wish that a delegation would be sent from the Zurichers, Bernese, and other evangelicals to ours, to excuse themselves for the delay in providing assistance and to inform them of the reasons that detained them at home, and at the same time to ask that, if they were to be troubled by the other cantons, they would look to them for support; that they would also pledge their lives and goods to them. This would greatly encourage ours. I do not write in vain. I know what I hear every day. Here, that alliance with the impious, which has not once turned out badly for us, should not be considered, but the truth and the salvation of the fatherland. I know it will lead to good in the future. I know what you object. That they did not seek help except for the future. True. But I also know why they did this. They would have already asked for help, if they had been present, unless the expenses were so great. For I truly say: Ours make such expenses that nothing is beyond. I hear from not insignificant men, if they could only come to the muster place at their own expense, they would be content with a reasonable salary, since they are not fighting here in France, but for the sake of truth. This should be so dear to them, that they would rather suffer some lack, and also stand by, so that it may be preserved. These and similar things are spread everywhere. I ask you not to take offense that I write these things more freely. You can judge from this yourself what should be done. I prescribe nothing. I do not desire soldiers to be sent, but an honorable delegation, so that at least their goodwill towards us may appear. It does no harm; it serves much good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>But now I cease writing. When Vogler returns, I will also abundantly report everything (if anything happens in the meantime).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I would gladly like to be sent one or two copies of your Enchiridion on the resurrection, as translated by Frisius, as well as the response of D. Bibliander against Osiander's judgment on the last times. When you send them, I will pay in good faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Farewell. Greet the lords, brothers, and the whole family. Our brothers wish you well. Augsburg, August 3, 1546.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Also give my best regards to my father-in-law in my name. Everything is well.</p>

      <p>I wrote to you on July 24. I do not know if you have received it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>There are no Zurichers with us. 10 Swiss banners were in Memmingen, who have now set out towards Kempten. Where they are now, what they are doing, I do not know. Among them are all the Zurichers (if any have left). At the universal army in Donauwörth, there are only 2 banners of the Toggenburgers and Turgauers. Some of them were in Augsburg; whom I addressed familiarly with great congratulations and exhorted to piety. There are still 6 banners in the city, among which about 100 Swiss are scattered, also collected from the 5 cantons. What is fitting will be done.</p>
