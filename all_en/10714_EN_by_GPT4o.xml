    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like to acquire the notes of Theodor [Bibliander]'s lectures from the hand of the deceased pastor of Kloten, even in the event of a later publication of the lectures. Is constantly reminded of death by his illness, as was the case with Franz [Kolb]. Asks about the continuation of Bullinger's commentary on the Pauline Epistles.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I sent letters and two crowns from our Martinmas fair through the prefect of Lenzburg, and if you have received them, you surely understand what I want to be done with the notes written by the pastor of Kloten. In the meantime, as I consider my health, I see that even if Theodor allows them to be published, I will either hardly be able to do without them or not live to see the day they come to light. Therefore, since our messenger is heading to St. Gallen, I instructed him to pass through your city on his return, to bring Genesis or anything else he can. When you send to Lenzburg to the prefect, the messenger will receive as much as he can carry. I will send the crown with the next messenger. If the widow is in need, you can either accommodate her for a short time or write to the prefect of Lenzburg, and you will receive it.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell.</p>
      <p>Ah, my brother, the goiter was a constant reminder of death for Franz, as he often said. What else does my herniated goiter (an unbearable burden that does not allow me to visit the crossroads, however close to my house, unless I rest) remind me of, but to meditate on death daily? In the meantime, as long as I live and the Lord provides strength, I will faithfully attend to my duties.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>If there is anything more printed in your Paul, let the printer send it.</p>
      <p>13th of November, year 35.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved lord and brother. To Zurich.</p>
