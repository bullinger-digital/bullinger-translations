    <p xml:id="regest1">Since the Protestant imperial estates want to know what they could expect from the Protestants not belonging to the [Schmalkaldic League] in the event of an attack due to their rejection of the Council [of Trent], the [Konstanz] council has been instructed to, among other things, question the Confederates. Therefore, an envoy [Matthäus Molckenpur] is dispatched in this matter. Blarer considers this pleasing because it could mitigate the sacrament dispute. Bullinger should advocate for the cause [among the Confederates]. - Bullinger should not mention the present letter to Molckenpur or the people of Zurich. He may inform the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], but only on the condition that they do not mention Blarer, the information conveyed by him, or the negotiations about [Konrad Zwick's] military art to Molckenpur. Blarer and Bullinger should continue to correspond faithfully and confidentially. - [Zwick] is surprised about the stalling of his negotiations [on military art] with Haab. Haab recently replied to Zwick that he was waiting for Lavater's return to discuss the matter with him; since then, Zwick has heard nothing more. Bullinger should inquire cautiously about the matter. - It is said that the [Zurich] council has allowed the newly elected governor in Thurgau [Leonhard Holzhalb] to accept gifts, except from disputing parties. Blarer wants to know from Bullinger if this is really true, as the matter is causing much talk among the Confederates and [the people of Konstanz]. - A federal assembly was scheduled for September 1 [1545] in Donauwörth. They want to establish a Swabian League again, including the Protestants. To Blarer's comfort, it is reported from Ulm and by [Hans] Welser from Augsburg that they will not be persuaded to do so. - In November [1545], the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion approved by [Charles V.] is to begin. It is only about the emperor not losing face [to Pope Paul III., who convened the Council of Trent]; a pointless waste of time. - Welser reports that [Charles V.] and [Francis I.] are making a pact. - If [the Protestants] do not recognize the Council [of Trent], [Henry VIII.] wants to deposit 200,000 guilders in Brunswick for them, which they could use in the event of an attack. In return, they are to provide mercenaries for Henry VIII. if he is attacked. - Bullinger should ensure that the [Zurich] printers do not harm the printing activities of [Balthasar Romätsch] by also printing the books he is currently printing or intends to print, including the writings of Johannes [Zwick]. [Christoph] Froschauer will probably not do this because he has better things to print, but other printers might very well. Bullinger should advocate for this and inquire what is expected in return from [Romätsch]. - Blarer wrote in haste, as he did not expect the Zurich messenger [...]. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], who should send the promised mill sketches [by Gerhard Westerburg]. - [P.S.:] A learned man [...] has reported that Vadian wrote to [Martin Frecht] that he is pained by the unworthy treatment of the deserving Luther by the people of Zurich. Blarer can hardly believe this but knows that the informant is reliable. - Blarer will carry out [Rudolf] Gwalther's assignment.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc. Especially trusted, dearly beloved lord and brother, from our brotherly faith, which we have among each other, and highest trust, I inform you that the protesting imperial estates have deemed it good to inquire with all others adhering to the gospel of Christ (even if they are not in their union) about what they should expect in case they are attacked due to disobedience against the papal council. Therefore, my lords have been instructed to learn this from the evangelical Confederates and some others. For this reason, my lords' envoy will soon appear with yours and promote this matter; which I then consider a special gracious arrangement of God, from which much good may arise, I must hold to myself. For if yours here meet ours with a Christian response, as I would like to assure myself, I am confident that much friendship and goodwill would be awakened and much evil prevented in the future. Especially, the insuave sacramentarian dissension might be somewhat calmed and mitigated, as you, being more understanding, might calculate better than I. Therefore, be with yours so that they do not despise this promotion nor dismiss it, but prove themselves in a Christian manner. It is unnecessary to give you further guidance here on how to give a fine and very beneficial (useful) response. At the same time, I implore you per nostram fidem, as earnestly (urgently) as I can, that you do not mention (reveal, betray) this letter of mine with a word, so that my lords' envoy, Matthäus Molckenpur, will come to you; likewise, not against your lords, except against the two mayors with the condition that they do not let my person be known to anyone. No less, I implore you to urge the mentioned lords most diligently so that none of them let the mentioned envoy of my lords know anything about the matter of my cousin concerning military equipment, for the envoy, should you truly believe me, knows nothing about it. And it would be extremely burdensome for my dear cousin for many reasons. Although the mentioned Matthäus is a pious, dear man and dear to both of us, it is by no means to be done that you inform him of this letter of mine or the mentioned matter. I also want to assure myself that you will remain faithful and trustworthy as before, so that we may further confidentially open all things to each other according to the time's circumstances; for strange crooked dealings (business) will still occur shortly.</p>
      <p>My dear cousin is greatly surprised at how everything he has dealt with your mayor Haab has stalled (stuck) in such a way. He informs me that Mr. Haab recently replied to him that Mr. Lavater is not at home; as soon as he comes, he will handle everything with him. Since then, nothing further has been written. This causes the man, who is truly wise and understanding, all sorts of thoughts. If it fits, you might ask from afar how this matter stands, if you could do so appropriately; if not, let it rest. However, I would still like to know for not insignificant reasons what the attitude towards my cousin is, who truly and certainly means well, yes, for the best.</p>
      <p>I cannot hide from you that it is said with great slander by some of yours that the newly elected governor in Thurgau has been expressly allowed and promised by a council with you to accept gifts, except from the parties who are in justification against each other, etc. So much is talked about it that you would not believe it, by some other Confederates and also ours. Therefore, I kindly ask you to inform me of this with reason, so that I and others may promise (defend, justify) you knowingly (if it is not true), or if it (which we do not assure ourselves) were the truth, to have compassion with you; for you and others will undoubtedly bear great displeasure about it.</p>
      <p>No special news, except that on the upcoming first of September a federal assembly will be held in Donauwörth. They would like to make a Swabian League again and also bring in the Protestants. But I am comforted, especially by Ulm and the mayor Welser of Augsburg, that they hope ours will not be persuaded to do so.</p>
      <p>In November, the conversation approved by the emperor is to begin. It is nothing but a pretense and appearance, so that the emperor does not completely lose his authority and reputation. Yet it will not bind the adversaries at all, even if the colloquents (which is not possible) were to agree on everything. Thus, cost and time must be lost. God have mercy on the miserable actions and that no one also wants to become wise with great harm to himself, etc.</p>
      <p>The emperor and the French (Welser writes to me) are supposed to come together and practice great things; but the Lord will remain well with his own before them all, etc.</p>
      <p>So you know in confidence that the king of England has let ours know that if they are finally resolved and willing not to adhere to the papal council, he will deposit two hundred thousand guilders in Brunswick. They may attack and use them if they should come into danger because of the council.</p>
      <p>In return, if he is attacked because of this, ours are to send him several thousand mercenaries (I have forgotten how many) to the end and place where he will order them. He will then pay them himself. Now again, my very friendly brotherly request to you is to inquire with the printers with you, yes, to persuade them not to reprint the books of the good, poor, pious fellow with us, which he has partly already printed but has not yet let go out, partly still to be printed, some of which our pious doctor Hans made, some also others with us might have made and still make, and to inform me of what ours can expect from them. His livelihood depends on it, and in my opinion, it would be unfriendly if one wanted to lead the other into harm in such a way. I am not worried about Froschauer; he has much better things to print. But others with you might do it. Therefore, act according to my trust and inform me helpfully of what ours can expect, I ask, to oblige you brotherly and Christianly (to repay).</p>
      <p>Send many services, good and greetings to all yours from me, and always keep us in faithful Christian intercession before the Lord. I did not expect this Zurich messenger and thus wrote everything in great haste. Consider it good for me.</p>
      <p>Given, the 27th of August 1545.</p>
      <p>Our Theodor, when you have reverently greeted him with our words, remind him to send us the account of the mills, which he mentioned to us among drinks but seriously, as soon as possible, as he will greatly gratify us with this, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>I read in the letters of a certain good and learned man that our Vadian wrote to someone that he is very sorry that his Zurich people treated Luther, a man so deserving of the church of Christ, so unworthily; which, as I am reluctant to believe, I know that man is by no means vain and did not invent it from his own head.</p>
      <p>I dare not delay the departing messenger. Tell our Gwalther that I will diligently take care of what he has entrusted.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, venerable and dearest brother.</p>
