      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ His Son, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Recently gathered, most illustrious man, a good part of our synod's brothers, the ministers, reported with great zeal that certain men of the church of Güttingen, a populous and not ignoble place in Thurgau located by Lake Constance, have a pastor who is an unlearned man and not at all suitable for the ecclesiastical duty of teaching. They testify that if he continues in this way, it is to be feared, since they have a cunning and talkative man as a neighbor, that it cannot happen without the detriment of the church and the defection of the listeners. The abbot of Kreuzlingen appointed him to this church, evidently in contempt of our profession, and they say it was done according to the avaricious nature of the Pharisees, with a lower salary than was previously agreed and prescribed by the magistrate for supporting the pastor; for he cut down several bushels of wheat from the number. But this poor man thought it was well with him if he could enjoy certain parts in a certain place. That church has the means so that it is not necessary for a frugal pastor to be oppressed by poverty.</p>
      <p>The people of Güttingen brought their complaint in vain to the esteemed man, the president of Thurgau, and implored his help and advice. He responded kindly and asked them to bear this misfortune with patience until these turbulent times have become a little calmer; then he would not fail them in his duty. However, we, although we wish well for the churches and their ministers, could not devise any other course of advice, since nothing sound is to be expected from the abbot's character, but rather much that is contrary.</p>
      <p>We placed all hope in the piety of the president, to whom they should return again in due time; we sent back the people of Güttingen and advised them to strive especially with that counsel, which provides that in the appointments of any evangelical church, no one should be appointed who has not been approved by examination, especially by the Zürichers, and having been approved, should look to some synod of their own. At the same time, it seemed good to the brothers, who do not know this pastor but have heard that he is the son of a certain carpenter from Zürich and is called Johannes, to briefly inform your paternity, so that if by chance he should be recalled under the anvil of your examination, by your singular prudence and care, whether by instruction or change of place and person or by any other means, both the church and the pastor might be advised; for we desire the welfare of both. Farewell, our honor.</p>
      <p>The congregation of ministers sends many greetings to your paternity. We are expecting at any moment what unfortunate Arabia will bring forth for us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in such great trepidation of affairs on all sides, we pray that the Lord may have mercy on us and commend His church, acquired by the blood of His Son, to His goodness, and direct the counsels of all to the propagation of the kingdom of Christ to the glory of His name and the preservation of the churches and now the salutary peace of our Switzerland. To H. Bullinger in the name of the brothers, the ministers, for the church of Güttingen, October 28, 1561.</p>
