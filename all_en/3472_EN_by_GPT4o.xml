      <p>To the most illustrious, most powerful prince and lord, Lord Maximilian, King of Bohemia, Archduke of Austria, etc., my gracious lord. Most illustrious, most powerful king, your royal majesty, my dutiful, most humble service in all obedience beforehand. Most gracious lord, the high and noble lady Isabella Manrique, etc., has here praised so much good of your royal majesty as a most gracious king, of divine truth, that your royal majesty would not take it unkindly if we, the servants here of the Church of Christ in Zurich, were to write something to your royal majesty and send Christian booklets.</p>
      <p>Through which I, who have also previously heard much honor, praise, and good of your royal majesty through honorable people, have been moved and encouraged to send this booklet along with this letter to your royal majesty, with a humble request that your royal majesty would graciously accept the little booklet and letter from me, who also willingly offers himself, in whatever way your royal majesty might be able to oblige me, that I would always be willing.</p>
      <p>And that this booklet is not more ornately bound is due to no other reason than that I had it prepared and sent in the utmost haste. And as the noble Georg Manrique, on behalf of his honorable dear mother, will make some request to your royal majesty, my humble request to your royal majesty is to graciously consider the honorable lady and help her to Christian freedom, so that she may freely, unoppressed, under your royal majesty's protection, maintain the holy divine word and the appropriate service of God.</p>
      <p>During the time she was here, she has shown herself entirely as befits a godly Christian lady. May Almighty God graciously and for a long time keep your royal majesty, along with your royal consort and all your kin, in His divine grace and in all prosperity. Dated Zurich, in the foremost city of Switzerland, the 12th of January in the year of our Lord 1558. Your royal majesty's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and servant of the Church in Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
