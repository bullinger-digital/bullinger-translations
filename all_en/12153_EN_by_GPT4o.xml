    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger sends the [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”], which responds to Luther’s [“Short Confession”]. Borrhaus will have seen how Luther, in his writing, accused Johannes Oekolampad, Zwingli, the people of Zurich, and the [Swiss] churches of heresy. This could not be silently accepted, even though [the people of Zurich] dislike the [intra-Protestant] disputes. Bullinger hopes that [the people of Basel] do not find the Zurich response excessive and asks for any criticism. Those who have heard Borrhaus on the sacraments praise him because he does not attribute too much importance to them. - Bullinger wishes to be accepted by Borrhaus as a friend. - Greetings from Pellikan, Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, and the others.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I send to your kindness, most illustrious man, a copy of our confession and response published against the condemnation and slanders of Luther. You have seen, I suppose, what he wrote against the faithful pastor of the renowned church of Basel, Dr. Johannes Oekolampad, against Zwingli, against the people of Zurich, and against the churches to which we minister, how he accuses the living and the dead, and the innocent churches, of the heinous crime of heresy. We could not silently ignore all these things. Indeed, we are not a little displeased by the disputes and quarrels in the church of Christ. But, with the innocence of the saints preserved, the truth intact, and our affairs unharmed, how, I ask, could we remain silent in the face of such dire and atrocious crimes directed at us? Please read, if your duties allow, what we have responded. We seem to you not to have acted immodestly. However, if anything seems to have been done wrong, we will gladly hear from you, our brother. We hope, however, that you will not fail us, or rather the truth, if necessity ever demands it. For those who know you and have sometimes heard you discussing the sacraments have praised your integrity, as you do not attribute too much to them.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, I also wish to introduce myself into your friendship and into the list of your friends, and I pray that you will recognize me as a friend, unless I seem unworthy. I love you and will conduct myself in such a way that I will never regret the friendship we have agreed upon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned man. Dr. Pellikan, Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, and the others greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 14, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Martin Borrhaus, esteemed friend and brother. Basel.</p>
