    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Bullinger's reproach, Lavater explains his silence by stating that no reliable messenger could be found, so he postponed his letter to the time of the Christmas Mass. The father [Hans Rudolf], who was angered by Lavater's silence, should be appeased by this circumstance alone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The following description of Lavater's arrival [in Strasbourg] is certainly of interest to Bullinger, who is like a father to Lavater, as indicated by his letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In Strasbourg, Lavater first went to Richard Hilles and handed him Bullinger's letter [not received]. From there, he went to Matthäus Zell. In response to Bullinger's letter [not received], Zell replied that he could not be of service to Bullinger and [Konrad] Pellikan; he had taken in Gerhard thom Camph for a completely different reason than the people of Zurich seemed to assume. Nevertheless, he offered Lavater his hospitality until a suitable host could be found. He and his wife [Katharina Schütz] do not take in anyone due to their heavy workload and his advanced age.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- When Lavater inquired about [Johannes] Marbach during his search for another host, he encountered the Zurich native Jakob Gessner. [Lavater] conveyed Otto [Werdmüller's] advice to find another host; however, Gessner refused, as he could not imagine a better host than Marbach. Zell also advised Lavater not to go to anyone other than [Marbach], whose departure from Isny was not because he gave too much importance to the sacraments, but because he became a nuisance to the merchants with his sermons against usury. Even the people of Isny gave [Marbach] a good testimonial. Ambrosius Blarer even wanted to appoint [Marbach] in Konstanz, but he declined. Lavater then turned to [Petrus] Dasypodius, who was appalled by [Marbach's low regard among the people of Zurich]. He thought that Marbach, who had rejected other students because of the [Zurich people], would take it badly [if the Zurich students now moved away from him]. Consequently, Lavater agreed [to stay with Marbach], especially since he could change this decision later and did not want to upset the highly regarded Dasypodius in Strasbourg. And so [Dasypodius] brought him to Marbach. Marbach was pleased to hear that Lavater was a candidate of theology. The pension amounts to 30 guilders [annually], from which Marbach will hardly make a profit given the prevailing high prices.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The upright, educated, and pious Marbach disapproves of the church dispute. His wife [Ursula, née Weisland] is pious. Lavater's faith is not in danger, even if [Marbach] should dispute with him [about the Lord's Supper] and have the last word. Thanks to his solid knowledge of scripture, Lavater can resist the Lutheran and secular tricks. Marbach willingly answers all questions and provides everything [Lavater and Jakob Gessner] need. For their studies, they have received a quiet place away from the market. Marbach reads from the Epistle to the Romans in Greek and comments on Paul's line of thought. He also briefly explains the Gospel of Matthew and is now at Mt 8. [Lavater and Gessner] are examined by him daily.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Lavater is grateful to Dasypodius. He shows himself to be helpful. Thanks to him, Lavater was also admitted to the lessons [of the more advanced classes]. Lavater listens with great benefit to the interpretations of the Book of Exodus by Peter Martyr [Vermigli] and the Epistle to the Romans by Bucer. Bucer also offered Lavater his help, especially since he greatly appreciates the services rendered by Lavater's father to [Christendom]. Since Bucer was called to the Regensburg Diet [for the religious discussion], Peter [Vermigli] has now taken over the remaining lectures on the [Epistle to the Romans]. Lavater listens to the languages [Gerhard] Sevenus and [Johann Winter von] Andernach. The latter explains Demosthenes' speech against Aeschines. As soon as [Johannes] Sturm returns, Lavater wants to attend his dialectics class. He attends the lectures of [Justus] Velsius on Aristotle's "Politics" and also those on Cicero's "De partitione oratoria". Soon he will participate in [Johannes] Sturm's class on argumentation. The boys practice Cicero. The [Strasbourg] Gymnasium is an excellent nursery of the liberal arts and piety. Lavater is very grateful to Bullinger for sending him to Strasbourg. He intends to strive to exceed the expectations placed in him, in order to one day serve [Christendom].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger should apologize to Lavater's father on his behalf. He would have written to Bullinger long ago, and it may be that [since his arrival] some [people] have already traveled to the Confederation, but he has not heard about it. With the [Christmas] Mass, he would certainly have had the opportunity to entrust his letter to a reliable messenger, [if he could not have given it to the deliverer of Bullinger's letter].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to Bullinger, to his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and family, as well as to Josias Simler.</p>

      <p>S. D. P. You would rightly reproach me, most excellent patron of scholars, if I had neglected the duty of writing until now due to some forgetfulness or laziness, or if there had been such an abundance of messengers. But indeed, I did not find a reliable messenger who could deliver letters to you, so, driven by necessity, I postponed the duty of writing until the Christmas fair. I hear that I have incurred my father's displeasure due to my silence, and you command me to soothe my father's angry mind with a letter. But I think that the excuse of necessity is more than enough to appease him; for we are all compelled to obey necessity. Otherwise, I am not unaware of how harshly he takes silence and interprets it as some kind of insolence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>But leaving these matters aside, I will recount my journey a little more thoroughly. For I do not think this will be unpleasant to you; indeed, your letters seem to suggest this. Furthermore, there are no ordinary signs of your fatherly affection towards me. All these things promise that my letters will not seem talkative to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Upon entering Strasbourg, I first went to the house of Richard Hilles (and delivered your letters to him), who received me most kindly and promised to be diligent in my affairs. From there, I went to Mr. Matthäus Zell and explained your opinion of me. There I experienced the incredible piety and humanity of this man. After reading your letters, he replied that he was ready and willing to serve all brothers in Christ, not to mention you and Pellikan, but that it would not be in my interest in this matter. He explained that the reason for accepting Gerhard thom Camph was entirely different from what we might suspect. However, to avoid any unjust suspicion, he did not deny me his hospitality until either I or he could find a suitable host. The reasons for not taking anyone into his household are mainly these: His wife, pious and learned, is so burdened with various cares, partly visiting the sick, partly with domestic affairs (for she does not have a maid), that it is not free to take anyone into the house. Furthermore, the master is pressed by the weight of business, and old age, which is itself a disease, hastens. Finally, he was not accustomed to having boarders due to some kind of Cato-like severity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I could easily judge and observe that all these things were indeed so during the four days I enjoyed his hospitality. There I began to think about finding a pious host and to inquire more deeply into the affairs of Mr. Johannes Marbach. There, Jakob Gessner from Zurich presented himself to me. Wanting to encourage him according to Mr. Otto's advice to seek another host, he completely refused. Zell advised that I should go to him and no one else; for he is pious and learned, and the reason for his departure from Isny was entirely different from what we might suspect: not because he attributed too much to the sacraments, but because he was troublesome to the usurious merchants with his preaching. The people of Isny gave him testimonial letters (as they call them), which attest to his innocence. Furthermore, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer wanted to appoint him to the ministry of the church in Konstanz; he refused. But enough about this. Then I approached Mr. Dasypodius. He seemed to show some kind of indignation on his face (certainly not without reason). He said that Marbach would take it badly if, wanting to serve us in this matter, he had denied others boarding. Then I said, since things are as they are, I wish to be received into his household, fearing that I might make Dasypodius, whose authority is very powerful in Strasbourg, more unfavorable to me. He, having promised faith and silence, led me to Marbach, who, as soon as he heard that I was a candidate of sacred theology, praised my zeal greatly and said that I would be dearer to him because I was going to devote myself to the same study as he. However, Dasypodius only bound me in such a way that I could change my host whenever I wanted if I knew of a better one. The price, as he wrote to you, is 30 florins, although I frankly admit that in such high prices, not only of grain but of all things, he would not gain much profit, but more labor from us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>So I came to Mr. Johannes Marbach, when it was almost as if I were sitting on two chairs, as they say. But about this man, I can say nothing else (if I wish to speak the truth), except that he is a man of proven integrity, endowed with remarkable learning and piety, who is grieved by the discord of the churches and the turbulent state of our times. He similarly has a pious wife, etc. There is no danger to my faith, partly because the master is not troublesome to me in this matter (for what would he dispute with me? What if he were to win?), partly because, fortified by the solid pronouncements of sacred scripture, I can, with God's help, stand firm and unshaken against all the machinations of the Lutherans and this world. I could not correct anything in him, even if I wanted to. Whatever I ask, he is not reluctant to answer, indeed he encourages us to always bring something to the table. He provides everything we need abundantly. He has designated a place suitable for studies, away from the noise of the market. He reads to us from the Epistle to the Romans in Greek and shows the strength of Paul's speech. Then, since dialectics is the tool for both learning and handling all matters, both sacred and profane, he adds precepts of dialectics. He does not let any day pass without exercising us. But since it is now imposed to briefly explain all the books of the Old and New Testament, he began with the New Testament. He is now in the 8th chapter of Matthew, where he has found his footing, then he promised his help again in reading dialectics and rhetoric.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Therefore, I cannot but approve of Dasypodius's work and diligence unless I am ungrateful. He has also bound me to him not a little with many benefits. He has promised his help and wants me to flee to him as to a sacred anchor if I lack anything. Furthermore, thanks to his benefit, I have been admitted to public lectures. I listen to Exodus, which Mr. Peter Martyr expounds with a certain wonderful erudition and clear order, so that this lecture seems to bring me not a little benefit. Then the Epistle of Paul to the Romans by Bucer, who himself has promised me his help, because he hears that my father is highly commended to him for his piety towards the republic; and he has not once ordered me to follow in my father's footsteps. And certainly, he seems to favor the people of Zurich not a little, as I also understand from others. But since he is now called to the Diet of Regensburg, Mr. Peter has taken over the remaining lectures. In languages, I listen to Sevenus, a very learned man, a teacher of the first class, and Andernach, who explains Demosthenes' speech against Aeschines (we are still waiting for Sturm; then I will hear his dialectics), the books of Aristotle's "Politics" by Velsius. I also listen to the partition of oratory by Cicero. Soon I will hear Sturm's ἀποδεικτικά. Everything is read with the utmost diligence. The boys are exercised in Cicero. The gymnasium is a happy place for instilling the seeds of literature and piety. Therefore, I have and will have the greatest gratitude to you, both for taking care that I descend to Strasbourg for the sake of studies, and for having affected me with countless benefits and not ceasing to do so. In the meantime, I will strive with all my might that, as age increases, so also may honest learning and integrity of morals. I will make an effort to not only fulfill your expectation of me but in some way to surpass it, so that one day I may be able to benefit the safety of the republic and respond in some way to your benevolence towards me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>But perhaps I have said these things longer than happily. Nevertheless, it should be enough to have depicted the course of my life and studies with simple words. I will give more at another time if these are not sufficient. Now I do not want to disturb you any longer while you are busy. In the meantime, I beg your kindness to have me excused to my father. For I had written to you long ago, but I was forced to put aside the letters. For although many travel from Strasbourg to Switzerland, yet I am little allowed to know where they are. Three or four days ago I would have had the opportunity if I had preferred to give the letters to certain messengers at the fair.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I wish you well with your wife and the whole family. Do not disdain to convey my greetings to Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, from the house of Mr. Johannes Marbach at St. Nicholas, in the year 1546, on the 4th day before the Nones of January.</p>
      <p>Your Ludovicus Lavater from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father and lord. In Zurich.</p>
