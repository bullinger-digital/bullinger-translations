      <p>Greetings. I have absolutely nothing to write at the moment, except that your most recent letter, dated March 12th, was delivered to me today.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to resolve these disturbances.</p>
      <p>Nothing else is being written from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from Heidelberg and Augsburg at any moment. I will commend your faithfulness and diligence to Mr. MÃ¼ller.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls, Mr. Carlin, Mr. Pontasella, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 16, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, our Sebastian Guldibek, afflicted by apoplexy, passed away to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Thus, we are continually deprived of learned, good, and useful men.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
