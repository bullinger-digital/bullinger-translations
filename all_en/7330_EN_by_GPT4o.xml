      <p>Greetings. As I was about to write, most esteemed man and most venerable father to us all, your letters arrived, from which I joyfully understood that you have become somewhat stronger; may you be completely restored as soon as possible, so that the most holy church of Christ is not miserably deprived of your work. We will earnestly pray to the Lord that He may not wish to withhold His strength from you and may preserve you safe and sound for all of us for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>The news you sent attached to these, although now written differently than previously announced by some, do not offend us, knowing how much Mr. Peter von Grandson strives to adulterate everything and proclaim it far differently than it happened. But all those false speeches will one day be overcome by experience itself. What is more, our French are heard very badly among the citizens and all the common people, considering how deceitfully they have been imposed upon them and theirs, so much so that even prayers (the only refuge to God in miseries) are a fraud to themselves; for if they have prayed to God for victory, it is done to their own detriment, if they urge otherwise, they are praying against religion itself along with the happy course of the gospel. Not to mention how the legate boasts for the empire, as if he has redeemed the very bowels of the Rhaetians with his largesses as if they were all his own. Nor are there lacking those who now devise ways by which they can renounce the recently made treaty; indeed, many think they have the most just reasons for doing so, since he himself did not keep his part, secretly contracted friendship and alliance with the Spaniard against us and our religion, with the Spaniard, I say, whom we made hostile to us for retaining the French. Now this is the gratitude returned; now he proceeds to such audacity that he does not fear to threaten even the ministers, without whose work he could never have accomplished his plans for renewing the treaty.</p>
      <p>But however these things may be, I will now recount a new fear, which with a loud voice and great joy of heart was instilled in our people the day before yesterday. A breathless interpreter came to Mr. Charles, narrating that at the very hour he came, letters were brought to the legate from Zurich (they were brought by a boy sent from the inn at the Stork), in which it is most certainly written that Prince Condé is reduced to the utmost straits; for he is besieged at Orléans by an army of indeed 12,000 men, commanded by the king's brother.</p>
      <p>Our French color these things wonderfully, and the ears of all are still warm with such and many other things. But it is taken in a far different sense by others. Mr. Charles indeed heard it affirmed by a certain great man: that Prince Condé indeed betook himself to Orléans as to a place fortified by work and nature, and the king's brother with a great band of soldiers is feared around; but the admiral hastens by day and night marches to join his forces with the German cavalry, and with the forces joined, to repel the royal force here and there; but Domal and the younger Duke of Guise with a moderate army intend to forestall the admiral himself and prevent the junction of those forces, and there the issue of the matter will come into jeopardy, where they are said to besiege Condé or surround our people. The wife of our legate has a father presiding or judging at Orléans; therefore, she is said to be lying down, struck by that rumor; but the legate laughs at that pain, whence many gather that all things are feigned. They detest the Condés, whom they vociferate to rage in Turkish manner, to devastate all things, to destroy all things with fire, and to hold nothing in any esteem or sacred. Our soldiers had a plan to attack Mâcon before they departed; for unless they brought it into their power, they said they could by no means come to the king.</p>
      <p>Some of the captains secretly communicated this to their own, that as soon as they set foot in Gaul, they would be ready to besiege Mâcon; whence many think that not a few Swiss were also involved. - From Augsburg it is written to one of ours that a rumor is spread there that the Duke of Mantua, together with 15 companies of musketeers or artillerymen, has already crossed the Alps; so also from Ferrara, Florence, etc., great forces are being armed. Our people also assert this and add that Cardinal of Augsburg, Margrave of Nuremberg, etc., are gathering forces.</p>
      <p>It is strange, however, that the people of Augsburg can report so certainly (if it pleases the gods) about the Italians, and the Italians about the people of Augsburg. All things are doubtful and uncertain, and if ever, now the tongues and mouths of men are wandering. From the same Augsburg, it is announced and written that the King of Poland, with the consent of his subjects, has handed over his kingdom to the Voivode after his death and demise; therefore, Maximilian the Emperor has anxiously written and convened certain princes to Prague to deliberate what should be done in such a matter, since Germany would not be much cheered by such a neighbor. Concerning the same Emperor, a noble man, Balthasar Herliberger (who is at the court of Count Montfort and has come here these days to visit his relatives the Gugelbergs, a modest man, abstemious, adorned with much gold, silk, and other precious garments, and even with a necklace) - he reported and asserted as a certainty that Maximilian the Emperor sent envoys laden with gifts and many letters to Constantinople to the Turk; the Turk received the gifts, but kept or imprisoned the envoys and sent a truculent image of himself to the Emperor. Many wonder what this means. Perhaps it is to supplicate or seek some treaty with the non-Christian Turk, so that the war begun with the Christians is not hindered by any importunity, or the Turk himself is less inclined to the renewal of war, until they have exercised their slaughter in the church of Christ to their heart's content. - Our bishop (who recently used the same table with us at the wedding of Mr. Consul Willi's brother) reported as known that nothing is prepared for the Turkish emperor before the mild spring. He was displeased that a certain noble canon recently paid the bill for Gantner and me against our will, whence some suspicion of something arose with him. The Germans and Italians do not get along well in the castle; they constantly stir and exercise quarrels and enmities. - The captain (to return to war matters) Dietägius, very friendly to the legate, reports that the King of France by public edict has provided that no one in Paris may have paper and ink; therefore, it is not surprising that the Rhaetian captains write nothing from the camps. Oh, nonsense! etc. From Milan it is announced and written, says or writes Mr. Zanchus, that Cardinal Borromeo perished, having been killed by poison. May he rest in pitch. But I have detained your most holy ears with the whole body of my nonsense; I will contract the sails and bring the ship into port.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I beg, and interpret my loquacity kindly.</p>
      <p>Mr. Charles received everything from Mr. Beldi and shared it amicably. He greets you most dutifully along with Mr. Consul and Mr. Pontisella and Mr. Gantner, my dearest godfathers from my new son; thus I increase my affairs. May the Lord Jesus grant strength and triple brass to His churches, that they may decline and overcome this double evil and finally ascend to the heavenly citadels with such a leader, amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, swiftly, December 15, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
