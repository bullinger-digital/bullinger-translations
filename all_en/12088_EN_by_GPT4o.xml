    <p xml:id="regest1"> [The council and mayor of Constance] have already sent [Ludwig Kürnstaller] to King Ferdinand more than eight weeks ago, probably because of the Turkish tax and other levies [i.e., taxes] to be paid. After the gentlemen [of Constance] were invited to attend the Imperial Diet in Worms, they decided to appoint Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick, although he is reluctant to go there; the [Schmalkaldic] allies will gather in Worms a little earlier. The Emperor [Charles V] is said to be planning something against the Confederates; he has therefore written to the [Chamber Prosecutor] Fiscal [Valentin Gottfried], asking him to find a reason for an accusation; since [the Confederates have refused financial participation in the affairs of the Empire], he will persuade the estates at the upcoming Imperial Diet to impose the Imperial Ban on them; he will also claim assistance against them; there is a danger that this will be granted to him, as was the case against [King Francis I], when the Emperor turned a private matter into a public one; if this is true, then it is over for the [Confederation] and [Constance]; but God is more powerful. It would be good if they would unite more closely; for if the Emperor and France agree too much, it will be serious for [the Confederation and Constance]; as long as the Emperor has not subdued the Confederates, he is not master over Germany, as he fears an alliance between [Constance] and the Confederates; therefore, he will claim the assistance of the [Imperial] cities and estates against the Confederates; [if they comply with him], they would harm themselves, as he will claim everything else without effort in the event of success; may God thwart the plans of the princes; oh, if only the Confederates were united in the matter of faith! Just now [Ludwig Kürnstaller] returns from Vienna; he reports that King [Ferdinand I] showed favor to [Constance] and has written to [Hans Lochinger], the [Imperial Circle General Collector] of the levies, as well as to the Fiscal [Valentin Gottfried], to suspend all proceedings until further notice from the Emperor. The envoy, who has also heard of the Emperor's hostile plans against the Confederates, believes that the Emperor will find no support for this; [King Francis I] will also not assist him in this. The [Austrian] hereditary lands promise 22 tons of gold for the Turkish campaign; in Vienna, an insignificant person [prophesies] that God wants to deliver the city to the Turk; but no one pays attention to him, as once in Rome; the King rides out daily carelessly with Lady [Anna Jagiello] and daughters in a sleigh; and the Duchy of Upper Austria in vain demands God's word. </p>

      <p>My lords have sent a trusted man to King Ferdinand; he has been away for more than eight weeks now; I do not know when he will return or what he will accomplish; they think it is about the Turkish tax and other levies to be paid.</p>
      <p>So my lords have decided, after being earnestly invited, to attend the Imperial Diet in Worms, and have appointed my dear cousin Konrad Zwick for this, for whom the matter is extraordinarily difficult for many reasons; they think it will be a very challenging and difficult diet. Therefore, we pray to God from the heart that He may graciously arrange everything for the best. The Schmalkaldic allies will gather in Worms a little earlier than the diet begins, and will hold a separate meeting for some matters. May the Lord make everything turn out for His glory and honor; everything is difficult, and we have just cause to be distressed and to rejoice in our fatherland. I hear from some that the Emperor intends to take action against the Confederates. I have also written to the fiscal in such a way that he may find a reason for an accusation; and, since a negative response has been given, he intends to present this to the estates at the upcoming diet and to make it a common imperial matter, with a request for assistance from the Empire against the Confederates as the disobedient ones, who do not wish to fulfill their obligations. There is also concern that the Empire will grant him assistance, as happened previously with the French, when the Emperor turned a private matter into a public one. If this happens, then the way is already paved for your and our ruin, speaking humanly. But God is stronger than all; may He graciously be on our side as a father.</p>
      <p>Humanly speaking, it would serve the matter well if they would unite more closely. If the Emperor and France become too united, the third party will not be laughed at.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is concerned that he may not become master in Germany unless the Confederates are subdued; for he must fear that the city and the Confederates will join together. Therefore, he will approach the matter in such a way that the cities and other estates will help to make the Confederates obedient. By doing so, they create a rod for their own backs; for afterwards, if the Emperor succeeds against the Confederates, he would easily claim everything else. Sed dominus dissipat consilia principum. He will be wise and strong enough to maintain the matter. Oh, if only the Confederation were united in matters of faith! How many excellent people and estates would be willing to join them! O God, make it happen!</p>
      <p>Now, as I have written this, the envoy who was in Vienna on behalf of my lords returns. I hear that the king has shown himself very gracious, etc. Also, the General Collector of the levies, as well as the fiscal, have been instructed to suspend all proceedings until further notice from the Emperor. What this means, I cannot imagine. May God protect us from too much favor from the world, so that we do not fall into His disfavor because of it! Keep this to yourselves; few people know about it.</p>
      <p>This envoy also says that he has heard something is to be undertaken against the Confederates; and it is certain that the Emperor will find no support, etc.; the French will also remain inactive, etc. I will watch with all diligence and, as soon as I learn something substantial, let you know without delay.</p>
      <p>The hereditary lands down there have agreed that when the Turkish campaign begins, they will pay the 22 tons of gold. Meanwhile, an insignificant person in Vienna goes around the city, proclaiming that God wants to give the city to the Turk; but no one pays attention to him, just as in Rome. The king rides almost every day in a sleigh with the queen and the young ladies, his daughters; let the birds worry. Those above the Enns keep asking the king for God's word, but they cannot achieve anything.</p>
