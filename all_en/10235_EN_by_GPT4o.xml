      <p>I am sending you herewith some dried fish, as I promised you in recent days, which you and your dear wife and your master should eat soon on my behalf, because the longer they are kept, the less nutritious they become.</p>
      <p>Regarding the will, I will not forget about it; if it is somehow possible, I will arrange it and bring it with me next time, perhaps soon after Easter. Meanwhile and always, may God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Konstanz, 28th of March, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your willing Gregor Mangolt, bookkeeper.</p>
      <p>To the faithful, pious, and well-learned Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Gospel of Christ in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
