    <p xml:id="regest1"> The response of Antronius [Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] to the well-formulated letter from the Zurich council, which was handed over to the messenger [N.N.] by Itelhans Bertz, is not only arrogant but also dismissive, even harsh. The princely chancellor [Leonhard Hensler] announced that he had indeed taken note of the Zurich letter, but Bertz should not hope for or expect a response from him, as he would negotiate with the Zurichers [regarding the dispute]. However, since nothing can be legally charged against Bertz, it is certainly to be feared that Hensler will delay the negotiation until the Lucerne governor [in Thurgau] [Niklaus Cloos] takes office. To prevent this, the Zurichers must insist strictly on being fully informed about the accusation. Thus, [Holzhalb], if necessary, could set a negotiation date with Hensler for the next Baden Diet according to Bertz's wish. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> The princely bailiff of Romanshorn [Heinrich von Helmsdorf] is highly valued by the abbot solely for his reputation as an extraordinary, tireless enemy of the Protestants and is also the instigator of all discord. The more fiercely the entire court of this monster [Diethelm Blarer] rages against the Protestants, the more tyrannically and shamelessly the bailiff persecutes the poor Bertz! Bullinger should know this for that reason alone. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> Diethelm Blarer had engaged in a legal dispute with the city of St. Gallen [regarding customs duties] in the linen trade for his peasants, [to answer Bullinger's inquiry]. After taking note of the corresponding statement from the St. Gallen council, he withdrew his demands and now allows his subjects to pay all duties to the city of St. Gallen, which its residents also pay. Had he been unreasonable, the people of St. Gallen would have punished his [chancellor Hensler], this scoundrel, at a Baden Diet, even though they actually prefer peace and unity! </p>

      <p>The response of Antronius [Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] to the well-formulated letter from your most honorable council, which was handed over to our messenger Bertz, was not only arrogant but also dismissive, even harsh. These were the words of the chancellor: He had indeed understood the letter well and wanted only this, that Bertz should neither ask for nor expect any response from him. He would negotiate well with the Zurichers, etc. However, since he has nothing to legally charge against him, it is to be feared that he will cunningly delay the matter until the arrival of the Lucerne governor. This he will certainly do unless your people urge him to respond and promptly investigate the nature of the case, so that, if necessary, a date can be set for him at the next Baden Diet at Bertz's request.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Antronius has a bailiff in Romanshorn who is fiercely hostile to the true religion. This man (highly esteemed by him for that madness alone) is the author of all discord. But the insolence, more than tyrannical, with which the poor Bertz is afflicted, is all the greater, as the entire court and council of that monster is more atrocious against all lovers of Christ. I did not want this to remain hidden from you in the name of Bertz alone.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>How he had engaged himself on behalf of his peasants against our city (concerning the linen trade, etc.) and then reconsidered after seeing the written response from my lords, he has withdrawn. He allows his subjects to give and pay all that, along with the toll, which our citizens are obliged to give and pay. Had he persisted, we would certainly have punished the scoundrel before the Confederates, although peace and unity are much dearer to us.</p>
