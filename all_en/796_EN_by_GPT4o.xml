      <p>Greetings. While I await the opportunity to send you a letter, my dearest brother in the Lord, the delay is longer than I wished. I received on December 16 of the past year (would that all the troubles of the Church of Christ had passed with it) both your letter and the gift for the new year sent to Johann Heinrich, your son according to the sacrament of regeneration and mine according to the flesh, with a friendly and paternal spirit. May it be granted to you to remain alive for a while, but also in the peace you now have, for both the church and your household, until Johann Heinrich grows in age and in the grace of Christ and responds to the benevolence of your spirit. We give thanks to you in our name and in his, and we commend his infancy to your prayers before the Lord. May the Lord repay you a hundredfold and prosper your substance for His glory and for the benefit of yours.</p>
      <p>Moreover, unless I am mistaken, it is arranged here that on the following Saturday, envoys from our senate will be sent to you concerning our brother in the Lord, Mr. Haller, which is why I write this, so that if you think anything should be done upon their arrival, you may act in time, for I hope you will receive this on the day they depart from here.</p>
      <p>They will pass through Lucerne, as I hear, before they come to you. If it seems convenient, I beseech you to be present before them and remember me; for unless they will have regard for my necessity, I do not see how I can remain here; necessity itself will compel me to provide for my affairs elsewhere. Mr. Haller, our brother, bids me to hope well; may he not be mistaken.</p>
      <p>I hasten by the grace of the Lord to the end of my Psalter, which I can complete in a short time. Therefore, I would greatly wish that Mr. Gwalther would send back to me that part of it which he retained when I departed; for there are many things in it that need to be reviewed. He may perhaps do this through the one who delivers this, or through the ministers of our envoys. Convey to him and his wife my greetings in my name and inform them of this; I wrote to him recently about the same matter and do not doubt that he has received the letter.</p>
      <p>We wish, on behalf of all of us, a blessed, peaceful, and prosperous year to all of yours, young and old, and also to Mother Klunglerin. May the Lord protect you all from sorrow and trouble. Bern, January 7, 1550.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your brother in the Lord. And to our Mr. Gervasius, many greetings, and to the other lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
