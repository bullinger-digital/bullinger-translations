He read with pleasure the letter from Bullinger and Pellikan to [Johannes] Zwick, which did not reach him anymore. Recommends Jakob Frömbd. Ambrosius [Blarer] visited Konstanz secretly.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write about the expeditions of Charles. Unless there is something greater and more hidden (which I do not suspect), the enmity between the Emperor and the French over Milan is evident, and since I hear no consistent rumor that this war can be settled, the victory of either side is to be feared. The Emperor is greatly increasing his forces. As many cavalrymen as possible are being recruited across the Rhine. Many people do not have good omens for the French and assert that the French themselves are reluctant to engage in this war. We must await the will of the Lord, who knows what is expedient for His own.</p>
      <p>However, the present convention in Eisenach troubles me more, and I wish that someone from your side had attended, although your absence will have its own reason and benefit.</p>
      <p>Your letters and those of Pellikan did not reach Zwick, nor did I think to send them, as I knew he would be coming to you. I read them, opened by his order, with singular joy, as I understood that you have not yet diminished your zeal for genuine and chaste Christian piety. I commend to you Jakob Frömbd, our fellow citizen; for he has always seemed pious to me and worthy of assistance. He is struggling to make a living here. If any opportunity arises with you, he would not hesitate to move to you. As far as I have known him, I have found him to be trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers.</p>
      <p>My brother Ambrosius hid here in recent days, associating with close friends and brothers, whose mind on present matters, I believe, you have perceived from Zwick.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger; love me in Him, as you do.</p>
      <p>May 12, 1536. In Konstanz.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Evangelist of the people of Zurich, his singular lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
