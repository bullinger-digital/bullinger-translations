      <p>Grace be with you.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you that book of yours, which has now also become mine through your dedication, dearest Heinrich, and at the same time, I express my gratitude for your diligence, not only in my name but in the name of all pious scholars, whom, believe me, you have uniquely bound to you with a special benefit through such holy labor, even though they were already most devoted to you. Indeed, after I read this with great pleasure and eagerness, I judged it not only worthy but almost necessary to be handled by everyone, since even the simplest will clearly understand from this on which crumbling wall those shameless and foolish boasters of antiquity lean, who think they can seek the most fortunate defense of all their errors from those who were closest to the times of Christ and the apostles, when, upon careful consideration, their authority does not press us so much that the truth of their doctrine also agrees with us, from which we may borrow many and inevitable weapons against our adversaries. Therefore, ensure that the edition of this most useful book, which will benefit everyone, is published promptly, for as far as the printer is concerned, I would not begrudge this great profit to our Spitzenberg, unless I considered the interests of many more than of one. He has somewhat inelegant types, a sample of which I am sending to you here, and furthermore, it is entirely lacking in Hebrew and Greek characters, and although he is now contemplating a better-equipped workshop, it is uncertain, due to the man's misfortune, when that will be prepared. However, I would not want the expectation of so many scholars to be delayed longer for the sake of his [!] convenience, but I leave it to you to entrust this book to either Wolf or someone else to be printed as soon as possible, provided it comes out more corrected than the previous one, which needed your revision. Moreover, my sweetest brother, at this time, whether I want to or not, I am prevented from writing much to you according to my heart's desire. But in a few words, know this: however little I am, I am yours, and nothing has ever been more pleasing and delightful to me than that sincere friendship of yours, which the common zeal for Christ, our common Savior, has joined me to you, as well as other most honorable reasons with a certain hidden but effective harmony of souls. Would that there might be some occasion when I can equally declare and pour out this heart most loving of you! Now commend me to Christ in a Christian manner, in whom fare well.</p>
      <p>From our Constance, on the first of September. Greet in my words the venerable abbot and your steward. I will write more to you soon; now I have by chance encountered a Zurich notary. My brother Thomas greets you. 28.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger at the Grossmünster in Zurich, a friend as dear as a brother.</p>
