      <p>Greetings. I did not respond sooner to your letter written on November 24th, as it seemed to require nothing. I had previously written to you that the King of Navarre was in Orléans with the king and that his brother, Prince de Condé, was being held captive there. It is rumored that many of the leaders have followed the advice of Alcibiades: when you can flee, do not seek a quarrel. However, in many places, not a few have been thrown into prison because they are thought to have abused the king's clemency and supported the uprisings, and Cardinal de Tournon brought new plans from Rome and succeeded in having the continuation of the Council of Trent approved, which had previously been rejected by all votes.</p>
      <p>On the tenth day of this month, the assembly or council of all of France will begin in Orléans, where there are still some notable soldiers to instill fear in those eager for new things. The envoys of the Duke of Savoy and the Bernese left Neuchâtel with nothing accomplished, and everything was postponed to the tenth of February. Those who were in Lucerne passed through here after concluding a treaty with the Five Cantons and the people of Solothurn. I do not think the Five Cantons will take any action before the assembly of the next month; they had gathered because of the words of a certain bailiff Freuwler.</p>
      <p>There are those among them who ignite the torches and try to deceive, so that they may be thrown into plunder and danger. I am sending you a summary of what has been written to me from Italy, which will be shared with Lord Martyr along with greetings and friends. If you have any news, please write to us, so that the horses of the couriers do not perish from excessive idleness.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 2nd.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
