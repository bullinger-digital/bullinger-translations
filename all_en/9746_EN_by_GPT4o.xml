      <p>Greetings. I had already prepared those other letters four days ago, intending to send them to you either through my son, who was about to set out there, or through our courier, who has departed to you these days; but both of them disappointed me, my son because he was occupied and detained by the affairs of the chancellery and could not go, the other because he had entrusted the task to him. Meanwhile, I received yours through this courier of yours and sent them to my, indeed our, Steiger; but I have not yet been able to meet him in person. May the Lord avert these Jesuit plagues from us! Meanwhile, the royal envoy also writes to our people, requesting passage for the Polish king through our city.</p>
      <p>Our citizens are quite restless, as one wants to grant this, while another does not; however, I think he will not set out this way. Meanwhile, if he wishes, I do not know how he can be honorably denied, since we are bound to him by an eternal peace treaty.</p>
      <p>We have also received from Strasbourg those things which I am sending herewith; you will see how that king departed from Poland like a cat out of a dovecote.</p>
      <p>I decided to send the previous ones as well, not because they contain anything special, but because in them I return those things which you had already sent to me before.</p>
      <p>Farewell and farewell again. I cannot yet respond to what D. Simler proposed; however, I will do so shortly. Meanwhile, you will diligently greet him for me.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th of July, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
