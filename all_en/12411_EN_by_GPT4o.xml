    <p xml:id="regest1">On [February 28], Haller [with his wife Elsbeth, née Kambli, daughter Agnes and Marx Vogel] arrived in Augsburg after a difficult journey due to the strong gusts of wind. They were once again received very honorably by the council. Until the apartment is set up for them, they are staying with [Georg] Frölich. A new house was even built for them. [Former] mayor [Hans] Welser has been very committed to this and is also involved in furnishing the apartment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Wolfgang] Musculus greeted Haller kindly. How he reacted to Bullinger's letter [No. 2358], Haller does not know, as he has not encountered him since then.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In Memmingen, Haller was joyfully received by Gervasius [Schuler]. After he took note of Bullinger's letter [No. 2361], he did not show up again, not even at the shared dinner, although he intended to participate. Schuler's colleagues were surprised by this, but not Haller, who knows the reason for this behavior.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Frölich will convey the news. On April 1, a [Schmalkaldic League] meeting is scheduled in Worms, to which [Charles V], accompanied by an army, will also come. In the diocese of Bremen, new troops are to be recruited against the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. According to a letter from Nuremberg, Luther died on February 17 [correct: 18]. At the [Second] Regensburg [Religious Discussion], various matters are being negotiated. Bucer, however, remains the same. May the Lord protect the churches from the Antichrist and half-Christians!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller sends the books requested by Bullinger. There is nothing new from the booksellers in Leipzig. Some say that death prevented Luther from completing his [work against the Sacramentarians]; others say he was dissuaded by the pleas of friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger may forgive Haller's haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] [Sebastian] Schertlin will take [Hans] Wilpert Zoller for a year. The Augsburg authorities will cover the costs. However, Zoller must provide services for Augsburg when needed. This was reported by the city clerk [Frölich].</p>

      <p>Greetings. We arrived in Augsburg on the last day of February, safe indeed, but after a very difficult journey due to the strong winds. The council received us very honorably once again. Furthermore, Laetus, in his usual kindness and benevolence, did not want us to stay with anyone else but him until everything related to the household was abundantly prepared. They even built a new house. In the meantime, they splendidly furnished it with furniture and all necessary utensils; in this matter, former mayor Welser worked hard and continues to do so. Moreover, everyone offers their services to me, unworthy as I am, with great benevolence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I do not know how Musculus responded to your chosen letters; for I have not yet met him, although he kindly received me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Gervasius of Memmingen received us with great joy. However, after I gave him your letters, he returned home. After reading them, he never showed himself to us again, even though he had promised to come to dinner. I alone knew the reason, while the other brothers were surprised that he did not attend the dinner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will learn more certain news from Mr. Laetus. A meeting is scheduled in Worms on the first of April, to which the Emperor will come, accompanied by a large army. They also say that new troops are being gathered in the diocese of Bremen against the Landgrave. Furthermore, some letters sent from Nuremberg testify that Luther passed away on the 17th of February. Many deceitful and treacherous things are happening in Regensburg. Bucer remains always the same, whoever may defend his attempts. We will pray to the Lord to protect our churches from the impious machines of the Antichristians and semi-Christians. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am sending the booklets you wanted to be sent to you. The booksellers from Leipzig have brought nothing new. Some say that Luther was prevented by death from finishing the work he had begun; some confirm that he was hindered by the prayers of friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Whatever it may be, I rejoice if the stumbling blocks are kept away from the churches. Farewell and forgive me; for I wrote in haste. On the first of March, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>The matter of Wilpert Zoller is going well. Schertlin will have him with him for a year, but not as a servant. The Augsburg authorities will provide for his expenses, but in such a way that, if they need his services, he will not refuse to serve them. This was reported to me by the city clerk.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful president of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
