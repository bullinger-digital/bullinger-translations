      <p>He sends his regards. Your letters, Reverend Bullinger, have been delivered to me and they are the most eagerly awaited of all. I was indeed afraid that everything had been lost, since Froschauer, after the recent market, did not respond to my letters written to him, as I had requested. But now everything is safe. Nor do I doubt that, with your immense authority among all printers, you will easily obtain such a Bible as was made in the time of Origen, namely the Hexapla (six translations set in columns on each page). However, I wanted to consult you, even if I obtained nothing. From our very great Brentius, I could never again take back the Tigurine Bible, which was granted to him for use, as I hear it is so pleasing to him. Then also Castalio's is soon to be given to him. These things are true in the sight of God. But what could more fittingly adorn your venerable gray hair, or with what ornaments could it be more honored, than by being the author of this Bible to be published?</p>
      <p>To die for such a holy work would also be sacred and beautiful.</p>
      <p>For the fathers are not to be considered demented by a foolish plan, who have committed so many translations placed side by side. However, I do not inquire about the chorographs.</p>
      <p>I only desire an expanded index for Ptolemy's maps. For you know it is most beautiful in that author to have seen and measured the position of all places. But it is very difficult for us unskilled to find the position of all places in so many maps at once, unless we are helped by the service of a carefully arranged index placed according to the alphabet. Now, I say, I was perhaps imprudently seeking only the index. For thus the whole Ptolemy would be better. Indeed, it has an index at the front, but it is too cut off, then a very broad one at the back through all six books, but not arranged according to the order in which everything is found in readiness. Moreover, you say your Frisius has established, indeed almost completed, such a dictionary, of which I gave you a written sample from my son.</p>
      <p>Your son-in-law Simler could not be overcome by the greatest obstinacy to give me the whole day. He says indeed that you are writing on the 12 minor prophets and have prepared a calculation of the years. How I wish Lord Anselm Ryd had included his calculation of the years with drawn lines throughout the whole Chronicle (as he did on folio 61). For indeed all students are greatly delighted and helped by such tables.</p>
      <p>I have nothing certain of new matters. For the Margrave is fighting with the Nurembergers with the most hostile but doubtful fortune after inflicting many bitter defeats on them, as you yourself know from others. Then armies are being recruited everywhere and a levy of ten banners will soon be held on the border of Bruchsal, which will be auxiliary to the bishops. For they are nourished by some hope that with the help of these and Duke Henry of Brunswick, they will force the enemy to leave their lands, compelling him to place his last steps. Many other things could also be written, which you will now more conveniently learn from these your envoys.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I bid your venerable highness to be well, to whom I commend myself entirely. Write, I beseech you, something further under the Frankfurt market, so that I may have something from which to rejoice from the heart, or have your son-in-law write to me, so that I may at least know how you are.</p>
      <p>Given on the 16th of June in the year etc. 1553.</p>
      <p>Peter Venetscher of Wallis.</p>
      <p>I also ask your majesty, that for your august gentleness you do not disdain to grant some place to these my prayers. And if any of these things I ask should happen to be published in print, that you notify me with some writing or through your son-in-law Simler.</p>
      <p>I will also write to all the Frankfurt markets. Again, in the bowels of Jesus Christ our peacemaker, I beg you to commend me at some time to Lord Brentius or Greter with letters. For you know that this kind of people is hated by all the nations of the superiors. To whom you, father of our country, make me somewhat more commendable. My Adam invites and calls me with the greatest munificence through a certain most illustrious prince with letters written in Latin by the prince-bishop's own hand and sealed with red wax, so that I might even abandon and go over to his dominion and religion. But in vain. Yet through this evangelical religion, it is enough to be lean. However, it would be better to hunger for a time, so that afterwards we may be perpetually satisfied.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the greatest man of all theologians and the most sacred overseer of religion among the Zurichers, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Nor do I doubt that you, with your immense authority among all printers, will easily obtain such a Bible as was made in the time of Origen, namely the Hexapla - six translations set in columns on each page. However, I wanted to consult you even if I obtained nothing. - From our very great Brentius, I could never again take back the Tigurine Bible, which was granted to him for use, as I hear it is so pleasing to him.

      <p>Hence, I congratulate all on the studies of the Muses to be initiated, especially my four sons who are soon to be destined for this study as well. Nor do I doubt that it will be of the greatest benefit to all.</p>
