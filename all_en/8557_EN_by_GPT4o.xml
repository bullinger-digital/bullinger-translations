      <p>My willing service and friendly greetings beforehand, venerable, dear sir and godfather. Your friendly letter has reached me, and you should know in response that the people of Schwyz have earnestly ordered those from Lachen to bring all their books, especially those printed in Zurich, except for the Bibles, to the town hall. This has now happened. They shamefully had them burned on Monday, the 7th of May. However, we have not yet heard whether this was done by specific individuals or by the executioner; this indicates a tyrannical power that these people have in mind; may it turn out for them as God wills. However, we have not heard anything further than what I have written before.</p>
      <p>Today, our council's envoy, Stadtholder Häßi, has ridden to Rapperswil, where last night Lord Ammann Beldi was with him and asked him in a friendly manner if he might know what the three cantons Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, along with their people from Rapperswil, intend to undertake.</p>
      <p>He swore he knew nothing about it. However, some speculate and believe it might soon also concern the books; for there are said to be many Bibles in Rapperswil. Others believe they will discuss the castle, artillery, and ammunition with them; others have different opinions, and it is very strange to them, even to the highly intelligent, that they write to them about a messenger to their people in Rapperswil without indicating any reason why this should be done. It pains all good-hearted people the shameful contempt with the burning of the divine word, and consequently the attachment, what was printed in Zurich, and that in Lachen and elsewhere, where the people of Schwyz have ordered, no other Bibles should be had in the future than those of Doctor Eggen, etc. I inform you of this in good faith, since you in your letter as if you had already heard and known about it, make no mention. But otherwise, the burning is certain and true; for a Gugelberg from Lachen, who was appointed by the people of Schwyz and the village of Lachen as an envoy in our land, to solicit a donation for their church, which they are now rebuilding, and was here this week, told this to Stadtholder Häßi himself and others and indicated with pain that he did not want to give up his Bible; they took it from him by force and also burned it, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on Sunday before the sermon, the 13th of May, anno 71.</p>
      <p>Greet all the lords and brothers for me, also your dear household. All dear lords, Beldius, Arienus, our treasurer, and the rest also greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hugo, your godfather and son from Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, his dear lord and godfather, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
