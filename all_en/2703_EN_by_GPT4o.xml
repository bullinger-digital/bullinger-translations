      <p>Noble Tadeus Dunus, our physician from Locarno and faithful brother, who is now staying with you, requested by letter that a copy of this petition (most illustrious lord of mine), which you sent me to the church of Locarno in past days, be sent to him by me from here to Zurich. For, as you know, your affairs were safely entrusted to me, and I am returning to you through this faithful Locarnese brother the letters you entrusted to me. It will now be your freedom to provide the physician with a copy of the letters. However, I wish to reveal my advice to your kindness, if our Locarnese still attempt to try something against the enemies of the gospel: I would not want to provoke these savage papists at this time, who can be tamed neither by threats nor by kindness, but rather to endure and suffer any injury, force, and insult, until the merciful heavenly Father, who takes special care of us through that sin, liberates and defends us from their power and cruelty. Your prudence, which knows and foresees all these things far better than I myself do, will be able to provide the best advice to our brothers in Locarno. It will be their duty to obey your commands.</p>
      <p>From Italy, I have nothing certain to write to you, except for the siege of the town named Santya, in which there are about four thousand Frenchmen. The Spanish leader is attempting to attack it with thirty thousand soldiers. It has now been a month and a half since the town has been surrounded by enemies, and the outcome of the war is still uncertain. If anything new happens worthy of memory, you will know it faithfully from me. In the meantime, farewell and do not forget your Antonio Mario, who loves you diligently, I ask. From Chiavenna, not on the calends of September 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety, learning, morals, and virtue, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, my most esteemed lord. From Zurich.</p>
