    <p xml:id="regest1">There is great confusion; action has been taken against the powerful pension recipients; they blame the pastors for this, who have opposed this outrage and find themselves in greater danger than ever before; Bullinger and his church should pray for them. Greetings. The letter carrier Stephan [Willi?] will report more details.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. It is not necessary for me to speak with you at length, dearest Bullinger. We are in great confusion. Action has been initiated against the pension recipients, so that they may be corrected and brought into order; however, their impudence, through the multitude and prominence of the people involved, has gained such strength that they refuse to abide by the law. Meanwhile, they cast all blame on us, who proclaim the word of God, because we have always opposed this crime in our sermons. They fabricate foul lies against us, twist our words, so that we are in greater danger now than ever before. We only wish to ask you and the brothers to pray to the Lord for us with your church, so that, freed from these troubles, we may conveniently reach the tranquility of life. Farewell together with all the brothers. February 21, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Blasius, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, Stephan, will explain everything better than we could write; we also ask that he be recommended to you.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, foremost friend and brother in Christ.</p>
