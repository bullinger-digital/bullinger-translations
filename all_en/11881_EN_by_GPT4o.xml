    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer, in despair over Germany, as the Germans allow the Emperor to enter the country with a foreign army against their oath, sends a letter with news about the [upcoming] Imperial Diet [in Speyer]; if only the Christians think correctly about repentance, they will not be abandoned. News from [Kaspar] Hedio from the Margraviate of Baden: The Dane [King Christian III of Denmark] has captured many Hamburg, Bremen, and Dutch cargo ships like a pirate; Bohemians and Silesians returning from Hungary are planning another campaign [to defend against the Turks] for the coming spring; the plague is rampant in Poland; the Wallachian and [the] Moldavian [Voivode, Radu Paisie and Petru Rare»ô] could have caused [the Turks] many difficulties in Bulgaria if [King] Ferdinand [I] had defeated them in Hungary; the Crimean Tatars are a burden to Poland and Russia; the Turks want the Hungarians to abandon their numerous castles. The Cardinal, who is buying books in Basel and Zurich for unknown reasons, arouses astonishment. [Bonifacius] Amerbach was informed that the Pope had a Cardinal poisoned. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Bucer entrusted me with these letters to ensure they reach you. This was done so that you might be freed from any doubts regarding the Imperial Diet. He mentioned to me that he wrote very little on this matter. From my own understanding, it is clear that Bucer has despaired over Germany unless the Lord intervenes. The Germans erred by allowing the Emperor to enter Germany with a foreign army against their oath, which they are compelled to give to the electors at the beginning. Therefore, if penalties are to be paid, on what grounds will they be justified? This is what I have long lamented, that God has taken away counsel from the Germans. However, those whom the Lord has blessed with His gospel, if they think rightly about repentance, will not be abandoned. Let us, therefore, who are entrusted with the word of the Lord, ensure that we have God as our friend and guide those committed to our faith, as much as we can, in the way of peace, and commend the rest to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Hedio writes from the Margraviate of Baden, reporting the following in recent days: The Dane, acting like a pirate, has captured many cargo ships from Hamburg, Bremen, and Holland. The Bohemians and Silesians, having returned home from the Hungarian borders, are preparing another campaign for the early spring. The plague is raging fiercely in Poland. The Wallachian and Moldavian could have caused much trouble in Thrace if Ferdinand had pressed them in Hungary. The Crimean Tatars, inhabitants of the Tauric Chersonese, are very troublesome to the Poles and even to the Russians, whom we call the Rus. The Turks want the Hungarian nobles to abandon their numerous castles and inhabit some hastily constructed houses. This is what he reports.</p>
      <p>We all wonder what reason drives that Cardinal to buy so many books both here and with you. If he intends to burn them, he seems foolish; if he intends to read and refute them, he is undertaking the task too late; if he intends to read them to learn, may the Lord be with him. It has been written to Amerbach that the Pope invited several Cardinals to his table and poisoned them all at once. This is all I could write for now. Farewell in Christ with your family and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, January 3, 1544. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
