      <p>As for what you suggest, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, regarding the arrogance of some people arising from the outcome of the French war, I easily place trust in your writings. But the Lord lives, who will restrain the efforts of the wicked, and therefore I am very much amazed that your Cantons (I mean yours, who are of the evangelical religion; for there is certainly nothing to be amazed about the others) are so intent on this our episcopal matter, as they have always been, that they defend and protect the bishop and the bishopric, etc. However, I do not imply this because I am in any way complaining about the very illustrious man, Mr. Consul from Cham; for he has indeed been kind and favorable to us in this matter as he always has been, with decorum. And if only he had been present at the first Swiss delegation sent to us; for if he had been present, we would not have been agitated by such storms until now. But it was evidently in the fates that our House of God would be shaken by internal hatreds until now; may it not also collapse! As for your friendly and fatherly concern for us from Salis, and your advice on what you think we should do, I sincerely thank you on behalf of myself and all the rest of our family, and we have been and will continue to be mindful of your advice in the future, so that no one can rightly rebuke us for not being amenable in every situation, and to sum up: as we have never been evasive, but have always acquiesced to equity, so now we will attempt nothing but what is fair and just, indeed we will even cut from our own rights to ensure the safety of the homeland. What the Swiss envoys have now accomplished with us, you will learn from the aforementioned illustrious man, Mr. from Cham. - As compensation for the loss inflicted during the panic tumult that arose among us, I have been awarded a sum of 1400 gold florins, part of which I have already received, and the rest I will soon receive, God willing. May the Lord prosper this state of ours, which is quite tranquil and happy, from good to better. - There is nothing new here that I can inform you of, except that there is a great scarcity of grain among us, indeed of almost all things necessary for sustenance.</p>
      <p>[...] who himself also attended the present assembly in the name of our community.</p>
      <p>Chur, 26th of November, 1569.</p>
      <p>If I were present in person, I would speak with you about many things that cannot be safely committed to writing.</p>
