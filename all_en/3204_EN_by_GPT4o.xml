      <p>S. P. I received your letter, most vigilant Antistes, written on the twenty-sixth day of March, on the twenty-fifth day of May. From which, when we understood that all your affairs were in a good place, we were not moderately cheered. This only renewed our sorrow, that you repeat about the death of the most holy man, Mr. Pellicanus, and that man of the ancient golden age. But this sorrow of ours was somewhat alleviated by the fact that Mr. Peter Martyr (Pietro Martire Vermigli), my esteemed teacher, succeeded him, whose sharpness, learning, and judgment everyone admires and laments that he does not bring more of his intellectual offspring to light. But this pious complaint of many about him will be removed, I hope, now that he has found such quiet and study-friendly seats. I wrote to you not so long ago about the arguments of Menno (Menno Simons) concerning the incarnation of the Lord Christ. If there is anything in it that you have noticed, I pray that you do not hesitate to transcribe it to me as soon as possible. If my apology succeeds happily, there is hope that Menno's kingdom, which extends very widely in all these maritime regions, from the farthest shores of Flanders to Danzig (Gdańsk), will be diminished. I have already been called to Frankfurt for the sake of a colloquy, which should be privately instituted among the German pastors of Frankfurt and foreigners about the Lord's Supper; but I can hardly be torn away from here because of Menno's apology and also because of another one, which I am meditating against Wesphalus (Joachim Westphal) because of his lies, by which he has most unjustly accused not only me privately but all the Frisian churches and has defamed us before the whole world. This apology, I hope, will come out at the next Frankfurt fair, if the journey to Frankfurt does not impede my writing. Among other things, we have decided to refute that fabrication of Marcius / Martinus? Fabri about the interrupted recitation of the entire institution among the Nordans, as he charges us in the book of the Saxon confession, which I do not doubt you have seen and read.</p>
      <p>There is a young man of excellent promise, to whom I have entrusted this letter to be delivered to you, who, if he stays in Strasbourg (Argentinę) for the sake of study, will send this to you enclosed in his own; whom I pray that, when he comes to Zurich (Tigurum), you do not hesitate to assist with your counsel. We hope he will still be a useful minister of the church of God among our people.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In great haste, Norden, June 5, 1557. I pray you to greet all my most esteemed teachers, Mr. Bibliander (Theodor Bibliander), Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Gesner (Conrad Gessner).</p>
      <p>[It would] not be unwise to encourage Doctor Albert of Bremen to constancy.</p>
      <p>Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>The Count of Rietberg (Reydberganus) is still besieged, but shortly he will be forced to surrender to the enemies due to the lack of grain, as we hope.</p>
      <p>Our church is now (thanks be to God) in a good and peaceful place.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
