      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I sent to you the acts of the Diet of Augsburg, now I send to you the laws of the Geneva academy and what has been written from Lyon. On the 17th, the king was anointed. Philip is now in Spain.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy is still with the King of France. I hope to see you soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 21st of September.</p>
      <p>Yours if his own.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his friend.</p>
