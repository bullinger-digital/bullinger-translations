      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, dated November 17, December 6, and the latest on the 8th of the same month. I have written most of what is with us to my brother today, but since many things were discussed in the senate today, which I learned from certain friends, I wanted to share them with you as well. Firstly, the people of Basel and Schaffhausen have written to my lords in a very friendly manner, offering much good not only for the common cause and the matter of Glarus, but also on behalf of the Duke, which my lords were very pleased to hear and were greatly delighted by.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was also suggested from Zürich whether it would be appropriate to request a meeting day together or otherwise write to the people of Zürich in a friendly manner. Regarding the meeting day, my lords thought, as you also wrote to me, that it might be taken as a particular annoyance; however, regarding the special writing, my lords also thought it should not be done, because they might thereby be suspected by some, as if they were acting solely on behalf of the new land, to involve others in the matter, which might be harmful to them. Therefore, it was decided to instruct the messengers, who will come the next day, to discuss all matters orally with the three cities, and they understand well that they would like your messengers to have the authority to confer and deliberate with them on all matters. And I have been told so much that it seems to me they have informed you of this through my writing and have thus sought to engage with yours.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do what you think is necessary in this matter. Otherwise, they write back to the people of Basel and Schaffhausen in a very friendly manner, which is why I would like it if my lords were written to from Zürich before the day; that would greatly please them. They are holding back only because of the aforementioned reason.</p>
      <p>The people of Schaffhausen have also reported many strange tidings, which they have also written to yours joyfully. My lords also report all the things they have.</p>
      <p>Foremost is the persistent rumor of King Francis's death, which has come to my lords from many places. What turmoil there is in Freiburg, how they are preparing a storm and making strong preparations, and also how my lords will send an embassy there tomorrow and perhaps also to Solothurn, about which my brother will inform you. Today, they have also written to my lords in a very friendly manner and thanked them for breaking all negotiations that took place in Neuchâtel, and that a meeting has been scheduled in their city along with the people of Valais, which will take place on the 12th day, as it is called, of the next year. I have shared your last letter with my lord of Diesbach.</p>
      <p>He thanks and greets you; he intends to write to you himself; but I think he is prevented by many affairs, as he has ridden to Basel today. For what reason, I do not know; I suspect, however, for the sake of either visiting or marrying a wife. He also gave me the copy of the Glarus letter, which I hereby send back to you.</p>
      <p>My lords greet you all in general, especially Haller, Hag, Vischer, the treasurers, Emanuel, and others; the same do my mother, wife, father-in-law, Musculus, and all brothers. May all who are with you be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 14, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
