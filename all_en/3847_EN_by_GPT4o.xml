      <p>Greetings in the Lord abundantly.</p>
      <p>I send to you the Congratulations, just today first coming off the press and still breathing with the bellows, as they say. I have sent two copies of it this very morning to England, one to Queen Elizabeth, the other to the Duke of Norfolk, who was once my student; the third I now send to you as a token of my friendship and duty towards you. May you, in your kindness, receive this small gift with the same heart with which it was sent to you; for I know that due to your very serious occupations, you do not have the leisure to read and judge our trifles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it will be enough for me to declare my not insignificant goodwill towards you in this small matter. And so much for now due to the shortness of time and the haste of these matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 21, 1559.</p>
      <p>John Foxe, the Englishman, yours entirely in Christ. I, Oporinus, greet you, yours, as you know, from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the ecclesiastic of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
