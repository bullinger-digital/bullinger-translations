    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks, especially also in the name of [Diethelm] Röist, for Blarer's letter and for his loyalty to Zurich and the Zurich church. Death of his son Diethelm, who has now overcome all misery. Regrets that there was no opportunity to show more kindness to Zwick's wife. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks, not so much in my own name as in the name of Mr. Röist, for your letters and your utmost loyalty to our city and church; may the Lord repay you. You will have done a most pleasing thing if you continue in this way.</p>
      <p>In these days, the Lord has taken from me my most beloved little son Diethelm; but it is well with the little one, who has once and for all overcome many calamities.</p>
      <p>We wished to show some kindness to the most honorable lady of Zwick, but the opportunity was lacking; for we love you all sincerely.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of June 1542.</p>
      <p>Greet your brother and cousins. Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most pious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant pastor of Constance, his own. Constance.</p>
