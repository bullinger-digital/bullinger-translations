    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller must convey a most disastrous message to his esteemed father Bullinger. Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, who was believed to redeem Israel (to speak with the disciples of Emmaus), has been captured! This disaster was not without prior signs in the sky. One morning in Augsburg, two swords were observed fighting each other, one of which, although it fought bravely, was eventually defeated. Haller has already reported on this event in his last letter [No. 2888]. Now that the event has occurred, it becomes clear what God, indeed nature itself, wanted to indicate through this strange phenomenon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The following is the report that reached Augsburg about this disaster: The Elector preempted Emperor Charles V in the conquest of Erfurt. The city was taken by Colonel Georg von Reckerode. Then the Elector moved towards Wittenberg to prevent the Emperor from conquering the city. On April 21, 22, and 23, there were fierce battles with many casualties. The Elector remained victorious throughout.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On April 23, he gathered 500 cavalrymen and eight or nine companies around him and rode a little away from this troop along the Elbe River, under the false assumption that he would be safe from an attack by the river! However, the Emperor, informed by his spies, immediately sent 2000 hussars after him, who, thanks to the information from some peasants, found fords where they managed to cross the river. They were then able to corner the Elector. He was injured in the face and had to surrender. His eldest son [Johann Friedrich the Middle] is said to have been shot. How pitiful! It is said that no more than 500 men perished because the Elector's troop immediately capitulated. They believed they were dealing with the entire army of the Emperor. However, the main army of the Elector was not scattered. Meanwhile, even 15,000 Bohemian soldiers are said to have joined him. Allegedly, the entire population of Saxony is also armed. Johann Ernst of Saxony-Coburg, the [half]brother of the Elector, is also ready. [During the capture of the Elector] on April 24, [Ernst III of Brunswick]-Grubenhagen (whom Rudolf Gwalther and Haller often saw in Marburg) is also said to have been captured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Haller has always feared that the idolatrous doctrine of the Lord's Supper of the Saxons would bring disaster and that something must happen for them to realize that they unjustly condemned the [Zurichers] for the disaster that befell them [in 1531].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] What hurts the most is the following: When Bernhard von Schaumburg, the colonel of the imperial garrison in Augsburg, heard of this defeat on April 30, he fired celebratory shots from all cannons with the council's approval and to the distress of all the pious! Soon after, he was punished by God for it. For on May 1, the great wall at the Red Gate collapsed (Lorenz Meyer will know which one).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On May 1, the colonel, hostile to him, attended Haller's sermon again (incidentally, he only listens to his sermons). Accompanied by two captains, Haller, filled with the Spirit of God, preached fearlessly that the correctness of a faith cannot be measured by the fortune or misfortune of its followers; that one should therefore not doubt that Christ alone is the head of the church, the only mediator between God and humans, indeed the only way to God; that following human ordinances is not salvific and the mass is not a sacrifice, but only a celebration in memory of Christ's suffering. He then exhorted his listeners to follow the example of David, the apostles, and martyrs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] After the sermon, Haller was severely threatened by the enraged colonel: He (the colonel) claimed that in the last sermon, Haller had discredited the Pope, and now even the Emperor! He would show this Swiss where things stand! This sermon brought Haller into disrepute, so that all the mercenaries now recognize, insult, and curse him. However, he is not deterred by this, quite the opposite: He feels overall strengthened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] On April 23, the colonel had already attended his sermon. At that time, during his exposition of the First Epistle of John, he made clear what distinguishes the Antichrist from Christ. This enabled everyone to easily deduce the identity of the Antichrist. Even then, the colonel was beside himself and cursed him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Good, honest people urge him to be cautious and warn him of a possible poison attack. Therefore, he hardly dares to go out anymore. Musculus goes even more vehemently in his sermons than he does, but he is not in danger, as the colonel does not attend his services.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] On April 25, when Haller returned from a visit to Thoman Ruman, he greeted some important citizens. However, they responded to his greeting with curses! This has become his daily bread. It doesn't help much to report such incidents to the mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser, as they do nothing, indeed can do nothing. Since the defeat of the Elector, everything has gotten even worse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, is trying to settle back in the city by exerting heavy pressure with threats. It could soon come to that!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] God's warnings can be observed everywhere! For example, on April 28, lightning struck the abbey tower, which presumably announces the return of the devil in the Augsburg Cathedral. On the day of the Elector's capture, a severe storm broke over Memmingen. It is feared that God will transfer his kingdom to another, more obedient people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] City clerk Georg Frölich and all other councilors must obey the Emperor. Some do this not unwillingly and completely ignore the righteous people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Haller wishes to return to his beloved homeland as soon as possible, as he has had enough of the dishonorable situation in Augsburg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] It is hard to believe how much the malicious and wealthy people rejoice. The colonel is even supposed to be assigned a church to practice his idolatry. The papal-minded citizens encourage this even more than the soldiers. People who were once well-disposed towards Haller and Ruman want nothing to do with them anymore. The mayors would like to hear pleasant things from them, but they can only offer a bitter medicine, which would be beneficial for their soul. Frölich believes that Haller and Ruman should seize every good opportunity to return home.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] In short: The hostilities are great. Haller and Ruman must even fear for their lives if they do not manage to escape. However, Haller wants to persevere as long as he finds the strength to do so and his conscience allows it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] However, he will not write to the Zurich councilors, as they consider him sensitive and fearful, although he is not (the Augsburg church can testify to this). He takes no joy in the situation! He also does not want to hide that a recall would please him, especially since the pious in Augsburg would not suffer any disadvantage from it, even if they would reluctantly let him go. But they also know that he is threatened by the colonel. Nevertheless, he does not want to beg for such a recall. It is important to maintain one's good reputation! God will save him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] This detailed letter is intended to inform Bullinger about the situation in Augsburg and prepare him for a sudden return of Haller. Should it come to that, Bullinger should already know that this was the result of extremely great dangers. If it were up to Ruman, Haller would have long been back in Zurich. Ruman would also have to admit that Haller could only keep him in Augsburg with great difficulty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Haller wrote this letter mainly in German so that the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, and indeed others, can read it without difficulty. He will entrust it to Andreas Gessner for delivery, unless he finds a reliable messenger who goes directly to Zurich. In any case, Gessner will be able to confirm that the situation in Augsburg is even worse than described in this letter.</p>

      <p>Peace and salvation from the Prince of Peace, our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. Alas, alas! How unfortunate I am to be the bearer of such disastrous news to you, esteemed father! He has been captured, the one whom we hoped would redeem Israel, Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony. Not without reason did the heavens themselves portend this disaster, for on the very days these events occurred, two swords were seen in the sky near the rising sun, clashing with each other in a hostile manner, one of which, although fighting bravely, eventually succumbed. I wrote about this in my previous letter, from which you can now deduce what God, the best and greatest, and indeed nature itself, intended to signify with this prodigious vision.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The report reached us as follows: The camps of the Emperor and the Elector were not far from each other. The Emperor had sent troops to Erfurt to capture it, but the Elector's regiment, led by Georg von Reckerode, preempted him and took Erfurt. Afterward, the Elector thought the Emperor would aim for Wittenberg, so he wanted to preempt him as well. On April 21, 22, and 23, there were fierce skirmishes, many people perished, but the Elector was always victorious.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On April 23, he gathered 500 cavalrymen and 8 or at most 9 companies of foot soldiers around him and personally rode from the camp along the Elbe to preempt the Emperor, relying solely on the fact that the river was between them; therefore, he did not expect to be unsafe. The Emperor, having immediately received this information from his spies, sent 2000 or more hussars after him, who found fords at the Elbe through the guidance of some peasants. They crossed and attacked him, driving the Elector to the water, so that they had to surrender, although they fought bravely. The Elector was severely wounded in the face. His eldest son is said to have been shot. It is pitiful that the matter turned out so miserably. It is said that no more than 500 people perished. For when they saw the force, they thought it was the entire army of the Emperor and surrendered. Meanwhile, the Elector's camp is still all together and has gathered for such an action. Also, 15,000 Bohemians have come to him, who are on the move to help the Elector. Duke Johann Ernst, his brother, is also still present. He wants to hold out as long as he can. It is also said that the whole country is rising to rescue and liberate their prince! The Duke of Grubenhagen, whom Gwalther and we often saw in Marburg, was also captured. This happened on Sunday, April 24.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Thus, God earnestly visits his church. I have always feared (although my heart bleeds with sorrow and lament) that the idolatry of the Lord's Supper would not do good, and God would let them see something, for which they unjustly condemned us for our misfortune. God have mercy on his own!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But what is most shameful and painful to me is this: that our superior, as soon as the news came, with the permission of my lords, fired all the cannons that stood on the bastions on May Day and shot for joy, which almost caused a wild uproar. For all the pious were inflicted with as much pain as if they had been shot through the heart. God soon repaid it. For on May Day, a great wall fell into the camp (which they could not rebuild with 1000 guilders), the new large one at the Red Gate; Mr. Lorenz will know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On May Day, the superior, along with two captains, came to my sermon again, just to hear what I would say; for he has not attended any sermon but mine. He does it out of great hostility. As I directed all my speech to the point that no one should measure faith by fortune or misfortune: The truth remains truth, Christ is the head of the church; human ordinances are of no use, and one serves God in vain with them; now there is one mediator between God and man, Christ Jesus, etc.; now there is no sacrifice, but a remembrance of the suffering of Christ, since Christ himself called it, do this in remembrance of me (not sacrifice!); now all are thieves and murderers who seek other ways to life outside of Christ; with other words more, which the Holy Spirit gave me to speak with all freedom; therefore they should not be offended, consider the examples of David, Christ, the apostles, martyrs!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Thereupon he, moved against me vehemently (angrily): I must still receive the reward! I have just recently so shamefully disgraced the Pope, now compared the Emperor to a godless persecutor, and that in his presence! What then do I do when he is not present? They must be strong enough for the Swiss! He also brought me into such a cry that all the mercenaries recognized me and shouted over me: "That is the Swiss! That in botch here and there shame!" But no one dares to harm me, with the Lord protecting me from heaven. I am now the more zealous, more joyful, and braver. They all do not look at it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>On April 23, he was also in my sermon. There I had a passage in the Epistle of John about the Antichrist. There I told him who he was. Tried it. Set Christ and the Antichrist against each other, and let everyone who wants to be of Christ judge over it. Thereupon he said: "That you, botch sacrament and martyr, as soon as possible shame! You must still let the Pope remain, and you should burst!"</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Thus good, honest people tell me, whom I trust (also warning me), that I should be careful! If they could prepare a poison for me, it would happen! Therefore, I hardly dare to go out. Musculus is much more vehement than I am, but since he does not hear him, the storm goes over me. But God stands by me faithfully. To him be honor in eternity!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>On April 25, I went from Romano to my house. Some important citizens were lying in a corner. I greeted them. They shouted after me: "Priest, the devil take you! The devil take you!" That is daily bread. I hardly care about it anymore. If I tell the mayors, they want me to say who did it. It's like blowing into a cold oven. They promised protection, which they can neither provide nor even desire. It is only now really starting with the suppressed Elector! They are already singing songs about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The bishop threatens heavily, he wants to sit in his diocese in Augsburg soon. That can happen soon!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>On April 28, lightning struck the abbey tower. I think it means that the devil will be able to come back in. On the Sunday when the Elector was captured, there was a severe storm in Memmingen, which made them prepare for complete destruction. The storm struck the city in 9 places, but did not ignite anything, nor did it harm any person. These are all serious warnings from God! I fear that because of our ingratitude, the kingdom of God will be taken from us and given to a people that bears its fruits.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The city clerk and all the lords have no other comfort than that they must believe in the Emperor's grace! What he commands, they must do; they do it partly not unwillingly. Therefore, honest people are sitting very coldly with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I wish I were in my dear homeland (as it went), for I have no desire to be in the dishonorable situation!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>You would not believe what jubilation the malicious and wealthy are driving. It is also on the way that the superior is given a church in which he practices his idolatry. And the papal citizens drive this much more than the soldiers! Those who were once well-disposed towards us, now want nothing to do with us. The mayors would like to hear pleasant things, but we give them bitterness, which is beneficial for their souls. The city clerk believes that no just occasion for departure should be neglected.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>In short: The hostility is great! We must fear for our lives if we do not manage to escape. However, I want to do my best until I can no longer or my conscience allows me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I will not write much to Zurich. Not that I despise my lords, but because I know, and hear from honest people, that they consider me a young man, timid and fearful, as if I feared the cross. It is true, I have no joy in it! But I wish they knew how I hold myself in this danger in the church of God. The church itself will testify to it, as will the godless hostility. But I entrust it to the Lord! I would like to have a legitimate recall. But I will not beg for it according to the rule: "If you lose everything, remember to keep your reputation!" I also know that no disservice would be done to the pious, as reluctantly as they would let me go, only that no disgrace would befall me from the superior, who so greatly harbors hatred against me! But the Lord will be with me, deliver me from the mouth of the lion, and save me from every evil work, and preserve me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>I write this in detail to you so that you at least know and believe the state of our affairs, and so that you know that if I should ever return, it will not be without extreme necessity. If I had agreed with Romano, I would have long been in Zurich. He himself will testify how much effort I make to keep him until urgent conscience compels.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>I wrote most of it in German so that you can easily share it with the mayors and others. Andreas Gessner will testify, to whom I will entrust this (unless I find a more convenient messenger who goes directly to you), that I have written far less than the dangers truly are!</p>
