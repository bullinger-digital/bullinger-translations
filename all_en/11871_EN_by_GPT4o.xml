    <p xml:id="regest1">For the intercession for the bishops of Cologne and Münster [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck], Bucer's call [in No. 1803] was not necessary. Renewed request for the [Cologne] Reformation draft ["Simple Consideration"], also on behalf of Vadian, who has traveled to Augsburg; Vadian regrets Luther's harsh letter [to Froschauer] just as Bucer and many others do, but [the Zurichers] will not respond to him as long as they are not publicly attacked. Luther has already polemicized excessively against the [Archbishop] of Mainz [Albrecht of Brandenburg] and against "Hans Worst" [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel] without anyone opposing him, and now he writes against the Jews in a manner that harms the cause and is unworthy of an aged theologian; if Reuchlin were still alive, he would see in Luther's "Schem Hamphoras" and "On the Last Words of David" the hatred of his former opponents towards the [rabbinical] commentators revived. Particularly unbearable is Luther's claim that the Hebrew Bible has been corrupted by the rabbis, which is why he almost revokes his own translation; while Luther distrusts the Hebrew Bible, the church, according to his proposal, should rely on the revision of a single person - Bernhard Ziegler - and Luther's own writings are already almost revered as oracles. To preempt God's judgment, Bucer and others should call their teacher to reflection; [the Zurichers] entrust their cause to God, but posterity will view Luther's writings with skepticism due to his excessiveness. Bucer should let Melanchthon know that Luther, with his spitefulness, gives the followers of the Antichrist reason to call the evangelical preachers evil blasphemers. Does not address Bucer's depiction of his commitment to concord but rejects the accusation that [the Zurichers] are not tolerant enough; it has been shown that Luther does not want concord, but it is enough for them to be united with all who believe in God's word and adhere to the Reformation without false zeal. [Postscript:] Warning to be vigilant at the Diet of Speyer.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We hold the cause, indeed the very present danger, of the bishops of Cologne and Münster in our prayers, so that it is not necessary to seek it from us with such diligence, although in this your outstanding charity and concern for all the saints is evident. May the Lord, having enlightened them with His Spirit, preserve them in the holy and free confession of His name.</p>
      <p>The book of reformation is not yet, I think, completed; when the final touches have been put on it, I ask that you remember Dr. Vadian and me. He went to Augsburg a few days ago; he has not yet returned, I think. He regrets no less than you the fervent writing of Luther; it also grieves the other pious and learned brothers. Nor is there any reason to fear that a barely settled fight will be rekindled by our fervor. For unless he first provokes us with a public writing or attacks us in such a way that we cannot ignore the insult without compromising truth and pure confession, we will never enter the arena. But see, again and again, my most learned and beloved Bucer, lest, while we all remain silent and ignore everything and allow him everything, we gravely sin against the Lord and our function. Certainly, in the past, he would not have insulted and drenched innocent brothers with such great insults and reproaches with impunity. But perhaps affection imposes on us because our matter is at stake here. Against the Archbishop of Mainz and Johann Worst of Brunswick, he wrote in a manner that was plainly scurrilous, not grave, beyond all decorum and modesty. Who among us has objected to his immodesty from charity and fraternity, commended modesty and gravity? No one. Perhaps he would not tolerate a suitable admonisher. Indeed, many adore that canine and obscene eloquence of the man. Therefore, he proceeds and tries to surpass himself in slander. He writes against the Jews and disputes not ineptly but entirely uselessly for our holy Christian faith; but he renders a happy and plausible argument ungrateful, indeed inept, with those foul jests and scurrility, which are unbecoming to anyone, let alone an aged theologian. But even if we grant that a few inept things should be ignored because of the many useful and appropriate things contained in that book, who, I ask, can bear or regard favorably the book "On the Schem Hamphoras" written most impurely? Who is not astonished at that arrogant and obstinate spirit of the man insolently exerting itself in "On the Last Words of David"? If today the renowned hero Capnion were to revive, he would say that in Luther alone the Tungars, Hochostratos, and Pipericorns have revived, gnawing and tearing at the commentators with internecine hatred of the Hebrews.</p>
      <p>However, that ferocity would be bearable if the faith and ancient authority of the Bible remained untainted through his disputation. But now he denies that the Hebrew Bible is certain and indubitable, denies that the Christian and genuine sense can be perceived from it. He asserts that it has been corrupted by the rabbis. He admits that he translated the German Bible insincerely and almost revokes that interpretation.</p>
      <p>See, Bucer, beloved brother, how many stumbling blocks he places here even for the more prudent readers. I will not enumerate in a few words the absurd, preposterous, and perverse things that exist in this opinion of Luther. Finally, he refers the restoration and correction of the Bible to a certain Bernhard Ziegler, as if our faith should rely on this and the whole church should believe one man, which it cannot and should not, according to Luther's canon, give faith to the Hebrew truth. For then it will not be called Hebrew truth, but Jewish vanity. To this, indeed, the insolent genius of the man defers, when all the symmists and ministers of the churches adore any of his writings as oracles, when his spirit is proclaimed as apostolic, from whose fullness all have received.</p>
      <p>Indeed, from what has happened so far, it is to be feared that this man will someday bring some great evil to the church. However, it would be better if you and those like you, who have great influence with him, would restrain the friend, brother, and, if you like to say, teacher, so that he would think more humbly, write and act more purely and circumspectly, mindful of himself and modesty. For many pious and learned men are greatly offended by his insolence, which is more than enough insolent.</p>
      <p>But if men are unwilling to perform their duty, we will feel that God will soon punish the guilty with just judgment. Certainly, after reading those books, we bore more equanimously the condemnation he thundered against us, who in this matter do not wish to be his companions and associates. Indeed, we attribute it to God's just judgment that in extreme old age such a great theologian writes and acts with such immodesty. For from these things posterity will judge Luther to have been a man, and indeed a man subject to harmful affections, and they will read the writings of the man with much sifting and diligence.</p>
      <p>I write these things to you in so many words, so that, since you are otherwise going to write to the most illustrious man Dr. Philipp Melanchthon, you may also add this, that he should be vigilant, lest Luther, with his usual spitefulness, bitterness, abundance of bad words, and scurrility, corrupts the best causes, pronounces incautiously and rashly about the sacred volume and canonical writers. Such a theologian is fitting for modesty, prudence, piety, gravity. The example of his bold wit has today pervaded and occupied many ministers of the churches, who greatly inconvenience true piety, but confirm and harden the kingdom of the Antichrist, whose worshippers shout that the evangelical preachers are not heralds of the gospel, but satirical and slanderous buffoons. Therefore, we must all strive to have regard for the church and modesty, to recall the example of the prophets and apostles, and not to do anything too obstinate through emulation and arrogance. You will not bear this complaint of mine unjustly, beloved brother, which you know to be both just and fraternal.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, which you write at length, what you have done and suffered in the matter of concord between Luther and us to be mended, I do not respond, since you are engaged in this, that we may have an example of patience. Otherwise, we, thank God, are not impatient, who have committed all judgment to the just judge God.</p>
      <p>You have labored strenuously for the mending of concord; but you find that Luther does not want any concord. We commit that to God, nor can we nor do we wish to compel Luther resisting. It suffices if all who believe in the word of the Lord and, having set aside affections, obey and favor His salutary reformation are in concord with us. We seek nothing more; enough concord for us in this.</p>
      <p>In other matters, I have urged that nothing be neglected and that you urge your people to be vigilant at the Diet of Speyer, lest the emperor gravely harm them, etc. December 8, 1543.</p>
