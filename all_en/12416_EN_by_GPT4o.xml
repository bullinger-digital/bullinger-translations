    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser received Bullinger's letter from January 14 [not received] a long time ago. On [February 28], Johannes Haller also returned to [Augsburg]. Haller will accomplish much good, as he represents the true doctrine and is neither quarrelsome nor ambitious. Welser will take care of him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Luther died on February 17 [correct: 18]. This will contribute to the unity of the [evangelical] churches in the sacrament dispute. The devil will not easily find someone again who opposes Christ's [sacrament] as vehemently as Luther did.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Sebastian Schertlin will take Hans Wilpert Zoller with him. Welser has arranged with the [Augsburg Council] for Schertlin to be [financially] compensated for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Emperor [Charles V] is in Maastricht. The Council of Trent continues to meet. Pope [Paul III] is determined to brand all who obey Christ more than him as heretics. He has also ensured that those who do not accept the council's decisions are outlawed by the Emperor and pursued with armed force. More will be known about this in a week.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Welser thanks for the greetings from the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] and sends his regards back. - Greetings also from Welser's wife [Barbara, née Adler] to Bullinger and [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ, our Savior, with the offer of my willing services are yours, dear Mr. Bullinger, first of all. I received your Christian letter from January 14 a long time ago. Also, last Sunday, the well-endowed man of Christ, Johannes Haller, returned here. Praise be to God! I have no doubt he will accomplish much good in this city; for I find him sound in doctrine, neither quarrelsome nor ambitious. These are great gifts from above. He shall not only be entrusted to me but be dear for Christ's sake; for as long as God the Lord grants grace, I will not seek what is from below, but what is above.</p>

      <p>Luther passed away on February 17. This will, God willing, benefit the entire evangelical cause and bring about more unity in the Lord regarding the sacrament in all churches; for Satan will not easily find someone who will fight so defiantly against Christ's institution in this matter.</p>

      <p>Mr. Sebastian Schertlin will take Hans Wilpert Zoller with him. I have negotiated with my lords that they will also do their part so that it is without disadvantage to Schertlin. Since times are swift, my lords may further endow and use him in case of need; for my lords and I desire to promote such honorable people and to do what is pleasing to the honorable council of Zurich and its citizens. You can surely believe this.</p>

      <p>The Emperor is in Maastricht. The Council of Trent continues. The Pope is determined to declare all who believe more in Christ than in him as heretics; afterwards, the Emperor will outlaw those who do not accept the decision and pursue them with the sword. And the machinations are very swift. But in one week we will hear much. May the Lord have mercy on us and turn it for the best; for the adversary does not rest. Both mayors kindly thank me for your greetings and I kindly greet them back on my behalf; inform them that if I can serve them or the common city, I would be entirely willing.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My wife and I, as well as all of ours, greet you, dear sir, your honorable wife, and all yours in the Lord. May the dear God graciously keep us all in the true faith in Christ, our Savior, until the end, so that we may pass through this wicked world and soon come to the fatherland. May He also protect us all from evil. Amen. Dated Augsburg, the 4th day of March in the year 1546.</p>
