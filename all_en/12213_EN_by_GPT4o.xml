    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler hears that Luther is about to confront the Eucharistic views [of his opponents] with a condemnation. However, Schuler, as well as the Church of Memmingen, would not be ready to sign this. - [Charles V.] strongly advocates for a council. [Francis I.] acted cruelly against the Waldensians. [Charles V.] refuses peace to the Protestants and does not want to keep his promises. Those [Protestants or envoys from Memmingen] present in Worms remain steadfast. - Schuler sends the writing of a monk [Johannes Hoffmeister's "Verbum dei et carnem factum... assertio"]. It is indeed worthy of being dedicated to the new Cardinal, the Bishop of Dillingen [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg]! - The [Cardinal Alessandro Farnese] sent by Pope Paul III, a future traitor to Germany, has arrived in Worms. [King] Ferdinand [I.] has received him honorably. Poor Germany, which must endure such sodomites! - Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and to the brothers, especially to [Theodor] Bibliander and [Konrad] Pellikan. - [P.S.:] Schuler recently asked Bullinger for two [Glarus] Schabziger, which he would gladly receive. The bearer [...] will pay for them. Perhaps Bullinger can entrust the matter of Schuler's brother-in-law [Jörg Lübegger].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I hear, dearest brother, that Luther is about to strike our opinion on the Eucharist with an anathema. I am not at all prepared to subscribe to it; it is indeed too harsh and in no way to be embraced by me, nor will the Church of Memmingen accept it. May the Lord grant that he takes up better and more truthful matters. But if the Lord grants him less, I await what I should do. For my mind has not been able to be persuaded thus far.</p>
      <p>I have often wrestled with myself, but all in vain. May the Lord Jesus Christ come to the aid of His afflicted church.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is intent on maintaining and defending the decrees of the Council of Trent with all his might. Meanwhile, the French King has shown a dreadful example of his tyranny against the Waldensian brothers. The Emperor refuses to give us peace and does not want to fulfill his promises; behold the virtue worthy of such a tyrant and hypocrite! Our people in Worms still stand unmoved like a rock; may they persevere to the end! For there is no virtue that constancy does not strengthen.</p>
      <p>I send to your charity here the writing of a certain monk, as you see; not because I wish to trouble you, occupied with far happier matters, with such trifles, but so that you may see how the resistance of the enemies struggles in the extreme and how shamelessly they trifle. The book is indeed worthy of being dedicated to the Bishop of Dillingen, recently first distinguished with the cardinal's hat. As the saying goes, "like lips, like lettuce."</p>
      <p>The legate of Pope Paul III has come to Worms, about to betray Germany. Ferdinand received him reverently, a lid worthy of this pot. Here, hermaphrodites, sodomites, and such sacrilegious people are given the task (if it pleases the gods) to handle the cause of Christ. O most unfortunate Germany, which is forced to bear these sodomites! May the Lord Jesus Christ handle His cause and ours at the same time! For I see no human counsel remaining.</p>
      <p>Farewell, incomparable friend and dearest brother. Greet your wife and the brothers in my name, especially Theodor Bibliander and Konrad Pellikan.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, May 27, 1545.</p>
      <p>Funckius, the consul, greets you.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>I have previously written to you about two good Schabziger cheeses. I would gladly like to obtain them. Whatever they cost, the bearer of this letter will pay you with great thanks. I know well that I should leave you untroubled about this; but your old love towards me makes me bold and fearless, and I have no one in Zurich who could arrange this for me. You might well entrust the matter to my brother-in-law, Herr Jörg Lübegger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord, brother, and dearest teacher in Christ, etc.</p>
