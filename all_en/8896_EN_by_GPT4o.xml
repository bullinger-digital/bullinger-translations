      <p>S. D. I am writing to you, brother, only to let you know that I have received your letters along with the historical documentation and the letters addressed to the treasurer, which I have forwarded to him with the historical documentation. I have just received the historical documentation and will share it with Mr. Haller and the other faithful brothers.</p>
      <p>Knowing that on Wednesday evening between 5 and 6, lightning struck the tower of the cathedral opposite my house, igniting the top of the spire, from where it burned down to the masonry and burned all the wooden structures. The fire lasted until around 9 at night. People could not reach it; however, there were honest people who stood by the watchman's hut and, with God's help, prevented the fire from spreading further, saving the tower and the bells. The other tower was also bravely saved, although it began to smoke again, and there was great danger that beams and timbers from the tower or roof truss would break through the church roof and the fire would fall onto the church. But the citizens sat on the church and were on the vault, working so diligently that the church suffered no damage except for the shattered roof.</p>
      <p>It was a serious matter, and it was a very brave rescue by men and women. The houses around the cathedral were all secured. Those who were at the watchman's hut endured there, even as the burning beams fell towards them; they took them and threw them out of the windows onto the churchyard. It was a fierce blaze and crackling, and it is to be wondered that among so many thousands of people (for a large crowd came from the lake and the countryside to help) no one was harmed, and even more, the next day, yes, in one day, the tower, church, full of ladders, water, manure, and the churchyard, which was full of wood and burned things, tiles, etc., were cleaned and all roofs, for which 8000 tiles were used, were repaired free of charge before nightfall, and everything was so clean that I was able to preach in the church again today, and everyone marveled at the speed. God has visited us at home, but in all things has shown much grace in the midst of all suffering; to Him be praise and honor. May God protect us and prevent greater misfortune!</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you and your family and our lords and friends. May 9, 1572. In haste.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have much news from Augsburg, but no time to write. In the Netherlands, some cities are resisting the Duke of Alva, and in Hungary, an unfortunate event has also begun, although it is written that the Turkish emperor is said to be dead, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli in Chur.</p>
