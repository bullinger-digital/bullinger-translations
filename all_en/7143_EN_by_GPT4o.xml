      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Since the time our mutual friend Lord Johannes Fabritius of blessed memory passed away, I have not written to you, and indeed many things have since occurred that have caused me and many good men the greatest sorrow. But I was especially grieved by the death of such a great man. For Lord Fabritius was a great man, praised for his character in every way, and remarkably supportive of our homeland, and therefore very useful to us all with his counsel, especially in these troubled times.</p>
      <p>But since fate has willed it so, we must bear with equanimity whatever happens by divine will. Furthermore, my Lord Bullinger, what our League of the House of God has endured for about two years concerning our bishopric, and in my judgment undeservedly, can scarcely be enumerated. There is no doubt that the House of God supported a most just cause when it wished to recognize the very reverend Lord Bartholomäus von Salis as its bishop, since he abundantly deserved that dignity for many reasons, especially for the many benefits conferred upon his homeland. Therefore, he was initially elected by the canons themselves (even if by a minority vote) with the counsel and consent of the entire House of God, accepted by the same, inducted into the possession of the bishopric, and oaths were voluntarily exchanged between the prelate and our communities according to custom. After all these things were accomplished, assemblies were often held by the House of God, in which all communities decreed that the acts in favor of the aforementioned Lord Bartholomäus would be valid, and moreover, they declared in open letters that they would recognize him alone and no other as their bishop while he lived. And all these things were done justly by our people, since no bishop (standing on our privileges, agreements, and ancient customs, which we rely on and which, I say, our rights and privileges, even the Swiss arbitrators who pronounced in this case, declared should be held valid and observed in future times as most just and very beneficial and necessary for our ancient liberty) can be elected without the counsel, participation, and consent of the House of God, and if he were elected, then the House of God could admit or reject him at its discretion. However, Lord Beatus von Porta, although elected bishop by only one vote from the majority of the canons, did not initially receive any consent from the people of the House of God; indeed, as if with one voice, they all refused to accept him. And although these things are so, nevertheless, the House of God, shaken by the intercessions of various princes and especially by the persistent demands of the Swiss lords, removed that pious and good man, Lord Bartholomäus, from the prelacy and accepted Lord Beatus in his place, which I hope will be fortunate and happy! But in this way, our liberty, which we received from our predecessors, seems to me to be somewhat undermined. Therefore, I could not refrain from lamenting our fate with you, as with a most excellent man and my dearest friend. I pray to the Lord God to turn everything for the best and have mercy on us. But I will report on the current state of the bishops' controversy. In the declaration of the Swiss lords, it is contained that three men from each side should be chosen, so that if any dispute remains between the bishops regarding expenses and any other inconveniences that occurred while their episcopal difference was being agitated, these six arbitrators would define the whole matter and especially pronounce what should be compensated and reimbursed to the aforementioned Lord Bartholomäus for his expenses, labors, and various actions to be undertaken by him, and in case these arbitrators were in disagreement, then the process in this case would be sent to the consul of Zurich, who, after consulting the other Swiss Cantons, would render judgment and decide the case. Therefore, those six arbitrators convened, and when the process was completed, while the case was to be decided by them, the three arbitrators who were chosen by Bishop Beatus said they had no authority to determine anything in this case, since they were only commissioned to try to bring the parties to some voluntary agreement, and if that could not be done, they would not proceed further but would delegate the case to the Swiss lords. The remaining arbitrators asserted that all the arbitrators together had full authority to judge and that the sentence pronounced by the majority of them would be valid.</p>
      <p>Therefore, while the arbitrators disagreed, they withdrew with the matter unresolved. But many distinguished men of the League of the House of God, who were found here due to public functions of our republic, when they were informed of all these things, deliberated among themselves and decided that the process should not be sent now and that the whole case should be suspended until the first assembly is held by the House of God, in which it will be declared how far the authority of the arbitrators extends. And therefore, the parties were prohibited from proceeding further until the said assembly is held, and Lord Ambrosius Marti, the president in this case, was instructed not to seal the process or issue any delegatory letters, as they say, to the consul of Zurich. Whether Bishop Beatus will obey the lords' orders or send the process he has in hand, even if not authentically signed, to Zurich is unknown; but Lord Bartholomäus von Salis is not allowed to disregard the mandate of the lords of the House of God. Therefore, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I want to ask you again and again that if you perceive Bishop Beatus pressing your illustrious consul for the expedition of the case, you would deign to inform the same lord consul of the prohibition made to the parties, as above, and ask on behalf of the reverend Lord Bartholomäus von Salis that he not be burdened to defer the case until he can also appear without offense to the House of God; for he is so far from fearing the judgment of the Swiss lords that he even desires it greatly, but in the meantime, he would not want to offend the League of the House of God. And whatever you perceive to be discussed there concerning this matter, you would do a most pleasing thing for Lord Bartholomäus and his friends, and especially for me, if you would inform us of it incidentally. And you will ensure that the letters to be sent by you are addressed to the distinguished man, Lord Tobias Egli, the preacher of Chur (whom I love and honor for his singular learning and piety, and whom, to sum up, I will hold in the place of Fabritius). I also ask that you forgive me if I have been more lengthy than I should have been so far while writing about the bishopric. Moreover, my Lord Bullinger, do you know how my seditious compatriots treated me in unworthy ways two years ago? For they, having plotted against my life, and with my God protecting me, I escaped their hands, yet they attacked my possessions and in one day took from me the sum of 1700 Rhenish florins; but I have also suffered countless other losses, so that due to that sedition, I have suffered a loss of over 3000 florins. Therefore, I have now summoned the communities themselves, which raged against me in this way, to court, for here are the judge and jurors delegated in this case by all the Three Leagues, and I have no doubt that they will decide the case with just judgment, and I will therefore mostly achieve my wish; for they have not even the slightest thing with which they can reproach me, nor can they excuse themselves for the injury done to me.</p>
      <p>Driven solely by malice and pure envy, and because they had also spent much in tumult and had no ready means to pay, they attacked me. But in these days, some seditious individuals, as authors of that panic tumult, have been fined, but very moderately. Otherwise, there is nothing new that I can report to you. There is indeed a great scarcity among us of almost all things necessary for sustenance; in other respects, however, all is quiet. Farewell greatly, most esteemed and dearest Lord Bullinger, and I ask you not to be angry with me, who, as if for an entire age, have not written to you, in which matter I acknowledge my error and confess it, which can in no way be excused. Nevertheless, I still ask that you hold me earnestly commended to you. And my son Johannes also uniquely commends himself to you, and we both pray that you will deign to greet your most honorable sons and the whole family for us. Once again, farewell with all yours, and may the Lord God grant you Nestor's years and those far more blessed.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur on the 4th of July, 1567.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most... esteemed and revered lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
