      <p>S. On this day, the Jesuits have been given notice and their property seized. It took a lot of effort because the resistance was significant.</p>
      <p>However, I cannot hide from you that I am thoroughly informed that those who took the Jesuits' money did nothing less than, as soon as the door was closed, followed their community's orders and retrieved their sentence against the Jesuits. How much I like this, I will leave unsaid for now; but it will serve to ensure that they will keep their money in the future and leave us in peace in our lands.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, on Sunday, I delivered a serious sermon against the immoral life and also, among other things, protested in the name of all preachers: if rebellion were to arise in the lands (which God may long prevent), it would not be the preachers' fault, but the immoral life. I spoke in such a way that I thought they would not leave me unvindicated for it. However, the older, more experienced people thanked me greatly for it.</p>
      <p>And when I admonished the councilors not to betray before a proper investigation was made, if they wanted to keep their freedom and fatherland longer, one of the leagues (those from the courts) unanimously agreed to let the other two leagues decide, to establish a special form of oath, and when they would come together in the future to fill offices, that the oath would be taken beforehand and the envoys would swear to report all those who offered them money or engaged in other bad practices, so that such people would not be allowed access to honorable offices.</p>
      <p>I hope that gradually one thing and another can be improved. The bishop's matter is still pending.</p>
      <p>The first article is resolved, namely that his people no longer have a place in the councils. Regarding the other articles, the Two Leagues have made excellent progress, and once they set a law for the bishop, they have temporarily released our people from the law and suspended the law-setting. This does not please the bishop.</p>
      <p>Nothing has been handed over yet, but it has only been agreed to stand still until the Chur fair, until it can be brought before the communities everywhere, only so that if the bishop demands the law further, they can inquire with the communities whether they are obliged to be subject to the law, or if the law is used, whether the Two Leagues should be burdened with it or whether an impartial law should be set by the Godshouse, etc. However, regarding the accounts, our people will not allow him the law; for he has sworn to give accounts if the Godshouse demands it from him. The bishop is not privy to this.</p>
      <p>I hope to God that he will be forced to resign the episcopate to the Godshouse, which he would gladly do if left unexamined. I am holding on strongly; how far it will go, God knows.</p>
      <p>So far, it has gone reasonably well.</p>
      <p>So far, the bishop's people have given me good words; but now they hang their heads and estrange themselves, as they fall upon me and Dr. Philipp; they curse us; but we proceed strong in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dr. Baccaria's case has not yet been heard; Dr. Baccaria is with me.</p>
      <p>The captain in Valtellina is not of our religion, but otherwise a virtuous, sensible man, the other offices are mostly filled with those who are of our faith. The commissioner in Claven is very good, Lazarus, who is pursuing Dr. Beccaria's case, and who has so far maintained it with his people. The commissioners who will ride to Valtellina are mostly good; our bailiff is also one. We hope for nothing but good.</p>
      <p>I wrote this around lunchtime.</p>
      <p>What has been done with the Bishop of Como, you will hear another time; for his legate was here. If anything happens before I send the letters, I will write.</p>
      <p>I hope to propose Dr. Beccaria's case after lunch.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Dr. Beccaria's case has been proposed and kindly heard; I promise myself success in it. You write that I should ensure nothing is written to your magistrate; but I do not see the cause of your fear. Your senate's letters were read in the Senate of the Three Leagues: a private matter has become public; for some few of those magnates who wanted Dr. Beccaria expelled, against the decree of the Three Leagues, supported Beccaria's adversaries, that is, the legate of the Three Cantons, and they themselves were sharply attacked in the senate today by an eloquent man who spoke on behalf of the Schams and all the communities that joined them. We are waiting for a response, which we would have received long ago if the imperialists had not requested the senate for themselves. Just now in the evening, the response has been given regarding Dr. Beccaria; he remains, and it is to be arranged with the Three Cantons that they leave our people unhindered. This suddenly.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, as I hear, the appeal of those under the forest, which they made to those above the forest, to give the Three Cantons another letter to expel Beccaria, has not yet been completed. This suddenly in the evening; if the messenger arrives tomorrow, I will write more.</p>
      <p>Dr. Beccaria could not write, as his case was just now debated. He received a response; he may write this evening if he has someone to whom he can give it.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 10, 1561. Dr. Philipp, Dr. Beccaria, and others wish you well.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his ever-honored lord and patron. Mr. Bullinger.</p>
