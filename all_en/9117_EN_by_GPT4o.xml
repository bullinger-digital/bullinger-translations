      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, as Hans Heinrich went from me to you to Schaffhausen and to Laufen, I did not have time to write; you have probably heard from him, as well as from Heinrich, about our Barbli's death, which grieves me greatly; for she was always dear to me, etc.</p>
      <p>And thus one sorrow follows another; the good old J. Hans Conrad Escher from the Bach was also buried yesterday, so he did not come to St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, another captain will be appointed to St. Gallen and another pastor to the Fraum√ºnster. May God grant His grace that those who deserve it will be appointed. A poisonous writing has been issued in French by the king in France, in which he justifies his murder and accuses the admiral and his people to the highest degree; be aware, it will also come to Baden on the appointed day.</p>
      <p>The messenger to Solothurn has written a sharp letter to the people of Glarus, asking if they would provide him with soldiers if it came to an uprising or not; they held a community meeting last Monday and gave him the answer: they want to uphold the union if it is upheld with them, yes, if a foreign people invaded their land; but against their own and faithful people, they will not give him anyone; if he does not like it, the king may, if he wishes, denounce the union to them. And they have forbidden going to the king, by life, honor, and property, etc. Yesterday a messenger came from Bern, who brought what I have enclosed here for you; it was entrusted to me confidentially, it should be kept secret; therefore, do not make anything of it and send me the copy back promptly.</p>
      <p>Thus I go around, weak and not very lively or strong; but it is also about time. Greet Susanna and the children for me. All our people greet you. Also greet J. Hans Peyer and Leonem for me. Given on St. Andrew's Day in Yl; I assume the calendars I sent you have reached you. God be with you. 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
