    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is not necessary for Bullinger to go to such great lengths to provide Frölich with his letters, especially since he is already at the forefront of all friends. Therefore, his pious and learned letters always touch Frölich's heart.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He further wants to treat the Zurich preachers [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer] as friends and assist them with advice and action in case of need. Bullinger should convey this to them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The claim that the Emperor [Charles V] has fled is not true. Rather, on the evening of November 13, he moved his camp from Lauingen to the vicinity of the [Schmalkaldic League], to Lake Dattenhof, where he still remains. In recent days, there have been isolated skirmishes, which ended without losses for the [Schmalkaldic League], while there were many wounded and casualties among the Imperial forces. According to a trustworthy farmer [...], they were reportedly transported to Dillingen on 15 wagons over two hours. A final hard battle is likely to occur soon, as tempers on both sides are so inflamed, there is a lack of many things, and winter is setting in. May the Lord protect His cause!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [Johannes] Haller, the mutual friend, is all too discreet. Frölich knows that he has to endure some inconveniences, yet he conceals the expenses incurred as a result. Bullinger should write to him that in case of great difficulty, he should turn to Frölich, who will help him vigorously.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] There is no need to hope for peace with the enemy, as such would be unnatural. Moreover, only victory is an option! If the Lord grants this and the [German Protestants] still do not improve, the Lord should never again have mercy on them! If victory comes, the small towns that had to be given to the enemy can easily be recaptured. If defeat comes, Christian and worldly freedom are lost!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Duke Maurice [of Saxony] betrays both the common cause [of the Protestants] and the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony]! He occupies his territories and cites the imperial ban as justification. And yet the good Elector continues to defend foreign territory while losing his own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Ambrosius [Blarer] sent Frölich the letter addressed to him by Bullinger [No. 2652?] regarding the negotiations of the Four Places that took place in Zurich to read. He joyfully acknowledged the solidarity expressed therein and returned the letter to Blarer. But now Bullinger writes [in a letter not received] that Frölich should forward this report to Simon Bing, which is no longer possible for him! Frölich thus forwarded Bullinger's letter to Bing [not received] and simultaneously apologized to the recipient (to whom he is indebted) for the missing enclosure. The determined advocacy of the Confederates for truth and freedom against the Pope [Paul III], the Emperor, and other potential enemies is commendable! It would be even more touching if they would also help the neighboring [German Protestants] with actions before it is too late; which could also become dangerous for the Confederates. However, Frölich is not familiar [with the politics of the Confederation].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [Hans Vogler the Younger], the son of Ammann [Hans] Vogler [the Elder], must be restrained. He is skilled in writing and otherwise clever. However, he must be tested for at least another six months before considering his employment. Haller and Frölich have had to reprimand him sharply. Yet there is hope for improvement. Frölich therefore suggests that Vogler continue to work in the Augsburg Chancellery over the winter and receive board and lodging with Haller or another. Only then will Frölich pass his judgment on him. This should be conveyed to [Hans] Vogler [the Elder].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Hans [Thoman] Ruman has arrived safely in Augsburg. The authorities will treat him and the other Zurich pastors kindly. Frölich will also do his best for them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Apparently, Bullinger is overstrained by the day and night writing, reading, and preaching! He should take care of himself, otherwise, he will perish in the process!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Rudolf] Gwalther, and to the others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] [Wolfgang], the son of Mayor Lavater, withdrew from Ulm with the other Confederates a few days ago. Hopefully, he has returned home safely. If Frölich had known earlier that he was serving in the military, he might have been able to help him. He does not know how much Wolfgang's pay was.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [P.S.:] Enclosed are three copies of the German writing [„Bestendige und warhafftige Verantwortung“] as a gift for the mayors and the city clerk.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is not necessary for you to wish so ardently that your letters continue to affect me, as no mortal is more faithful and authoritative to me than you, my dearest friend. Therefore, I am always deeply moved by your letters, which are full of piety and learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will treat the Zurich preachers as friends and brothers, with whom everything is shared, and I ask you to write to them and instruct them that if they encounter any necessity or difficulty, they should not neglect my assistance. I have certainly offered myself entirely to them and will be their ally.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The rumor of the Emperor's flight is false. On the night of the 13th of this month, he moved his camp from Lauingen and set it up not far from ours at Lake Dattenhof, where he has remained with his army until now. In recent days, there have been several individual skirmishes without any loss on our side, thanks be to the Lord. However, many of the enemy were struck down, and many wounded and half-dead were brought to Dillingen in carts yesterday. A trustworthy farmer claims to have seen 15 wagons and carts of wounded being brought in over two hours. As far as I can see, after prolonged and frequent provocation, matters will soon come to a very fierce conflict. For the spirits on both sides are extremely embittered, some pillars of war have collapsed, and the harshness of winter is at the door, so that necessity will cause something significant. May the Lord, the only King of Kings, protect His own cause and glory for our salvation! Amen. Pray for us with the brothers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Mr. Haller, our mutual brother and friend, a man worthy of honor and affection, is too modest. For although I know that he sometimes encounters troubles, he swallows them and conceals them from me. Therefore, please write to him, so that if anything serious and difficult happens to him, he should not hesitate to use my help. I will assist him faithfully, not with words, but with deeds.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is no hope for peace with the enemies, and I believe that the conditions for a firm peace do not exist in nature. Therefore, nothing but joyful victory in the Lord will conclude the matter; if the gracious and most merciful God favors us and we do not amend our lives even then, I would not want Him to have mercy on us afterward! Once victory is achieved, we will easily recover the small towns we lost. If not, both Christian and secular freedom will be lost in these most unjust times!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Duke Maurice acts as much hostilely as treacherously against the Elector and the common cause. He is now in arms and occupies the Elector's provinces, citing the imperial ban or proscription as justification. Oh, wickedness, oh, villainy! Nevertheless, the good Elector continues to defend foreign territory and loses his own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Mr. Ambrosius, our dear lord and friend, sent me your letter regarding the negotiations of the Four Places to read, which I was glad to hear because of the unity and comforting assembly. I have also gratefully returned it to him. And since you now mention the report to Zurich, which I should send to Mr. Simon Bing, it has not reached me. Therefore, I wrote to the aforementioned Bing along with your letter as an apology. He is very well related to me. I am pleased with the decision of the Confederates that they are determined to uphold truth and freedom against the Pope, the Emperor, and everyone. It would touch people's hearts even more if they provided some help to the neighboring brothers before they come to suffering and then also face danger. However, I write as one inexperienced.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding Mr. Ammann Vogler's son, I find that he needs restraint. He is skilled with his hands and has enough intelligence, and he is right for me. He must be put to the test for at least half a year before judging with whom he should be entrusted. Mr. Haller and I have diligently spoken about him and have already given him a good lecture. But I have good hope for his welfare and success. It would be advisable for him to continue working in the chancellery over the winter and have board with Mr. Haller or another. Afterward, I will gladly express my opinion about him. Please convey my willing service to Mr. Ammann Vogler.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Mr. Johann Ruman has arrived here safely. My lords will show all due friendliness towards him and others of his kind. I will do the same to the best of my ability and understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I find it evident that your day and night work with writing, reading, and preaching must be excessive and unbearable. I ask you to spare yourself and give measure to these matters! For you know: What lacks alternate rest is not durable.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Greet on my behalf the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, and others of that kind, to whom nothing is sweeter to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The son of Mayor Lavater left Ulm with his compatriots a few days ago. I hope he is now at home. I wish I had known earlier that he was serving here. Perhaps I would have extended the duty of humanity to him. However, I do not know with what salary he served.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell, my soul! November 20, 1546. Yours, Georg Frölich, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I am sending here three German copies, which I would like to be given to the lords consuls and the chief scribe in my name.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Zurich church, friend and brother forever. Zurich.</p>
