    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger could give the [German] works of Zwingli to the letter carrier Quirinus [von Leiden] or Froschauer as an addition to his book shipments to the bookbinder Peter [von Mechell].

Thann will defend itself (as it is a free city like Breisach and has old imperial privileges). Such rights are held by Breisach, Thann, Mulhouse, Rheinfelden, Säckingen, Laufenburg, Waldshut, etc. Bullinger will learn more from Quirinus [von Leiden]. - Bullinger will probably know that Bucer has written a not very polemical treatise [„Der newe glaub“] against the articles of the Louvain [theologians]. Musculus has cleverly refuted one or the other article in his [„In evangelistam Ioannem heptas prima“]. - Gast hopes to soon receive [back] Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“] [from Bullinger]. He fears that [the Lutherans protect themselves with such a harsh attack] to impress the simple-minded. - Why does Bullinger not respond to Gast's last letters? - Gast has conveyed the greeting to Myconius and Bullinger's astonishment that he does not write; Myconius did not want to bother Bullinger with trifles. - If Bullinger wishes to write to Gilbert [Cousin], he should know that his brother [Antoine?] will be [in Basel] next week. Gast has forwarded Gwalthers' letter for Cousin [not received]. Bullinger should greet Gwalther from Gast.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>You can entrust the works of Zwingli to the carrier and set the price with him or tell Christoph Froschauer to include them with his books, which he usually sends to the bookbinder Peter, so that no one is burdened with this task. Then, I ask you to indicate the price.</p>
      <p>We have no news from the Diet. The Emperor is intent on subjugating Germany, which the Papists do not want to acknowledge.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor spreading here that the small town of Thann has been pledged by Ferdinand to a certain Augsburg merchant. The town will undoubtedly resist, as it is one of the free towns, among which Breisach is also included, and due to the ancient privileges once granted by the emperors. King Ferdinand should neither pledge nor can he pledge these towns. These include Breisach, Thann, Mulhouse, Rheinfelden, Säckingen, Laufenburg, and Waldshut, etc. You will learn more from our Quirinus.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware that Bucer has written against the Louvain theologians and has refuted their articles only slightly, although Musculus in his commentaries on John cleverly refutes one or two articles.</p>
      <p>I hope to soon have Luther's fanatical pamphlet, written not only against the Swiss but also against the Swabian churches. I fear they might deliberately conceal it to boast among the simple-minded for a time.</p>
      <p>But hey, why do you not respond to the letters I sent recently? Farewell in the Lord, may you and all yours be happy for a long time.</p>
      <p>I conveyed your greetings to Myconius and expressed your surprise that he does not write at all. He said he has no subject and does not want to disturb your studies with trivial matters.</p>
      <p>If you wish to write anything further to Mr. Gilbert, you can; for we expect his brother next week. I sent Mr. Gwalther's letters to Gilbert, whom you will also greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love Gast.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zürich.</p>
