    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's scholarly works and his warning about Claude d'Aliod, who has come to Strasbourg. Reports on the agreement between Blarer and Schnepf, whom he already knew as a stubborn person in Heidelberg, and assesses the Formula of Concord positively. However, the Reformation in WÃ¼rttemberg is developing in the Lutheran direction. It is claimed that Blarer has recanted. He is now with the Duke in Urach. Bucer sends an excerpt from a letter by Philipp Melanchthon, who is interested in an agreement and approves of Bucer's mediation. In Strasbourg, they are now taking stricter action against the Anabaptists. He looks forward to Bullinger's "De testamento." Apologizes for not having approached a young man recommended by Bullinger. Myconius was in Strasbourg. Greetings. Bedrot is absent.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord abundantly.</p>
      <p>I give you immortal thanks, dearest Heinrich, for your religious and learned writings, and also for your warning about that Claude, who came to us, as all those monsters usually do. But he will not stick.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of Schnepf and Blarer, it stands thus: After Schnepf was imposed upon the most innocent prince with remarkable skill and it was neglected to call Blarer in time, as the prince had ordered, who otherwise would have been present long before Schnepf, we, as before, left nothing undone to avert Schnepf's severity, and it was obtained through Sturm that the prince ordered nothing more to be demanded than that the Eucharist be taught according to the Saxon confession, which states "the body of Christ is truly present in the supper and is given to those who eat." There is no mention of "essentially" and "substantially." Initially, however, Schnepf did not want to accept Blarer as a colleague unless he agreed on the Eucharist. There the prince was miserably perplexed. For he did not want to dismiss either for many reasons, especially religion. For he values Schnepf highly for the constancy he showed above others in Augsburg. He is also very eloquent, but at the same time hard-headed. I have known him for many years. We acted together in Heidelberg. Therefore, while Blarer affirmed that we are not of the opinion that there is nothing but bread and wine in the supper, but that we also want the body of Christ to be present here, he objected: "But not truly!" while we affirmed that we acknowledge Christ himself to be present, who indeed has a true body, but is perceived by the mind. He omitted perception, insisted on the object, which is received. Thus it came about that Blarer, to show that he acknowledges Christ himself to be perceived here, but by the mind, admitted those words you have. For "quantitatively, qualitatively, and locally" exclude all bodily perception. For these are objects of the senses. "Essentially" and "substantially" express the solidity of the true Christ truly present, but only to be perceived by the mind. For substance and essence are objects of the intellect. They are perceived only by the mind. When the prince received these words from Schnepf, he leaped for joy and sent a courier here to write this to Sturm. This courier arrived here from Stuttgart within one day and half a night - it is 15 not small miles. The duke's people, induced by the priests, when they cannot retain the papacy, all clamor for the Lutheran reformation, which is milder for the papists. Then there are other great reasons for the flesh, so that the prince must defer something to the Saxons. The prince had taken care that it should not be considered a recantation of one party, but an amicable concord and explanation of the opinion of both parties, what they confessed to each other. There Schnepf also accepted that he would not demand those words "carnally," "bodily." But meanwhile, as is the custom with these men, they wrote throughout the whole dominion that Blarer had recanted. I think it had to be endured so that Blarer would stick in the administration of the churches of this principality.</p>
      <p>Now he is acting with the prince in Urach in the absence of Schnepf, where it will become known to both princes, so I do not doubt, that the matter will be better.</p>
      <p>Then we expect Philipp, who recently wrote to me: "What you write that we must strive for concord among us, I am indeed doing, and recently we discussed this matter with our prince. But I expect the Landgrave shortly, as I hope, to come to us. And if he does not come, I will write to him some of my thoughts, which I will share with you sometime. For indeed I desire nothing more than that the great scandal of dissension among us be removed, which you know how much it hinders the course of the gospel. You see me not fighting against you. But I hope others will also become milder. May Christ look upon his church and restore to us holy and pious concord."</p>
      <p>Thus he. He wrote similar things to a certain Franc, to whom he also testified that my moderation in this cause did not displease him. Therefore, I think there is nothing to fear from any sophistic words.</p>
      <p>There was fear from the Anabaptists before. They are becoming obsolete, but nothing beyond the seduction of the simple. Now it has begun to act more severely against them, so I think the matter will be better in the future.</p>
      <p>I will gladly see your book "On the Only and Eternal Testament" - for the books have not yet been brought. This is a necessary argument of the time.</p>
      <p>I beg your pardon, I did not even address that excellent young man of yours. I have been so occupied with business these days that I have not even been able to breathe, and now for the first time as I respond to you, I read his recommendation. Myconius was also here these days, with whom, however, I was able to be for only a few hours. In the future, I beg you, give such letters, so that they come to me themselves. You could have written this one thing through him, that he is the craftsman you recommended to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 10.</p>
      <p>Commend me most diligently to our Leon and your other fellow ministers. Capito greets you. Bedrot is absent.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned servant of Christ Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurichers, dearest friend and brother.</p>
