      <p>Greetings. If I sometimes write about lighter matters, I do not fear that it will displease you, since I have no other intention than to obey you.</p>
      <p>You have probably already heard that the Port of Grace has been surrendered to the French.</p>
      <p>The French had stationed a garrison in the tower at their discretion.</p>
      <p>Hostages were also given until the English left the town and returned to their homeland.</p>
      <p>The condition was set that ships and weapons would be returned on both sides.</p>
      <p>But it was later written that they had fulfilled the agreements.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is peace in Normandy, unless the Queen of England voluntarily wages war, which is very unlikely.</p>
      <p>Now that the queen is free from fear, she will soon reveal her intentions.</p>
      <p>It is certain that so far, due to her treachery, our enemies have dared to openly reject the king's edicts, in which the chancellor, who sincerely favors us, is generous towards us.</p>
      <p>But whatever is well decided in council is thwarted by the queen's secret schemes.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the wife of Count Cursol, who has previously led her here and there at will, will change her mind.</p>
      <p>She is a spirited woman who will not easily yield possession of power.</p>
      <p>She promises everything, I hope she will do something.</p>
      <p>As soon as Cardinal Castiglione informs his brother Admiral that there is no danger at court, they will join forces.</p>
      <p>Admiral himself wrote to us that he is prepared for serious efforts, expecting nothing from the prince, not only because he is soft and cowardly, but because he is foolish and completely indulges in shameful pleasures.</p>
      <p>Genlis, who ruined him with secret betrayals and finally shamefully defected to the enemy's camp, is in high favor.</p>
      <p>His brother, who betrayed Bourges, is preferred over many most loyal friends.</p>
      <p>Nemours is just as familiar as if he had never been an open enemy: as long as he rolls in the laps of harlots, he thinks he is king.</p>
      <p>However, what is boasted about the Council of Trent among you is vain.</p>
      <p>For he does not admit that he has defected from religion.</p>
      <p>A synod was convened in Lyon, which the king prohibited from being held by his edict.</p>
      <p>The cause is the governor, a good man otherwise, but too timid, who, while wanting to protect himself privately, has disrupted the whole matter.</p>
      <p>We gave the brothers advice that we thought was useful. When they inform us of their decision, we will strive with utmost effort to obtain a new convocation.</p>
      <p>The provincials are still in arms.</p>
      <p>In Dauphin√© and the Occitan language region, things are calm, and indeed many of the priests and monks have testified that they do not seek the mass.</p>
      <p>Thus, although no one forbids them, they still leave the temples empty. Your letters, in which you advised me not to dedicate my lectures on Jeremiah to the Palatine, reached me late.</p>
      <p>For the matter was already settled.</p>
      <p>I had sought advice from our Gaspar in a timely manner. I do not know why he did not respond.</p>
      <p>However, if there is any offense, it will be easily dispelled, nor do I worry much since I did not seek favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and my esteemed brother. May the Lord keep you safe and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to all colleagues.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
