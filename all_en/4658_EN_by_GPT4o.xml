      <p>On Saturday evening, a Zollikofer from St. Gallen rode out from Lyon. I asked him diligently how things stood in France: he said, very well; everything was quiet, and the persecution had stopped; no one was harmed because of their faith. All prisoners were also released, and the brother of the king of Navarre was also out of his custody, as he had requested, with certain conditions concerning his adversaries, without which he himself did not want to be free; everything was done through good means and methods, with which he was well satisfied.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he believed that the Guise family had completely left the court on this day and indeed 14 days ago, and so many pamphlets, pasquinades, and conversations in French were made against them, in which all their evil deeds were brought to light, that everyone was talking about it; it was a wondrous thing, of which he himself had read much, etc. The cardinal from Lorraine had a tremendously large fortune brought out of France some time ago, he spoke of many thousands of crowns, which he had made in Milan, a hundred thousand, and 14 or 40 thousand in Venice, which were embezzled by the one he entrusted them to, and brought to the Turk. He cannot say enough about how many people are against the Guises.</p>
      <p>The cardinal always had this saying as a proverb in his mouth during the life of the previous king: "If the king lives, so do I; if he dies, then I am dead;" this is now spoken of him openly and well. He also mentioned that it was announced at the court 14 days ago that those who were there for money reasons should not move; they would be given a decision in a few days, which they could rely on. But he particularly mentioned that pamphlets were being circulated in France, as if the king of Navarre had completely turned to the pope and offered him all allegiance, but everyone knew that it was nonsense and it was happening now, where the writings were coming out, that France was involved with the pope, and some others were also more inclined, who otherwise might have been more reluctant, when they heard that France did not want to be involved and would not participate in this council. But it is certain that Navarre is upright and honest, as are the constable and admiral, and it is hoped that everything will get better and better, especially now that the brother of Navarre is also released with conditions, as he requested. I wanted to share this with you to confirm the letters sent back on Friday, which Martyr received from Strasbourg. Do, let me know, I beg you, whether you believe to be true what is being asserted with great assurance about many thousands being baptized and converted to the faith of Christ in Mauretania (they are called Marranos in German) and that by the preaching of those who crossed over from Spain to Africa because of the immense persecution. A printed sheet about this in Strasbourg, previously distributed by Kaspar Peucer in Wittenberg, you have probably seen. February 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Mayor Joachim Hauser (Huserus), a sensible, pious man, will deliver the letter to you; you can talk to him about everything.</p>
