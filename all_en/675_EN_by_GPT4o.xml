      <p>Most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your letters were recently delivered to me, from which I clearly understood what you think should be done to reconcile the church in Chur. I praise your decision to refer the matter to the ministers of Chur, who will examine it piously and rightly. For regarding Doctor Augustin, I feel the same as you do. He indeed has sound doctrine, and I have never doubted this; I have only accused him of laziness in his ministry, which has caused many dissensions in that church, which could have been entirely avoided if he had been vigilant as he should have been. I omit many other things in silence, which were explained to me by the first members of his church against Augustin. But concerning all these matters, the Synod of Chur, to whom it pertains, will judge more rightly. Therefore, you have acted excellently by referring the whole matter to them. I truly seek only that the kingdom of Christ may be increased, the purity of doctrine retained, and peace and concord preserved in the churches. May our Lord grant this to us for the sake of His Son, whom He has given to us.</p>
      <p>I thank you immensely both for the kindness you have shown to the faithful of Christ and also because you love me so much that you omit nothing in which you feel you can gratify me.</p>
      <p>However, I understand that my recommendation with you will always be of such a condition that all things are done according to the strength of this church and without troubling you. - Although many open dangers to my life threaten me from all sides, with the ministers of the Antichrist conspiring against my head, the Lord nevertheless comforts me with His spirit so that I am not disheartened, but ready for all events to testify to the glory of Christ. I intend to travel to Florence with my family, both because of the utmost fairness and piety of its ruler and also because of the faith and love of many brothers who are there. If I, as I hope, succeed, that is, if I am allowed to remain there safely, it will not be without the fruit of spreading the gospel. Perhaps I will accomplish more conveniently there all those things I had proposed to do in Venice, and if only those letters of recommendation had been written for me to the Duke of Florence! Good God, how much benefit they would have been in promoting this cause. Moreover, I am greatly grieved that I receive no letters from Lord Lelio, especially because of those books he was to send to Italy over a month ago. You can remind him if you see him; to whom you will also commend me again and again, and greet the entire church in my name.</p>
      <p>You will earnestly pray to the Lord for my persecution. I will depart from here within two days with my wife and children.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me.</p>
      <p>Given in Bergamo, September 12, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Baldassare Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, my ever to be respected lord. Zürich.</p>
