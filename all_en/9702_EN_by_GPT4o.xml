      <p>S. I have received all your letters, most reverend father, with good faith, and we have read most of what is contained in them with great admiration and hope. But since I am not now able to respond to each one, partly due to domestic concerns, etc., which nearly drive me to madness, and partly due to our market and fairs, in which we are always miserably harassed by foreigners and locals, I now respond in the briefest aphorisms, which is the matter at hand. It is also reported and confirmed from Italy that the king has expired; but we have not yet been informed about the nature of his death; it is, however, credible that such a monster succumbed to a monstrous disease.</p>
      <p>The captains and almost our entire nation gape like ravens at these fairs and still eagerly hope for the arrival of the ambassador with money.</p>
      <p>Today it was said that he is not far away; but, he who is coming is not seen. They think the rumors of the death of such a holy king are false. I also heard today from trustworthy men that Spanish envoys are present with money and are seeking numerous Rhaetian soldiers to be led into Belgium. Indeed, cunningly, since the Frenchman delays and the good father king is exhausted, and there are not a few who have long been tempted by the wealth of the Spaniards. - What that Ulpius from Como or rather the Antichrist himself is attempting in the Valtellina, I prefer you to understand from the letters of others, which I send. Mr. Lentulus still limps and writes little, as he also rarely receives letters from me for certain reasons. - A few months ago, when Mr. Campellus sought permission and dismissal from the lords, he was asked by them to stay, and he wished to continue in office.</p>
      <p>But on June 9, contrary to all expectation, the younger Pontisella was elected in his place.</p>
      <p>What I think and by what means this was accomplished, I will write soon; by the same means, they also labor to substitute Gantner, who persists stubbornly in his heresy, in my place. They could not bear our concord, which we have preserved uncorrupted; hence that sudden change. Into what misery you have cast me, will soon be evident. - If they want to have my judgment on creating another teacher, Mr. MÃ¼ller will be foremost in my mind above others; my voice will choose him and no other, if he is willing. I ask you, on occasion, to tell him not to take it badly that I neither write now nor have recently responded to his letters, as I will write most fully soon. He will surely understand from Mr. Pontisella what the matter is. I also wish to be excused to Mr. Haller; for next week I will both write and send in letters what I can send. Forgive me, my most esteemed father, for burdening you with so many words (for I thought I would scarcely write three).</p>
      <p>We give thanks to your paternity for deigning to instruct us about those wonders, and we will pray to God with you that the sacramental dispute and contention may finally be ended with the victory of truth. Immortal God, how unexpected and yet certain is the power and might of God.</p>
      <p>All of ours send greetings to your eminence. Most swiftly, June 14, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most humble servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his singularly revered and esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
