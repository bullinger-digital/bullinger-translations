      <p>To Lord Bullinger, his most friendly and esteemed, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>About ten days ago or so, I wrote to you, my lord Bullinger, and now perhaps I would write more extensively, but the haste of the bearer of this letter prevents me from doing so; therefore, please excuse the brevity. However, what I earnestly request from you now, my lord Bullinger, is that if the bearer of this letter, Mr. Apollonius Merenda from Naples, who is compelled to leave his homeland for the sake of the Gospel and visit foreign nations, needs your help or favor in any matter, you would, in your usual kindness towards all pious people, consider him recommended by me, which would certainly be greatly appreciated by me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my lord Bullinger, I have nothing new to write to you at the moment, but if your excellency has anything to share, I ask that you make me a participant when leisure permits.</p>
      <p>Regarding my little son, whom you wrote you would take to the baths, I have written to you before, entrusting you to do whatever seems necessary for the preservation of the boy's health. God willing, after the upcoming Chur fairs, I will come to you, and if anything has been spent for my son, I will promptly repay it then. Moreover, I further commend him to you, knowing that he is already highly recommended to you. But indeed, I earnestly ask that you greet your most honorable wife and your entire family, and finally also my son, and tell my son in my name, which I ask and implore greatly, that he should be obedient to you and all yours and diligent in his studies, so that when I arrive, I may hear him praised by you and all yours, which will be most pleasing to me. Farewell greatly, my lord, and keep me recommended to you and also excuse me for writing so crudely, or rather inconsiderately, which the bearer's untimely haste has caused.</p>
      <p>Given at Samaden, April 28, 1557.</p>
      <p>The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the greatest professor of the Gospel of all, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and revered lord and patron. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
