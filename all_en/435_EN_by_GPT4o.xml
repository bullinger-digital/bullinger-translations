      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus our Savior! Amen. In the past few days, these letters were delivered to me by a courier, dearest friend Bullinger, and along with the letters, our friend Richard wrote me dreadful news; but which, as I hope, have reached a happy ending, although sad and mournful.</p>
      <p>The uncle of our king (I do not mean the protector of the kingdom, but his brother) attempted with unspeakable treachery to murder our innocent king with his own wicked hands in the dead of night.</p>
      <p>The tragedy unfolded as follows. A royal chamberlain, who was an accomplice in the crime, obtained a key, which allowed access through the corridor to the king's chamber. In the dead of night, he entered accompanied by his accomplices in the crime. Between the door through which he entered and the king's chamber, there was a space. Here, the most faithful guardian of the boy, the royal little dog, happened to be shut out of the room; when he sensed the thief approaching the king's door, he betrayed the murderer with his barking. Angered, the thief first killed the dog, and was about to kill the master too, had God not prevented it. Awakened by this noise, the most faithful guardian of the royal body, having roused some of the king's guards, called Gardeknecht, came out. When he saw the murderer astonished before the door of the royal chamber, he demanded to know what business he had there in such a deep sleep of the night.</p>
      <p>The trembling thief replied that he wanted to test whether the prince was safely guarded. But this excuse did not help him: the following day he was led to the Tower of London as a traitor; and shortly after, the one from the king's chamber who had entrusted him with the key, with whom he had entered. And if by chance the king had not bolted the inner door of his chamber (which rarely happens), it would certainly have been over for him before the other had arrived. Along with the traitor, a knight in charge of the king's mint in Bristol was also captured: for Bristol is the richest maritime city in England. Thus, you have the happy outcome of the entire tragedy. I do not doubt that they finally received the punishment worthy of such a great crime.</p>
      <p>Please give or send these attached letters to those to whom they are owed. Our Strasbourg languishes: the bishop is expected daily. Three things were proposed to the preachers by the magistrate, that they should not speak ill of the Emperor and the princes in their sermons: they agreed; that they should accept the religion proposed by the magistrate: they consented, provided it conformed to the Holy Scripture: thirdly, that they should not whisper a word against the Interim. They say they cannot do this. They are only waiting for a response, and I fear they will have to move elsewhere. John a Lasco lives and is well in England. And you, in turn, live and be well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 15th February 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster, my kind lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
