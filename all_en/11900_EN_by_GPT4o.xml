    <p xml:id="regest1">If only Bullinger were appreciated by everyone according to his talents! [Peter] Kunz, the head of the Bucerans, has died; only a few mourn him, and some attribute his illness to his bitterness. Whether he should be replaced is uncertain, as three pastors are actually sufficient and an election could hardly be unanimous; asks Bullinger to assist [those inclined towards Zwingli] if necessary. Rümlang's [previous] letter [No. 1841] should remain confidential; he has realized that the proposals outlined there are not feasible. In the dedication [of the book against Cochläus], Bullinger may proceed at his own discretion; here, edible gifts are valued more than literary ones. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most learned and in every way most upright and greatest Bullinger; indeed, I recognize the gifts of God in you and your writings that breathe nothing but the divine. If only you were regarded by everyone as you truly are! For it would contribute to the glory of God being more widely embraced, etc.</p>
      <p>Kunz has died, the great support of the Bucerans. I hear of few who are affected by grief. May God be gracious to all. There was no hope of his recovery; he had reached such bitterness because he felt so many obstacles and could not achieve anything except in the most important matters. There are those who consider this the main cause of his illness, etc.</p>
      <p>I have not yet heard who will succeed him, unless our preachers complain about the excessively arduous burden of tasks; for we will be content with three as before. We also fear that the votes will not be unanimous; therefore, we remain silent, etc. I beg you to always be willing to assist us if anything happens, and to be our support.</p>
      <p>I implore you not to show my nonsense, which I dictated in a tumultuous youth, to anyone and not to share what I have sent to your faithful heart with anyone.</p>
      <p>You have completely removed from me the conceived opinion of restoring the truth; however, I know that there are few true friends, and therefore no hope should be placed in them, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the dedication of your book, do whatever you please. I know that here everyone values food and other delicacies that cater to gluttony and luxury more than literary gifts.</p>
      <p>We all greet you, all of us who truly serve God. Given in Bern, February 22, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and vigilant man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his patron in the Lord and dearest brother, etc.</p>
