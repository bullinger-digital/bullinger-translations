      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, although there is nothing at all to write, for I have not heard anything from friends, whom I am certain are not idle, nevertheless, since Nicolaus from the Pellizari family was traveling to Frankfurt, I wanted him to visit you on the occasion of my letters. If you wanted to write to friends, you would have someone to whom you could give the letters.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, everything is complicated, and I am struggling with the greatest difficulties and I begin to foresee that whether an alliance is made or refused, we will be in a precarious situation.</p>
      <p>I begin to fear everything.</p>
      <p>But our lords have hurried and set articles; if King Philipp accepts, then ours can come to an agreement; for I think that much money has been spent on it and the preparations have already been made. What do you want me to say? I do not dare to entrust to letters what I wish.</p>
      <p>Oh, if only I could pour my heart into your bosom! I do not fear Philipp, but our own sins.</p>
      <p>If I oppose it vehemently, then the preparations have already been made. If it is rejected, then Philipp threatens war; then we priests are to blame, and people will come into the country against each other. I cannot advise it either; for the matter seems suspicious to me, even if good words are given.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us and not give us according to our deserts! I do not dare to write more, although I would very much like to. Hercules from Salicibus is pressing the matter and promises many good things, especially regarding religion; others do not believe everything he says. Farewell, reverend Father in Christ, and inform us about the affairs in France and Germany.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 4, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>As for the main issue, I always stand firm; as for the circumstances, they vary so much from day to day and hour to hour that the plan must be changed daily. Something new comes up every day.</p>
      <p>In short, there is nothing complete from top to bottom; therefore, our matter cannot have much stability, etc. To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and honorable Father in Christ.</p>
