      <p>Your dearest brothers in Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>May the almighty, faithful, and good God strengthen you at all times with the power of His Spirit, so that you and yours may grow and increase day by day in the true knowledge of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Knowing, faithful, beloved brothers and lords in Christ, if I were not burdened by the great weight and heavy load of my own cross and that of mine, I might well leave you in peace, for I do not doubt that you all are also burdened by our faithful God with the hope (the cross) of the chosen ones of God. Therefore, I would rightly leave you alone if I did not know that it is fitting to seek comfort from the stronger in weakness and sickness. Therefore, I earnestly and sincerely ask you, by God's will, to advise me on how I should handle my situation without detriment to God's honor; for I cannot and may not endure such poverty and lack in myself, in my pregnant wife, who is due at any moment, and in six children. If I had not been helped so faithfully and brotherly in Konstanz, I would have long had to go into misery and would gladly do so; yet I cannot bear the children, as they cannot go themselves. Moreover, my wife cannot go anywhere, and I am sick and frail every day and know neither how to go forward nor backward. Also know, dear brothers, I did not leave Rorschach without great cause, and one reason is that I did not receive my sustenance; the community would not give it to me, they said the one who sent me there should pay me. The payment was well determined by the captain and council, but I received nothing, indeed I had to sell a coat at the door and give it for grain. Finally, the miller took the cow from the children for his own and rightly so. At the same time, the abbot's father came with his people and searched everything in my house but found nothing. Meanwhile, the abbot also seized all my sweat, and finally, they sold everything there was except for two beds, which they sent to me with my wife and children, and they still owe me 25 guilders and 17 measures of grain as determined compensation. I never receive a penny for it, as it should have been given to me from the monastery's goods. That is now all dead and gone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my dear, faithful brothers, advise me on how I should begin my life. I am ashamed to beg, I cannot work, and I cannot abandon my wife and children. In summary, may the faithful God prevent my flesh from doing what it desires, even though the inner man fights and resists strongly by God's power. But the great poverty presses and urges so hard that I can hardly resist the crosswind. If there is any comfort and encouragement with you in this my misery, I ask you by God not to spare it (not to deny it), as I trust you, and advise me as a comfortless one on what I should do, so that I may endure to the end and after this life receive the eternal with you, my beloved brothers. Amen. May the merciful God grant you all His grace together. Amen.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Eckstein.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger and his fellow workers in the word of God in Zurich, my beloved brothers, H. E.</p>
