      <p>Greetings. I had intended to write to you through Froschauer upon his return from Frankfurt; however, my plan was interrupted by a journey to Strasbourg, undertaken on the advice of my brothers. Upon my return, I quickly wrote this letter to inform you about the state of that church, although I assume it is not entirely unknown to you. It is somewhat turbulent because 14 ministers of that church recently requested dismissal from the senate unless it takes care to eradicate idolatry and extend a just hand of discipline, especially against the Anabaptists, Schwenckfelders, and Hoffmannites. The senate, having taken this request poorly, declared a somewhat harsh response, to which they again, and more extensively than before, pressed their previous request and justified themselves for the secession announced by the church, and thus they remain uncertain about what the final response will be.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having understood the matter, although we do not disapprove of the zeal of the pious colleagues, we strive to achieve with them that, if, as we hope, a tolerable response declares that the magistrate is not entirely alien to a sincere purpose, they should not leave the place and abandon the churches, deprived of pastors, to be devoured by wolves or certainly disturbed by mercenaries, nor should they give the papists an opportunity to triumph ostentatiously, especially since they seem unable to prove this by any precept or example, and that although they cannot now obtain the complete eradication of antichristian impiety, they should at least direct their efforts to ensure by a pious edict that no citizen may participate in papistic rites with impunity. But they will not obtain this without effort and special help from the Lord, especially since with the reception of idolatry, the senate has poorly promised the masked bishop, and I fear the senate will decide to keep it worse unless they are encouraged from above. For although there are those who are not lacking in either judgment or sincere will, they are nevertheless restrained by fear of episcopal indignation or rather of the autocrat, from rendering the service they owe to Christ the Savior with courage, nor have they progressed to the point where they can say with the psalmist: In God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me." Therefore, the Lord must be prayed for all the more, that He may mercifully support and preserve the declining church. Beatus did not join the others in this counsel, led by his own reasons, perhaps because it seemed too hot and vehement to him. However, if he listens to us, or rather to Christ, he will uniquely act to ensure that the magistrate, with whom he seems to have considerable influence, retains his pastors and diligently works to cleanse the church from sacrilegious impiety.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, concerning the margrave near us, we have quite clear indications that he is sufficiently alienated from papistic idolatry and moderately inclined and affectionately disposed towards the true profession of religion, which was recently gathered from his own words by the delegation of our city when he was in the vicinity among his people, nor are there lacking those who seriously urge the reformation of religion with him and hope to obtain it. To this is added Egenolf, Lord of Rappoltstein, lord of several towns and villages near Count Georg of Richenweier, who lacks nothing in favor of religion, but is hindered by pusillanimity from making a place full of Christ by ejecting papism among his people; for his domain is almost entirely composed of episcopal territories, and yet he is in the process of hiring an evangelical preacher in the metropolitan town of Rappoltsweiler, where he has already given me the opportunity to teach for the second time when I visited him on business.</p>
      <p>From the same source, I have understood that Ferdinand's plans will not be so opposed to the pious endeavors of the saints in the future. I wanted you to know this, my brother, so that these seeds may be commended to the Lord in your sacred and your community's prayers, so that by His blessing they may mature into a rich harvest. I receive no news of military matters, and the monarchs, as usual, are undoubtedly giving birth to their offspring, and I wish they were not so monstrous and destructive as they have been so far. But those who have conceived injustice cannot but give birth to iniquity. They say that the Frenchman has promised his Sorbonne, the mother of all hypocrisy and impiety, with great new zeal and effort, to procure the purification of the kingdom from the Lutheran heresy, as soon as he has freed himself from war. I pray that the Lord either converts him, in whose hand is the heart of the king, or strikes him down with the fate of Julian. But farewell, most distinguished man, and highly esteemed by me in Christ Jesus, to whose grace I commend you and all yours. Basel, October 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
