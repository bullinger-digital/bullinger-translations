      <p>Greetings. Why I have not written to you for so long, honorable lord and godfather, I believe you have learned from the letters I recently wrote to my brother. The Lord has visited me with great and immeasurable affliction; for He has taken from me my dearest companion in life after a rather long and severe illness, and left me with nine children bereft of their mother in great sorrow. How great this affliction of ours is cannot be imagined, let alone written. I pray to the Lord to ease my sorrows, grant me patience, and turn His wrath away from us. I also ask you to pray to the Lord for me; for however much I try to break and overcome my sorrows with Christian moderation, I am almost overwhelmed by the recurring and returning storms of temptations and sorrows, especially whenever I look at my many and so young children and consider their fate. She died on March 28th, from what and what kind of illness, my brother will report, to whom I have written everything more extensively. Other matters, as they now touch my mind less because of these sorrows, can also be written about less by me now. Beza returned ten days ago from Frankfurt. He says the princes are sending a joint delegation to the King of the French for the captives. He says nothing was done about religion or a colloquy and that there were few theologians there. Funcklius, a master of the art of carpentry, was also there; from his report, Blaurer writes to us: "The new emperor had to swear many articles, among them these: that he would not seek further coronation and confirmation from the pope.</p>
      <p>Also, no office was held, and the oath was taken without reference to the saints. Also, that he would let everyone be free in religion and not cause any unrest because of it, and that he would bring Metz, Constance, and several more cities back to the empire. Also, they want to have a lasting peace throughout the land with many attached conditions. Also, the French have made an excellent agreement with the Turk, in which, among other things, it was agreed that whatever they gain together, the goods shall belong to the French, but the people to the Turk, upon which the Turk is already starting great incursions. But soon all this will be known exactly, and the French, if he does not desist from serious requests, will be declared a public enemy of Christendom. There is concern about great unrest. The pope will almost spit against this election of the emperor, perhaps also aligning himself with the French and the Turk."</p>
      <p>This from Blaurer. Meanwhile, while these things are happening, our Savoyards are excellently contending, some about predestination, others about the descent of Christ into hell. Four of these ministers have been dismissed by the senate. The people of Lausanne are pressing for excommunication; they did not want to administer the sacrament at this Easter time unless it was granted to them. The senate has postponed the matter to the next week. What will happen, I do not know. Thus, we have battles outside, terrors inside. May the Lord have mercy on His church. You take kindly what I write in a very tumultuous manner, being afflicted. Greet your wife and all yours, and pray to the Lord for us. My mother greets you and asks that you do not take it badly that she left without greeting you recently when I summoned her; for she left a few hours after the messenger arrived, so she could neither arrange her affairs nor greet almost anyone. She is now a great comfort to me, however sick and weak she may be. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 12, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>A certain person from Zofingen added another and indeed greater affliction to our troubles these days by spreading the news that you had passed away. But my brother freed me from this distress when I learned from his letters, which he sent to me these days, that this was false, as he made no mention of this matter. Therefore, I give thanks to the Lord and pray to Him to keep you safe and sound with us for as long as possible. Request copies of the Decades translated by Froschauer in my name, as many as you wish. I instructed my brother to present one in my name to Mr. Consul Habio and also one to Mr. Cham.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Blaurer writes the same to me, adding that Funckli arrived just as the emperor was lending the fiefs; he saw that.</p>
