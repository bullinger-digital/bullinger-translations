      <p>Greetings. I, reverend father in Christ, will be very brief in writing; the reason is that I approach writing with great reluctance due to some fault, namely because I tire myself greatly with continuous sermons, to which I was not accustomed before, and if I have any free time, I spend it in some sort of weariness. Certainly, the eagerness for studies and the vigor of spirit that I once had have greatly diminished, and it is no wonder; for then I approached studies and writing only with a serene and unoccupied mind, and while I pondered even individual syllables more carefully, I almost became another procrastinator; now many things come to be done at once, which have taught me to write suddenly and also to act more hastily on each matter. Therefore, if hereafter, most illustrious man, you find the old diligence lacking in my letters, I ask you to forgive me. But what? I proceed further than I wish.</p>
      <p>Your volume of sermons has been returned to me; but because there were continuous rains at that time, it was completely soaked; however, it suffered no damage or erasure. Now, because I have to thank you so often (even though whatever comes from you to me cannot but be most welcome to me), I am almost ashamed. For when I consider the magnitude of your benefits, when I place your most ample merits before my eyes and, in turn, consider what kind of man I am, and how I do not achieve even the smallest part of your merits in returning thanks, is there not enough material provided and left for me to blush? But since it is the nature of great men to bind many to themselves with benefits, in that respect I will gladly yield to you and, as much as clients owe to their patrons, I will confess that I owe to you and yours, as long as I live, and now in the present, indeed, I will repay you with the price that it is customary for the richer to be paid by the poorer today: thanks to God. There is no copy to deposit in the library, as there is none with us except scattered and closed to me and others. However, I will most candidly share it with other friends, and lest you suspect me of committing any fraud in this matter, I have also given your letters to Mr. Philipp and Pontisella to be read and inspected, wherefore they too are most grateful to you.</p>
      <p>Last week I sent you letters from the most illustrious man Mr. Friedrich von Salis; whether they have been delivered to you, I doubt.</p>
      <p>The news from Italy is roughly as follows: Between the Pope and Duke Alba, who acted in the name of the imperial majesty, etc., a peace has been concluded; with what terms, I cannot yet know (except that Duke Alba imposes laws on the defeated). Therefore, the French are coming back, namely now two dukes of Guise, brothers of the Duke of Guise, who was the commander, also another duke (whose name I do not know), the son-in-law of the Duke of Guise, the commander, also another duke of Mantua, so that in total 4 dukes are coming back with 500 cuirassiers and 600 light horses. On the date of this letter, the postmaster rides with a courier, given to him by the city, also several others into the French service in Valtellina, to arrange accommodations here and there; they are also supposed to lead a large number of light horses with them. The Duke of Ferrara is not included in the peace, although the Pope is said to have worked hard on it, but in vain. Meanwhile, since the Duke of Florence with the Duke of Parma and Piacenza (if I remember correctly) have undertaken a great military preparation against the Ferrara, some princes and lords have intervened, so much so that these two dukes are said to have proposed some articles of the treaty to the Ferrara and demanded three strong places, among which one is called Reggio, the other Modena (if I write the Italian names correctly), the third has not been named to me. But the Ferrara has complained and opposed this greatly and has offered a sum of money for it. Therefore, those who come from Italy say that it now hangs on the same.</p>
      <p>The brother of the Duke of Ferrara has recently ridden through here on the post, sent by his brother to France, and is said to have been still imperial 14 days ago. These things from the consuls, who also ordered me to send you their greetings.</p>
      <p>Mr. Frölich, along with some enemies of the Confederates and Pünten, is said to still hold himself in the service and land of the Ferrara, as long as peace can be reached. These things, as you see, hastily; if you share them with Mr. Collin, you will do a favor to him and to me. You will convey greetings from me and my wife to your most honorable wife, your children, and all your sons-in-law, also to the most learned men Mr. Gwalter and Mr. Wolf with other brothers and colleagues who teach the gospel of Christ in your church. Chur, September 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his patron and benefactor, much to be respected. Zürich, Mr. Bullinger, etc.</p>
