      <p>S. P. Most illustrious and venerable Lord Bullinger, during the past Lenten fair, I received the letters of your humanity, along with two booklets which your humanity opposed to Johann Brenz, of which I handed one to our preacher Nikolaus Roll. I have read the writing of your humanity and praise its modesty. Your humanity would certainly have many occasions to respond to the slanders of that Brenz, if you did not more regard what pertains to the matter, and it has long been well known to your humanity that business cannot be appeased by insults, but rather exacerbated. Your humanity is indeed well regarded among our people here and among as many learned men as possible for its singular modesty, which is more esteemed and praised here than all the unjust jests of Brenz. Would that he would confess outwardly what he believes inwardly and learn to control his passions, whom Heshusius follows, formerly a preacher among the Bremen people, who now lives with us here on his income, but no longer acts as a preacher. Would that he too would desist from his insults, which our money, when he was studying in Wittenberg, did not deserve to be spent on him. Let them all see to it that in their arrogance they do not strive to please this age and some men, lest they lose the future age. In these past days, Paul Knebius, a certain Flemish notary, also brought other letters from your humanity, to whom I ordered these of mine to be delivered. I give thanks, my most beloved Lord Bullinger, that you deign to greet me with your pen at times; for I know that in other serious matters your humanity is occupied with so many writings that it can scarcely be allowed. I continue to be yours; love me, I beg, and separately intercede with the Lord for me in your prayers, and also in your public ecclesiastical prayers, I beg, pray to the Lord, who I am now beginning to reach my fortieth year, that he may grant me a God-fearing and pious wife, with whom I may live healthily and bless his name and that of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, all the days of my life. I earnestly entreat your humanity, most beloved Lord Bullinger, not to cease praying to the Lord, that he may hear you for me. I, together with the others, will also invoke, if he does not wish to hear us, that he may at last hear your humanity with his own. Furthermore, concerning the business of those two nobles in the matrimonial case known to your humanity, one of them, namely A., the first, who had pledged his faith without conjugal embrace, has already passed away unmarried to the heavens a few months ago, the second, C., still survives, and the girl B. He and C. would still very much like to marry the girl; but seeing that it is difficult to obtain it from the prince of the country and especially not to offend God, at least one of them (if not both) will devote themselves to another marriage, although it will be hard for the noble C. to undertake. Therefore, I again beseech and earnestly entreat your humanity, that you may not be unmindful of them in your private prayers, that the heavenly Father, for the sake of his son Jesus Christ, may be willing to have mercy on them and look upon them, guide and govern them with his holy spirit, that having obtained the gift, whatever prescribed by the Lord, they may adhere to it and always praise and bless the Lord without ceasing, to whom be praise and honor forever and ever. Amen. Farewell again and continue to love me as I love your humanity.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, in Wesel, October 25, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most ready for anything for your humanity, Adolph von Baars.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and venerable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God among the Zurichers, his lord and esteemed friend. In Zurich, to his own hands.</p>
      <p>Adolf von Baars.</p>
