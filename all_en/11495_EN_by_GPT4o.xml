      <p>I would have sent GrynÄ™us's letter earlier if a courier had been available; they arrived here eight days ago. Therefore, please understand that you are receiving them so long after the date; no one is less at fault than I am.</p>
      <p>Regarding your students whom you sent to us for the sake of their studies, I do not know what to write. After two left me, we lost Kunhart not long after, and Christian in recent days, unless he is in his homeland, which you can easily understand from Rhellicanus. Christophorus is still with me, a young man, as far as I know, not bad. I mention this so that nothing may be lacking in us, to whom you entrusted them.</p>
      <p>Farewell always in the Lord with your family and brothers. Basel, January 7, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
