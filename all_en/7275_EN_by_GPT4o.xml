      <p>S. D. As far as it concerns, dear brother, Mr. Brunner, I gladly read that you have advised him; but in turn, I wish that he would seek those things which are of peace and concord. I am sending you two letters here and trust them to you alone, so that you may read them and then safely return them to me. I am displeased with the proud nature, and that he attributes more to himself than is appropriate and is more devoted to disputes than befits a minister. The confession of our churches is approved by all the more sincere ministers and doctors of the churches of Germany, all of France, England, Scotland, Poland, and other faithful kingdoms, but it is not approved by Brunner alone.</p>
      <p>I write this so that you may know how to conduct yourself towards him and that you may wish to be an authority to him, so that he does not foster schism, etc.</p>
      <p>As far as the current events are concerned, we have no further writing from Bern. From Geneva, I have a letter dated October 12th, stating that the queen has brought the king to a secure place, though not without some setback; however, where, how, or what the setback was, is not printed.</p>
      <p>Also, Picardy, Normandy, and the cities around Paris are being held by the prince, and he has a very strong, well-equipped force. On November 1st, 6000 German riders are supposed to be in Lorraine and join the prince, etc. So much from Geneva. Yesterday, a nobleman from Gelderland arrived here, the third one, and he comes from Geneva the nearest; he says that in Geneva they have the news that the Huguenots have taken Avignon and killed the pope's legate, the cardinal, there; they have also taken Rouen, Toulouse, Calais, and other prominent cities along with Normandy and Picardy and what is around Paris. Those in Lyon, having become aware of this, have become milder and are letting go of much of their cruelty; perhaps thinking that they will be visited for the actions committed, etc. But whether this is so and whether it is true or not, I cannot say. The nobleman says it is true. The clamor grows more and more that something has happened between the Huguenots and the Confederates, over which some have perished. As the matters have reached me, so I give them to you. However, whatever the case, it would be good not to join, and if one must join, to command the servants who went before to return and not to help anyone against the true religion and against the French nobility. But may God grant grace that the authorities act justly!</p>
      <p>God be with you. Diligently greet for me the three mayors, Mr. Ganthner, Mr. Pontisella, and other gentlemen and friends.</p>
      <p>Dated October 24, 1567.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
