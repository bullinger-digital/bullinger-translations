    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to a letter from his fianc√©e, who informed him that she did not want to leave the convent after all; complains about this unexpected change, reminds her of the marriage promise, and seeks to counter her reasons with biblical arguments: marriage is willed by God, therefore she should not fear that some would find her departure offensive. He asks her not to expose his love and perseverance to ridicule, but to confirm her loyalty to him.</p>

      <p>I never expected such a completely unexpected answer from you, it is so much more unbearable to me, as it was so much more unexpected. And your writing troubles me, since (because) you are of such understanding that you can well consider: if (when) I had set my mind, heart, love, and loyalty elsewhere, then solely to you, my only one, I would not have waited so long, written to you in vain, not given myself to other honorable people, not let myself be driven by the whole world for so long.</p>
      <p>I have done much out of great love and hope for you; so look, how you accept (receive) my service, or how you justly let my loyalty be put to shame! The flattery and advocacy of honor is long enough, we are dealing with matters of honor. Therefore, I would not have needed all this fuss, since you wrote to me much more freely before than now, and do not err, that you say: "Yes, I do not think that our words should harm us now (in any way)." - You have certainly spoken and written this out of temptation; for (because) if you reflect on your previous writing, you will find otherwise, namely that you have freely consented to me to your part, as far as and also those of yours consented therein, and your words sounded thus: (Recita). Now, my lord has taken up the matter out of love and loyalty against your brother Hans, to whom you are most attached, and he has freely consented, as far as you consent. Now you have consented, so now the consent is complete; you cannot rightly withdraw from me before God, for a Christian's word should be such that "yes, yes" it is [Mt 5,37]. I admonish you just as strongly through the suffering of Christ as you do me, that you hold to me and prove yourself, as I trust you well and I well know that it is God's will and order.</p>
      <p>It is certainly true that God has instituted the marital state, so that one does not sin with it. If you speak, you want to resist the temptation, so I truly fear, you do it more for your own sake and the world, than that you fear, you might not live as godly in marriage as outside of marriage. Dear, what are you dealing with, what are you taking on? Are not the highest friends of God [James 2,23] of both testaments married people? And that Paul praises purity, he does so because our flesh has so much more rest; it is found freely in Corinthians [1 Cor 7,28]. Therefore, do not seek such excuses (pretexts) first, and recognize that you are also a human being, do not presume too much etc.</p>
      <p>But most of all, it grieves me that you draw the offense herewith and burden yourself with the words of Christ: "Woe to him who causes offense!" [Mt 18,7.] Dear, so tell me, do you not think that I am as much of Christ as you and would just as unwillingly offend anyone as you? What does offense mean? Does it not come from the evil and wicked? Yes. What do the words of Christ in Matthew 18 [7] mean: "Woe to the man who causes offense"? Can you make anything else out of it than: Woe to the man who leads such a shamefully evil wicked life that other people are offended by it, also become worse, or are injured by it? Or, if that is not the meaning of the words, why does it then immediately follow: "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you" [Mt 18,8]? See, hand and foot are the sinful members: Colossians 3 [5ff]. So we should put away sin, so that we do not offend anyone with it.</p>
      <p>Now, you draw the offense into our matter: many pious people will be offended by it. So it is certainly true that one must be offended only by the evil; and if they are offended by your matter, then your matter must be evil and wicked: so is also the marriage evil. See, where you come to! But what does Paul say in Hebrews 13 [4]? "Marriage is honorable among all and the marriage bed undefiled." - Yes, you say: but they did not understand that it is right for us. - Who did not understand it? - Many pious people. - See, see, that is just beautiful! Isaiah says: "Woe to you who call evil good and good evil!" Isaiah 5 [20].</p>
      <p>Now, marriage is, as God and his prophets and apostles testify, good; and those who say it is evil, but sit in the monastery and wail and rot there, which God rejects, say it is good. So look, what pious people you present to me! In short: no pious person can be offended by what is right. If he is offended, then he is not yet truly pious.</p>
      <p>Marriage is permitted to all states: 1 Timothy 4 [1-5]; 1 Corinthians 7 [2.9.27 ff]; Matthew 19 [3ff]. Those who are offended do not want to be corrected, because it is said enough; so they are certainly not weak, but want to be offended with force. They are exactly those who are offended by all God's orders. Should one now wait for all of them and not proceed much further in what is right, then nothing would come of Christian religion but despair, doubt, and falling back and forth. In sum: no pious heart is displeased with what is right; if it is displeased, then it is not yet truly pious. Should one now always follow the same, then we and they would perish. Thus the psalmist says: "You shall not follow the wicked," Psalm 37 [27].</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not mention the offense to me in this form anymore, or tell me freely beforehand: marriage is evil. But I think you would now also like to please the world, because you say, they will say, you have gone out of the way of debauchery. See, see, these are fine little children, whom one should not offend, who say, marriage is debauchery! Remember St. Paul: "If I wanted to please men, I would not be a servant of God" [Gal 1,10]. Yes, it will not happen that we should always flatter (please) them. Christ, the Son of God, himself was not without hindrance and reproach, therefore we must not regard them either: 1 Peter 4 [1ff]. You must also not fear the threat of the bailiff. Solomon says: "Whoever fears man will fall, but whoever trusts in God will be safe" [Proverbs 29, 25]. You know the bailiff so well that his words should not rightly move you, especially since he can only harm you in temporal matters.</p>
      <p>Dear, do not be so childish and tempted, you who have the knowledge of God's goodness and his word! See that I can freely despise everything for your sake, that I desire you alone! You do not need the pretext: "I am not for you"; let me worry about that! Be a little more friendly and let me enjoy; if I have ever done you good, do not put me to shame with your withdrawal! Give me a friendly answer, you must enjoy that with me the day you live!</p>
      <p>Now may God grant you grace and also give you in your mind that you do his will with joy. Given.</p>
