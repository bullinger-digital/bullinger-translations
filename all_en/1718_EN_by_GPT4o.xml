      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, here is Aurelius for you, whom I am sending to handle certain business for me not only in Zürich, but also in Basel, primarily to pay off certain creditors. I wanted to come myself at this time; but a very serious reason kept me, namely the celebration of public assemblies in our Graubünden. They are scheduled for St. Gall's Day; in which many things about religion, I wish, as we desire! Certainly, a great debate is to be expected. Listen about Camillo Renato, listen Bullinger: he wanted to set out for Bergamo; meanwhile, while he was touring the city, behold the officers, who apprehend the man and throw him into prison, nor will he leave alive, I think. I myself had committed myself to a much greater danger last year, when I had entered Italy and wandered through it for 20 days; but God preserved me. I will not tempt Him further, believe me.</p>
      <p>Cardinal de Tournon made a journey through the town of my ministry. We met and discussed the whole cause of religion. Good God, how much he labored to bring me to the reconciliation of the harlot (the Catholic Church). But you will hear the whole story from me in order. I could hardly have believed that it was still possible for me to recover my mitre, indeed even the purple hat, and to stand by my own efforts.</p>
      <p>But do not doubt, my Bullinger: all mitres and purples are worthless, as long as I look to Christ. This temptation not only did not move me to think of reconciliation, but it kindled me to act for the cause of the pious and the republic of Christ.</p>
      <p>I was amazed that that great man showed such humanity and, I might almost say, humility towards me. He was hunting, of course, but he did not catch the beast, as he hoped.</p>
      <p>A certain brother writes from Italy almost in these words: "I could have already sold all of Bullinger's works, which you sent to me (for they are highly valued by everyone); but many pages are missing from them." I replied, asking him to declare which ones are missing; for I will ensure they are sent. Meanwhile, the negligence of that servant, who had folded them, is inconvenient for me; for I could have sent money now, if the books had been delivered to me intact. But I will not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>A great man will indeed soon head to Geneva for the gospel. I have a certain portion of his belongings with me, which I will send to you; I beg you, Bullinger, for Christ's sake, to ensure that it is transported to Lord Margrave as soon as possible at no cost to you; for I will reimburse the expense immediately. Tavà is the name of the town where the assemblies will be held; from there I will come directly to you. Meanwhile (listen, I beg you, to a matter that is very dear to my heart) if by chance Richard Morosini, the envoy of the King of England, comes to Zürich (for I hope he will come), plead my case with him with the charity you are accustomed to, and affirm that I have decided to want to cross over to England with him; therefore, ask him to indicate when he himself will have set out there and where I should find him. I entrust this business to you again and again, indeed I ask, do not spare the expense and send a personal messenger to me (if it seems good to him), who will inform me of everything. I will remain at home until St. Gall's Day; I will spend three days at the assemblies; soon I will hasten to you (as I said). I heard that the envoy himself had gone to Venice; therefore, if he wishes to follow the Emperor, he will come to Zürich (I suppose). Farewell and be well with the whole church and family. Greet especially your sons-in-law for me, whom I love very much. Vicosoprano, 15th of September 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
