      <p>Greetings and blessings. Reverend and esteemed, dearest brother, your letters were most pleasing to me, both because I sincerely love you and rightly hold you in high regard, and for that reason, all your matters are most dear to me, and because I understand how much you love my son Heinrich, whom you strive to help in every way. My sons' letters to me indeed proclaim this about your kindness, and the excellent young master Collin (Collinus) proclaims the same most fully. Therefore, I give the greatest thanks I can to your piety, and since I cannot repay such a great favor, I sincerely pray to God the Father, the rewarder of all good things, to bless you and your family. However, if my modest means can ever be of service, I offer myself and all that is mine to you and yours, and I beseech your piety to continue to be a father to my son and to instruct him faithfully, so that he may return to his homeland not only learned but also with integrity and modesty. But since I understand that he cannot obtain a degree (which I see you also suspect) without the troubles and slanders of many, I prefer that he return to us learned, adorned with your testimony and that of other learned men, without a degree; I will value this as much as the testimony of the whole school (although I hold it in high regard). Therefore, you can hardly believe how much pain your sorrows have stirred in my heart, caused by the ill-conceived pursuits of some ungrateful people. May the Lord restrain those belligerent minds and prevent you from being exiled in your old age. Yet it would be better to be exiled than to yield even a little to those adulterating the truth of Christ. Moses, the distinguished servant of God, chose rather to suffer with the people of God than to enjoy temporary comforts, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. And we know that neither Moses nor the patriarchs nor the prophets nor our Lord himself lacked anything in exile. I would wish for nothing more than to see you and converse with you pleasantly. I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ that what is beneficial for his church may come to pass. We utterly condemn here the most impious doctrine of that cynic from Prague, falsely called a Jesuit, that Christ Jesus is not now an intercessor in heaven. We believe and firmly hold what the beloved apostle John taught us in his first canonical letter, chapter 2, and we do not reject what Saint Aurelius Augustine wrote on those words. We are pleased and approve of what you have recorded on paper from the scriptures, from Cyprian, and Eusebius, for which I give you the greatest thanks. Let us pray to the Lord that he may deign to pacify and strengthen the church, which he redeemed with his blood and consecrated to himself as a special possession. The distinguished man, Peter Martyr, who loves you dearly, commends himself to you. Lord Lelio greets you, whose parent died this summer. Theodorus Bibliander, my three sons-in-law Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler, Gualther, also a relative, senior Collin, and the other brothers and fellow ministers greet you most affectionately. Italy is ablaze with wars incited by the pope; the king of France is involved in these. All of Italy is torn by factions, so great calamities are to be feared from this. May the Lord Jesus finally drive out this savage beast from the seat of pestilence and gather his scattered little sheep.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, reverend man and dearest brother. May the Lord bless you and your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 1, in the year of our Lord 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger, wholly from the heart.</p>
