      <p>S. D. P. (Salutation and Greeting). So that my children, when they reach adulthood, do not enter into marriages with the people of this age at the risk of their salvation, and so that I, concerning divine worship, do not have to act out of fear in a way that pleases men more than God, and for that reason have to struggle with the devil in the agony of death, I have completely decided to change my place of residence as soon as I conveniently can, and settle elsewhere where such danger is not necessary. Therefore, I ask your kindness, my Bullinger, brother in Christ, to consult a wise and prudent citizen on my behalf and transcribe his advice to me, in which town among the Swiss I could most conveniently support my family. In order for this to be properly advised, it seemed appropriate to reveal some part of my life, character, and condition. In my youth, I laid the foundations of Latin grammar in a particular school in Li√®ge, where in the year 1526, I first learned that Luther opposed the doctrine of the papists. Therefore, anxious about my salvation, I wished to be informed which party taught correctly. In 1527, I was taught by some in my homeland that Luther justly opposed the papists on the article of justification; in 1528, for the sake of learning more fully what was necessary for salvation, I went to Wittenberg against my father's wishes, where I stayed for several years and, after my father's death, returned to my homeland and engaged in business for several years, which succeeded very well before marriage, but not at all after marriage. Why this is so, God knows; my assets now do not exceed 700 or 800 thalers. In 1545, I married a wife, from whom I have four surviving children. If I were not certain that I am not endowed with a very great memory and am more than sufficiently modest, I would not have undertaken business but would have taken up another condition. I am neither learned in Greek nor Hebrew, and although I am somewhat proficient in Latin, I do not excel in the ability to speak extemporaneously. Therefore, I am not suited to teaching young people. My nature is inclined to those studies and arts that are aided by arithmetic, from which I conjecture that if I had followed my natural inclination in my youth and adolescence, I could have become a skilled mathematician. However, I avoided that study (which I now regret), partly because it supports few, and partly because I thought not much utility could be transferred to others from it, and indeed I would still delight in that study if age, being 47 years, and condition did not now demand otherwise. Before I left Wittenberg, I understood that Luther and Bugenhagen did not have the correct view of the sacrament of the body of Christ, not clearly, but as if through a sieve, I saw what Christ meant when he said: "This is my body." Later, having returned to my homeland, I was admonished by Oecolampadius's antisyngram and examined Augustine, where I learned the matter more perfectly. However, in Augustine's opinion, that sacraments are not sacraments unless they have some likeness to the things of which they are sacraments, I do not think it should be adhered to very firmly; for in the sacred scriptures, in my judgment, many signs are found and many more could be conceived that neither in substance nor in effect have a likeness to the things of which they are signs, as if a master about to go abroad, among other things, instructs his servant to meet him with a horse on a certain appointed day, and fears that the servant might forget this command, so he makes a knot in his belt with this admonition: "Behold, servant, let this knot be a reminder to you, lest you forget this command. When therefore you see and feel this knot, then you will remember this command," etc. Who does not see here that the knot has no likeness to the thing signified? I nevertheless frankly admit that those signs which have a likeness to the things signified are more suitable for reminding. I am greatly amazed and grieved that so many pious and excellent doctors of the church have not yet come to that knowledge, to understand and see that signs often take the names of the things signified and that according to that rule, the words of Christ: "This is my body" should be explained, especially since that explanation not only has nothing perplexing or inconvenient in it, but also most clearly illustrates the glory of God for our salvation, whereas the literal explanation of the Neoterics brings with it many opinions and absurdities and shows no benefit except some fictitious and imaginary one.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that this error will be gradually corrected among the pious, especially since I hear that among you the truth about sacramental expressions is taught quite modestly and not harshly.</p>
      <p>Luther, as a strong man, has certainly deserved much from all of us, so we should rightly forgive him this error, since without any doubt God himself forgives him. We do not all know everything; indeed, in my judgment, no Christian, while living in this life, is without some error. As long as we believe that God is propitious to us for Christ's sake, the matter will be safe, even if we do not perceive everything so acutely that we understand well the good will of God towards us. If you wish to respond to me (I wish to be answered at the next Frankfurt fair, if not sooner), then send the letters to me with these words: "This letter should be sent by the honorable Bartholomeus Boichorst, resident in Cologne, at the place by the Herrenhuis, to his brother-in-law Diederich Becks, my good friend." Farewell. Given at Ruremond in the Duchy of Guelders, the day before the calends of May in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Theodricus Beccius Laurentius, your friend and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
