      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my patron and most esteemed lord, Johannes Rudolf Stumpf sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing to say how much the letters of my father and yours have stirred me with anxiety and care, most distinguished man, for both of you again so anxiously warn me to beware of gifts, even though I have already excused myself many times. I do not know what else it could be, except that I am falsely accused by those who are evil and not at all favorable (as I gather from my father's letters). I certainly call upon the most good and great God as a witness that I am completely free from this fault. For although I asked you to write in my name to Mr. Cox, Treherne, and Peter Martyr, I was not seeking gifts, but only pursuing friendships; for, as you well know, I have always desired nothing other than to be grateful. If that is a more serious offense, I confess that I have sinned.</p>
      <p>However, I hope I have managed that you will soon hear what the truth is in this matter from Mr. Hooper and Peter Martyr; I would have also requested letters, as they call them, testimonials from Mr. Cox, the chancellor of the university, if he were not now gravely suffering from pleurisy while being far away.</p>
      <p>If anyone is still not satisfied with this, we will see what should be done further. I have also left the college on the advice of good men, so that I may finally free myself completely from this false suspicion. Until now, I have paid 5 English crowns for a quarter in the college; elsewhere, 6 will now have to be paid due to the high cost of provisions, which is increasing daily.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to commend my innocence in this matter to your humanity, to be defended where necessary. I also give the greatest thanks I can for your most useful commentaries; for you have made Peter our dearest friend from a friend. I hope that his commentaries on the first epistle to the Corinthians, in which we assist him by writing, will soon be published. Lord Treherne had gone to France with hostages; whether he has returned yet or not, I do not know at all. The Duke of Somerset, formerly the protector of the kingdom, who was recently cast down into the mud, has now been raised again to the highest dignity and appointed to the king's council.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, everything is calm and peaceful. I would like you to return the greetings to your sons, who are most dear to my heart (whose greeting in your letters was most pleasing to me), as courteously as possible; I will also write to them diligently as soon as I have the opportunity. Please also convey my greetings to your most honorable wife and to Huldrych Zwingli, your son-in-law, my old friend. Farewell, pride of the homeland. Given in Oxford in the year 1550, on the 15th of May.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rudolf Stumpf, most observant of your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and singularly learned, most serious and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church among the Swiss in Zürich, his patron and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
