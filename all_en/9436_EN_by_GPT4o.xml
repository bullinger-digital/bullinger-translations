      <p>S. I have just been informed that our Muralt will be leaving tomorrow. Our courier returned yesterday; I still do not know what he brought to the lords.</p>
      <p>My brother sent a note from which I understood that the council was not convened at your place on the last Monday and that you were occupied with the wedding of your niece, the daughter of the late Huldrych Zwingli of blessed memory, to which (I pray to the Lord) He may grant His blessing.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I am expecting your letters through the other messenger whom I sent. I have not yet met with Steiger because he is away from the city, nor do I have anything to report to him until I receive your letters. In the meantime, Beza has come here; he is setting out for Strasbourg to Condé, from whom he writes he has been summoned. He brought nothing new of significance, except that he left these letters with me to forward to you, along with those homilies, which I am sending together. There is nothing new about the king, except that he is passing through Savoy. Beza hoped to meet Bellièvre on the journey.</p>
      <p>On the same day he was here, as he wanted to leave immediately, Mr. Tretius also arrived, namely last Sunday. He greeted Beza, who was just about to mount his horse, together with the Colignys. Afterwards, Beza departed. Tretius spent a few more hours with us, and although Beza went ahead, Tretius followed him so that they spent the night together in Fraubrunnen.</p>
      <p>Our courier has not yet returned from Milan; when he comes, I will explain to you how those matters stand.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, fare well. Greet my brother; for I am not writing to him now.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 26, late at night, 1573.</p>
      <p>Here are letters concerning Mr. Zingg's mother, which I beg you to give either to her or to my brother.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
