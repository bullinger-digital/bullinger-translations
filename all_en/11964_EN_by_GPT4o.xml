    <p xml:id="regest1">Hans Jakob von Landau reported to Johann Menlishofer about a letter from the Emperor [Charles V], in which he asks for clarification regarding an alleged alliance of Konstanz with the Swiss Confederation and expresses his displeasure towards Konstanz. In response, von Landau appeased the Emperor and his chancellor [Johann von] Naves by pointing out the issues actually troubling the city ([Thomas Hütlin?] and Reichenau) and was able to convince them of an offer of assistance to Konstanz. Menlishofer will immediately inform the Secret Council of Konstanz about this. Blarer was therefore not unjustified in fearing that the Emperor would negotiate with Konstanz and that the Swiss Confederates should have sent a friendly letter to the city; however, caution is advised at the moment. He asks for reflection, assures his goodwill, and hopes for a successful outcome. Besides [Diethelm] Röist, no one should learn the names mentioned here. Inquires about the teacher and preacher Hieronymus Kaufmann; greetings.</p>

      <p>Friendly, dearly beloved lord and brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I learned in great secrecy that our physician, Doctor Hans Menlishofer, was with Lord Hans Jakob von Landau, the governor of Nellenburg. He informed him that the Emperor had written to him a few days ago, stating that His Majesty had been credibly and confidentially informed that the people of Konstanz, in contempt of His Majesty and against their honor and oath, had established an alliance with the Swiss Confederation, thereby allying themselves with His Majesty and the Empire. Therefore, he should immediately proceed to Konstanz and inquire of them, and if this were so, His Majesty had received great and severe displeasure from it and would not be at peace until they were punished accordingly, with more content, etc.</p>
      <p>From this, he understood well that the people of Konstanz had been very badly slandered and misrepresented to His Majesty by their adversaries, etc. He was also very shocked by this letter and was concerned that if he were to carry out the order so harshly, it might cause more displeasure than goodwill among the people of Konstanz. Therefore, he wrote back to His Majesty and her chancellor, Lord von Naves, explaining why he had not carried out the order, and especially because he had learned that the people of Konstanz had not dealt with the Swiss Confederation; although they had been with them on several days, it was because of a former citizen; he also did not think that this was the way to deal with the people of Konstanz, but he thought it would be good, since he knew that the people of Konstanz were greatly burdened by the Ow and other matters, that His Majesty should appoint someone to the people of Konstanz and graciously request them to report all their grievances to His Majesty, with the promise of providing them relief.</p>
      <p>In response, the chancellor replied that His Majesty had approved of this opinion and would soon give orders and instructions. He, Menlishofer, could well inform some trusted members of the council of this; he has also been instructed twice and has been told much about the Ow, how the bishop does not hold to the king and the king is not satisfied with him, also how unkindly and unfairly the people of Konstanz are treated, also that it was once discussed that the people of Konstanz should be given a district across the Rhine, and more he has shown and let it be known quite clearly how inclined he is to the people of Konstanz and in every way desires to help promote their affairs with His Majesty for their best. Menlishofer will still tonight, as I understand, report all this to our secret council.</p>
      <p>From all this, you can well understand, firstly, that I have not written to you unjustly for a long time, that His Majesty will negotiate with Konstanz; also why I advised that the Swiss Confederates should have written a friendly letter to my lords in good time; also that my oral advice was still the best, that nothing should be negotiated publicly; that neither the Swiss Confederates nor Konstanz should be advised to expose themselves to the displeasure of this time and provoke the Emperor, by cutting off supplies or in another way undertaking something hostile against Konstanz, but that it should only be seen that Konstanz does not deepen (engage, bind) itself with the other party. However, it will be difficult to reject great things and at the same time not be able to hope for anything elsewhere; it will also not be good to openly instill hope in them and thus the other party might feel what is being denied to them, that it happens because of the hope of the other (the) benefit; for from this would follow equal danger (deception, danger). I have not wanted to withhold this good, trusted opinion from you, with a request that you, since so much depends on you and us, diligently consider the matter. I mean it truly and well before my God, as the end will show, whether it turns out well, whichever way it may go. So I write to you the truth before the Lord, as I have also testified orally before you. May God grant grace, that whatever good is to be done, it may also be done in the best way, so that it may succeed. Amen.</p>
      <p>To Lord Röist, please convey many services, good and greetings from me. You may also show this letter to him; but to others, whoever they may be, you should not reveal the names for great reasons, but you may well show the trusted ones the summary without the names, so that the matter remains secret on my part.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste, on the 26th of May at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, 1544. There is here, if I am not mistaken, a certain Hieronymus Hofmann or Kaufmann, who has served as a schoolmaster somewhere among the Swiss, learned in Greek and Latin, and who is also very capable in preaching. About whom I ask you to write to me diligently his age, other conditions, how many children he has, with what other gifts of the Lord he is adorned, especially whether he has made an attempt in preaching the Gospel of Christ and with what success. Afterwards, you will understand why I am so eager to learn this from you. Greet your wife with your whole household and commend us diligently to the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and by far dearest Lord Bullinger.</p>
