      <p>I was deceived by the one who promised to have this letter delivered to you. But now Master Johannes Thomas, the envoy of the people of Magdeburg, is here, whom I do not need to recommend to you, since the cause itself and the very honorable mission of the legation commend him enough. He himself will explain to you in person the entire war with its outcome most diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul; I cannot write more, as it is also necessary to write letters of recommendation to Augsburg. February 1, 1552.</p>
