    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The day before, Bullinger gave the messenger from Constance [...] a letter [No. 2774] to take with him. When he returned from the church, where he had delivered a Latin [Karlstag] speech to the pastors, as is customary in Zürich, he found Blarer's letter [No. 2775]. When he then wanted to go to the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater?], he was told that the mayor was in a council meeting due to a letter that had arrived from Constance [dated January 26, 1547]. Meanwhile, Bullinger uses the time to write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer is thanked for his letter and for the friendly reception of the letter written by Bullinger in distress [No. 2767]. God and the eternal truth remain the rock! One should ask Him for grace. One should completely surrender to Him. His will be done. [Blarer and Bullinger], who are in the same boat, should faithfully perform their duty until death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In both their names, Blarer should write to Georg Frölich and Johannes Haller and urge them to stay in Augsburg as long as there is still a reason for hope. Leaving the city now would be premature. Moreover, the people in Zürich are just as fickle as in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger does not know that the Confederates [at the last Diet] decided [not to address the case of Constance at the future Diet]. Bullinger hides nothing from Blarer. The traitors will always spread false rumors. Likewise, Bullinger has not heard anything about a future Diet where the matters between France and the Confederates are to be addressed. Should a Diet be scheduled, he will report on it immediately. It is certain that if Francis I requests mercenaries, no Diet is needed for that. The money for the mercenaries is already ready in Basel, and whether the officials of the Inner Cantons want it or not, if Francis I wants it, the marching will begin by March 1 at the latest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] If Emperor Charles V is still alive and breathing and not already drinking from the waters of the Styx, he is still only flesh and blood and will therefore only be able to do what God allows him. Trust in the latter! He must be proclaimed! And if one must die for it, it would be a gain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to Mrs. [Katharina, née Ryff] and children, to Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick, to whom Bullinger offers all that is his, as long as he lives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Should Duke Christoph [of Württemberg from Basel] be expelled, then it will be well established that the [Confederates] are just as inept and unreliable as others.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Yesterday I wrote with your messenger. Now I just came out of the church. I gave a Latin address for the clergy, as is customary; then I found your letter on the table. When I wanted to go to the mayor, I was told he was in a council meeting about letters. Therefore, I must write now while I have time. I will speak further with my lord later, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I thank you very sincerely for your diligent writing. Thank God that you have so kindly accepted my distressed, disordered writing. In summary: God and the eternal truth are our rock. We want to build on Him and ask for grace. May He do what seems good in His eyes. We want to give ourselves in death and life, as He wills with His grace. Certainly, as it is with you, so with us. We want to take up the burden and do our duty as long as we can.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Also, for God's sake, write to Laetus and Haller in your and my name, urging them not to leave until they see that there is no more hope. The time is certainly not yet here. What they abandon there, they will find here. Therefore, be brave; do not retreat.</p>

      <p>That the common Confederates have decided this, I do not know for sure. I withhold neither good nor bad from you. Traitors may well say many things here and there according to their will. I know of no day set for the Confederates or the French, as they parted without setting a date. But if something new is set, that I know, I will report. If the Frenchman requests mercenaries, he no longer asks for a day. The money lies ready in Basel. Whether the oligarchs want it or not, if the Frenchman proceeds, the marching will begin by March 1.</p>

      <p>If the Emperor is still alive and breathing the ethereal air and has not yet drunk from the Stygian swamp, it is certain that he is flesh and not spirit, and he will not accomplish more than God Himself permits. Let us trust in Him, proclaim Him while doing our duty! To die will be gain.</p>

      <p>Farewell eternally with your wife and children, brother and cousin, to whom, however things may turn out, I offer all that is mine, as long as I live and have a place on earth. Zürich, January 28, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>If Duke Christoph is expelled, it will be seen that we are also of no use and that we should be trusted just as much as other people. All flesh is grass. The word of the Lord endures forever.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, dear lord and brother M. Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Constance.</p>
