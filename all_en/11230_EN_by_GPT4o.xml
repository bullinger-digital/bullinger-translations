    <p xml:id="regest1">Will not burden Haab with his letter. Sends a [Strasbourg] report on the reception of the letter from the Swiss Reformed to Luther and the princes [Johann Frederick of Saxony and Philip of Hesse] at the Schmalkaldic League meeting in Eisenach. The Englishmen who were in Zurich write favorably about King [Henry VIII]'s measures for the evangelical sermon and against pilgrimages, images, monasticism, purgatory, and private masses. John Butler, who visited Haab in Rheineck and has now returned to England, showed Bullinger Zurich writings translated and printed in English; he sends thanks and greetings. Bullinger recommends Haab the promotional letter from town clerk [Werner Beyel]; Hans Jakob [Beyel], who has hardly any notable fortune, will become a good and loving husband - despite his former reckless lifestyle - if he gets an honorable wife, for he has many excellent qualities. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Johannes Haab, bailiff in the Rhine Valley, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Pious, honorable, prudent, and wise, especially beloved lord and brother, although I have not written to you until now, it is not out of forgetfulness of you and your friendship, which you have always shown me, but because I knew well that you are already burdened with many affairs. May God grant you that you always complete them according to His will and pleasure, to the honor of His name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, as a sign of my unforgettable friendship, I am sending you what was discussed and handled at the recent meeting in Eisenach by the princes and estates of the Christian union, our response from Zurich to Luther and the princes, since you have understood from the previous writings of the princes that they intended to present our letter to the allies of the union. I ask you to send me back the copy, if it pleases you, as I have not kept an exemplar of it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the English gentlemen, who, as you know, were at my table for a time and returned to England at Easter, write that the king has sent out preachers throughout his kingdom to preach the gospel. This is happening earnestly, so that already all pilgrimages have been abolished and the principal idols, which were worshiped, have been removed and burned. Likewise, monasticism is being vigorously abolished, so that there are few monks left in their habits, although the king provides them with pensions. Purgatory, they write, is now being dissolved, and there is a strong effort to abolish the sale and market of masses. The earnest preaching of the intercession of Christ makes the intercession of the saints count for little, etc. I wanted to write this to you because I know well that it is a special joy to you when the kingdom of Christ increases and the kingdom of the Antichrist decreases.</p>
      <p>Some books written in Latin in Zurich are being translated into English there, of which I have already seen some printed; for some have been sent to Johannes Schenck, the nobleman who was with you in Rheineck. He has also earnestly instructed me to thank you for all the friendship you have shown him in many ways and to commend you sincerely. For he has now also received letters that he has returned home to England through France.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my earnest and urgent request to you is that you have faithfully followed the friendly writing and promotion of our town clerk and apply your possible diligence in this matter, for I am well informed and know that if you conduct yourself in this matter and place your consent, favor, and help with him, the matter may succeed. Now, it is not less, the property is perhaps not a heap, that you might be named before. But you see well how it mostly goes and how sometimes the young men rely on their property and show little property and friendship to the daughters, their wives. Johannes Jakob, although he has been somewhat more frivolous for a while, as you know, as young people tend to be, he promises so friendly that if God would help him into the holy state of marriage and provide him with an honorable wife, he would conduct himself properly and well and show her all goodness, all honor and friendship, love and loyalty. He is very skilled in practice, he has many good and excellent gifts, which every sensible person values and esteems higher than wealth. He has an honorable and skilled father, favor and will of good honorable people, therefore I hoped the daughter would be very well provided for. And it is my friendly request that you help with the matter and let me know your friendly answer. If I could serve you as my especially dear lord and brother, I would not spare. And I ask you, if I can serve you in any way, do not spare me.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you, your honorable wife, your children, and household to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, 15th of October 1538.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
