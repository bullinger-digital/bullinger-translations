    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings. - Hardenberg's enclosed letter [No. 2120] to all [Zurich] pastors is so insignificant that only Bullinger should read it and then burn it. Bullinger should write to [Johannes] a Lasco himself. Hardenberg has greeted Hermann Aquilomontanus. In Cologne, he dined with [Johannes] Caesarius at the table of Count [Christoph] of Oldenburg. The good old man [Caesarius] applauds both parties; perhaps Bullinger can change his mind. - Hardenberg hopes, along with many others, that the people of Zurich will respond to Luther's [“Short Confession”] with restraint, especially since the opponents are looking for a reason to separate the [Confederates] from the other Germans, so as not to have to help them in case of emergency. Since Luther has offended many, it would be good for the reputation of the people of Zurich if they did not respond too harshly. Hardenberg hopes that harmony will prevail someday. [Hermann von Wied, the Archbishop of] Cologne, has promised him to persuade all church leaders to a meeting to reach an agreement. However, this information should remain confidential. Many accuse the people of Zurich of being strict and defiant, but Hardenberg cannot sense any of this in their writings and conversations with them. Therefore, he defends them. However, this puts him under suspicion. - The weak must be helped [through an agreement] without sacrificing the purity of doctrine. The disunity of the church pains Hardenberg, especially since the Antichrist is raging. The people of Zurich should advise the wavering church. - May the Lord protect Bullinger and his family. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Kaspar] Megander, and all others. - Greetings to Gerhard [thom Camph]. - May Bullinger receive this candid letter well.</p>

      <p>Greetings. My soul, my, oh my Bullinger, greetings a thousand and ten thousand times!</p>
      <p>The letter you see, I wrote to all the ministers. But then it seemed to me unworthy that such trifles should reach others. Therefore, please greet them diligently for me and burn the letter after reading it. I ask you to write to Lord a Lasco yourself. I have greeted Hermann Aquilomontanus in Friesland, a very good and diligent man. He commends himself entirely to you. In Cologne, I dined with your Caesarius at the table of Count of Oldenburg. The good old man applauds both sides, so he can follow both parties. Perhaps you can persuade him. When I admonished him, he was soon offended.</p>
      <p>I hope you have been modest in your response, if you have prepared any to Luther's pamphlet. Some know that I have been taken into friendship by you. Therefore, they have asked me to remind you of Christian gentleness and leniency, which I otherwise hope will never be lacking in you. The adversaries have always aimed to separate you from the other Germans on this occasion, so that, if necessity arises, one cannot help the other. Luther's writing has greatly offended the minds of many, so they think it is your duty not to respond too harshly; thus, more will judge your opinion favorably. I am always reminded of Paul's words: "If you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another" [Galatians 5:15]. I hope, and may it be allowed to hope, that there will someday be concord among brothers. My Cologne friend has promised me that he will ensure that the chief ministers of all churches are convened to discuss a form of concordant doctrine; you are also to be invited, even if it must be done at his expense. However, I would like this to be said to you alone, so that if it does not come to fruition, other brothers do not think it was fabricated by me. Many attribute to you austerity and unyielding ferocity in this cause, and blame you for the churches being divided into so many factions. But I do not find this in your writings, much less in conversations, so I cannot help but defend your innocence, which I know not badly in this part. But while I do this, I am also called into suspicion.</p>
      <p>I write to you freely, my soul, and truly I write as I love you from the heart. Consider what we must do to help the weakness of many. The purity of doctrine must not be betrayed at all. But see for yourself if the cause can be mitigated in any way. I implore you, my lord, not to take this indignantly nor show it to anyone who might take it indignantly. It pains me that the churches are divided into so many factions, especially when the Antichrist is raging otherwise. It will certainly be your duty, as far as it can be done, to advise the wavering church, in which you easily hold a prominent place; which I indeed confess not dissimulatingly to anyone, for I cannot and should not act against conscience.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you with your excellent family. Please greet my venerable lords, brothers, and friends diligently, especially Mr. Pellikan, Theodor, Walther, Megander, and all others who come into view. A hundred thousand good nights, my dearest brother in God!</p>
      <p>Bonn, March 23.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to Gerhard.</p>
      <p>Your Albert Hardenberg.</p>
      <p>Please, my father, do not be offended; I write to you from the heart and with the deepest affection of the heart.</p>
      <p>To the man of singular piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed pastor of the church of Zurich, his always to be respected lord. Zurich.</p>
