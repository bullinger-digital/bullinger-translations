      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The King of France came to Saverne on May 3rd.</p>
      <p>Schertlin has his own army and precedes the king with the most select soldiers. He caught a traitor who had received 12 florins from Gutschick, who was beheaded among us, and also money from Bolweiler, to kill Schertlin either by sword or poison, but was miserably chased away and torn apart by spears.</p>
      <p>There are still four others who have received money and want to risk it, and they will also face punishments worthy of their deeds, and that soon. At Obernai, the army of the baron, who is called the Rhinegrave, is stationed; we are uncertain where he will move. Our senate sent a delegation to the king, to plead for the land itself, so that it is not devastated; but the land acts contrary, they stand in opposition, sending 40 foot soldiers to the landgrave. This grave is near Scherwiller (where the poor peasants were slaughtered in the peasant uprising), to protect this land. What then do our gracious lords ask for the people, who do not desire protection and shelter? The war is very serious and threatens the destruction of Germany. Strasbourg prepares to defend itself against the French, therefore it has brought in foreign soldiers; I do not know with what intention it does this. The Carthusian monastery is being demolished, trees outside the walls are being cut down, and whatever is useful to the enemy is being removed; cattle are being driven away from the rural villages.</p>
      <p>Sélestat is in great danger; Colmar is building new fortifications, working day and night to defend itself from the enemy. Peasants are everywhere in the fields trying to resist the incursions. What do you think will happen? Those from Breisach have placed Count George of Württemberg with some soldiers in their villages, which were wounded, and wrote to those from Breisach that they have taken them back into the city. The lord of Ribeauvillé is lying in Breisach; the regiment is there, almost abandoning Ensisheim, although some remain there so that it is not said they have fled. Many of the nobility have fled to us with their wives and children; but they have been told to lie and provide themselves with food, so that they do not burden the city. Thus, they bring much grain and wine into the city, so that they have something to eat. Some are from Benfeld and from the Margraviate; for the Margraves fear that one wants to take over the lordship of Rötteln. In Sundgau, last Tuesday, poor citizens from the Valley of Roses were mustered; they are being sent away from the land.</p>
      <p>Junker Hans Otmar von Schönau, residing in Laufenburg, also takes soldiers for King Ferdinand, many young people with little armor; I think he wants to occupy the four cities, so that they quickly consume what supplies they have. Farewell. May 8, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius sincerely.</p>
      <p>I wish to know what the Abbot of Vines has committed, as rumors spread that the monastery is burned and everything devastated. Where is the Emperor? He sleeps; he will undoubtedly be awakened to the great misfortune of the princes, who care nothing for the supplicant people, etc.</p>
      <p>To the outstanding man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor at the church in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
