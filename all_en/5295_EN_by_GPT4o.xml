      <p>S. D. We have received, honorable lords and dearest brothers, through a certain messenger from France, that great disturbances have been stirred up by the Guise faction (with the help of some conspired magnates in France, especially cardinals, bishops, and the clergy) and that extreme cruelty is being exercised daily against the faithful. To help you understand everything more clearly, I am sending you what I have received from Orléans, where the army of the faithful is gathered, to be shared with your dear brothers. First, you have a brief description of the abominable cruelty of the Guise faction, which they have exercised against the church of Vassy, from which you will gather what plans these men have conceived against all the churches of Christ's faithful in France. Then I am sending the protestation of the most illustrious Prince Louis, Duke of Bourbon, who is Prince of Condé, published and printed in the French language, but here translated into German by Mr. Georg Cellarius, as ordered by the most honorable magistrate of this city, who has the French original. Therefore, there is nothing in it that should be suspect to you.</p>
      <p>You will understand from it the whole matter, and that our people are not seditious against the king, but are trying to bring the conspirators and seditious ones against the king into order, to free the king and restore peace to the kingdom, etc. I have also attached a letter from Mr. Beza; for he wished that I would share it with the brothers in Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, and the Rhaetians. You see what needs to be done, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>We must cry out diligently and without ceasing to the Lord, and exhort the church to supplication.</p>
      <p>We must also strengthen the churches entrusted to our faith; for if the papists prevail in France, driven by their nefarious deeds, they will threaten us as well. But our papists are no milder than those, and there is no doubt that the Council of Trent was begun for no other purpose than to provide at least plausible pretexts for the most cruel persecution, which they have been fabricating for several years. Would that we might meet the Lord with true repentance and faith; He is merciful to forgive the sins of the penitent and powerful to save His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell in this, esteemed lords and dearest brothers. Zurich, April 23, 1562. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It is certain that military aid is being requested from the Swiss, and therefore a diet of the confederates is to be held in Solothurn on April 26. Soldiers are being requested in the name of the king (either fictitious or captive) to the number of 4000. My gracious lords forbid their people to run to arms under penalty of honor, property, and eternal loss of the fatherland; they have called for a common prayer, etc., dealing with this matter with Bern, etc.</p>
      <p>To the faithful servants of Christ Jesus, Mr. Valentin Fortmüller and the other most vigilant ministers of the church of St. Gallen, honorable lords and my dearest brothers. St. Gallen.</p>
