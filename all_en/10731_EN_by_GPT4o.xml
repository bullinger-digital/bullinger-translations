      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We received the writings of our dearest brother Bullinger on the night of the penultimate day of November, which affected us with not a little sorrow - because it was not possible to satisfy what was requested. For if the appointed day had been indicated to us in time, it would not have been neglected by us. The plan to hold a meeting, especially of the brothers in Switzerland who profess Christ, is greatly approved by us; we earnestly ask that it be done, and indeed soon. It seems to be worthwhile - what do I say? - it seems to be in the interest of our churches that we agree on the truth among ourselves and be confirmed for every eventuality. Therefore, although this time the matter did not succeed, dearest brothers, another day must be appointed by you and communicated to us through a reliable messenger and in time. The location in Aarau, as it is suitable for almost all of us, is not displeasing.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of November in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Megander, yours with all my heart.</p>
      <p>To Leo, Bullinger in Zurich, his dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
