      <p>God be with us all. For some time now, several honorable people have thought that if the evangelical places, in matters concerning faith, would let each other know their concerns and plans in a friendly and confidential manner, everything would go more harmoniously and successfully. Therefore, my lords are now writing to your lords about their concerns regarding the oath of alliance.</p>
      <p>I ask you to discuss this confidentially with Mayor Branden, etc., and other trusted individuals, and do your best to ensure that there is a unified opinion, and to amicably request the other places to let us remain in our religion, as we let them, etc. The method proposed by the places is that my lords are willing for the oath to be given equally in all places, by God and the saints, and that the envoy from Zurich should do this, if not, then the one from Bern, if not, then the one from Lucerne; however, in the evangelical places, no one should be forced to name the saints, but it should be free to name them.</p>
      <p>Such a burden my lords rightly bear, not because they have not deserved the precedent in giving the oath, but because Lucerne wants to impose a form on them that is contrary to our religion; otherwise, they would gladly concede to those from Lucerne that they give the oath by the saints in the papal places, while they do not want to give it. They also want to be satisfied with such confirmation, only that they and other evangelical places be allowed to swear according to their religion. Especially since they say, no one should be forced to name them, why should they then be mentioned? Honorable people rightly fear that it would be to the great detriment of our religion. In the peace of the land, it was said that they would be allowed to remain in their true, old faith. Such words they have drawn upon until now and still, we have given letters and seals that their faith is true, old.</p>
      <p>Now, if we let the form be given publicly in the churches before all the congregations of the evangelicals, they will first use it to claim that their faith is the right one, the believers will be offended by the Confederation and the unbelievers will be strengthened, and a disgrace will be brought upon our churches. Furthermore, they should first allow or approve us to swear in the same way. What is this but a departure from the faith? Solomon allowed his wives to build idol temples, and the scripture says that he practiced idolatry; indeed, he brought upon himself the wrath of God and all misfortune.</p>
      <p>If our Confederates demanded that we allow a mass to be read for a day, while they were in our presence as envoys, and erect images, but that none of ours would go to them unless they wanted to, would we allow them that? Certainly not. Why then would we let them give the oath in our churches to our people in the aforementioned manner?</p>
      <p>It is not a small matter concerning the oath, nor is it (as some say) about a single word alone, but about the entire faith. It is a knot and bond of religion and policy. Polycarp, the holy martyr, would rather die than swear by Fortuna Caesar. And my lords do not impose a small thing; for they are thus informed about the oath in the word of God:</p>
      <p>There are clear commandments of God that one should swear only by God, as in Deut. 6. 10., Psalm 63., Isa. 45. 65., Jer. 4. etc. On the other hand, there are also prohibitions that one should not swear at all by those who are not gods, nor even name them, as in Acts 23, Joshua 23, Jer. 5, Zeph. 1.</p>
      <p>The oath is a testimony by the highest good, which is the eternal truth, and also knows our hearts. So if we place the saints alongside God, we confess that they too are our highest good.</p>
      <p>The oath is a confession of who can help and punish us; for we say, may God help me thus. If we add: and the saints, we confess that they can help us, etc.</p>
      <p>Yes, the oath is an invocation of God; for one says: Thus I pray, may God help me. If one adds: and the saints, one has invoked them, and it does not count, as some say, the saints are meant in the holy, understood as heaven, or mean the living saints. For our Confederates do not understand it that way, but the blessed in heaven. Here, however, a believer should not engage in any equivocation.</p>
      <p>When the honor that belongs to God alone is given to creatures, it is blasphemy, as is clearly seen in Acts 14 in the deeds and words of Paul, who tore his clothes when they wanted to offer sacrifices to him. No authority should allow blasphemy to proceed willingly among their own.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the alliances will not be destroyed. There are two distinct things, the alliances themselves and the oath of alliance. The alliances themselves are the articles concerning land, people, jurisdiction, freedom, justice, and their maintenance, comfort, and help; it is an external thing, does not concern faith. But the swearing is the confirmation of the alliances and concerns faith.</p>
      <p>Our forefathers swore by the saints, as was customary at the time. However, there is no article of alliance that one cannot swear otherwise than now by the saints, and even if there were, God's commandment and covenant count more. But it is an article of alliance that one should swear. Here comes the peace of the land, now made according to the alliances in the distinction of faith; it allows each party to remain in their faith and now gives us form, manner, and measure, how one should swear, we by God, they by the saints.</p>
      <p>Thus, the alliance and the oath of alliance remain, indeed become so much firmer than before, as much higher as we have God than the saints.</p>
      <p>When it is said that one would like to see who wants to swear and keep the alliance, we can well say: we want to keep it and also swear. And as we are in the alliance, we can still be in the alliance and keep it, even if we have become of another faith, so we can also well swear, even if we swear according to our faith and not as from old times.</p>
      <p>If they do not want to let us remain in this, it is a sign that they are seeking something else or now engaging in a deception.</p>
      <p>However, this could be countered: we cannot, for the sake of people and human alliances, abandon God and His covenant, nor do we desire to be at odds with those who are called our Confederates. So one would give the answer, one would want to keep the alliances no less than if they were sworn, if one cannot now agree on the form, so the alliances themselves are binding, whether they are sworn or not, they should be eternal. Over time, one will understand each other better, etc. All this understood in the best way. God be with you. Given in Zurich. June 15, 1555.</p>
