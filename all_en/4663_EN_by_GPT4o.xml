      <p>Greetings. At present, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to see what the assembly currently being held in Neuchâtel will bring. Our people have sent a very large delegation; we also hear that envoys from many princes and cities will be coming there. What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>I expect little good; for whether we are to have war, you know what war brings, especially considering how our people feel about such a war, or whether we have peace, we will hardly have such peace that is not accompanied by the detriment of God's glory and the destruction of many churches.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would prefer an honorable war, if I were allowed to decide, rather than an unjust peace. The Lord would not fail those who dare something for His glory.</p>
      <p>The citizens are certainly well-disposed; but I fear the more powerful ones, who, after having managed their affairs, could now easily accept any conditions of peace, as long as their skin remains intact and their substance safe. I pray to the Lord to preserve His churches.</p>
      <p>We admonish publicly and privately, and we have good hope; but I fear the arts of the flesh; it seeks peace with the world; but it does not care for the peace that is with God.</p>
      <p>Would that I am mistaken! We hear indeed that the duke does not relent in the rigor of his demands, and would that it were so! For I do not see otherwise how our people could be drawn to the defense of that land. He also urges a transaction; he certainly wants to use the opportunity.</p>
      <p>He would like the whole matter to be decided soon.</p>
      <p>But we will have more certain information when our people return; then I will also inform you of each detail. I recently thanked you through a brother for the last part of your sermons on Jeremiah, but I still thank you and am most grateful. Remember, I beseech you, what I wrote about Daniel.</p>
      <p>What freedom has been granted to the faithful in France, you will learn from this royal mandate, which I send here. You will take care to have it transferred to you by someone; for I do not have a German copy at hand now. The Glarus affair is now silent; but the Baden chancellery is dissatisfied with the holy mass. I think my lords have written to yours about it.</p>
      <p>They are inclined not to tolerate it.</p>
      <p>May God give the heart for it to happen! All our people would be ten times more willing to help the Glarus people than to march into Savoy. But these things quickly.</p>
      <p>I commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Also, have me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and all your family. Our people greet you, Musculus, my father-in-law, Hagius, Haller, Vischer.</p>
      <p>The rest are in Neuchâtel, namely Tilger, Steiger, Diesbach, Wingartner, and Ambrosius Imm Hof. Bern, February 12, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. H. Bullinger.</p>
