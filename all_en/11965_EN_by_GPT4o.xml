    <p xml:id="regest1">If Bullinger's silence has a reason, then it is not justified; as he behaves as if they had never been friends, Myconius cannot know if his letter is welcome. Recommends to Bullinger and [Konrad] Pellikan a lay brother of the Franciscans from Rufach, who turned to [Basel] to lay aside the monastic habit, but despite the efforts of the pastors, they could not find work for him, whom they supported with alms; asks, also on behalf of Markus [Bertschi], to continue the assistance begun in Basel, to take him in and assign him work. News: The Diet is over and Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse have departed, while Emperor [Charles V] and [representatives of the] cities are still staying in Speyer; the [Archbishop] of Cologne [Elector Hermann of Wied] and the [Bishop] of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] show themselves unyielding; Emperor [Charles V] is supposed to travel to Metz soon, where he has also sent ahead the Viceroy of Sicily [Ferrante I Gonzaga] with 300 horses and where supposedly Count Wilhelm [of Fürstenberg] is staying; nothing is heard about the Peace of Religion, but perhaps news will soon come from Strasbourg; [King] Ferdinand [I] and two of his sons were almost killed by a hailstorm; it devastated the land between Speyer and Strasbourg completely, a proof of God's fierce wrath on the sins of men.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You write nothing, you respond to nothing, you do not greet; you act as if you never knew me.</p>
      <p>I do not know the reason, unless it is false. Therefore, I am surprised that such a lofty mind can be moved by a false cause to act in this way, unless such a commendable friendship had not previously existed between us. You make it difficult for me to write when asked, not knowing whether it is pleasing to you or not.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, my spirit, not at all changed in me after a long and frustrating expectation of yours, strongly urges me to serve friends and to attempt to assist the servants of the Lord to the best of my ability, and to meet with you as before, as if all matters were intact, as they are with me, not violated in any part.</p>
      <p>With this spirit, I commend to you and to Master Pellikan this brother, not learned, but a layman, who, having worn the Franciscan habit for a time among the people of Rufach, finally led by repentance, came here to be freed from it again.</p>
      <p>The change of habit was such that our almoners (unsere Almosenpfleger) attempted in vain to ensure that he could henceforth support himself by some craft, but having tried in vain, they asked me to commend him to you, so that what has been begun here, you might complete. Therefore, we now ask through the Lord, that you may assist him, so that he may learn to sustain his life in the future through certain labor; for if you do this, you will gratify us and undoubtedly serve God. For he seems to us to be such that whoever benefits him will not have misplaced his kindness; if he deceives, he will deceive gravely. You will therefore have the man commended for the reason I have stated, for the sake of the Lord, also in the name of Master Markus and myself; we will return the favor whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>The rest is as follows: The Diet is dissolved, although the Emperor and the cities are still in Speyer. The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse have departed. The Archbishop of Cologne and the Bishop of Münster remain strong in religion. It is thought that the Emperor will go straight to Metz, where he has also sent ahead the Viceroy of Sicily with 300 horses. And Count Wilhelm is said to be there now. I hear not a word about the Peace of Religion. I expect something of this from Strasbourg soon. I would write about the violence of the hailstorm, in which Ferdinand and his two sons almost perished, if I did not think you knew it already. From Speyer almost to Strasbourg, it devastated the vines, fields, and trees, leaving nothing behind. Thus, nothing does not prove the wrath of God against our most grievous sins. May He have mercy on us, I pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider all things well. In Basel, hastily, May 26, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
