      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich and Master Leo. I want to inform you that the bailiff of Baden rode to my inn in Tegerfelden on Tuesday before St. George's Day and spoke to me in a very inconsiderate manner, which I cannot withhold from you, and I am not reporting this because of my own person, but because of the divine honor, which is being grossly blasphemed, and also our faith is being disparaged. It is my request to you that you consider this matter in a fatherly way and, if you deem it appropriate, report it to the mayor and the council. Not that I desire my gracious lords of Zurich to take any rash or unrestful action on my behalf, but that it be considered how the honor of God may be furthered and neither we nor our faith be harmed, while the peace of the land is maintained, etc.</p>
      <p>And this is the matter: Initially, the bailiff asked me if I still remembered what he had discussed with me when the day in Baden took place? Answer: Yes, I remember it well. Bailiff: Why did I not keep it? Answer: I have kept it (so that you, my dear fathers, may understand what the bailiff discussed with me, and he did not speak himself, but Master Hab from Zurich and Standard-bearer Störler from Bern spoke in his name: The eight places have recognized me again in Tegerfelden, and I should promise that I preach without harming the peace of the land; answer: I will strive to do so as far as I can; this is the sum) and have not broken the peace of the land, but preached my faith to my parishioners, and in no way insulted or even mentioned their faith, and have conducted myself properly before an entire congregation that has heard me. Bailiff to me: "You boast of that and lie with it" etc. To this I asked how I had broken the peace of the land. Bailiff: "You have broken the peace by setting up a feast on Easter Day and boasting highly of it. And by boasting so highly of your feast, you have disparaged our faith." Then he said: "We have the true, undoubted old Christian faith. Therefore, we have been given letters and seals." With this, he asked me if it was not so. With this, I noticed the trick, answered: As the peace of the land was, so I let their faith be. I also did not set up a feast, but celebrated the Lord's Supper with my brothers. Since the peace of the land stated that each party should leave the other unchallenged, I desire the same. I have also strived for this until now. I also informed him that the dean of Zurzach had taken the table (the communion table) out of my entrusted church with his own authority on Easter Monday (which I did not disturb) (so that he might have 12 witnesses himself); I also sent some of the councilors to him, asking, since I wanted to use the table again on the same day (and did use it), why or for what reason he had taken it out. Answer: He did not want to know it there, because his faith did not know that he had a similar mass beside it, etc. To this, the bailiff gave me no answer, but after many high words, he threatened me thus: (bailiff:) If it happens again that it seems to him that I break the peace of the land with such or with other things (let the brothers judge), he will take me by the head himself. With this, he wanted to warn me, wanted to take me himself and bring me to a court of the land and let justice be done over me there. He asked me if I understood that. Answer: "Yes, I also desire nothing else than justice." And I wanted to speak more, but he raged like a pig, and all my words he swallowed in my mouth. Present were the two witnesses, Caspar Schriber from Baden and Steffen Keiser from Zurzach (and where it is necessary, dear lords, I will personally be present to support the complaint, if desired). With this, I ask you to consider the matter and advise me in it. Write how the matter should be handled, for the sake of God's honor. The grace of God be with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given as above, in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Johannes Winzürn, a servant of the word in Tegerfelden, your willing [servant].</p>
      <p>To my dear lords and fathers, Master Heinrich Bullinger and Master Leo Jud, servants of the word in Zurich.</p>
