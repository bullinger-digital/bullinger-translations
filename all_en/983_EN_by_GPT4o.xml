      <p>Strasbourg, 10th August 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I see, dearest Bullinger, that you are greatly concerned and anxious because you have not received letters from England confirming the delivery of your books and letters. You seem equally worried about whether the books were intercepted or lost on the way. Dismiss all fear: for I know for certain that the goods, in which part of the books were included, have safely reached England. Moreover, the servant of Richard, to whom I entrusted the letters and the king's book, has safely reached his master and returned safely to Antwerp. What he did with the king's book and letters, I have no doubt, will be sufficiently indicated by these letters from Master Richard.</p>
      <p>I believe Hooper is too busy to have time to write. On March 29, he last wrote to me, with which I received a packet of letters for you, which I immediately arranged to be sent to you through Valentin Nussbaum, a citizen of Basel. In the meantime, he has sent nothing.</p>
      <p>He is certainly a bishop: may he always watch over the Lord's flock! The letters I have already received from you, I will ensure are transferred to the courier tomorrow, before eight days pass to reach Antwerp. This messenger, who brings these to you, is honest and faithful, and was my servant a year ago. Any act of kindness you show him, if he needs it, will certainly be appreciated by me.</p>
      <p>There is no news, except that I hear the day of the Augsburg council is to be postponed to the 24th of this month. In England, all is calm. Among us, restless priests armed at night patrol the streets, but they were almost punished by the citizens, had not the magistrate acted in time. Doctor Hans Distel, a patron of the papists, was wounded. If the priests continue to be seditious, I hope it will benefit the word of God. They raise their crests, seeing the Emperor so diligently striving to restore their errors. May the Lord grant us His grace and peace!</p>
      <p>My wife sends her most diligent greetings to you and your wife. May you and your entire family be well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the learned ones. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>The people of Leuven have again published their faith in writing. Among other things, they prohibit the common people from reading the Holy Bible and the Gospel. A new and unheard-of inquisition is also to take place throughout Lower Germany. Pray to the Lord to preserve His own.</p>
      <p>From the upcoming Frankfurt fair, I plan to set out for England to visit friends whom I have not seen for twelve years: if I could render any service, I am most ready.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend. Zurich.</p>
