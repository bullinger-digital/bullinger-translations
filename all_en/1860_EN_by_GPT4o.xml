      <p>We received your letter written on April 21st on April 23rd; we understand what you write about Gachlinger. As we have heard these days, he is the same as he was before. - Your weakness troubles us; you seem to us to be advised by these words of Erasmus:</p>
      <p>"Unless the vine is pruned from time to time, it becomes weak and perishes by its own fertility; thus, excessive zeal must be restrained in fortunate talents, lest they be exhausted by insufficiently moderate labor."</p>
      <p>We therefore ask you by the Lord, not to kill yourself with excessive zeal nor to wear out Bullinger, but rather to preserve this man for the world.</p>
