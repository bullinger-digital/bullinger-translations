    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares Bullinger's concern [about the Frankfurt Standstill] and expects nothing good from the planned religious discussion; the opinions [of Melanchthon, Bucer, and Hedio from 1534] could cause a lot of harm. Refers, regarding the state of affairs, to the letter [No. 1261] from Ambrosius [Blarer]. Thanks for the news from England; fears that [the Protestant estates], out of faint-heartedness, will deliver themselves and their foreign fellow believers to the knife. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>On the second of May, your letters were delivered to me, Bullinger, dearest brother, which sufficiently testify to your concern for me. And indeed, you rightly reason about the end of the ages due to those strange and astounding machinations of the world; for what does the world not attempt, what does Satan not contrive to demolish the truth of Christ? Although this itself would be trivial, if it were not for that defection foretold by Christ. But their defection is of those from whom there was hope of standing firm against the world, Satan, and various adversities; now they are conquered (which I greatly fear) not by swords and persecution, but only by shadows, not by terror, but by flattery. Good and excellent God, how much money has been consumed, how much time wasted by our advisors and counselors, although this too would be milder if we did not meanwhile most shamefully betray and prostitute ourselves. For the immortal Christ, how unspirited we are and how little we adhere firmly, thus the devil exposes us more splendidly than the midday light. We are all dismayed by these futile efforts and these slippery disputes in a matter so certain and clear. To what end does it pertain for us ministers to convene for the sake of a new concord? Is it because we do not agree in Christ, or because we are about to enter into concord against Christ? Or truly, so that from a subtle and sophistic study of concord the most atrocious discord is prepared, from which then a far more atrocious persecution may arise? But here it will be better to adhere constantly to simplicity and truth, despising all the cunning of the wise, and not to be moved by the bombastic and grandiloquent arguments of anyone. O my brother, how much do you think these French counsels will harm us! What did the most fervent zeal for concord want for itself? Namely, that we may finally be confounded with the most confused confusion, from which, however, may Christ our Lord deign to deliver us. Amen. These things into your bosom, until we see the outcome.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius writes to you about the state of affairs. I do not doubt the constancy of our people, although our condition is miserable, as we are not of much authority among the magnates of this world.</p>
      <p>We are grateful to you for the English news; for in them there are many things that delight. May the Lord hear the cries of the good for the sanctification of His name. Woe to our faint-heartedness! Is this how we expand the kingdom of Christ with our examples and promote the cause of the gospel among foreign nations?</p>
      <p>Is this how we strengthen the feeble knees? Is not the example of the most harmful conversation of the first mother Eve with Satan evident? Thus our conversations with men, from whom no other hope can be expected than that which is from Satan, will also betray us. And if one were to say throughout the whole world how bravely, handily we become loud and that we offer our hand to other good-hearted people, we give them and ourselves to the flesh bank. May God have mercy on us and by His power deliver us from the sevenfold devil, who attempts to make our latter state worse than the former.</p>
      <p>But farewell, and you too be diligent in prayer to the Lord, that He may animate us with the sword of His word most constantly. Amen. Greet all the brothers, Leo, Pellican, Theodor, etc.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 2nd of May 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Brother Konrad sends you his devoted greetings.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
