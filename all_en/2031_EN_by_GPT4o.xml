      <p>Greetings, Heinrich Bullinger. Three days ago, the king's envoy greeted me in your name, then the pastors of Chur showed me your letters, in which I also saw mention of myself. Therefore, I give you great thanks.</p>
      <p>The Servetus tragedy has terrified me. For every hour I experience that no one can say a single word about it without stirring the spirits of many: indeed, the papists, so that they may cast all blame on our doctrine and our reforms and meditate all evil against us, and the pious, so that they may be ashamed of these monstrosities. In summary: under the guise of reforming the churches, the foundations are deformed and shaken. Alas, how much Antichrist will rejoice in this dissension. I already hear what some of his members are babbling.</p>
      <p>I saw the letters you wrote to the council of Geneva; they are indeed pleasing. You do not explicitly say that the heretic should be removed from life, but you exaggerate in such a way that it is easy for the reader to understand that you are of the opinion that he should be removed. I wrote to you what I thought; but I commit the matter to the Lord. I hate these troublemakers worse than a dog and a snake; but I would have preferred them to be enclosed in the foulest prisons rather than consumed by fire or sword. It is still regrettable that this scoundrel does not lack supporters from the order of doctors and those who not only have given their name to the gospel but who want to appear as pillars. I speak of what I know, not what I suspect; I heard it from them themselves, not from others, recently, not long ago. But I do not wish to write: you will hear in person.</p>
      <p>I indeed came here intending to stay for barely 10 days; but 14 have passed, and I am still not leaving, and I am indeed living here with great inconvenience, I also add danger, in a public inn among soldiers. I will wait for this entire week and will fly to you, even if those I expect do not arrive; I have decided so.</p>
      <p>There is no talk of the pope's envoy, but much about Ritius; they affirm he will come here, I think to deal with matters that pertain to that other one, at least to pave the way for him. At this very time, the Rhaetians return from war discontented and will indeed cry out against the king, and Ritius will not sleep on this occasion. I am almost daily with the royal envoy.</p>
      <p>He is a remarkable and indeed rare man; he loves you greatly and praises you before many.</p>
      <p>My Italy trembles where there is no fear. Such is the matter: if you could see its timidity in the cause of the gospel, how it withdraws, how it dissimulates, how it asks exiles not to write to it, you would say a hundred are burned daily, and it is not so, not even one, although some light persecution has arisen in a few places. The devil sends fears, the devil stirs up heresies and Servetuses, and God permits these evils because of our ingratitude, by which we do not honorably and sacredly worship the light of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, but abuse it. May the heavenly Father have mercy on us for the sake of the Son. I bid your colleagues and sons-in-law to be well; pray for me.</p>
      <p>Chur, 8th October 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>[To] Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
