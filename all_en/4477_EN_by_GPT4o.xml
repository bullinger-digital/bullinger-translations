      <p>Greetings. I cannot, my dear Bullinger, fail to inform you that on the past Sunday, the Cantons sent a messenger to our magistrate, instructing him to send delegates to the current assembly at Einsiedeln, who would be accepted and welcomed by the Cantons, otherwise they would not admit them to the session and audience. They specifically prescribed to our people whom they should send as delegates.</p>
      <p>From our opponents, they want to have the consul Schud, the prefect Madi, Dolder, and Lienhertz Avienus; from our side, Schuler, Pfendler, Jacob Becker, and the treasurer of the treasury.</p>
      <p>See, good man, what presumption and arrogance this is, that they do not fear to disdain our magistrate and attribute the authority of a dictatorship to themselves. What these things portend, a moderately sane person can evaluate.</p>
      <p>The magistrate, out of goodness, has complied with the mandates of the Cantons and sent the aforementioned named delegates, along with them also Hess, the elected consul of this year, whom they refused to include in the number, and also sent Jacob Avienus and others. May the Lord turn our affairs for the better.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Dated October 2nd.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner of Glarus, yours.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in ZÃ¼rich, my kind lord. Day at Einsiedeln, October 6, 1560</p>
