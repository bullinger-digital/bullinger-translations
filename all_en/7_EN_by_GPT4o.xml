    <p xml:id="regest1">Count Georg has not yet been able to respond to Bullinger's last letter [not received] due to daily business.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Enclosed is a letter [hbbw XX, No. 3098] from his preacher Matthias Erb, along with his treatise [on the Lord's Supper], which he delivered to him about two years ago. Bullinger will likely find it pleasing in light of his own writings on the Lord's Supper composed for Count Georg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">He has no news, except that Emperor Charles V is recruiting cavalry and infantry soldiers. Presumably, they are intended for Duke Charles III of Savoy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther and New Year's wishes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">His own situation remains unchanged. May God bring it to a good end.</p>

      <p>We have no new information, except that the Imperial Majesty is once again recruiting many cavalry and infantry soldiers. However, no one can yet ascertain where they are to be deployed, though some believe it concerns Savoy.</p>
