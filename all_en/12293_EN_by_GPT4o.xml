    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger is pleased that so many good people seek his friendship. He gladly accepts Serin as a friend as well. - It is not true that Bullinger has changed his opinion on the issue of the Lord's Supper, as the "well-known Swabian evangelist" [Martin Frecht] claimed. For more than 20 years, Bullinger has been teaching the same thing in this regard. This can also be seen in his commentaries on Matthew, John, and Mark. - Bucer had hoped for agreement. What has become of it can be learned from Luther's vehement ["Short Confession"]! Bullinger encloses with his letter the response of the Zurich [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”], which also contains the writing of Luther [published with it]. From this, Serin can understand the view of the [Zurichers]. - Bucer had in vain recommended the "Wittenberg Articles" to the Swiss for signature. Unacceptable in it is the claim that Christ is "substantially" present with the bread and wine, as well as the opinion that even the unworthy truly partake of the body of Christ in the meal. Since all our worthiness arises from faith, especially since righteousness comes from faith, the unworthy are equated with unbelievers, who, because they eat the Lord, [according to John 6] would consequently also have a share in [eternal] life; but that cannot be! For whoever eats Christ remains in him. The Swiss also did not want to acknowledge the Augsburg Confession, as the opinion expressed there about the Eucharist does not differ from that of the Papists. - Bullinger cannot tell Serin what he thinks about the latest edition of Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion" from 1543, because he has not read it. He has only seen the first edition [from 1536]. However, what he thinks about John 6 can be seen from his commentary on this Gospel. There he shows that eating means believing. The "substantial" body of the Lord is thus eaten by the believer, as he believes that the Lord has taken on a [human] body for him and that this body was delivered for him. However, Bullinger does not believe that the "substantial" body of the Lord is present in the meal, especially since this does not correspond to the properties of the human body. Even if Calvin (whom Bullinger esteems) were to teach such a thing, Bullinger could not agree with him, as the truth is mightier than Calvin! - Wilhelm [Reublin] has not conveyed any request from Serin to Bullinger, otherwise Bullinger would have gladly been of assistance. However, Serin should know that Bullinger has taken him into his heart. - Greetings from Erasmus Schmid, Heinrich Buchter, Gwalther, Otto Werdmüller, Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, and the other preachers and teachers. - [P.S.:] Bullinger has [now] learned from [Reublin] that Serin is of the opinion that Bullinger should publish his sermons. However, Bullinger does not share this view. He has [indeed] already commented on the entire New Testament except for the Gospel of Luke. He will turn to the commentary [version] of this Gospel in the coming winter.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I truly give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who brings about the friendship of many good men for me and makes my labor in Christ accepted by all good people. To Him alone I attribute whatever I have rightly and usefully accomplished for His glory and the safety of the church. From Him, I expect reward and praise. Meanwhile, I do not reject your congratulations, but I embrace and honor your gratitude and humanity. Pray to the Lord, I beseech you, that He may preserve both you and me in His grace. Otherwise, you do a most pleasing thing by dealing with me candidly and simply, leaving aside the embellishments of words. Do not doubt that I am most ready to serve you and all the pious with all my strength.</p>
      <p>A certain renowned evangelist of Swabia writes that Bullinger now thinks differently about the Lord's Supper than before. But whoever he is, he spoke not very honorably; for he spoke falsely. I have not changed my kind of doctrine. Today I feel the same as I did 20 years ago, that the body of the Lord has been taken up into the heavens, that is, assumed into the skies, and does not appear to mortals on earth nor is it corporally present to those celebrating the supper, but in spirit, power, and operation. Nor have I professed anything else in my published commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew, John, and Mark.</p>
      <p>Bucer promised a broad and splendid concord, but that man was deceived in his hope. This is evident because Luther has published a most virulent pamphlet against us, in which he contends that the very body of the Lord is truly and corporally eaten not only by the faithful but also by the unfaithful in the sacrament.</p>
      <p>I send here Luther's pamphlet; I also send the response we gave to him. From it, you will understand what I teach and what the church, to which the Lord has willed me to minister, believes and holds; also what I think about the poorly established concord. Bucer presented us with the articles of concord, whose description you send, wishing us to subscribe to them; but we refused. We were offended that they confess "with the bread and wine truly and substantially" the body and blood of Christ are present, offered, and taken. We were also offended that they confess even the unworthy truly eat the body of the Lord. For if they are unworthy, who do not have faith (for all our worthiness is from faith, because righteousness is from faith), then according to their collection, the unfaithful would eat the Lord himself; but thus they would be partakers of life. But that is false; therefore, it is also most false that from which this is collected. Whoever eats Christ remains in Christ; the unworthy do not remain, therefore they do not eat. Furthermore, we did not want to accept the Augsburg Confession, because it differs little or not at all from the dogmas of the Papists regarding the Eucharist. Therefore, these articles were not accepted by the churches of the Swiss, nor did any of us subscribe to them; about which you will understand more from the response given to Luther.</p>
      <p>You ask what I think of Calvin's recently published Institutes. I have not read the later ones, I only inspected the first ones a few years ago; therefore, I can pronounce nothing. How I explain the 6th chapter of John is clear from my commentaries on John, where I have proven with many arguments that to eat is the same as to believe. Nor do I believe anything other than that the very body of our Lord, and indeed substantially, is eaten by us. For no other food is given to the faithful than the true flesh of Christ. We eat, however, when we believe that it was assumed and delivered for us. I do not believe, nor do I teach, that the substantial body of the Lord is present in the supper. For the truth of the human body cannot be in many places; about which more has been said in our response. However much I may esteem Calvin, if he were to teach such a thing about the supper, I would not agree with him. Truth is more important than Calvin. The apostles preached faith, from which, if anything alien were announced even by angels from heaven, they would be accursed by us. Apostolic faith teaches that Christ truly assumed a man consubstantial with us, died, and was buried, the same rose again on the third day and ascended into heaven, not having shed, not having changed the nature of humanity, but glorified. Therefore, I will never accept what is contrary to this faith, as if the true body is present in the supper, offered, and taken corporally.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm, your notary, did not request anything from me in your name; otherwise, I would have gladly placed my efforts at your disposal. He can report more about our affairs here. However, I wish to testify to you with these words that I favor you from the heart, that I love you and receive you into the number of friends. Love me in return in Christ our Savior, who is our peace. Pray also for me with yours and for the church to which we minister. Consider this writing, however unpolished, kindly.</p>
      <p>Business has distracted me; I have therefore hurried. Farewell now.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 18, 1545.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Schmid, Heinrich Buchter, Rodolph Gwalther, Otto Werdmüller, Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, and the other preachers and professors of the church of Zurich greet you and all who are devoted to piety.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your notary indicated in your name that it would be useful if I prepared a postil (a collection of sermons) for the use of pious preachers. However, I do not see such utility as to think it worth the effort, as he himself will explain more fully. I have written on the entire New Testament, except for Luke, on which I will comment this winter.</p>
      <p>From there, it will be possible to derive the interpretation of the Gospels and Epistles. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most pious man, Leonhard Soerin, teaching piety in Znaim, Austria, beloved brother.</p>
