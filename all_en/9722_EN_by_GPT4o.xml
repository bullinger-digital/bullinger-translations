      <p>To D. Théodor de Bèze.</p>
      <p>As soon as your letter was delivered to me by the noble Lord of Beauvais, the notary from St. Gallen was also present, undoubtedly by the good providence of God. Therefore, I entrusted this known and faithful notary with a package to be transported to St. Gallen. I included in the package, first of all, your letter to our Thretius, then the declaration of the most illustrious Prince Condé received from the Lord of Beauvais. I added to these two of my letters to Mr. Paul Gilovius and Mr. Andreas Prasnovius, ministers of the Polish churches, in which I advise them that if our Thretius has departed to the Lord, they should open the letters addressed to him and faithfully expedite everything. I would have also written to the Palatine of Kraków, had I not been told that he was dead. Therefore, our Simler wrote to the treasurer of the Kingdom of Poland and the steward of Kraków, Mr. Hieronymus Buzinski, recommending our cause to him. In short: I have arranged everything so that, if the Lord blesses this business, I hope for the most abundant fruit from it. Furthermore, I sent letters to Nuremberg to the most honorable men, Mr. Gabriel Schlüsselberger and Mr. Laurentius Dürnhofer, requesting that they ensure the package I sent is carefully, quickly, and safely transmitted to Kraków to the kingdom's treasurer and Mr. Christophorus Thretius. I advised them that the enclosed letters contain matters of great importance, and I ask, therefore, through our friendship, that they ensure they are carefully, quickly, and safely delivered to Poland. But if they understand that the King of Poland has already departed from the Kingdom of Poland and is traveling to France, they should return the package to me. At St. Gallen, I also entrusted in writing to our Johann Lyner that he should promptly and accurately transmit my letters with the package to Nuremberg. Therefore, I hope, with God's blessing, that everything will be properly expedited by those friends of mine who have never failed me.</p>
      <p>As for your letters, which you sent to me open, I sealed them with my ring; therefore, I do not want you to be concerned about them. Moreover, the Lord of Beauvais executed with utmost faith and diligence what he had been instructed by the most illustrious prince; for he sought our counsel on how assistance, either in money or arms, could be obtained from the four evangelical republics of the Swiss. To this request, we responded that it does not seem appropriate to ask this of our people at present for reasons we explained to him. However, regarding the main issue, we advised him that a delegation should be sent to the new king, which he can explain to you in more detail; for all attempts should be made before resorting to arms, and these should not be taken up and attempted except by those to whom the Lord has given authority. Faithful ministers rightly abhor with all their hearts the shedding of blood, especially since David said that the blood of the poor should be precious to kings, how much more to ministers, who have the example of meekness and peace in Christ and the apostles. We have learned with sorrow that the plague has re-emerged among you, and since we can do nothing else at present, we will diligently pray to the Lord to have mercy on you and protect and deliver you from that plague.</p>
      <p>You are indeed doing the right thing by preferring to remain with your flock in that sadness rather than visiting us by traveling.</p>
      <p>If it is not permitted by the Lord for us to see each other and greet each other in this world, it will certainly be allowed in another world to see each other and rejoice before the Lord forever.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord keep you from all evil. Greet my Mr. Hottomann, Mr. Roset, Mr. Port, and other lords and brothers. Our people also greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 28, in the year of our salvation 1574. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
