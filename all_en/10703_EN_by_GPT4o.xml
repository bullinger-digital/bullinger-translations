    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's commentary on four Pauline letters and his writing against the Anabaptists, but has not yet been able to deliver the latter to Konrad [Köllin]. According to the instructions given to him by Christoph [Froschauer] or Jakob [...], he first delivered Bullinger's letter and is now waiting for the return of Georg Diener. Sends the requested "Catalogus haereticorum" of the recently deceased [Bernhard von] Luxemburg and offers Erasmus' ["Ecclesiastes"]; also sends a publication about the Münsterites, a bull of Paul III, and a writing about the Emperor's victory [in Tunis]. A truce is said to have been achieved between Duke [Christian] of Holstein and the Lübeckers. Confirms, based on a papal letter he copied by hand to King [Ferdinand I], the news of the execution of [John Fisher] and [Thomas] More and reports on the marital dispute of Henry VIII. Recommends, in the matter of the letter bearer [Benedikt Kromer], to refrain from a divorce. Wishes to make the acquaintance of Nikolaus Müslin. Greetings. Assures Konrad Klauser of a friendly reception.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received with gratitude your commentaries full of learning on the four Pauline epistles. I also have with me today four books against the Anabaptists, still anxious about when I will deliver them to Doctor Konrad, whom you know. For Jakob, being more cunning, provided me with letters to be delivered to him before the books descended by ship, saying that this was entrusted to him by your Christoph. I complied, approached, and handed him the letters personally. Upon opening them, he was not clear about the name. He asked whether I knew you, who you were. I reminded him, as much as I could, of your acquaintance. He finally said: "Is he the young man who used to visit me with his brother Jakob?" I replied: "He is the one." Then he tried to read your letters, but he could not. So I was asked to read them to him. You mentioned in them a certain Lord Georg Diener, and since he was not present, he said he would soon be and would keep the letters in custody until then, and he thanked me profusely, refreshing me with wine and beer, wishing to honor me more. However, time did not allow me to stay there longer. Upon departure, he escorted me personally to the gate of the monastery and said he could not pass judgment on the unseen. Therefore, I proposed that as soon as I learned that Georg was present, I would deliver the same books, so that, incited by him, who used to be your admirer, he would read the aforementioned books with greater care. Whatever he writes or entrusts to be announced, I will ensure with all diligence that you are informed.</p>
      <p>I am sending you, as you requested, the "Catalogus haereticorum" by [Bernhard von] Luxemburg, who recently passed away. There are four books by Erasmus on the method of preaching available. If you request them, write back with the next messenger. Regarding the Münsterites, I am sending what has been published with us, as I recently received it, along with the bull of Pope Paul III, so that you may perceive the interest of our people at this time. Regarding the Emperor's victory, which you mentioned, you will also see a certain writing.</p>
      <p>We have no more certain information about the war between the Duke of Holstein and the Lübeckers than that a truce has been given.</p>
      <p>Regarding [John Fisher] and [Thomas] More, both have certainly fallen by the sword of the King of the Irish, along with several pairs of the observing order. For I myself wrote in my articles copies of the apostolic letters, in which the aid of the King of the Romans and other princes was implored for expelling the King of the Irish from his kingdom, as he is not only a public adulterer but also a murderer, heretic, and traitor to majesty. For his kingdom is tributary to the Roman Curia, etc. To understand briefly: I hear that the Pope once dispensed with the King of the English, so that he might marry his brother's wife, because the wife alleged the same impotence, etc.; but now the King takes this opportunity to repudiate such a wife, namely his brother's, and to marry another, spurning whatever dispensations were obtained from the Roman Pontiff, and furthermore the whole of that mixture. And therefore, all those who resist him, defenders of the constitutions of the Roman Curia, he afflicts with various tortures, among whom is [John Fisher], who shortly before his death was also elevated to the number of cardinals.</p>
      <p>And now, to mention the letter bearer in passing: You say he desires to be freed from his wife and that I should, if I can, provide him with a benefit, etc. The most present benefit (as I hear) is available, provided he wishes to use it: Let him leave this one and adhere to the one he first married, if there is no just and evangelical cause for refusal. Even if there is, he can still show mercy to the frail sex, etc. What I write, I wish to be entrusted to your faith. The same was asked once and again to dine with me, but he always offered an excuse.</p>
      <p>I wish to make the acquaintance of your brother-in-law Nikolaus Müslin.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and brother Hans along with other friends a thousandfold.</p>
      <p>You write about Konrad Klauser. If I knew he was among us, I would address him as familiarly as I could.</p>
      <p>With these few words, farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, on the eve of Simon and Jude the Apostles, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Theodericus Bitter of Wipperford.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my special good friend, to be delivered.</p>
