      <p>Most illustrious man, Samuel Pellicanus brought me your letters and at the same time three writings, one of which I now return; I will keep the remaining two with the utmost faith and diligence and, when they have been translated, I will return them.</p>
      <p>I think I know everything that the Bernese have written in our cause, whose counsel I truly approve; for certainly it would be more convenient at the next assembly. But whether the matter is dealt with then or not, I would consider it most advisable if you, whose intellect and solidity I value highly, would publish something to demonstrate that the Swiss act prudently and piously if they abstain from the papal council. I have translated here a commentary, which I had made in Italian and published under the name of my relative Vida. It is now being printed and will soon come to you, and I have no doubt that you can extract some things from it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Morellet has returned, who thanks you greatly for being concerned, etc. He himself seems to suspect somewhat the same things. I am constantly with him, as I notice him daily more favoring our cause. As for what you write about having heard that my Venetians incline towards the king's side, know that it is not true, nor will they incline while this Emperor lives; the same is to be thought about the Duke of Ferrara. But it is to be believed that the Duke of Urbino has inclined, since he has married the sister of Duke Octavius. I do not hear from my letters that war is being waged so fiercely as you write; indeed, I hear there is not a small hope for peace, and may our Lord God bring it about for us! I expect Mr. Gribaldus at any moment, who will bring more certain news, and indeed I wonder why he delays so long. I am almost idle here now and will leave immediately when he arrives, which I would like you to inform him of, for you will see the man before he comes to me. Not only is the little commentary I mentioned being printed, but also my letter about the pope's coronation, which you sent to Mr. Oporinus last year; you will have it shortly. I hope that some Italian things can be printed here, although the matter is not very safe.</p>
      <p>Mr. Morellet showed me yesterday letters written in Augsburg on the 10th of this month, in which I read these words: "The Magdeburgers are doing remarkable things." Therefore, they have not yet surrendered, as some are spreading.</p>
      <p>I know how important it is not to publish what you have received from the lords and what you have written to them alone. Therefore, do not doubt; for they will be retained with me and I will return them to you soon. When Mr. Gribaldus arrives, I will go straight to Bern with him. I wish he would bring me your letters, at least, I mean, the letters of the ministers, with which you would commend me to that senate with a better note! Farewell and be well. I bid the whole church and school to be well. May the Lord Jesus keep you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 21, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>The letter already written, another version was brought to me; therefore, I send you the other writing, about which I cannot now pass judgment, as I have not yet read it. But I will read and write what I think.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
