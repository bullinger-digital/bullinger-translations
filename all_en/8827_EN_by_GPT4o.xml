      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand. Your letter has greatly troubled me, for I well know what has always followed such developments. We pray to God from the heart that He may bring this dangerous matter to a good end, so that our entire honorable Confederation, our beloved fatherland, does not come into burden and suffering. How things have otherwise gone and how many serious sins are committed among you and the entire Confederation is known to no one, so that a severe and great judgment of God is to be feared. May Almighty God be gracious and merciful to us! You ask how you should conduct yourselves in such misery under arms. My advice is that you steadfastly preach that such uprisings are great punishments for sins. What sins are now present and unfortunately committed by superiors and subjects, I shall not prescribe to you, but how you should punish them with seriousness and Christian zeal with discretion and admonish everyone to improvement and Christian prayer, especially so that God does not repay us according to our deserts. Therefore, I trust you, as you have already faithfully carried out your office, that you have neither secretly advised nor publicly incited anyone to uprising with preaching. And that it has happened, I can well understand from your writing, that it is painful and burdensome to you. Therefore, you should admonish everyone to peace and quiet, so that no occasion is given for deadly war, as we already have enough war with the terrible famine.</p>
      <p>May God take it away from us and comfort us poor with the fertility of the earth again. To praise are those hearts who would gladly open justice from a good foundation and lay down injustice. But this should be undertaken with orderly means, which are not against God; and since a day of punishment and justice is set, one should let it proceed and be satisfied with it and not act with violence. No one can be both plaintiff and judge.</p>
      <p>Their misdeeds, which have been handled badly, should be brought to light with seriousness and truth before the competent judges and then judged according to the law and the deed. And should it now come to pass that other places of the Confederation come to you to mediate, the matter would be regretted, so that each party should be satisfied with the law; and whichever party does not do so and wants to proceed with violence without law, all other places should help to show them the way to justice. Therefore, it is very necessary to point them to the way of justice. The 5 or 7 places have recruited my lords this week from Lucerne, that they, for the good of the Confederation, since there is concern about uprising in the Bündnerland, write to Chur to the Bündner and admonish them to peace and that they let themselves be satisfied with the law in their disputes. My lords have written about this, as you may well have understood. I must worry that when the places hear that there is violence, they send their envoys and much confusion, God willing, does not result in worse. But if it were the case that some envoys came to recruit, I think well, my lords are so considerate to Chur that they write to my gracious lords here about their concerns, if perhaps my gracious lords send envoys to their other Confederates, Bern, Glarus, Basel, Schaffhausen, etc., and also send to you to mediate, so that greater evil might be prevented and a pious Confederation, our beloved fatherland, in these times, which are otherwise narrow, miserable, and full of danger, might remain in peace. May God grant that. And if the bishop also attacked, it would first - to worry - give a new tragedy. But one will know well how to do these things without my indication and settle this matter without delay with justice, before the matter goes further and the devil sows greater discord. Let me know how things are going; for I am exceedingly anxious. And since I cannot do more, I will pray to God that He may be gracious to you and the common Confederation. Also earnestly praying and admonishing everyone to prayer. - As for the rest about changing the place, you would bring upon yourself the greatest infamy at present; however, I have never denied my assistance to the ministers, especially their wives and children, and I hope well for the grace and protection of our Lord God. - I can well imagine how the city of Chur is hard pressed with the provisions; for here it is very expensive. Yet they have ordered them 100 measures of grain; therefore ask Tscharner, who brings you the letter, how it has gone. If something more of the same is to be recruited, then always the mayors themselves write to my lords and explain how the matter is arranged, etc., not through you nor through me, although I am always ready to serve the city and the Bündner with the utmost diligence and willingness, as I have now also done. And my friendly dear lord godfather, your brother-in-law Haller, has given out the 100 measures, yet by order of my lords, when they have received thorough information from me, how the matters are arranged and that the little flag is present, etc.</p>
      <p>The matter with your grain money against your brother-in-law I have entrusted to Mr. Haller, although I also gladly, when I meet young Mr. Joachim, will speak with him, etc. But you cannot believe how I am overwhelmed with business and also very unwell; for the many businesses and the much writing and preaching, great care and anxiety break my strength, although by the grace of God I am always very joyful and comforting in the Lord. May God increase His grace until my end!</p>
      <p>The enclosed writing, entrusted to me alone, I will, without doubt, keep well. If you were to send something to be printed, it cannot be printed before Froschauer's return from Frankfurt, but it could well be submitted to the censors beforehand, if they allow it to be printed.</p>
      <p>Our Gwalther has been left by the fever; he is again performing his duties. Our Simler is bedridden with gout, which pains me greatly. I think Mr. Haller himself will write to you. I pray to the Lord that in these troubles He may grant a happy delivery to your wife; the Lord is powerful and merciful. I also grieve for Mr. Rhaetian and would wish that he had not listened to the pope, the enchanter and enemy of God and the human race. I have written this in many businesses very hastily. Farewell forever. Zurich, March 21, in the evening, 1572.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, the elder. A new worry grows on my neck, as I hear from Lucius that Mr. Stuppa in Basel says the letter with the money has not been received by him. Knowing that I received the letter from Mr. Jakob Geßner and left it lying on my table until I had a messenger. And when I had finished the letter in France to Mr. Ramo, I sent it to Basel to Mr. Zwinger, but I no longer know who the messenger was to whom I entrusted it; for so many things happen that I do not know how and what, I forget one thing. And yet Ramo's letter is finished; for he has since answered me from Paris. But I have not written to Mr. Zwinger since then, nor received from him at this time, but I will write to him by the first messenger and ask, and this should be the last letter I take upon myself to send to others and give them an answer about it, if I do not only know whom I trust. But I know thoroughly that I sent it with trust.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
