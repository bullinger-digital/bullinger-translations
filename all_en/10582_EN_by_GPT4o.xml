    <p xml:id="regest1">Wishes that Bullinger would deliver the [enclosed] letter to his friend Ambrosius Zehnder. Asks to recommend him again to Blarer, as he is still without a position and is waiting in a monastery. His wife [Barbara] is expecting the visit of the wives of Bullinger, Utinger, and Göldli at Easter. She asks Bullinger not to forget what she discussed with him. City clerk Gabriel [Meyer] wants to buy the large Bible as well as Pellican's commentary volumes and asks Bullinger to inquire about the price and payment method with Christoph [Froschauer]. Bullinger should inform his brother Johannes that his money is ready.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ Jesus, our Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>These letters, most learned man, when you write to Blarer at some point, please attach them to yours so that they may be delivered to my dear friend Ambrosius Zehnder.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I earnestly ask your kindness to recommend the said Ambrosius to Blarer in your writings for the second time; for he has not yet obtained any position. He writes that he is being supported by the monks in a certain monastery called Stantstatt[?], waiting for the common reformation with others announced for the seventh of March. Meanwhile, he does not know what is happening there and does not promise himself much good. He fears that the Württembergers are not very favorable to the Swiss name. Therefore, please act as we hope well of you.</p>
      <p>Your wife, along with Utinger and Göldli, promised my wife that they would come to visit us on Easter. Let them keep their promises; for we will expect them unless they send a message or letter to cancel.</p>
      <p>My wife greets you, saying that she spoke with you about something recently while we were with you; do not forget this.</p>
      <p>Gabriel, our scribe, would gladly buy the Bible in larger format, which has so far been given for three Zurich florins, along with Pellican's commentary volumes on the Bible. He asks you to inquire with Christoph in his name about the price at which everything would be sold and on what terms he should pay; for he says he does not have everything ready at the moment, and you can reply through Johannes the assistant.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Aarau, March 6.</p>
      <p>And tell your brother, Mr. Hans in Ottenbach, that his money is all ready; therefore, he may come over if he wishes, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Zehnder.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished, learned, and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of the Zurich church and dearest brother.</p>
