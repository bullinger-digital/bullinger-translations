      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write, just letting you know that the messenger is available if you have anything for me. Greet Pellikan for me.</p>
      <p>Dear, do me a service propter sotios (for the sake of companions) and send your boy to the comb maker (Kammacher), who is making me a comb with an ivory handle, and pay him the maker's fee, since I have given him the ivory, and send it to me by courier. However, let me know what you owe him. Or I will send you 3 batzen (a type of coin) here; pay him from that. I do not believe it will be more. Kotter should have been treated more generously; but later, when he comes to us, we will take care of it.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
