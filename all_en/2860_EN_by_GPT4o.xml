      <p>Greetings. I give you immense thanks, my dear Mr. Bullinger, both for the most elegant silver coin sent as a gift to my wife, which she certainly cherishes most gratefully in your name (whom she venerates devoutly), and even more so for the prayers you have given me as a gift.</p>
      <p>I am pleased with the subject and the treatment, and I will gladly accommodate you in printing them, as much as the brevity of time allows, given the upcoming fair. I am sending a sample of the print, in which I will do my best to show, if not as elegantly as we would wish (for there is a rush, and there are many other things still to be completed, which have occupied us throughout this entire winter), at least as accurately as possible, our respect towards you and our singular eagerness to reciprocate your kindness. Furthermore, Froschauer wrote to me that he will also send me your sermons on the Apocalypse; if he does, I will gladly assist both you and him with my work by next summer, if the Lord grants us life and health as He has so far. I still have one concern, whether he wishes the printing to be done at his expense or mine (which I would prefer), although, whichever he prefers, I will not refuse my efforts, to the best of my ability and resources, which, if they were a bit more substantial, I would yield to no printer in terms of industry or endurance of labor. But I cease and wish you to remain with us and the church for a long time, safe and sound, and I sincerely pray for this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 13, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and friend, to be especially honored. In Zürich.</p>
