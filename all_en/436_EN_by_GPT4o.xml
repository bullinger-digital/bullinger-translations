      <p>Greetings in the Lord. What can I offer you in return for such a Christian benefit in sending the interim decree? You will see that I am not ungrateful. Dr. Brenz rightly said that the Interim is nothing but a whitewashed tomb full of the filthiest bones, which are not only hidden but also openly display their stench to all who are not deeply rooted in Christ. I have greatly benefited from your collections and writings, and I do not doubt that you have given many the opportunity to thoroughly read and reread the interim decree. If this is not imposing papism and utterly destroying Germany, what else should it be? Thus, the Lord usually sends madness to princes, I mean those who have embraced the truth with their soul, and leads them to insanity due to the ingratitude they have shown towards the true word of Christ. The same will happen to the people of Strasbourg if they introduce the Interim within their well-fortified walls with so many ditches and bulwarks. Meanwhile, I have heard this about England: little dissension is growing among the learned about prerogative; thus, the Lord usually tests. They have disputes in which nothing but contentions are stirred up. We do not read of such a custom in the early church, having disputes in matters of religion. Thus, Satan tests our faith from the right and the left.</p>
      <p>Do you doubt that the Bishop of Constance, who is said to be quite ill, will fail to expand his church and impose the Interim? He will undoubtedly come soon, as will the Bishop of Lausanne, a proud and arrogant man with a youthful spirit, who is ashamed of nothing, who even boasted to us half a year ago, when he was returning from the Emperor's court, that he would soon be in high honor in Lausanne with everything restored that was taken by the Bernese, and that the Bishop of Arras, Granvelle's son, wanted to buy the bishopric from him for 4000 crowns. From this, you can infer with what practices this kind of people disturb everything. Moreover, I have seen and read the sheet of your sermons, and everything you wrote pleases me in every way. If only you would more extensively insert papism, not with a light abundance of words, but with sharp, bitter ones, as it deserves, so that it would be made clear to everyone that papism is being proposed to us all by the Imperialists, even if this is not the age for writing as it was, nevertheless, the truth must not be passed over in silence, that is, what is true must be said freely because of the hypocrites, who desire nothing else than that the gospel be modestly proposed to the simple people, with past errors overlooked.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love Gastius.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 15, 1549. You will hear about the creation of masters from others or from Zwingli himself.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
