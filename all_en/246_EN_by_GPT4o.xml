      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Here is the delay, which I could not send sooner due to Westhemer's absence. News: A notary from Wittenberg was here, who told us this about the state of Saxony:</p>
      <p>They generally do not want to accept the Interim; the entire nobility along with the learned. There is much talk in Saxony against Duke Maurice; there is more news today that Duke Maurice has been stabbed by his chamberlain; I fear there is nothing to it.</p>
      <p>They are preparing for the wedding in Torgau; for the emperor has betrothed Duke Augustus, Maurice's brother, to his sister, who is in Denmark; they are bringing Duke Maurice about 3000 horses together; they are preparing for the wedding.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick does not cease his tricks, he has forbidden those of Goslar to mine, from which they can have great profit; he has rebuilt his castle Wolfenbüttel. He also sent a priest to those of Brunswick, who was to say mass for them; the children threw him out of the city with dirt, saying that if he came again, they would beat him out with rods.</p>
      <p>The pious princess of Saxony is said to have died of grief in Weimar these days, always spoken of by the pious prince.</p>
      <p>Those of Strasbourg are still holding out; some citizens are leaving the city. The emperor wants to station troops in Alsace; accommodations have already been ordered. They want to give a banquet to Big George and the bishop of Strasbourg and thus vex those of Strasbourg; for the one from Büren is supposed to come with some horses and foot soldiers; we will see from where. Those from Pomerania do not want the Interim at all.</p>
      <p>Count Albrecht of Brandenburg, who helped Maurice against the Duke of Saxony, has ridden to Krakow to the king of Poland with 400 horses, wanting to receive the fief in Prussia from the king; for the grand master from Prussia is very old, can no longer wage war, which does not worry the German lords a little.</p>
      <p>Agricola, for having persuaded the Elector of Brandenburg and the Count Palatine to accept the Interim, has been gifted by Charles, Ferdinand, and the Bishop of Augsburg more than a thousand gold coins, excluding clothes and other precious things; whom the Wittenbergers pursue with utmost hatred and even mock in the preachers' entrance by adding his name.</p>
      <p>Your Dionysius, to whom you inscribed the letter to the Romans, is again saying mass and doing everything that the imperial ones want, command, and order. See the inconsistency of the man. The same is said of the Landgrave; thus the Lord lets us fall.</p>
      <p>Julius Pflug has received the bishopric of Meissen from the emperor, although they do not yet say mass in that city, yet they sing the canonical hours in Latin.</p>
      <p>What is happening in Augsburg, you know better than I. They are recalling the boys who have so far devoted themselves to studies with us; perhaps they fear being involved in the Swiss war, or they know the emperor's plan. He is planning something either against the Swiss or the French; if he wants to restore the Duke of Savoy, the Bernese will have war with the French, and I believe the emperor has no other plan than to secretly wage war on us with our allies applauding, who will eventually fall into the harshest servitude, neglecting the home of their neighbor. But they do not want to be wise, and it is no wonder, since gold blinds them, so they do not know what is useful, what is useless. May the Lord protect us from all our adversaries.</p>
      <p>I wish to know what you have certain about the people of Constance; for various rumors are spread among us. Where is our constancy in consoling the brothers, who desire nothing else than the sound doctrine of Jesus Christ? We dare nothing more, we who stand by the gospel, we have no wisdom in consulting, no courage in resisting the enemy of the gospel. How cold we are in asserting the truth. I see before my eyes the impending blow of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding the preachers of Augsburg, there is no need for me to write anything to you, since you are very familiar with what has been done there. Farewell. August 28, 1548. Prince Christoph of Württemberg is with us; what he intends or seeks, I do not know; more on this next time.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Theodor, Pellican, and the other excellent men. Yours, Gastius</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
      <p>September 14, 1548.</p>
