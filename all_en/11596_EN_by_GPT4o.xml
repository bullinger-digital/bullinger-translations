    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for [No. 1545]; has sad news to convey: [Simon] Grynaeus has fallen ill with the plague and is on his deathbed; some say the Lord has already taken him away; [Oswald] Myconius has written Bullinger a sad and desperate letter [No. 1551]. Bullinger has not known what to do for two days out of sheer grief; few are left whom he loved more, for in Grynaeus, education, philanthropy, and deep piety are fused. Unfortunate stars hover over this year: within the span of a year, Eobanus Hessus, Guillaume Budé, [Simon] Grynaeus, [Christoph] Hegendorff, and [Juan Luis] Vives have passed away; these deaths admonish us to live rightly and prepare for death. [Rudolf] Gwalther will marry Zwingli's daughter Regula on August 3rd; if only Vadian could attend the wedding! Regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I received your letter, my most esteemed Vadian (Joachim von Watt), and I thank you for your faithfulness and diligence. As for my reply, I have nothing at present except this most unfortunate news that was brought yesterday: the illustrious man, Lord Grynaeus (Simon Grynaeus), gravely afflicted by the plague, is on his deathbed. Indeed, there are those who say he has been taken by the Lord; some proclaim that on the evening of July 27th, he still had some breath. Myconius (Oswald Myconius) sent letters full of mourning and despair. For two days now, out of sheer grief, I do not know what to do. There are few left whom I loved more intensely than this one. For he combined humanity with learning and remarkable piety. Truly, unfortunate stars have shone upon us this year. Within a year, the best poet Eobanus Hessus, the most skilled in the Greek language Guillaume Budé, the most praised philosopher Grynaeus, the most knowledgeable jurist Hegendorff (Christoph Hegendorff), and the sanctuary of all learning Vives (Juan Luis Vives) have passed away. Yet, the good will of God receives these men, who have deserved well of letters, into blessed seats; it reminds us, however, to do good and prepare for death. Glory to Him forever! My Gwalther (Rudolf Gwalther) will celebrate his wedding on August 3rd. He has married Zwingli's (Huldrych Zwingli) daughter Regula, a girl both beautiful and praised in every way and blessed. If only you could adorn the wedding with your presence. Farewell, and as you have done so far, do not cease to write frequently. August 1st, 1541. Yours, Bullinger (Heinrich Bullinger).</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Joachim Vadian (Joachim von Watt), the most esteemed consul of St. Gallen, always to be honored and loved by his lord.</p>
