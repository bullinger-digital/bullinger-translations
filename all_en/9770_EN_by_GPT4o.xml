      <p>Greetings in Christ, most esteemed man and venerable father!</p>
      <p>I am most grateful to you for writing to me so diligently and lovingly. Indeed, nothing could have been more pleasing to me than to understand your opinion on our controversies. You write most fully about what you yourself think of the whole matter; I see and embrace it. However, I hope that this new edifice of new discipline will soon collapse under its own weight, as it is clear that many of our people have long been weary of it, who previously admired it; and those who seemed to be the most vehement in establishing this new construction have now, as if having changed their minds, begun to cool down in a remarkable way. May the Lord grant that, with all dissensions and contentions removed, we may all speak and think the same according to Jesus Christ, and that with one mind and one voice we may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
      <p>I do not wish to write to you about English affairs, because this pious and learned young man, who brings these letters to you, will inform you of everything.</p>
      <p>The first cloth I sent to you was intercepted by the Flushing pirates; I took care to send a second, which I hear has reached your hands.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man, and I earnestly ask that you commend me to God in your prayers. In haste.</p>
      <p>Fulham, England, August 9, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, and most loving of you, Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man and his dearest brother, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
