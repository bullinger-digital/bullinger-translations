      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I have diligently read and re-read your Apology against the Lutherans, most excellent Bullinger. The booklet is certainly perfect in every respect and fortified with the sacred oracles of God, arguments, and solid reasons, not to mention the eloquent passages of Scripture, so that the gates of the underworld are compelled to yield to the truth, whether the adversaries like it or not. Those proletarian writers indeed resist; but the truth will remain immovable and invincible. But this is like telling a story to the deaf, which I not only fear but know for certain, for there are more adherents to tradition and ceremonialists in the lower churches, not to mention the penny theologians (no offense intended), who with stubborn minds prefer to cling to their madness and gladiatorial spirit rather than yield a finger's breadth to the truth, etc.</p>
      <p>I would like to share an example of this with you. There is among us one or two young men, stipendiaries of the church, who returned from Wittenberg last year and came to NÃ¶rdlingen on a Sunday. There they heard someone ranting against us from the pulpit, saying: "The enthusiasts in Zurich and Switzerland pour out 12 sacraments to the people, like one pours swill into a trough," etc., and some other things even more vain and disgraceful. Thus do those pigs grunt... indeed, those who have never even heard of your teachings. They are incurable, and it is hopeless with them, as they also speak of us, since this is the infallible truth, which we confess that Christ is food not for the stomach, but for the soul, and since the soul is spirit, it is necessary therefore that the food of the soul is spiritual, etc.</p>
      <p>Another example. In that year, when Zwingli of blessed memory returned from the Marburg Colloquy, I was on a mission on behalf of the brothers of Erfurt to a good man, and while I was walking after dinner with Leo Jud, whose guest I was at the time, we happened to meet Zwingli walking with some others. Letters were given to him from Nuremberg, which he read as he walked, and finally, standing, he said he had received letters (I do not know from whom) about Luther's obstinacy and added: "I know that Luther would sooner fall to the Anabaptists, if he did not fear much opposition, before he would fall to our opinion regarding the sacrament, which is not ours, but God's and scriptural. I say this without injury and offense to either party." However, Zwingli's statement has stuck in my memory like a Sibyl's leaf, when now the matter itself is clearer than daylight, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you make me the critic of your apology, and if anything displeases me, you freely allow me to advise you. What, will a pig judge Minerva?</p>
      <p>But, to respond to your wishes, I do not want to hide from you that I am entirely displeased and miserably lament that your excellent writings, supported by the truth of Christ, are shunned by the adversaries as if they were poison. But do not lose heart, as you do; for there is one who will see and judge in due time. Continue with courage, etc.</p>
      <p>I also wonder about Johannes Sleidanus, who in the previous year in book 5 of his Commentaries on the State of Religion wrote about the controversy of the Eucharist: "There is one opinion (he says) of all these that the body and blood of Christ are taken spiritually, not corporally nor by mouth, but by heart, while the adversaries still stubbornly maintain that the substantial, natural body, as it gloriously sits at the right hand of the Father, is eaten by even impious men," etc. An egg is not as similar to another egg as our genuine opinion on the Eucharist is dissimilar to the Lutheran confession; so far are we from agreement, unless my mind deceives me, or I, as a completely stupid old man, understand nothing. If only Sleidanus had sounded this more clearly and with more open pipes. But perhaps it was not fitting for a historian to theologize. Therefore, I do not care for the slanders with which we have been oppressed for many years; but thanks be to God, we are not overwhelmed, even if the adversaries excel in the acumen and ingenuity of Chrysippus. The speech of truth is simple and our confession of faith is not contrary to the analogy. It would be worthwhile, however, to lift pure hands to heaven and pray unceasingly that Christ, the Son of God, may extinguish this long-burning fire for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>They do not pray for us, although perhaps not all, but curse us as desperate men, and the more they do this, the more they rage. May God have mercy on us and bless us. Enough of this to you for now. Why do I trouble you, who are engaged in more useful matters?</p>
      <p>Since you have reproached me for not having written for a long time, behold, you have a very lengthy letter written by an old grammarian.</p>
      <p>You will polish it with your refined style. May Christ, the Son of God, keep us, amen. Greet your family in the Lord, especially Mr. Pellican, who, no less than I, with old Simeon, awaits the kingdom of God, and also Gualther, Bibliander, Fabricius, and the other athletes of Christ. Pray to the Lord for us. Our people greet you. Regius has revived from death, etc.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr, on the 10th day of April, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Erb with a staff...</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, a brother to be respected.</p>
