      <p>Greetings. I have received with immense joy, indeed with jubilation of the spirit and not without delight, the two letters which you, most esteemed lord and most revered elder, have not disdained to send to me, who am in no way deserving of such (which is your characteristic kindness). For this admirable kindness of yours, as well as the effort you have undertaken on my behalf, and for the assistance you offer, I can do nothing but give you eternal thanks, since it is not within my power to repay you adequately. But to conclude briefly and not to trouble you longer with my unwelcome letters, although a considerable sense of duty touches my mind to burden you further, who have already taken more than enough trouble for my sake, yet since you yourself encourage me with your kindness, I dare to further abuse your patience with my audacity and ask that, since the printer here refuses his services, you might arrange through one of your people, if indeed it can be done conveniently, that my little book, since those friends to whom I promised it are pressing, be published either in Basel or Geneva, where I hear religion flourishes most sincerely, provided that 90 or 100 copies could at least be sent from there to here, which could then be brought to me after you have retained those you wish. But I have been more lengthy and thus more troublesome to you than I intended. Please forgive me. I have greeted the brothers and fellow ministers whom you ordered to be greeted, especially Julius of Milan and Scipio Lentulus, who are now gathered very dutifully at the synod in Zuoz. They in turn greet you most diligently and we pray that you keep us in your prayers to the Lord. They also pray that you have my book commended in their name as well for the request I made a little above. Farewell, today no small ornament of Europe.</p>
      <p>Given at Zuoz on the 2nd day of June in the year of our Lord 1568. Yours always most observantly, Ulrich Campell.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most holy Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most revered father and lord to be honored with perpetual fidelity.</p>
