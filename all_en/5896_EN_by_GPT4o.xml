      <p>S. Although Mr. Calvin sincerely recommends to you the cause of the Pellisari, which is being conducted among the Rhaetians, and explains what should now be requested from them: because I feel personally obliged to those men, I did not want to fail in my duties.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most illustrious man, they request letters of recommendation from your most honorable senate to all the Rhaetians, who will hold a public assembly at Chur on the 3rd of the Ides of November next, or on the feast of St. Martin, which is the same.</p>
      <p>You will easily understand from Mr. Calvin's letters that your most honorable senate is asked to encourage the Rhaetians with their letters to continue as they have begun, so that the cause they have once undertaken to defend may be carried through to the end with the same spirit.</p>
      <p>And since it is rumored that they intend for the monks to have less power and authority in their domain in the future, they should be advised to expel that entire rabble of monks and priests from their borders as soon as possible, if they wish for a peaceful Rhaetian domain in the future.</p>
      <p>But you will discern everything better with your prudence. One thing remains, which I ask of you, namely that you write specifically to the most illustrious prefect of Chur about this matter, and strongly recommend it to him.</p>
      <p>For I hear that he is both a friend to you and will do whatever is possible for your favor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most illustrious man, I ask you again and again to take up and protect this cause of the Pellisari with the humanity and diligence you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Which you will certainly do if you obtain the letters I mentioned from the senate, and write to that prefect yourself.</p>
      <p>We, however, will gladly accomplish whatever you command.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>All of yours greet you reverently, and especially your brother Budaeus.</p>
      <p>I wish all friends who are there to be well.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from Mr. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>What is furthermore happening in France you will learn from Mr. Calvin's letters.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you and keep you safe, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before the calends of October 1563.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
