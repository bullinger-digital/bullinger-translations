      <p>S. Your letter written on the 13th of this month was very pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>I sent the letter you wrote to the King of Navarre along with the book and added my own, in which I omitted nothing to make everything more pleasing to him. When I receive a response from the brother, the king's secretary, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>Your letters were very beneficial to the people of Geneva, as they were read before the king, the princes, and the primary council. They were particularly pleased and delighted with what you mentioned about the wisdom and moderation of the most noble council of Zurich. They returned the original and kept the translation I sent, and the queen mother placed it among her treasures. The cardinal has left and will be absent for a long time.</p>
      <p>The pious are always in good hope; but everything must be done gradually and slowly, and one must not indulge the minds of many too much. The matter is in the hands of the Lord, who makes great conversions in a moment. We must pray that great progress is made in His word.</p>
      <p>I am writing to the consul, who recently intervened in the peace negotiations at the assembly in Baden, to be involved in the matter demanded by the people of Lucerne regarding the money given in the name of King Henry, so that he may intercede for the king's response to be awaited and for everything to be settled amicably and with honor to the Swiss name. And to open up to you most familiarly: some from the king's council consider it a bad example and pernicious in these regions to approve giving ten percent annually. But often opinions (as he said) do violence to the truth, and many unjust and wicked things are done in customs, which are often punished with the gravest penalties by God. To remain silent about what is read everywhere in the Holy Scriptures about biting usury, Aristotle in his Politics and Ethics considers it to have inherent malice and to be contrary to natural law and charity; for since money is a sterile thing, no one should demand profit from it, and its true use, which is for the sake of exchange, is inverted if it is transferred to gain, especially when the one to whom it is given perceives no profit from it, as in this case, which was consumed for the ambition of some in Italy, and descending to particulars, they say in the contracts made that the anticipation of payment is unjust; for 84 thousand gold coins were counted at the end of August, and the interest for one year is to be paid on the first of May, 46 thousand crowns were paid and counted at the end of November, and the interest for the whole year is to be paid on the first of June following, the counting of the last contract was done at the end of November, the payment to be made on the 26th of October, then the cardinal offered twenty percent for half a year; but in necessity, a friend should not be oppressed. I know these are excused, that this is the custom here to pay interest from the time someone has the money ready, even if they receive it later. But they want the payment for three years to be made in June next year, even for that sum which was due from the contract only on the 27th of October. They also want the payment to be made here, which is owed in Lyon, and the principal to be returned in three years, and in July, beyond the excessive interest, twelve hundred crowns for expenses. Thus, they capture double profit from a sterile thing.</p>
      <p>It is no wonder that Cato compared usury to theft and murder in his work on agriculture, because examples prove it while we live, although many people tolerated malice for a while, while necessity pressed, they dissimulated, but did not approve by conniving. I hope, however, to extricate myself from this labyrinth with the help of good people, and I will not openly promise more than five percent, which the municipal law here permits; but I will be an advocate for something to be given separately from the royal generosity beyond those five, which will seem fair and right to all the sane and good, so that peace may be granted to me in this matter. The king is now compelled to redeem peace with King Philip by paying one hundred and thirty thousand crowns for his sister's dowry, and the entire sum must be in Flanders next month. Delegates are to be chosen from the eleven cantons, and they have already been named, to look into the controversy between the Bernese and the Savoyard, and a diet is scheduled in Basel for the 18th of May. There are various rumors about the conflict initiated in the Val d'Angrogne.</p>
      <p>More reliable sources say that 800 of the Duke of Savoy's soldiers were killed by those peasants who were being oppressed. A friend from Geneva wrote that he has thirty crowns for Rambouillet; I will take care of it, and if they are sent to me later, he will have them shortly, and if necessary, I will order the postmaster to give them to him. If you see the consul and the occasion arises, I beg you to commend the matter of usury or interest to him and greet the friends. I hope to see them with you soon; then we will discuss everything more intimately.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 25th of February.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Cognetius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
