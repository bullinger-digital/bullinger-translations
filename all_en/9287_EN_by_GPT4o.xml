      <p>S. Your benefits to me, reverend lord and father, are great and innumerable, with which you have not ceased to heap upon and burden me, unworthy as I am. Since I cannot give worthy thanks for them, I have decided to show some token and remembrance of gratitude. Therefore, to the large Wyttenbach cheese, which Mr. Consul himself sends to you and Mr. Gwalther as a gift, I have added a small cheese from the Münster valley, which I offer to you, just as one offered a drop of water in the hands to the great king of Persia, earnestly asking you to deign to regard my spirit more than that small gift, for your humanity; it is clean inside and not too fat, which is indeed a kind that is highly recommended among our people in the summer, and it is now maturing; the consul's cheese, however, can be kept for two years or more; for it is fresh and unchanged, provided it is kept in a temperate place. I thought the consul himself would write to both of you; but while I was writing this, he was overwhelmed with business and instructed me to offer all his services to both of you, his most esteemed lords, in his name, as a sign and symbol of the most certain old friendship, sending this small gift, earnestly asking that you always keep the old friend Wyttenbach in commendation. But I must not embellish the gift of a good man with my words before you. I commend myself and all mine to you, especially my son Samuel, whom I, along with his mother, still surviving, a matron of pious memory, have dedicated to sacred letters and the fatherland, by which vow I am now compelled to bear scarcely tolerable expenses. But I am not a little refreshed by the goodness of God, so often experienced towards me, and also by the liberality of all of you who are in charge of the church and school, so that I hope I will soon achieve my vow.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write now, especially to you who are nearer to Baden and Zurzach. The rumor about the capture or killing of Andio at La Rochelle continues and is confirmed day by day. May the Lord grant that all things may finally turn, as much as is fitting, to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul and all good people wish you all prosperity. May God keep you safe for us for a very long time, most esteemed lord and father, with your whole family, whom I ask you to greet from me.</p>
      <p>Biel, 14th April, 1573.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] w[holly]</p>
      <p>J[osua] F[insler] of Z[urich].</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger at the Grossmünster, Zurich.</p>
