      <p>God with us. Herewith I send you the news that was written to me on January 16th from Augsburg; look at it and send it back to me at the first opportunity. The people of Lucerne have written to my lords that there are particular individuals who intend to lead the people out of the country against the authority, which has not been the custom until now. Therefore, my lords have scheduled a meeting in Baden for tomorrow in eight days, that is, February 10th, and now the citizens are being urged to prepare for that day. Treasurer Thoman has not yet arrived, unless he came last night, which I do not believe; for it is a long way to Antwerp. May God grant him His blessing. From Chur, it is written that the Turk has taken sixty thousand Tatars into his service; for he is preparing himself both on land and fiercely on water. May God grant us peace. If we strive for it, He will grant it to us; if we desire war, He will grant it to us, and it is a long-deserved matter. Let there be peace in my days.</p>
      <p>God be with you. Greet Susanna, Elisabeth, Susanna, and J. Hans Peyer and his wife, Mr. Hans LÃ¶we, etc. A pair of your rolls have arrived at brother-in-law Mr. Keller's house, where we sent them for you to finish.</p>
      <p>On Candlemas morning at 8 o'clock in the year 1572. All my people greet you.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his beloved brother Mr. Hans Rudolf Bullinger, preacher at Berg, to answer. Berg.</p>
