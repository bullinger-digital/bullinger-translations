      <p>Greetings. Regarding the Garnerian case, it is as you say: it is not surprising that you are so grieved about it, as it is hardly approved by other good and pious men. With your prudence and sagacity, you have hit the nail on the head. Those who desired an opportunity, when it arose, seized it most eagerly, although they claimed to be moved by mercy, and indeed not of the ordinary kind. Intercessions and supplications were made by the most illustrious counts, preachers, and others, but nothing (as the matter itself shows) could be accomplished. If I wished to include in writing everything that pertains to this case, I know I would exceed the limits of a letter: therefore, when you make a journey to Zürich, you will be able to learn the whole story.</p>
      <p>I have received letters from Jan Łaski (Johannes a Lasco) two or three times since he has been in Frankfurt: he, being pious and strong, bears the storms and tempests of these times with an even mind: although it is quite lamentable that the fat and coarse theologians are so hostile to the true doctrine of the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>May God deign to somehow finally counter their implacable fury. I too, from Easter until this day, that is, from the suspension and deposition of Garnier, have not attended any church, nor have I decided to return to the French church until I first see clearly what doctrine they wish to introduce there. Meanwhile, it is hard for me to be deprived of the sacred assembly. Therefore, I ask you to obtain consolation for me and the remaining brothers from God with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Regarding the writing of Hooper, do what seems right; just note this, do not think that I requested in my letters that you alter the writing of the deceased, especially those things for which he met his death; but I was advising that, while preserving the truth of the doctrine, which the pious man believed and taught, if anything was less accurately written, it should be corrected and the arguments that seemed less firm or weaker should be removed.</p>
      <p>Nor would this have violated the will of the deceased, since he requested in his letters that this be done by us, and he excused the inconveniences of prison, the lack of books, and other impediments that prevented him from writing more accurately what he wanted. Therefore, I was not proposing that the pure truth of the doctrine be covered with any coating, so that it might appear less openly and clearly, but I was only seeking that the book come out more corrected and polished, and since I was not unaware that you are more burdened with the lack of time than other ministers, if the matter had been handled by someone else, I thought the duty would have been fulfilled. Nevertheless, use your judgment on the whole matter and consider what I wrote as aiming to clarify the sense of my previous letters and not to think that I wanted to burden your laborious occupations with any new task.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that your magistrate received the Locarnese, who were expelled from their town, with such charity, I cannot extol it enough with my commendation. To defend those in danger was certainly no small thing, to want to have them in your city was much, to provide for the sacred services to be conducted in their language and to have their own church was much more; but to call a minister to them and to provide for their sustenance with your public stipend was indeed very much and the greatest thing, an example not to be despised, but rather one that other princes should admire and imitate in our age. As for me, I thank your republic and especially you, whom I do not doubt to have been both the author and the advocate of such a noble work.</p>
      <p>I also admire the generous piety of the Bernese, who have supported the poor of Christ with such a lavish and munificent gift. They have indeed done something worthy of a Christian magistrate. This is to declare faith by works. May God deign to repay them and the people of Neuchâtel, to whom the excellent Farel ministers the gospel, a hundredfold here and eternal life in the future age, which I do not doubt He will do, since He has promised it in the clearest words.</p>
      <p>I have seen the picture of Italy with the interpretation that you sent, and I knew it to be in such a state as it is depicted, and much worse, even before that picture; for there is no mention there of the tyranny of the Pope, nor of the other horrendous sins that are rampant there. Nevertheless, I thank you for the little gift, as I should, and I pray that you earnestly commend that region, so miserably afflicted, to God, that it may be freed from idolatry and the reign of sin, because unless it turns to Christ, it will never find an end to its calamities. I have nothing new to write from England, except that the brothers are continually being burned; yet in these evils, we must give thanks to Christ for this extraordinary benefit, who grants incredible constancy to His martyrs. From the Diet of Augsburg, it is expected daily that peace will be granted to the Lutheran churches. If this is obtained, we will be greatly insulted; but if God is for us, who can be against us. Farewell and love me in the Lord, as you do. I have greeted those you ordered, who all greet you in return. I wish you would deign to convey my greetings to your colleagues in my name. Strasbourg, July 3, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man by singular piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>As in these days (as it happens) I was reviewing some of my writings, this part of Master Hooper's work also came to hand. Therefore, I noticed that by sending the book, I had failed to include what remained. Therefore, so that you may not be frustrated if you wish to know the whole matter at once, I send it to you and ask that you kindly overlook my previous negligence. Farewell again.</p>
