      <p>My willing service beforehand, friendly dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>My lord Doctor Vadianus has informed me that you desire, for the benefit of the people of the House of God, etc., to send what has been found to you. In response, I have brought several copies from the countryside from willing sources, including an original from those in Waldkirch. These copies have been drawn by the abbot's scribes from the originals and sent to the countryside. The handwriting is also very well known. Therefore, I believe, they will be very good in the right. I kindly ask you not to betray me and to remain silent, so that we are not brought to more hatred, as we already have enough and too much.</p>
      <p>Also know hereby that a judgment has been issued to the common people of the House of God in Rapperswil under Abbot Francisco by the four locations, that the abbot should not burden them further with any new impositions. If his actions now concerning the people of the House of God, the faith, and customs are not a burden, the believers may judge, etc. If this recognition might serve this matter, I know well the place where the letter and seal would be. However, I leave such matters to you, so that it does not become public, as the abbot's officials might remove the letter and perhaps conceal it, as they are inclined to serve the abbot and not the people of the House of God, etc.</p>
      <p>It would also be my request that we have several more of those mandates that your lordship has issued, as the ones that have arrived have brought not a small comfort, and if we had more, we would send them here and there in the countryside, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, if you have used the letters, that they would be returned to my hands, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, I offer myself inclined and willing to serve you at all times.</p>
      <p>Herr Jacob Riner, once a preacher in Thal, now residing with us, sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>Given in St. Gallen, the 4th day of June in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Wetter alias Jufli, servant of the divine word in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my gracious lord.</p>
