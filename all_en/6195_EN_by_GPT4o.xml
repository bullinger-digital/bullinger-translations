      <p>S. I rarely write, indeed. This often happens against my will; for it often occurs that in an entire month hardly anyone, whom I know, travels to you, as happened this past month; if I send letters elsewhere, there is a risk that they may be intercepted or not handled with care. This is evidenced by your recent letters to Mr. Beza; attached to them were other letters written by you and my brother to me on March 9th; however, I only received them on the third of this July, sent from Basel; you see, therefore, with what diligence they are usually handled. I believe the same sometimes happens with my letters; therefore, do not conceive any ill superstition about me, as if I love you less than before; you know who I am and who I have been towards you until now; I will remain the same forever. And I deduce what you are like towards me from the fact that you so greatly desire my letters; for if you did not love me, you would not long for my letters so much. I could indeed assign many other reasons why I write less frequently, such as that I want my brother, to whom I sometimes write hastily, to communicate everything to you, and it is bothersome to write the same things twice, also because I do not like to write uncertain things, and because I cannot always know everything that happens here (for our magistrate tends to do everything here very secretly), and I am often prevented by shame from inquiring, lest I seem to incur the vice of πολυπραγμοσύνη (meddlesomeness), which many faithful ministers are often accused of, especially among us, and therefore I write what I write not without danger. However, whatever the case may be, I truly know nothing that I have concealed from you so far of all that I could know and that seemed expedient for you to know. But let us leave this aside. As for these letters, I did not want to send them to Mr. Beza, since they were written so long ago, lest he think they were retained so long due to my negligence; therefore, if you wish to change or still send them, do so. I will take care of what you send with the utmost diligence. As far as our Saffoische (Savoy) dealings are concerned, they are now almost at the point of printing, and we expect it to happen this week; for on July 25th, my lords in Chambéry are to give the Duke and the Duke here my lords' response regarding the proposed means for the renewal of religion and the city of Geneva, and I am convinced that the matter will lead to peace. Regarding religion, those who are restored are to remain in all things by the teaching and reformation as they now have it, until a general, free, Christian council, in which alone it will be recognized from the clear, pure word of God what the truth is. The city of Geneva is to be assured in all things that neither the Duke nor his people shall do them any harm nor allow others to do so, but whatever claims he or they might have against them, it shall be settled in friendship or, if that is not possible, with impartial justice, and that the Duke shall allow them free trade in his lands and not block anything. Regarding the eternal alliance they made with my lords, it shall remain and stand, unless the Duke can rightfully prove that they had no authority to make such an alliance. This last article has been long debated; for they wanted to keep the alliance simply; but it could not be; so the appendix was added. I understand, however, that they have their good reasons and freedoms for it, so that they could well do it, and therefore I see no danger in the article, and therefore I think it will now be concluded; for my lords, who are outside the city, are all summoned to be here next Monday. There the matter will be handled. Meanwhile, all the cantonal assemblies have been held throughout the German lands; there are 39 of them. They all had to give their response and decision in writing regarding the matter; they were all heard before the council yesterday and there are three opinions: The first, and the majority, has about 20 communities; they advise my lords to seek peace, and since the Confederates have handled so much in it, that they should not be dishonored, since my lords retain such a large part of the land and the others are kept in the faith. The second has about 13 communities; they leave all matters to my lords, not advising either this or that: my lords have ruled wisely and well so far and kept them in good peace; therefore they leave it to their wisdom; whatever pleases them in this, they are willing to support with body and goods. The others do not want to give the Duke a shoe's breadth of land; but, as it was won with the sword, so it should be kept with it. There is therefore much dispute about the matter also in the countryside. But it is now finally at the point of printing; God grant that it goes well! I am otherwise troubled by the good people who must go back under the Duke; but I know nothing else to do than to pray to God that he may be their protector and that they may be a leaven from which the gospel may come to the Duke in his entire land. If the articles are accepted on both sides, it will be made known to the Confederates again; they will then insert these articles into the others that were previously set and conclude the peace; but they will have to ensure that the land that remains also comes to the point and is accepted. I would like Zurich not to show itself unwilling; for it would create much goodwill. I understand that the other places show much goodwill; for the matter is inquired about over and over. As for other news, I know nothing special. It is said for certain that the King of León has moved to Villa Franca along with the court because of the plague, which is breaking out mightily in León. On June 22nd, the Duke of Savoy entered Chambéry with 800 horses. On July 3rd, he entered León, where the King and Queen met him up to Montbéliard, a French mile away. No other war preparations are heard of. The people of Geneva also write that they hope the matters will go better than they seemed; yet they desire no less that 50 men be equipped for reinforcement if needed. But they do not want to do it yet, so as not to give anyone cause for war. Regarding the Germans who are moving to Italy, nothing further is heard than that they are moving towards Genoa, and it is said that Philip wants to use them against the Turks. In León, an English lord was with the king with 60 horses, having ridden up on the post, and there concluded peace and alliance with him in St. John's Church, yet not to any measure. Some of ours, who were in León, have seen him eat with the king; the king sat at the top of the table, he at the bottom; neither spoke a word to the other. These are the friendships, these are the alliances of kings! Greet for me my lords both mayors, also your wife and family along with all dear lords and brothers. Mr. Schultheiss Steiger, Junker Niclaus von Diesbach, Mr. Treasurer von Grafenried, Mr. von Mülinen greet you greatly; he returned home the day before yesterday, for he and Mr. Manuel held the assemblies in the Aargau before them after they came from Baden. Mr. Treasurer Haller and Mr. Venner in Hag, who are both in the chamber today, can go nowhere else. My brother-in-law and your brothers-in-law, the Zähenders, also greet you greatly. Marquard Zähender, the young, has recently married my brother-in-law Batt Herport's daughter. Mrs. Frisching along with her sons and daughters is well and also greets you greatly. Given in Bern on July 15, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I must also send this letter to the Aargau to Birr, as I have no other messenger. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his honorable lord and compatriot, dear in many ways. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
