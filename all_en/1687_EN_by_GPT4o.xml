      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most esteemed father! As I pondered what I should write to your kindness, John from Ulm came to mind, indicating that it would be pleasing to you if I informed you about the progress and confirmation of religion among us, or about the household established by the Duke of Suffolk, my lord. Regarding religion, after the idols were demolished and trampled upon, and idolatry was shaken and cast aside, and after the return to the true light of the gospel by the grace of God, the path we have entered and followed, and the order we have maintained for these four years, I believe is not unknown to you. Now, at present, the book (which is called royal), in which the manner of divine worship and the mode of praying to God, which is widespread among us (to be publicly used by all), is contained and explained, is said to be amended in certain places: in how many places, I am not yet certain. There were certain prayers for the dead, which did not seem to fit well.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in the institution of the sacred supper, something must either be changed or completely erased. A booklet on the election and ordination (as they call it) of ministers was published, which seemed to contain partly inept and partly impious things. We are in expectation that (with God's help) it will be amended at least in some part, if they do not reach the clear purity that is fitting, which we may wish for, but perhaps cannot fully hope for yet. But (thanks be to God) we are called to hope that impious superstition will be completely abolished.</p>
      <p>Regarding the established household of the Duke, I must ask you again and again to show the way you judge best, rather than for me to explain our method to you. John can report better on this. There is one thing about which I will express my opinion and intention to you; then I will ask for your opinion and advice on the same. In the houses of such honorable people, you know there are games, not only those that moderately and piously delight the body or soul, but also those that induce idleness and generate laziness and impiety: such as dice games and card games. Now the Duke has forbidden all his servants from engaging in any such game for money. However, he and his most honorable wife, with their friends, secretly in their chamber, not only wish to be allowed to play, but also to gamble for money. I am of the opinion that it is in no way permissible for a Christian to gamble for money in any game, so that the victor departs with some gain, or the loser with some loss. And in this way, it is frequently debated. Those who are with them often bring up these main points: They do not desire another's property, but it is the same to them whether they gain or suffer loss: without money, the game is cold; therefore, nature, as if asleep, must be awakened: no one is stirred unless a prize is proposed: in many other things, there are redundant and unnecessary expenses, such as in food, in clothing, etc.; therefore, in this kind of thing too, some allowance should be made for custom, and not everything should be so strictly managed, nor should everything be referred to the calculations of conscience and duty, since no one lives without fault, - etc. in the same sentiment: therefore, it is permissible to gamble a little, provided there is no great loss.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, I cannot be persuaded to believe that the human mind is so indifferent and impartial in gambling, that it does not regard gain more than loss, nor avoid loss more than gain. Otherwise, gambling would not be a game, but rather a firm intention of the mind to give freely.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if anyone has such an impartial intention, then he does wrong by disturbing such an even disposition and attempting to lead it to disorder, so that (with money involved) he comes into danger, lest previously calm and peaceful affections (if they can be so, which I do not believe) are stirred up, and suddenly the desire for another's property, anger, envy, quarrels, etc., emerge. Therefore, let the game indeed be cold, and (lest it falls into worse) let the exercise itself in any kind be sufficient reward (which is the main thing, or should be), then as if a crown of praise (if it seems so) victory. Whoever cannot be induced and sufficiently moved by these things, starts from a bad thing, which is beyond that. However, it is different in public games, which have their certain established prizes for the sake of exercise and otherwise commendable and necessary competition, and for the sake of the public good. As for the excess in food and clothing, if the food is too exquisite and redundant, and the clothing too elaborate and expensive, or otherwise excessive, that voluntary excess and sought-after sin is. Otherwise, there is a great difference between money unnecessarily gambled and such (in some part) necessary expense, because the ends differ. Clothes and other adornments are created and made for the purpose and use of being worn by some and worn out: only in excess and beyond what is fitting is there a sin of curiosity, and when the expense exceeds the condition of the person. The same judgment should be made about food, except that its use is more necessary. Money, however, is intended for use, and according to the prescription of the law, to value human affairs, as Aristotle clearly shows in Ethics and Politics. Furthermore, it is necessary that we have some adornment: it is not necessary that we gamble for money, because games and exercise are otherwise exercise in themselves, without money being involved. And while in clothing and food the measure is to be considered according to the differences of persons, not so in games. For it is equally unlawful before God in all things, as far as it could be transferred from all to better and more necessary uses. And because (due to inherent wickedness) we are always inclined to evil, even when we propose piously; yet (unless God is present with His grace) that proposal turns into vice: therefore, when with all the diligence that can be applied no one lives without fault, one should not deliberately seek opportunities for sinning or doing wrong, nor indulge in them, as it is most alien to Christian piety. Therefore, it is not permissible to gamble even a little for the sake of gain, and so that any loss may occur to anyone: for it can be spent on better uses, however small it may be, even a penny. There is no reason why money should be involved, if not for the sake of avarice or certainly for the sake of gain, since a game is a game in itself, even without money being involved, etc. In this way and in almost this sentiment, it is often debated. I am also much moved by the fact that such gain is not approved by any rightly established republic. That some of the scholastics allow it seems to me too meager, not to say foolish, although the more sensible ones entirely disapprove if it is done for the sake of gain, or if the entertainment exceeds, or something like that, from which no harm, but rather much gain arises from mutual association and from that philanthropic love; and since that expense is almost agreed upon beforehand on both sides, as if a fixed sum is to be spent. However, the expense in games is not necessary, and relies on the rashness of fortune. But how civil laws are set against such things, and the right to reclaim what is lost in that way, you know much better. Among us, however, what is gained by archery can be claimed by law, and an action is valid for the victor against the loser, as in contracts which are approved by civil law and our positive law and edicts.</p>
      <p>Now you see my audacity: lest I write nothing to you, I have given these my trifles to your kindness. But yet these light matters, and (as they are estimated by some) ridiculous, sometimes lead to serious and grave matters from the losses given and received, besides other incidents. Indeed, I always judge them to be serious. For whatever is lost in that way (for so I like to call it), however small it may be, could still have been spent on better and more necessary uses. I see daily many inconveniences following from this, but no benefit; which, although they are not inherent in the thing itself (since some do not abuse it so), yet I see these inconveniences almost always follow gambled money, as a shadow follows the body. And thus far about my opinion.</p>
      <p>However, this is the intention: at present, I endure it, but in such a way that I also rebuke it whenever an opportunity presents itself, privately or in conversation with a few, not by publicly preaching. However, once I publicly denounced it from the pulpit during the Christmas season last year; because when we ought to celebrate our most merciful God the Father and rejoice in the Lord (as you know), then especially indulging in all kinds of games and wickedness, they delight themselves and rejoice in evil, and serve the devil above all, from the ancient institution of the Saturnalia, as it seems, which you know better. I am not speaking now of the family in which I am; for there things are not so. But certainly, how it is with you, or in other places, I do not know. Among us, however, commonly throughout the whole region (although not now separately in individual houses), at that time and during those holidays, we abound in the worst and most nefarious examples, most alien to our profession. And the bad custom has grown so much that unless they show themselves cheerful at that time and during these holidays (so they speak), and in that way cheerful, in the worst way possible (or certainly of which they are ashamed during Lent, as it is called), they not only consider themselves lazy and inept for anything, but it is almost a religion to them, unless they behave in some way like that: they think they are cheerful in that way because of the birth of the Lord. This still holds among the common people and the uneducated peasants. However, in our family, there is nothing of the sort, nor anything so greatly indecorous; about which more later. But I have explained the common way throughout almost all of England, except in certain places. And therefore, I show it more fully, because John affirmed that you delight in it. If therefore I seem too verbose, the blame is to be transferred to him, and pardon is to be given to me. To continue, therefore. Courtiers and the better part of the common people (now better instructed by the grace of God), although they clearly understand that it is not their duty to behave in such a way; yet partly because the custom has grown, and lest they seem lazy and not good companions (as they call it), partly and especially (as I judge), because they have not yet progressed to the point where they can perfectly hate the stain of the flesh, nor do they yet feel the sincere fear of God instilled in their minds, so that they have the intention to conquer and crucify themselves, much less do they desire it.</p>
      <p>But to return to the point from which I digressed, and to explain how I reproved my people once in a sermon, and what followed from it: know this. When I had openly blamed the whole kind, and those (but commonly and generally) who gambled for money; I saw it taken in a bad part, because the Duke's family, my lord, does not play among the servants, or certainly in no way gamble for money, as can be known. However, since the Duke himself and his wife with their friends played secretly in the chamber, they thought it was also my duty to admonish them secretly. But listen to the reasoning of my counsel; for that open reproof was not made by me immediately at the beginning, but much later, in the way I will submit, with that consideration and caution. Therefore, when I had done this more often, and seemed to achieve nothing, although they had nothing to contradict (with some reason), and I had warned them that I would eventually openly and clearly reprove them if they played again even in the chamber (provided they gambled for money); otherwise, I would not condemn any game as an exercise of mind and body, but that kind, when they gambled for money (because I saw no suitable reason for that unnecessary expense to be brought by them) I could no longer endure, and after I had predicted many things in the same sentiment; they ceased for a time: at which I rejoiced and was called to great hope. However, afterwards, at the following Christmas, perceiving them beginning to return to their nature; as the occasion allowed, I publicly reproved both the thing itself and the persons, in the way I set above, that is, commonly, with no certain person named or delineated. Then, understanding the mentioned offense arising from it, I have since been silent; only privately and separately, whenever the subject is discussed, reproving. And in this way, I endure and permit (because I do not publicly reprove and in a sermon). However, since they consider me too strict, and with that pretext want to be interpreters for themselves in other things, contrary to what they were accustomed to before, and say, Haddon cannot agree with us in this and that matter, since they are as indifferent as the game which he almost alone reproves; and in that way incline to truly evil: lest (I say) they wander in that way, and fall into evils in no way to be endured; I endure unwillingly, as I explained above; I endure compelled, as one who holds a wolf by the ears. However, I see some fruit from that concession, (which is indeed no concession, but some part of a remission of duty and rather of rigor in duty); because I do not publicly reprove, although I always disapprove in the same way separately and in conversations. However, because they see me conceding to them somewhat even against my opinion, and they think I treat their weakness gently, they are more willing to listen and obey in other matters.</p>
      <p>Now I have explained (perhaps more fully than was fitting given your occupations) both my opinion on the matter itself, and my intention in tolerating it and the manner. I ask you to write to me clearly about this matter, and fully explain your opinion, and what you judge I should follow, what you approve and what less, to what extent, in what way, as it will seem to you; and give advice on how much I should tolerate in such matters, and to what extent you think I should connive. But at your leisure: for I do not wish to interrupt you when occupied with more serious matters. Unless I considered myself in some part from you (as far as a humble man is allowed and as one almost initiated in letters to a most distinguished and learned man and perfect in every kind of erudition); I would not have dared to disturb you, scarcely greeted by me with these three letters, in this way. But let it be as it may: for you yourself are to blame, because you wanted me so. I will certainly dare further, and I ask you to greet for me that most esteemed Mr. Bibliander, whom I also seem to have known from his published books.</p>
      <p>Farewell, two lights of the church. May Christ protect you and be present with His spirit and your ministry.</p>
      <p>In Richmond near London. August, 1552. Your devoted and most observant, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
