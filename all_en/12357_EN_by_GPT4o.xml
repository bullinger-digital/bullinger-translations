    <p xml:id="regest1">Even if Haller might soon come to Zurich, he must inform Bullinger about his situation in due time. So far, he has preached about the Covenant of God and the principal articles of faith and the sacraments of both Testaments, including the Lord's Supper, which greatly angered [Wolfgang] Musculus and his accomplices. Consequently, on December 23, the council summoned all preachers and forbade them any hostility against Haller. Mayor [Hans] Welser accused Musculus of arrogance above all. Musculus then burst into the harshest words and could hardly be restrained by [Michael] Keller and the others. The next day, he submitted a resignation request. What will happen now, Haller does not know. [Johann] Meckart, [Johann] Flinner, and [Johann] Traber, all even greater Lutherans than Musculus, hate Haller only because he is from Zurich. They want him to leave. Haller strives to counteract the discord. On one hand, he is very affected by the ecclesiastical disputes and the hostility directed against him, on the other hand, he feels sorry for the [Augsburg] church deprived of the truth. Everything is aligned according to Bucer's [service] order of 1535 [correct: 1537], which is referred to as Concord. Haller adheres to it, as long as he is allowed to explain it to the people in a pious manner; otherwise, he cannot stay. - Some [...] wrote to the councils of Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] in Frankfurt, stating that a Zurich man had been called [to Augsburg], thereby destroying the church and concord and breaking the [Schmalkaldic] alliance. This was communicated to the [Augsburg] council, which steadfastly accounted for its decision; Haller has read the letter. [The Augsburg councils] also wrote to their Frankfurt envoys, among them Nikolaus [Müller known as] Maier, that they are carefully searching for the informant. Musculus is afraid and therefore considers leaving, but this is not allowed due to the [offense he caused]. - Regarding Haller, nothing has been decided yet. The [Augsburg] pastors complained that Haller had not been introduced to them according to the usual procedure and had not been examined. The council replied that the testimonies Haller brought with him and also Haller's [sermons] made an examination unnecessary, but they were willing to introduce Haller to them. This will probably happen shortly after the holidays. - Haller does not know whether his presence or absence would be better for [Augsburg]. Since the citizens are already partisan, Augsburg will never come to rest and will always be suspected of fanaticism as long as Haller remains. If only the Zurich council had not interfered in Augsburg's affairs, so that the Lord's cause would not fall into disrepute! The [Zurich] should deliberate on this. As long as Luther attacks the Zurichers (allegedly he is writing a treatise against them), Haller cannot be useful to the Augsburg church. - Perhaps [Georg] Frölich will send news. Bullinger's recently arrived letter [No. 2302] was welcome to Haller, but he is concerned about Bullinger's health. He should advise Haller regarding Musculus. - Greetings to Bullinger's family, Gwalther, and [Wolfgang Haller]. - [P.S.:] Georg Frölich wishes Bullinger to congratulate the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] in writing on his victory.</p>

      <p>S. Although I might soon return to you, I cannot refrain from informing you in due time about my affairs. So far, I have preached about the Covenant of God, arranging the topic in such a way that I have addressed the principal articles of religion within it. I have thus come to the sacraments of both Testaments in order.</p>
      <p>After other topics, I also explained the matter of the Lord's Supper simply and purely. This so agitated the adversaries (namely Musculus and his accomplices) that they began to devise astonishing plans against me, and they could not even conceal their virulence.</p>
      <p>Therefore, on the 23rd of this month, all preachers were summoned by the council, and it was gravely forbidden to all of them to manifest any sign of malevolence against me. Mayor Welser delivered a long and very eloquent speech against them. He accused them of arrogance, especially Musculus, and of contention over primacy; this so touched Musculus's sore spot that he could not restrain himself but burst into the most virulent words and could hardly be restrained by Keller and the other brothers. The very next day, he immediately submitted a petition (as they call it) to the council, requesting to be dismissed, and said he had many reasons, both recent and old, which had arisen long ago, and that he was moved by them, saying he could no longer serve this church.</p>
      <p>What will happen, however, I do not know. These events took place today. The other brothers, Meckart, Flinner, and Traber, all entirely Lutheran and more infected by Musculus, hate me so much that nothing surpasses it, at least because I am from Zurich; otherwise, they have nothing to complain about, except perhaps they fear that something will diminish their honors with me present. Therefore, they desire and seek only this, that I should not be received but expelled again. I, who have always been a lover of peace, am doing everything I can here to prevent such great discord from dissolving the church; and I am entirely in doubt about what I should do. On one hand, the discord among the brothers, the offense to the church, the plots, and private dangers torment me; on the other hand, I feel sorry for this church, which has many pious people, and I grieve that it is deprived of the truth and desolate. Bucer prescribed a form, which is called Concord. It was published in 1535, and now everything is being contrived under its protection, whose words (although not all) I accept, provided it is free to interpret them piously to the people (as you rightly advise in your letters); if this is not granted to me, I will never remain. However, some have written to Frankfurt to the councils of the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave, stating that a Zurich man was called here, thereby disturbing the church and concord, breaking the alliance, etc. This was written to our council and reproached them. They respond steadfastly and give reasons for why they did this. For I have read the letters. They also wrote to the envoys they have in Frankfurt (among whom is Mr. Nikolaus Maier), to diligently inquire who spread these things and reported them to the princes, and to inform them in due time. For this reason, Musculus, fearing for himself, is contemplating leaving first, which, however, will not be granted to him because of the offense.</p>
      <p>Nothing has been done with me yet. The brothers complained (because they could not find anything else) that I have not yet been presented, as they call it, nor examined according to their custom. The council replied that they have such and so many testimonies about me that it seemed superfluous to them to examine me; moreover, the whole church can now testify about my faith, learning, and grace given by the Lord. What need is there for further examination? However, to satisfy them, they want me to briefly present myself to them. When this will happen, I do not know yet.</p>
      <p>However, I think it will be shortly after the holidays. Once that is done, I hope my affairs will be concluded. You hear, therefore, most illustrious man, in what great troubles this church is involved, for which I do not know whether my presence or absence would be better. Dissension will never cease with me present, and the citizens, already factious, will follow their own parties.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish that our Zurich magistrate would not involve themselves or their people in these troubles, so that the Lord's cause would not be suspected. For as long as even the name of Zurich remains in Augsburg, this church will be suspected of some kind of fanaticism, and it could be more conveniently built by people of another name. Therefore, I beseech you, ensure that these matters are considered in due time.</p>
      <p>I am ready to act and endure anything for the name of my Lord, provided I build up. But indeed, the name of Zurich will build little in Augsburg, especially with Luther again sharpening his impure pen against us, whom they say has already published or is publishing a rather large book against the Zurichers, which I have not yet seen. However, I will take care to bring copies with me if I can obtain them.</p>
      <p>By this, many will form an unjust suspicion about us. However, the Lord will also bring an end to these things, who must be frequently entreated by us in prayers, so that He does not allow the truth to be suppressed.</p>
      <p>Regarding new matters, Mr. Laetus might write more, as he knows them better than I do. For I am so vexed by these my affairs that I care little for new things, except as they must be cared for by any vigilant pastor. Moreover, your letters recently sent to me were most welcome, except that they reported your adverse health. I sincerely pray to the Lord to restore you to us and preserve you in good health for a long time. For in you lies great hope for the church.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will not cease to pray for you. You rightly advise regarding Musculus. I will do and concede what I can. What I cannot, I will overcome with constancy. Moreover, you will hear more about all matters when I come. I wanted to write this hastily, so you would not be unaware of what is happening with me. To you, most learned and dearest father Bullinger, I commend myself. Commend me to the Lord, that He may raise and strengthen my certainly troubled spirit with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the family, Mr. Rodolph Gwalther, my dearest brother, and others [pious and] learned. Mr. Cellarius, Mr. Bernardinus [Ochino], Bethuleius, and Mr. Laetus greet you, who will write himself. Farewell. December 24, 1545. Augsburg. Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I wrote this, Mr. Laetus advised me to encourage you to write to the Landgrave and congratulate him on his victory, so that he may continue to be inclined and benevolent towards our truth, seeing that his well-being is also a concern for us. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord and father. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
