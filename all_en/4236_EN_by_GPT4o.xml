      <p>This winter, I wrote six books against the Anabaptists, concerning all their sects and doctrines, which I refuted to the best of my abilities granted by the Lord, and demonstrated that our churches are true. I wrote them in the German language; I hope that they will soon be translated into Latin by our Josias. Those who continually count us among the Anabaptists and other sectarians will see how gravely they sin against the truth. Indeed, we understand more and more that our enemies are greatly influencing many by persuading them that we act in many ways with the Anabaptists and are carried away by the Anabaptist spirit. They will see how shamefully they are mistaken. Meanwhile, I wanted to warn the simpler ones not to let themselves be deceived by those talkative Anabaptists.</p>
