      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have nothing to write to you at the moment; nevertheless, I did not want to neglect the opportunity to write, most esteemed lord and godfather. I thank you for writing to us so diligently about everything. I am expecting your letters at any moment through the wife of Mr. Jodocus. Today, the council of deacons was held here. The letters from the people of Basel were read, which indeed reported many sad things, that even the duke and those others who have so far refused the Interim, now accept it, except for the cities of Lindau, Konstanz, and Strasbourg, about which we hear that they are almost in turmoil with internal strife, as some wish to accept it, while others do not. May the Lord grant them pious constancy! I wish that our letters would at least somewhat confirm them, so that we do not seem to be unchristian or unmoved by the nearby evil; for certainly our own situation is at stake, as the wall burns when the neighbor's house is on fire. We must act prudently and cautiously, but also piously, so that faith and Christian charity are not crude. I wish that what is done with you in ZÃ¼rich would also be done here with us, that with such great public persecution imminent, common repentance and prayers would be instituted, so that the whole church would gather, both children and the elderly, and after confessing sins and imploring divine mercy, they would be uplifted by sacred promises and confirmed by the examples of the saints. It could be done conveniently, as there are few sermons here otherwise, and I alone would not be burdened by this work. I have discussed this matter with some; it pleases some, but not others. I also wish to have your advice.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely no remedy for these evils other than the invocation of the divine name and true confession and repentance.</p>
      <p>You wrote to Mr. Eberhard about Musculus. I entrusted the whole matter to him; for while I was anxiously working for him, I almost became suspect to some, indeed, what is more, I incurred the hatred of some, whose judgments I wish were more moderate with sincere constancy. I described to Musculus the condition of our church and indicated what Bucer did here, how he is regarded by us and all the pious; I asked that, since his writings are intricate, and I do not doubt his mind and opinion, he would not hesitate to explain his opinion to me in writing. He did so piously and openly confessed what he thinks about the sacramental matter, and also why he pursued this moderation in his published commentaries on Matthew. He asks, however, that if I think there is even a little suspicion of him being sinister, I should not press his vocation; for it would be most distressing to him if he were seen by anyone as something he is not. And therefore, I indeed insist less, although I would like such a learned man, whom this church indeed needs beyond measure, to be reunited. I implore and beseech you by all that is sacred not to dismiss him; for it is certain that if he remains with you even for a short time, all suspicions here will perish in the meantime, so that eventually, if it seems so to the Lord, he may succeed me at the end of my term of vocation.</p>
      <p>I sent your letters to Calvin. He wrote to me first; I now replied with yours. Our people consider him a rascal (such are the hasty judgments). Many things here I must overlook for the sake of edification. I know indeed how much he wanted to deviate; however, I consider it better to correct brothers with constant gentleness than to condemn and reject them with rash and passionate rage. It is certain that if some knew I wrote even a single letter to him or received any from him, they would immediately draw me into some suspicion. I write this to you, most esteemed father, so that you understand how wounded this church is on both sides and how not insignificant are the labors I endure while striving not to further divide the dissenting parties, but to reconcile them in the very truth with pious moderation. Pray to the Lord to bless this my intention and labor, so that I do not run in vain.</p>
      <p>Today, for the first time, Consul Vadevyler greeted me with an outstretched hand, as he came to sit beside me at a wedding banquet at the same table, yet so reluctantly that, unless such an occasion had arisen, which he could not pass by with any honest reason, he certainly would not have done so yet. Haller, the treasurer of the treasury, shows himself very kind to me; for I press him much in the school matter, as he is the chief schoolmaster. He never fails to remember you most honorably. I have not yet forgotten about Valentin the composer as you advise. Encourage him to wait until I have informed him; for he would come in vain if he did not have a present opportunity. He will offer himself, as I conjecture, shortly with convenience. I wanted to burden you with these matters for the present. You, as you always do, also take these things in good part.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with your wife and all your children, to whom I send my warmest greetings in my name and that of my wife, and to all the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Hopper, Frisius, and all others. Our Mr. Jodocus, Textor, Eberhard, and Nikolaus greet you. Bern, July 25, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
