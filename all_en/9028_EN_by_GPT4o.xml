      <p>Greetings. Most distinguished man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, I received two letters from you on the same day, one written on the 11th and the other on the 12th of September, from which I understood that the news we received from France corresponds with what has also reached you. Therefore, I consider the fact that the Papists are so elated by this monstrous and treacherous massacre of the pious as a sign of the imminent retribution that the Lord will bring upon them. For who among even the most savage nations' wise men would approve of this heinous crime? Thus, we are comforted by Christ's words:</p>
      <p>"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice.</p>
      <p>You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy." It is known from history what punishment followed shortly after the stoning of Zechariah. Meanwhile, these examples remind us to practice repentance and faith through serious and constant invocation. Last Sunday, Dr. Burgoverus found letters at the public inn in Neroberg, delivered by someone unknown to the host, addressed to your humanity, which, as far as I can guess from the handwriting, I judge to be from Durnhofer. I am sending them now with this message, as no other opportunity presented itself sooner. I am also returning Dr. Ursini's letters, for the sharing of which I am most grateful to you. I have neither the material nor the leisure to write more, especially now amidst the noise of the grape harvest and the urgency of the messenger. If your humanity receives anything from France or Belgium, I beg you to share it with us briefly.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. The consuls, Doctors Peyer and Burgoverus, Beatus Leo, Benedict Stocker Junior, and all the ministers individually and collectively, respectfully greet your humanity. I respectfully greet all the Zurich colleagues.</p>
      <p>Written in great haste on the 18th of September in the year of our Lord 1572. Your humanity's most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger Senior, the most faithful leader of the Zurich church, his lord and father in Christ, highly esteemed.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the Zurich church.</p>
