Reports in detail about the triple assault of imperial troops on Saint-Dizier, which ended with heavy losses; the French are raiding up to Epinal; this is reported by Italian soldiers; [Konrad] Pellikan can provide more details. Greetings. Bullinger is already informed about the enterprise of the Duke [Heinrich] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel] against the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck]. The Prince [of Orange, Renatus] of Nassau was killed in the assault [on Saint-Dizier]; his lands fall to Lutherans, namely to Wilhelm of Nassau, who has Erasmus Sarcerius with him, and to Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I recently received two letters from you, enclosed together, in which you abundantly express your feelings towards me. The letter you wrote to Mr. Cousin, I still have at home. However, I am expecting his brother any day now, who will take some books with him, to whom I will give it, so do not worry.</p>
      <p>News about the Emperor's and the French army: The Emperor had a small town named Saint-Dizier stormed, which had been well bombarded beforehand. The soldiers charged but were soon driven away from the walls; for the French had loaded cannons with a ball, in which an iron chain was enclosed; this brought down many soldiers. When they charged again, the soldiers came into a blind trench (hidden trench), where straw and gunpowder were laid, causing a great explosion and many soldiers suffocated, retreated back, and also melted the equipment from the walls, burning many soldiers. And when they thought they had conquered the city, the French released some cattle, previously arranged, so that the soldiers stood in formation up to their waists and had to retreat behind a German mile, leaving their tents, huts, pots, equipment, and whatever else was needed in the water, also abandoning 16 cannons, which the French took.</p>
      <p>The French are also raiding up to Épinal, throwing down goods, whatever they find. I have this from Italian soldiers. The rest Pellicanus can provide.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your wife and the whole family. Basel, August 8, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>You already know what the Duke of Brunswick has attempted against the Bishop of Münster.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Nassau was killed in the assault; the fiefs and feudal lands - for he died without children - were given to the Lutherans, for the Prince Wilhelm of Nassau was given the Low Countries around Leuven as a fief, many cities and villages, who has Erasmus Sarcerius with him; also, a part was ceded to the Duke of Württemberg, bordering Burgundy. What the Emperor intends with this, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
