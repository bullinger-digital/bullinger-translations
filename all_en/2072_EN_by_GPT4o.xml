      <p>Greetings. I finally received those letters which you sent on October 10th.</p>
      <p>You complain in them that you receive none from me; but I have sent many through the son of Mr. Dasypodius, which... I am certain you have received, as I gather from the fact that your master, my singular friend, responded to them, to which I had joined yours. Meanwhile, nothing occurred to me that I should write.</p>
      <p>I repeatedly impress upon you what I hope will be very beneficial: whenever you wish to converse with your father, read the booklet written by my hand and entrusted to you upon your departure. Thus, conduct your studies and life in such a way that I may someday derive pleasure from your learning and piety, and indeed you will have done nothing more pleasing to your mother, who sends her greetings. We are all quite well. After a month, certainly before the Christmas holidays, I will send a gift to your master and his wife through you, provided I receive reliable messengers. If I do not send it before, at least after the festival, but not, as it is usually said, after the festival, I will add it. Your portion will also be sent to you. I urge you to study frugality, piety, and the best things; beware of bad or profane company. Live for yourself and for literature, seek all pleasure in these; for you will someday reap the most abundant fruit and joys, truly full pleasures, from them. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 17, 1553. I await your response to my previous letters. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From this, I will estimate your diligence and commitment to me, if I see upon your return that you can recount and show all and each of the letters written by your father during the entire time you were abroad.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved son. In Strasbourg.</p>
