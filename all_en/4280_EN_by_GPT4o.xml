      <p>Greetings. Many and varied reports are still being circulated about the French tumult.</p>
      <p>Of these, while perhaps not all are true, not all can be false either. It is certain that some of those who attempted to attack the king in the castle of Amiens have been repelled and suppressed; it is also certain that a serious investigation is being conducted into the conspirators, especially their leaders. Our people fear that all these things may be found to have been orchestrated in Geneva and that, for this reason, war may be waged against the Genevans, in which we too might become involved. What they suspect, I do not yet fully know; however, in recent days they have reviewed everything related to the expedition, so that they are prepared to undertake it on any day, at any hour. It is reported that Valence is still held by the conspirators, who have resolved to die bravely there in defense of themselves rather than endure the dreadful punishments of the executioners. It is also reported about a certain minister who was miserably burned for three days before he was finally put to death. Many other things are reported, which I do not know how much I should believe.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we will receive some certain news from Baden; from our side, Mr. Nikolaus von Diesbach and Mr. Hieronymus Emanuel are departing there; Mr. Treasurer Steiger is currently bathing there.</p>
      <p>I am waiting to hear from you if anything from England has been brought to you at this fair. Various rumors are circulating here; some say that the Scots have made peace with the King of the French and recognize him as their king, and that he, in turn, has granted them freedom of religion; others say that Elizabeth of England has married a certain Scottish earl and that both kingdoms have been united under certain conditions. I believe neither as of yet.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write at the moment, except that in the meantime I have read your work against the Anabaptists... with great pleasure and I cannot sufficiently... praise your faith and diligence; it is received with great favor by all, especially the ministers, for whom you have labored usefully; for we still have much of this leaven in many parishes. May the Lord keep you safe with us for a long time for the defense of His truth.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest compater, and always keep me recommended to you. All of ours greet you, especially Musculus, father-in-law, mother, etc., who will soon return to you.</p>
      <p>Also, give greetings to all yours in my name. Bern, May 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>As I was just about to close this, yours are offered to me.</p>
      <p>Having read them and communicated them to Mr. Musculus, I promptly return them to you and give thanks.</p>
      <p>We mourn the death of the most illustrious man, Johannes a Lasco. However, we give thanks to the Lord that the affairs of England and Scotland are safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>I send this through our envoys, who are departing for Baden.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his honorable lord and dearest compater.</p>
