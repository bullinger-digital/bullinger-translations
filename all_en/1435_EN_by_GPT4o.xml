      <p>I have received two letters from you (most learned man), to which I have not responded before, both because at the time the first letters were delivered, I was gravely ill, and because of the innumerable affairs that kept me entirely occupied and almost overwhelmed during the recent assemblies. In them, I saw Mr. Gesner, to whom I promised to provide all the assistance I could, so that he might obtain a privilege from the royal majesty for the second volume; he gave the title of the book and the author's name in writing and I sent it to the court. As soon as I have a response, I will inform both you and him; for I am well-disposed towards you and wish to gratify you in all the ways and means I can.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I understood from your letters your pious affection towards the French and our republic and the reasons you support them, which are certainly not vain or empty, and I pray to our God that He may so increase His church in France that you may rightly favor them even more, for which I do not doubt you (as is your piety) pray without ceasing. As for the common friendship of our king with the most serene king of England, it is certainly great, and I hope, God willing, it will become closer by the day, from which good and pious men promise themselves not a little, and many think that these recent wars can greatly promote this mutual relationship; thus God is accustomed to assist His own in diverse and often unexpected ways. Regarding the book you decided to dedicate to the royal majesty, Vergerius once wrote to me that he would translate it into Italian; which I hope will be beneficial, especially since you handle and pursue your argument with great modesty. As for your writing that you need my assistance, Mr. Schertel, Mirabilis, or some good man, so that when you have finished, you can transmit it to the king's hands, so it is not intercepted by malevolent people, the Lord will then provide, and we will deliberate with His counsel what should be done in this matter, so that everything is done decently and with charity. Moreover, you kindly and most faithfully admonish me, most illustrious man, and not only me but also all the French, to be diligently vigilant, since war has been openly declared against the Emperor, lest the Austrian's poisonous arts sow discord among the allies of the French, which is nothing more to be feared at this time; all his arts, all his plans aim to divide the Swiss from the French under some pretext, so that he can gradually oppress both, about which I have not once but repeatedly warned the royal majesty and did the same among the Swiss in the previous and recent assemblies both publicly and privately.</p>
      <p>For I see that under the pretext of the Council of Trent, he wants to sow discord, which was the reason that at the recent assembly in Baden, I taught what was to be expected from such a council and what it is like, and that the royal majesty desires nothing more than a council, provided it is general, Christian, and free, and I showed reasons why the Council of Trent could not and should not be called such. And unless I thought you had seen my German proposition (since it was given to each legate), I would send it word for word.</p>
      <p>I sent the French version to the king, which I do not doubt he will approve, although he gave no such mandate. I also sent a copy of the letters which, by my advice, he is to write to the Swiss in the next assemblies; however, I do not know whether he will approve of my advice. For I am entirely focused on making the Swiss understand what lies hidden under this Council of Trent and with what cunning arts the Emperor wants to usurp the monarchy and make the hereditary empire for the House of Austria. You certainly rightly advise about the Avignon expedition, at which time, unless the Bernese had allowed the passage of soldiers, which the others were hindering and did not want to give soldiers, corrupted, forgetful of treaties and oaths, the French affairs were in the greatest danger. Yet the Lord regarded France in such a way that without that notable conflict, more than thirty thousand Germans perished.</p>
      <p>And because what has happened once can happen again, especially since in some there is no less corruption of morals, I diligently warned the royal majesty to remember that expedition and to seriously watch out, lest something like that happen; for I suspect the morals of some.</p>
      <p>I also heard the same complaints you wrote would be made against the royal majesty, that he was calling the Turk, that he was overturning the business of the Council of Trent, and that he loved war more than peace. But if it is enough to accuse, no one will be found innocent; the Emperor's cunning is well known.</p>
      <p>What do we have in common with the Turk, what neighborhood, in what do we need his assistance, except that our merchants can sail safely and conduct trade freely and bring goods there? In which no one can rightly blame us.</p>
      <p>Yet with such calumnies, he could achieve something and deceive the simple, if everyone did not know that the Turk occupied the town of Africa or its fief by force, that the Roman king wanted to... strip the kingdom of Hungary, so that he was forced to implore the Turk's help and acknowledge him as lord. Everyone knows that this year he occupied Transylvania with amazing arts, of which the Turk boasts himself as the protector.</p>
      <p>As for the council, I wish the royal majesty had disturbed it and reduced it to smoke.</p>
      <p>As for the opening of a new war, the Emperor's arts are known, who during peace allowed German soldiers to go to the king of England while closing the routes by which they could go to France. Why did he besiege Mirandola, which has been royal for many years, why did he kill four hundred foot soldiers trying to go there through the Duchy of Milan as through friendly soil to the last man? There are countless other causes, some of which I offered to the legates to read in the recent assemblies, which I also think you have seen or have been informed by the Zurich legates. As for your writing that some Cantons had a legate with the Emperor in Augsburg, I can hardly believe it, since Mr. Marrliacus, who was then serving as the royal legate with the Emperor, a certainly good and pious man, wrote nothing. But that they agreed to send to the council and promised to ratify whatever would be decided there, I easily believe, as it is certainly very true. However, having heard my proposition, they dissimulated what they had in their mandates and wanted to refer again to their superiors. We will see what will happen in the next affairs, in which I will not fail in my duty; for the Emperor, as you wisely write, attempts nothing more than to sow discord among the Swiss, between you and the Cantons; for he thinks such discord is very valuable and will be most beneficial to him in preventing the departure of Swiss soldiers to France. About which I will write diligently to the royal majesty and thank you for having such care for the republic and the liberty of France and for having so prudently and anxiously admonished me, and I pray that you continue to do the same as you have begun; for I can now read your letters quite well, although at first glance it was somewhat difficult, yet I could easily grasp the meaning, and you certainly write much better than the most learned and erudite man Simon Grynaeus, whom I gladly recognize and venerate as a teacher, etc. yet I do not remember seeing you with him, and perhaps the one you saw was Morellus; for I never lived in his house; yet he loved me so kindly that he even mentioned me in his death, when I was then in the Diet of Regensburg with the electors, princes, and states of the empire as the royal legate. Yet I have always loved you in your absence and have often wished to greet you. But what has not been done before will be done hereafter, God willing. Farewell and keep me commended in your prayers and to your church. From Solothurn, October 14, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and erudite man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich ecclesiastic, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
