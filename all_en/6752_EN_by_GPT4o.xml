      <p>Favorable, dear sir and trusted friend! The Christian proposal, which you have undertaken at the request of your brother-in-law, my dear lord and old friend Rudolf Gwalther (Waltherus), to bring forward to me for my daughter Anna, I receive with great pleasure and consider it a gracious dispensation of God. Now that your brother-in-law has desired my legitimate daughter Anna, from my first wife Margareta Ehinger, in marriage and I have learned of her inclination, I ask you, as a mediator ordained by God, to reply to your brother-in-law, as far as my consent is concerned, that my wife and I accept the proposal and regard it as a gracious divine arrangement, also trusting that if it leads to the desired goal, our future son-in-law will have joy in our daughter and have nothing to regret; for she has always shown herself obedient and compliant. We therefore have no concern about an amicable agreement regarding the dowry settlement. But since you rightly consider it good that we first agree in writing about this marriage arrangement, I find Mr. Walther's offer of bridal dress, belt, etc., completely sufficient; furthermore, it is reasonable that she should conduct herself in her other clothing and honorable behavior according to his office and will. As a morning gift, it is customary with us to set aside 200 florins for daughters; but since perhaps it does not go so high with... I do not want to demand anything new, but ask to reduce the sum to your custom, even 100 guilders or as it is not burdensome for him. She herself will bring him 400 florins of maternal inheritance, to be paid in two annual installments in cash or "in tangible goods" in Zurich and to be interest-bearing until then; if that seems too long to him, I leave it to him. I would gladly give more, but I must treat my children equally. From my estate, however, after my children on both sides have been provided for their maternal inheritance, she shall be an equal heir, except if I should give something in advance to my sons, as is also reserved for him in relation to his son according to your writing. Whatever else she inherits or otherwise acquires, she shall also bring to him, and he shall provide for her with the property she brings. As for the inheritance of his previous children, it is customary with us that first the children inherit from each other and thereafter the parents inherit the last deceased child; yet we are willing to submit to the inheritance law of the city of Zurich. But as for what he should inherit from her if my daughter should die before him without leaving children, or what she should inherit from him if he should die before her leaving children or grandchildren, he may determine and set it according to fairness, since in his view the third... often brings misunderstanding and a certain one would be better. As in the other case, if she or he should leave children from her, the survivor should take over the inheritance and how the division with the children should be handled, after they have each taken their maternal property in advance, and it should be reserved for them to bequeath more to each other in the future, especially a lodging and some household goods to my daughter, should she become a widow, all this to be included in a marriage contract... he understands best. Therefore, I also let him be asked about it; as soon as it comes to me, I will inform my and my daughter's friends about it, but without delay and hope for a good outcome.</p>
      <p>My wife and children send their regards and wish you all the best from God, as you may also convey to your brother-in-law and the other relatives from me and mine.</p>
      <p>I received your letter through MÃ¶rikofer only on Sunday, April 7, and have sent a tailor from my neighbors with him to receive your answer.</p>
      <p>Dated Monday, April 8, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your humble servant, Thomas Blarer.</p>
      <p>When and where the marriage, if it comes to pass, should be arranged and promised, I leave to you; Winterthur seems most convenient to me, or it could, if he wishes, be completed in Zurich with the investiture, sealing, and mutual promise before the wedding and church attendance, thus saving time and cost. The wedding would not have many... and people on my part.</p>
