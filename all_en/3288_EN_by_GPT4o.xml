      <p>Your remarkable piety towards God (most illustrious prince) and your outstanding Christian merits towards the republic, which are indeed celebrated by many with praises, have become known to us especially through the commendations of the most distinguished man, Matthäus Cognet, and have led us, the ministers who preach the Gospel of Christ in Rhaetia, not to hesitate to approach your highness humbly as supplicants, asking that you graciously take the trouble to understand the essence of our request from the document we present in person. Everyone knows, most illustrious prince, how necessary and customary the relationship between the kings of France and our people has been since the memory of our ancestors. But how cruelly our people have been treated throughout France until now, how no form of punishment has been omitted, and in what danger those who are united with us in thought and will still find themselves, the matter itself (alas) speaks. Hence, the old friendship between the kings of France and our people seems to begin to languish and grow cold.</p>
      <p>For what wonder is it if our people act more leniently, if we, too, the ministers of the Gospel in Rhaetia, abandon the cause of the king, whom we experience with great pain of heart to be so ill-disposed towards our cause? We know indeed by what name some ill-wishers try to defame and render our doctrine odious to the most Christian king. They claim that it is destructive to kingdoms and empires and therefore should be expelled and exterminated from the realms. These and other equally dire things many, in their bitterness of hatred, unjustly fabricate and hurl against us; but experience itself teaches and the writings of our people abundantly testify that our doctrine not only does not overthrow or destroy divinely ordained magistrates but also establishes and confirms them. We do not seek honors, wealth, or kingdoms; we humbly seek shelter and hospitality for the afflicted and poor Christ with the most Christian king of France, and we beseech and implore you, most illustrious prince, by the same Lord Jesus Christ, who is to come to judge the living and the dead, that you, with the authority and favor you possess with the king, do not hesitate to take up the cause of us, indeed of the exiled Christ and the whole church, especially since our doctrine has been so widely disseminated and propagated that it can no longer be destroyed or consumed by sword or fire, which, as it was planted by the blood of martyrs, so it daily flourishes with more fruitful growths by the same blood. France testifies to this, Germany testifies to this, experience itself testifies to this.</p>
      <p>Since nothing has been achieved so far with threats and terrors, it is credible that religious dissensions are to be reconciled and composed not by sword and fire, but according to the prescription of the divine word, whose most secure contempt so far, would that it not be the cause of the greatest calamities, which are threatening not only France but the entire Christian world. Since nothing is more illustrious, nothing more worthy of a prince than to relieve the oppressed, we flee to your help, most illustrious prince, and earnestly beseech you with our prayers and humbly urge you to allow these our humble and pious prayers to become known to the most Christian king as soon as you can, to whom you will commend both us and the church of Christ with all the diligence you can, etc. Your most devoted ministers of the Gospel of Christ preaching in the Three Leagues of Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>I would ask you, reverend father, to correct it, but I fear it may not be conveyed to me again before the duke's arrival. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zürich, his lord and patron. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
