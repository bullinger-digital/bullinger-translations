      <p>I have written to you before. Now know that at this very hour a message comes, how their 9 soldiers came to FÃ¼rstenburg Castle and pretended to help defend the castle, demanding the keys; the provost opposed this; Lord Batt came for the castle; the messenger informed the people of the monastery nearby and called for help. The captain has not yet arrived since that day. The monastery people, a number along with the captain, hurried there. If Lord Batt is in the castle, then the mockery has been made. Is this not force against force? If he is in the castle, then it stands that he will be in it. I think, in 2 days, they will write to the 6 places. This now suddenly at this hour. On Saturday.</p>
      <p>The lord's judge, who knew about the Batt's plan, came to the castle at night, called to the provost: "Lord Provost, I am here in the name of my gracious lord and request to keep the agreement. What I can help mediate, I will do. Do not act against us and keep it so." For they fear that the monastery people will fall upon them with force. Now there is no need for war, etc.</p>
