      <p>Greetings. Regarding my affairs, dearest godfather in the Lord, there is nothing to write at present, except that now at last, after I have presented my Commentaries on the Psalms of David dedicated to our council, I will see whether I can remain here more comfortably and tolerably with an increased stipend in the future, or if no increase is forthcoming, it will be necessary to devise other plans for settling my affairs. Nor do I see what hope there should be afterwards if friends achieve nothing on this occasion.</p>
      <p>My household is still peaceful by the grace of the Lord, except that my wife is increasingly troubled by the pregnancy she is carrying.</p>
      <p>Today I received letters from Wittenberg dated January 10th, in which, however, not a word is written about the affliction of the people of Magdeburg. A certain Matthias Orbazius, a Hungarian, writes to me, who in the year 1548 at the Diet of Augsburg was still a chaplain to King Ferdinand, now a student of sacred literature in Wittenberg, a remarkable conversion: he clung to the court of the king in prosperous times, now, when the entire cause of the truth of Christ seems not only to be declining but also to be in extreme danger, he has joined our side just as Joseph and Nicodemus once openly joined Christ while he hung on the cross, although they had previously concealed their faith out of fear of opposing power.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Magdeburg, the rumor in Augsburg is that they are now completely abandoned by all help, because the army of the lords from Heideck and Mansfeld has been completely dissolved and dispersed.</p>
      <p>This matter has greatly troubled me these days; may the Lord of hosts come to the aid of the afflicted, and where human help ceases, there may the help of the Lord begin. Prepare yourself for the Council of Trent; for nothing is more certain than that if the efforts of the Antichrist succeed to that extent, you will be summoned by your Confederates and called to the council, not to defend the truth, but to hear the sentence of Catholic condemnation. I have here a copy of my Commentaries on the Psalms dedicated to your library; if you know a way it can be sent to you, let me know. Farewell excellently. Greetings to all yours, even the brothers, Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, etc. Bern, February 20, 1551.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] M[usculus], your godfather. Kindly greet in my name Mr. Butler, my dearest friend.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest godfather in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
