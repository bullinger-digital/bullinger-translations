      <p>Greetings. When your messenger was recently here, I was not at home, and before I returned, he had already left. Hence, you are receiving these letters from Mr. Musculus, which I am now sending, later than intended; they should have been sent earlier, but due to my absence, this was neglected. He might write something about the matters in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while those were being written, we received other letters from Augsburg. Wise men write that there is a certain new minister there, an Ubiquitist, who publicly advocates the ubiquity of the body of Christ and condemns all who think differently, shouting that they should be expelled from the empire's borders because they dissent from the Augsburg Confession. The rest either ignore or connive; the people are divided into factions and are greatly troubled by this new doctrine. They also write that many cavalrymen are roaming here and there, sometimes 30, sometimes 40 together, especially towards Nuremberg; neither people nor goods are safe, and no one knows to whom they belong. Regarding the Duke of Savoy, we hear that he is in Nice and has taken the Corsicans into his protection, who, according to the peace terms, should have been returned to the Genoese; but since they did not want to return to them, the Duke of Savoy intervened and took them under his protection, and for this reason, there are some beginnings of war preparations between him and the Genoese. We also now hear from reliable witnesses, which we previously only had from uncertain sources, that he received three hundred thousand crowns in Lyon as his wife's dowry, and that all this money, while being transported down the Rhône, was sunk.</p>
      <p>We have this information from a certain nobleman who has just come from his court. He also reports what I wrote about the Corsicans and the Genoese.</p>
      <p>He also says that he is fortifying a castle in Villefranche. He adds that he is a man greatly devoted to the superstitions of papism and that it recently happened that some mimes, who used to perform with small bottles in front of him, were introduced to him by Count de Challant, who is the master of his court, to recite some comedies in front of him, of which they knew various kinds.</p>
      <p>There they recited some things against the luxury of priests; but the prince interrupted the performance and ordered them to leave his presence. The count excused the act and advised them to perform another play.</p>
      <p>So they returned and performed something with the theme: "All, nothing, something; naught, something, everything." They recited stories of those who, when they wanted to have everything, obtained nothing, and other such things. He was more offended by this performance than the previous one and ordered them to be thrown into chains, and sent inquisitors, as he suspected them of Lutheranism, to examine them on religion, and if they had not excused themselves, they would have barely escaped the most severe punishments. Rumors about the death of Philip are also brought to us from elsewhere; but there is still no one who wants to affirm it for certain. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your wife, children, sons-in-law, friends, and all brothers.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you, especially my father-in-law, Haller, Vischer, Diesbach, etc. Bern, December 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my lord and ever-honored compatriot.</p>
