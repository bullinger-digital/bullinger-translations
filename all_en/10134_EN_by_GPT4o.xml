      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot sufficiently thank your charity for all the benefits bestowed upon me. However, I hope that by some chance, I will be able to repay you, if not entirely, at least in part; in the meantime, please continue to hold me in your commendation as you have always done. There are indeed many things I would most gladly discuss with you in person, which I cannot do in writing, fearing the interception of letters. For recently, I had written to you, but the courier left these letters behind in Mellingen. I am truly glad that there was nothing written in them that I would fear, because I am concerned that the host in Mellingen, Faßbinder, in whose inn the letters were left, does not wish well for either you or me. However, it will soon happen that either you will come to me when you travel towards Bern, or I will come to you in Zürich, where we will then discuss everything to our satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and know that Johannes Sebastian Bestli has been elected as my fellow pastor here. Therefore, our magistrate is sending him these letters, so that he may come to us as soon as he can.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and children for me, Master Leon, Utinger with his wife, Master Heinrich Goldli, Master Vyß, and all who ask about me. And I have not yet forgotten that I am your debtor for the shoes for my wife.</p>
      <p>Given on the twelfth day of June in the year 1532</p>
      <p>Johannes Zehnder</p>
      <p>Always yours.</p>
      <p>To the no less upright than learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic among the people of Zürich, most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
