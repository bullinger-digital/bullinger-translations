    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer has had nothing noteworthy to report for a while; however, Bullinger knows that he would not fail to inform him of any significant news. He knows nothing about the current state [of the negotiations for a possible alliance between Zurich and Constance], but he senses that something is happening. - Regarding Luther's [“Short Confession”], he has heard nothing from the people of Augsburg; yet he knows that all the wise disapprove of it. - May the [clergy of Zurich] be able to realize their plan to send an embassy to the Elector [Johann Frederick I of Saxony] and the [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse! People are already eagerly awaiting the [“True Confession”]. - Blarer has nothing else new to report, as Bullinger is already familiar with the news about the council and [Sultan Suleiman I]. - Blarer has neither seen nor received Osiander's [“Apology”]. - He sends his regards to Bullinger and his family. - [P.S.:] He would like to know why the eleven-year-old Anneli [...] left the [Zurich] glazier Heinrich Haldenstein, with whom she was serving, and returned to [Constance].</p>

      <p>Greetings. During this entire time, I have had no subject worthy of writing to you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger; otherwise, you know well enough how I am not accustomed to neglecting anything that I consider pertains to you and yours.</p>
      <p>As for what is happening between your people and ours, so help me Christ, I am completely ignorant, except that I have a vague sense that something is indeed happening. May our Lord and Savior Christ turn everything for the good.</p>
      <p>I have received nothing from the people of Augsburg regarding Luther's pamphlet, although I often receive letters from there, and from distinguished men at that. However, I know that all sensible people disapprove of it.</p>
      <p>Regarding your hope of sending an envoy to the Elector and Hesse, I pray to the Lord that you are not disappointed; for this endeavor would be well worth the effort and not regrettable.</p>
      <p>Your response is eagerly and impatiently awaited, which I do not doubt will be as it should be, as you would give, not as it would befit Luther to read.</p>
      <p>I have absolutely nothing new beyond the usual about the council and the Turk, which I know you have long been aware of.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Osiander's apology. Each of my friends thinks I receive such writings from others, and thus it often happens that I am the last to come across them, although they are not very commendable nor worthy of spending good hours poorly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger. Stay and remain forever in the old right. Commend us diligently to the Lord with all yours, to whom you will convey my many greetings. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In haste, Constance, February 17, 1545. Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>There is a glazier with you named Heinrich Haldenstein; with him, a girl of 11 years named Anneli was serving. She is from him and has come here. I would like to know why she left him and how she has been.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
