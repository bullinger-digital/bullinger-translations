      <p>Greetings. I received, most illustrious man, both the letters which were indeed very pleasing in themselves and your most learned work (the four books, I mean, On Justification) which is much more pleasing than any other things. Although I have not yet read this work, I am fully convinced that it is of such a kind that both against the fanatical opinions of Theobald and for bringing to light and refuting the doctrine of Osiander, indeed of any others who, through error or ambition, do not think rightly, I and those like me can be rightly instructed. Therefore, I have a double reason to give thanks, first indeed for the letters sent to me, and then for the most useful and especially necessary book for us at this time, which you sent as a gift. Would that in some way I might be able to repay you in kind someday.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death of Servetus, I had not heard anything before I arrived in Frankfurt, where indeed I noticed that many were greatly astonished when they heard that he had been subjected to the ultimate punishment in Geneva, whom it was rumored had been summoned only for heresy. As for me, I do not yet have anything to pronounce, since the book of Johannes Calvin has not yet been fully read by me, leaving me in doubt and completely suspended.</p>
      <p>Our Theobald was wise, namely, who thus followed his conscience, so that by his guidance, after long and much sagacious investigation and hunting through the Italian and German forests, he captured a rich canonry in Mainz; some say that four hundred gold coins accrue to him annually. But I will write more fully another time; for now, being in the noise of unknown people in Frankfurt, I could neither more correctly nor more fully write anything. Farewell, therefore, most illustrious, always happy in Christ.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, 11th day before the calends of April 1554. Yours, Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and serious moderator of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed lord.</p>
