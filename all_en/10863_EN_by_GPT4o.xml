    <p xml:id="regest1">Information about the chaplaincy of Goßau can be obtained by Bullinger from Heinrich Utinger, who has conferred with Erhard Blarer. Hopes that Heinrich Dürst will get the parish of Seegräben or another parish; requests to help him secure a sufficiently endowed parish in any case. Sends further parts of the manuscript for the printed edition of his chronicle and demands the return of the ninth book in its original version.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, regarding your request for information about the chaplaincy of Goßau, you will find all the information I have from Erhard Blarer, as well as complete details from Heinrich Utinger, with whom the aforementioned Erhard has been and discussed the matter; therefore, it is unnecessary for me to trouble you further with my writing, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dear brother, after the parish of Seegräben becomes vacant due to the departure of Heinrich Meßikon, I understand that Heinrich Michel, the servant at Oetwil, is supposed to come there. However, I am concerned that our lords might not be generous with the salary, as it concerns the Rüti Monastery.</p>
      <p>If the good, pious fellow, who has endured poverty with his children for a long time, is once again pushed into a small or poor parish, thereby having his hopes for better prospects taken away, it would truly sadden me. Therefore, I have sent him to you to advise and assist him, considering what you deem least detrimental to the honor of God, beneficial to the church, and advantageous (prosperous, beneficial) for him and his children; I know that I, for my part, would gladly and amicably deserve your help in this matter. Therefore, if you appoint the aforementioned Heinrich there, it is good, only that he should not be placed in new misery with so many children. With this, I commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending you herewith the second book and the beginning of the third of my work; please review them. There are many errors in it, as I have done everything in great haste. The first book is not correct, as you well know; but when it is complete, it will also be sent to you. Please send me my last book, the real one, packed and secured with your seal, etc.</p>
      <p>From Bubikon, the 18th of May, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Stumpf, signed.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and brother.</p>
