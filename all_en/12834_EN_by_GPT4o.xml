    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich is grateful for Bullinger's comforting letter from January 22 [not received] and his advice, especially since he knows that Bullinger would also follow it himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He had hoped in vain that Augsburg would preserve faith and freedom. However, the complacent merchants have advocated for reconciliation with Emperor Charles V both within and outside the council. The authorities have deceived the people with false promises, leading to almost all 300 councilors of the Great Council agreeing to the reconciliation. Frölich, however, has fulfilled his duty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The agreement is shameful! The free exercise of religion was only verbally promised to the people of Augsburg by the imperial councilors and only until a Christian reformation would occur in the German Empire. The concession will not last long!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Furthermore, the city is forced to admit foreign troops to enhance the Emperor's prestige. There is a trick behind this! The [Augsburg negotiators] are trying to prevent this measure. Whether they will succeed remains uncertain. More will be known today or tomorrow. The otherwise compliant population is very dissatisfied and could occupy the city gates upon the arrival of the imperial troops. This would lead to an uprising. Then there would be war not only outside but also within the city!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Frölich cannot report on the other conditions now. Perhaps more on this soon, and verbally.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Although he is in more danger than anyone else, he will take good care of Johannes Haller. Haller intended to return to Zurich. However, on Frölich's and Bullinger's advice, he abandoned this plan, especially since a [move] would be dangerous and a departure inappropriate. For in Augsburg, the preaching of the Gospel cannot be easily abolished, even if it is restricted. May God show how Augsburg can maintain the evangelical truth despite the agreement [with the Emperor]. The reform sought by the Emperor will be in the sense of the Roman Church, and those who do not join it must reckon with a ban. It is important to be vigilant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The Emperor is not dead. When the Augsburg [envoys] paid homage to him on Saturday [January 29] and confessed their guilt for the war, he spoke with them and pardoned them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Frölich thanks for the news about Italy and France! Similar things were heard in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has been forced into disgraceful peace terms that would not have been worse if the Emperor had defeated him! This has also shocked people in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, who was still before Leipzig until January 24, could not capture the city despite heavy bombardment. May God grant him victory, even though Frölich fears for him because of the idolatry practiced in Wittenberg [in the Lord's Supper]! The Elector has enough troops but no money. Except for Dresden, he has taken almost all the land of Duke Maurice of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Landgrave Philip of Hesse does nothing. Perhaps he has a [secret] agreement [with the Emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Frölich must stop.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [Hans Welser], to whom Bullinger dedicated his [commentary on Luke], is a fool!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Hans Vogler the Younger has taken a wife [Maria Grafner] in Lindau without his parents' [Hans the Elder and Appolonia, née Baumgartner] permission. Now Frölich is supposed to help defend this marriage! However, he does not want to support such disobedient behavior nor offend the father. What would Bullinger advise?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Frölich could not read through his letter.</p>

      <p>I received your letter, most esteemed brother, dated January 22, filled with both consolation and advice during these calamities, with the utmost gratitude. I believe you would do the same if you were in my position, as you advise me. Therefore, I gladly embrace your counsel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In recent days, I had great hope for the preservation of religion and freedom, but much of that hope has since diminished. The leaders of our city, namely the complacent merchants, have sought and cried out for nothing but the favor of the Emperor, both in the council and outside of it. Those in charge have soothed the ears of the people with long but false persuasions and have finally drawn them into their opinion, so that almost all the senators of the larger council, nearly 300 in number, have decreed that an agreement must be made with the Emperor. I have diligently fulfilled my duty.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, it is truly shameful to say how the agreement was made. For nothing is provided for religion, except that the Emperor's councilors have promised in bare words that each city is freely permitted its own religion until a Christian and common reformation is made in the kingdom of Germany. Pray, brother, how long will the free power to preach the gospel of Christ remain with us now?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Then (which is also difficult) foreign soldiers must be admitted into our city to enhance only the Emperor's (as they say) authority. I cannot help but fear treachery. Our people are trying to prevent this plan with prayer and reward, but what they will achieve is still uncertain. Our people, indeed numerous and otherwise pliable, murmur greatly, and it is very much to be feared that they themselves, upon the arrival of the imperial soldiers, will occupy the gates and not admit the foreigners, in which case not only will a tumult arise among us (with all the leaders now having defected to the Emperor), but we will have war both outside and at home. Today or tomorrow, we will be more certain about what has been done with the foreign soldiers at the Emperor's court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is no time to write about the remaining conditions now. I hope to communicate some of these matters to you in person before long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Haller's cause is clearly mine. He had decided to leave, but on my advice and your letters, he changed his mind: For it was neither safe nor honorable enough. For although the preaching of the gospel is endangered, it cannot be easily abolished here in a short time. Meanwhile, the Lord, moved by the amendment of our life and the sincere observance of Himself, may show us the way to retain the truth among us, which is completely blocked by our agreement, because the future reformation will certainly be according to the Roman Church, and those who do not follow it will be struck with anathema and finally cut off. Therefore, the more prudent and pious must be vigilant, so that they may provide for themselves in time as things decline. I will take diligent care of Haller in this as in other matters, although I am in more danger than anyone else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Emperor is alive. Our people fell at his knees on the next Saturday, begging pardon for the fault committed in this war, to whom he returned clemency and gave words. Oh my brother, to what have we been reduced?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I thank you for your news from Italy and France. Similar things have also been heard here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Duke of Württemberg has agreed to the most disgraceful conditions, but as befits a tyrant. In chains, he could not have been squeezed more; this has also terrified our people!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Elector of Saxony was still before Leipzig on January 24. He bombarded it heavily but has not yet captured it. He is hopeful that it will not withstand him. Oh, may God grant that righteous prince a true victory, although I greatly fear for him because of the idolatry in Wittenberg. He has enough troops, but the sinews of war are lacking. He has not yet taken Dresden, but almost all of Duke Maurice's land.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Landgrave remains still. It is to be feared that he has an understanding, since he neither attacks nor is attacked.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I cannot write more at this time.</p>

      <p>The one to whom you dedicated your sacred works is a fool.</p>

      <p>Give my greetings to all the good people you know.</p>

      <p>The son of Johannes Vogler has taken a wife in Lindau against the wishes of his parents, as I hear. He asks me to help in confirming the marriage. However, I will do nothing against the will of the father, a very good man, lest I seem to be a patron of disobedience. Yet I would gladly hear your judgment on what I should do.</p>

      <p>Given on February 1, 1547, not reread, etc.</p>
