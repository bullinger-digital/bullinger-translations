      <p> Greetings. Following the advice of our mayor, most prudent and dearest Bullinger, on the stated day, I acted as the herald and advocate of my affairs, so that the entire council of Glarus, moved and confirmed by the testimony of the most holy council of our city, decreed that I have brought forth ample and sufficient testimony of my wealth, reputation, and innocence, which remain unblemished in their eyes, maintaining the inviolable purity of a good man's character. And if anyone should presume to brand me again with this oft-refuted mark of infamy, they would stand as my patrons and defenders in judgment. Thanks be to the highest parent, who has thus far guided me with His hand and rescued me so many times from the jaws of the lion and the dragon. Certain sons of Demetrius of Ephesus were present, who presented to the council, not without a furrowed brow and with grandiloquent words, the magnificence of the virgin's candle. Nor were there lacking some in the senatorial assembly, men of similar ilk, etc. The council responded: the matter is not solely of the council, but of the entire province; when it convenes, whatever is decided by common vote must be upheld, etc. </p>
      <p> The sanctity of the oath remains, as it was imposed, for the proconsul and the colonists of the Werdenberg prefecture, and nothing has been diminished. Therefore, this dark offspring departed with the matter unresolved, indeed sad and murmuring, certainly also dejected in spirit, having experienced the unexpected authority and steadfastness of the council. </p>
      <p> May the Lord increase in His own whatever is holy and honest, and of firm purpose in the matter of both the fatherland and true religion. I have written this to you briefly and swiftly. I thank you for everything, also on behalf of other brothers, with whom I have spoken from your letters about the contentious matters of our land. </p>
      <p> Musculus has departed from Augsburg, immortal God, how I grieve; if he, then where are the others? May the true shepherd, Christ, be present through His Holy Spirit to His sheep, now growling wolves and tearing them apart. What hope is there finally? Unless we repent of our sins, we must perish in a similar manner, etc. </p>
      <p> Farewell perpetually and happily. May it be well with you and the church, the citizens, and all the brothers. </p>
      <p> Written: Schwanden, July 25, 1548. Yours always, Laurentius. </p>
      <p> To the pious, wise, and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the Christian city of Zürich, his beloved lord and good friend and benefactor. Zürich. </p>
