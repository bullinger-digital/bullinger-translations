      <p>S. D. You have indeed greatly advanced with me by your response, most learned and dearest brother Calvin. I now understand you better from this last writing of yours than I have understood you hitherto, as you will see in my response. Nor will you be surprised that I wrote to you so rudely. Today you find learned men, and indeed exceptionally learned men, who change their opinions more often than is beneficial. Not that I think you are such, but because I wanted to hear from you in clear words what I have heard. Otherwise, I have conceived no negative opinion of you. Pardon my rusticity. Nor do I try to defend my own views, except insofar as they are true. Nor do you say they are false, or accuse me of falsehood.</p>
      <p>You say you disagree with us in such a way that you are not at all separated in spirit. Indeed, I do not see why you disagree with us. Having read my response, I hope you will remove all disagreement in this matter. If you disagree with us in other doctrines, I am unaware of it, nor do I think so. I do not hate D. Bucer, and I am moderately grieved by the misfortune of the man. But there is no doubt that he, by his flexibility, has greatly harmed the church of God. May the Lord forgive him, and us for what we sin against him, overcome by our emotions.</p>
      <p>Regarding the letters written by you and others and criticized by the people of Z端rich, I will add nothing, nor will I respond further. May the Lord grant us all hearts in the most sincere love. It is enough for me that you write that you love us sincerely. You may also promise this of us. Let the complaints cease. Let us love each other sincerely and build up the churches.</p>
      <p>Regarding our affairs, I write nothing else now than that they are doing excellently by the grace of God. We are all well here, and there is peace. Would that we might live in such a way as to have it endure.</p>
      <p>The people of Z端rich have not sent any delegation to the King's assembly at Solothurn, both because they are not in the league whose restoration will be discussed, and because some of the league's articles seem to be such that they cannot be accepted by us. The Lord and time, I hope, will continually provide sound counsel. The example of the league of Jehoshaphat made with the house of Ahab terrifies the minds of many, and many are grieved by the bloody persecution of the King against Christians. May the Lord be with His own forever. For the books sent to me as a gift, I give you the greatest thanks. I, in order to deposit at least some token of gratitude with you, sent two decades of sermons through D. Haller, which I hope you have received. I pray that you will consider the small gift kindly. I praise your faith which you have shown in refuting the Interim. The Lord will give you a crown of glory. We give thanks to the Lord. We also thank you for your diligence and labors. I am very pleased with the freedom and zeal in your writing. I am especially pleased with the last two almost entire pages which you added to the refutation of the Bishop of Avranches.</p>
      <p>It is indeed strange if the skin still itches so vigorously, not only rubbed but also torn. I am very surprised by what spirit Brentius is driven to respond to the W端rttemberg princes, that they can publish the Interim and impose the Interemic (or Jeroboamic) religion on their subjects, yet not approve anything in the Interim. For this is the opinion of the most illustrious Prince George, Count of W端rttemberg, who is also very offended by this matter, and for this reason greatly disapproves of Brentius. Let us rather continue to confess the truth clearly and not approve or dissemble if even a little false religion is proposed to us.</p>
      <p>D. Musculus, very dear to me, will remain in Bern, I hope, and will work faithfully in that church. The church of Christ is indeed scattered throughout the whole world, but few remain today who openly retain the name of the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Almost all the German churches (certainly of Upper Germany) have accepted the Interim. Let us pray for them, I beseech you, and let us bring all our strength here in Switzerland so that our churches may be united. Bring all your effort here: we will also do our duty to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, most esteemed man and dearest brother in the Lord. Greet all the brothers, especially D. Gallas, from whom I received an elegant book for which I give great thanks. All the brothers greet you, etc.</p>
