      <p>S. D. I recently shared my advice regarding Mr. Musculus with you, most esteemed sir, in the letters sent to you from KÃ¶nigsberg through him; I prefer that he stays with you in Zurich for another one or two months, both to make his authority and reputation more acceptable to everyone and to wait for a more convenient opportunity. The term of half a year, which is set for my calling, will provide a good opportunity to transfer him here. I had indeed advised that he meet me in Bern; I hoped he could reach the theological profession, which, however, in the meantime, has been assigned to Mr. Eberhard, who would reluctantly accept another position, having left this one, and for this reason, I thought it less advisable for him to come with me now. I am not sparing any effort to have such a man in this church, nor do I despair of success, although it is difficult partly because of the people who are too hostile to foreigners, and partly because of the hatreds and suspicions that this internal contention and discord of a thousand kinds have created. I informed you through my brother that you should remind Rasdorffer to come here as soon as possible if he wants to accept the position; it slipped my mind when I was writing the letters. I would still wish that he does not delay long. Mr. Jodocus and I would like you to recommend him not only to us but also to the magistrate; for we see that this will carry more weight with many. The scholastic function here is now vacant with Eberhard transferred to the public profession. We are uncertain whom to call; for we need an excellent man. I would like Xystus to be called; but he is a Swabian. Some speak of Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>I ask you to also advise us about someone. Indeed, the one from Marburg will come, who has lived there for so many years without his due salary; for he is called by a public courier after we learned from that testimony of Funckius, which you sent to us, where he was.</p>
      <p>However, because we do not doubt that he is also infected with different doctrines, we do not have great hope for him. Furthermore, the position of Hebrew reading is vacant in Lausanne. Zebedeus wrote here, wishing that someone sincere be sent before others intervene for someone who is of their faction. Mr. Jodocus advised about Musculus; but this displeases me; what would he do among the French? I also know that if he did not agree with Zebedeus in every way or had any association with Viret and others, he would immediately be denounced here; these slanders would be stronger than all our testimonies.</p>
      <p>As for what you write to me in secret about printing that booklet against the Interim Decree here, I would indeed provide the utmost trust; but I do not know what to trust about Apiarius. He is contracted, so he cannot compose by himself; if he does it through a foreign servant, I do not know how safe this is. And I also doubt about him, lest he be full of leaks; if you advise, I will try him. I would exceedingly wish this booklet to be published, so that the troubled consciences of many might have some solace; you indeed do a pious and most holy work if you publish it; you act prudently and rightly by publishing it under a concealed name.</p>
      <p>I have long awaited the publication of that booklet, which I saw written in the vernacular language with you, where you compare the individual chapters of Papism and Christianity with each other. It would be most useful now, so that the simpler ones could rightly discern between light and darkness. I ask you not to deprive afflicted and very troubled consciences of such a treasure. You see what the ministers of the belly do, who still want to appear as ministers of Christ, still preach the gospel, how much darkness they cast upon souls, while they excellently claim not to err nor to have erred by accepting the Interim. Indeed, we must go against these, souls must be snatched from the snares that such lost men set for them; we must ensure that no one perishes through our negligence. Therefore, I would greatly wish this booklet to be published. Apiarius has already begun to print the vocabulary and ecclesiastical doctrines.</p>
      <p>What should I write about the people of Constance? If this happened to this church, if it nourished so many hypocrites, what should we hope for from ours? Indeed, I can promise myself nothing better; therefore, I prepare myself and others, as much as I can, for the cross, not rejecting meanwhile a better hope. I hold this judgment about us, I hope and plead for more merciful things from the Lord's mercy.</p>
      <p>We await what will come from the Baden assembly. I fear, I fear, lest the French alliance is finally confirmed; here everything is conducted so secretly that it is hardly possible to discern the truth of the matter. Therefore, I fear lest a snake lies hidden in the grass. We do our duty. There are also not a few still in the magistrate who protest. Haller the treasurer acts strongly in this cause. I wish you would write to him, as I also recently advised and you promised. He will greatly help in the cause of both Musculus and Blaurer; for I would gladly leave here if it were possible to call even those two.</p>
      <p>What certain information you have about Ambrosius, write back, I pray, and what you think should be done in his case. Musculus is less suspected; therefore, his calling could also be more easily obtained. I finally returned to Bern on September 25; I found the schools very corrupt except for the one in Zofingen. A sharp censorship and reformation will be needed.</p>
      <p>I diligently commend to you those who bring these letters to you; they are also recommended to us by Zebedeus.</p>
      <p>They greatly desire to see your church; they asked that I send letters to you through them, so that they might reach your acquaintance with much more convenience. You commend them to the other brothers, whom I wish all to be well and to live most happily in Christ together with all who are in your house. Mr. Jodocus and others greet yours, as do my wife and family. September 28, 1548. Bern.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
