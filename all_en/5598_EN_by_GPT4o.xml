      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Two months have already passed since the assembly in our kingdom was held, and what news there is here, which would be worthy of your ears, I believe will be abundantly explained to you by this noble young man, whom I also wish to commend to your piety.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the magnificent and vigorous Captain of Magdeburg has deliberately written to you, distinguished sir, about the greatness of the family and other honors of this lord.</p>
      <p>However, having been asked, I also wanted to add my own little recommendation, for they are persuaded that my letters to you might be of some importance.</p>
      <p>I have been staying here in Piotrków for a full two months with no other plan than to serve the church of God, especially in eradicating the most pestilential doctrine of these Arians, and so far, by God's grace, everything is going well.</p>
      <p>There were almost ten ministers here from the vicinity, who unanimously condemned this very doctrine with their votes and warned others, both privately and publicly in sermons, to beware of the same plague, with great success.</p>
      <p>The king is now also deliberating on eradicating this very pestilential error and banishing the heresiarchs themselves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, two confessions are handed to me by some men of great renown to be sent to you, and it is reported that this very plague has also erupted in another part of Poland, causing great scandal and harm to those churches.</p>
      <p>However, even there, God is raising up some prudent men, who, as you will easily recognize from their confession when you read it, have conducted themselves very wisely in this crisis.</p>
      <p>But they are in great need of your help and raise their supplicating hands to you, that you may assist them, as much as you can, for the glory of God with your writing.</p>
      <p>They await this from you with the greatest desire.</p>
      <p>To their prayers, I also join my own, do not be burdened, distinguished men, to undertake such a great labor, especially since the matter itself demands it from you.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, reward your labors, amen.</p>
      <p>A certain Lassocius, a great man, under whose auspices Blandrata and Lismaninus declared war on your churches, has now died in this assembly, which has greatly frightened them.</p>
      <p>The Polish nobles have most steadfastly reproached them here in the assembly.</p>
      <p>Our Christopher, I beseech you, send him back to us with the responses as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, comfort and preserve you with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Given in Piotrków in the year 1563, January 23. Stanislaus Stadnicki, servant of Jesus Christ, greetings to your piety.</p>
