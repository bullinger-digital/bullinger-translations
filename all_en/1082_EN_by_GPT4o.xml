      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. I do not cease to trouble you with my unpolished letters, dearest brother. Paulus Blasius recently returned to his paternal home and after a few days, having been seized by the contagion of the plague, passed away.</p>
      <p>Titus, coming home from Zürich, found him sick. He ended his life on the night of St. Martin's Day.</p>
      <p>He incurred a considerable debt in Basel; for this reason, we are sending letters to Master Thomas Grynaeus, so that unexpected expenses do not arise. Therefore, make sure that those letters are delivered quickly to Grynaeus, the master in the Augustinian monastery.</p>
      <p>I entrust the care of my little daughter to you, and if there is anything I need to do, let me know. Titus remains in the paternal home; we are anxious that the plague might seize him as well; for it is not yet completely subdued.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From Chur, November 17, 1550. Lutius Haim, now again elected consul, and Johannes Pontasella send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and special friend.</p>
