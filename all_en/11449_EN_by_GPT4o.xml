    <p xml:id="regest1">Arrived well in Marburg, but did not meet Geldenhauer, who had already departed for Hagenau; through letters of recommendation from Oporin and Westheimer, he gained access to Lonicerus, Eobanus Hessus, and Draconites, and Kaspar Rudolphi also offered him assistance. The cost of living is overall about the same as in Basel; the travel expenses were partially covered by [John] Butler. The lectures are mainly interesting for beginners, while private lessons are too expensive for him; Wittenberg, where Bernese also study, would be more attractive, and the concerns of the Zurichers about this university apply equally to other German places of study. Regarding morals, the scholars here are no role model. Since his means are insufficient, he has asked [Johann Jakob] Ammann to send him money. Some nobles have intercepted Nuremberg money and silver transports without being held accountable. Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse is said to have entered into a second marriage or at least intends to do so; more on this soon. Greetings. Requests to be given a companion for further travels.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Know, most esteemed father, that I have arrived safely and unharmed in Marburg, where I did not find Mr. Geldenhauer; for he had departed for Hagenau the same week I arrived. However, I received letters from Mr. Oporin and Westheimer to Lonicerus, Eobanus Hessus, and Mr. Draconites, who have not yet refused any assistance in my matters. Finally, Kaspar Rudolphi, the professor of dialectics, offers himself entirely to me.</p>
      <p>I have board in the college, where more than seventy gather daily in one hall for meals. Each pays fifteen florins. You know the customs and living conditions of the colleges. However, the less we spend on food, the more we spend on renting a room and bed, so that it is no more expensive to pay 23 florins in Basel. The cost of the journey was indeed heavy for me and would have been unbearable if Mr. Butler had not alleviated it to a large extent, to whom I confess I owe much.</p>
      <p>The lectures here are useful for beginners and new students of letters; however, those who have made some progress in their studies do not find what they seek here.</p>
      <p>There are, however, private and paid lectures that are not to be despised, but poverty prevents me from attending them; and I do not wish to become a supplicant to those whom I know disagree with us.</p>
      <p>If no favorable condition presents itself to me, it certainly seems useless to waste time here. Wittenberg is highly celebrated, and several from Bern have also gone there. However, I know what you fear, although nothing prevents you from fearing the same about Marburg and all other German places. You know what I mean.</p>
      <p>The customs of this region are such that a young man can find an example of temperance among very few, even the most learned. I have never before witnessed such wine indulgence. Moreover, the morals of all are most corrupt.</p>
      <p>You would not discern any difference in this part of Germany between the papists and the professors of evangelical doctrine if you were to conduct a review of morals and life. May God finally correct this for the better.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, dearest father, it is incredible to say how much necessity I am now forced to fear. I have money that will sustain me until the fairs. But then I see that for half a year's sustenance, there is no more than the stipend of one angaria available, which you can judge is far from sufficient for this purpose. Therefore, my father, I earnestly beseech you to take up my cause with Ammann (to whom I have written about this matter), so that they may add something of ours, with which I can honestly provide for my living here. If they are unwilling to help, I ask this, which I see as the last refuge, that you may be pleased to deal with Froschauer to lend some money at the fairs to be repaid after my return. For unless this is done, I will be forced to accept even the most abject condition, which, as you see, would be ridiculous for all of us among such people.</p>
      <p>There are many news here, and I wish there were fewer. Some nobles intercepted a Nuremberg cart carrying thirty thousand florins, which they call Jochamstaler. Another cart loaded with silver was captured these days. Some accomplices of this crime are known, but I see that they face no punishment, indeed only laughter and jokes.</p>
      <p>I would have amazing things to write about the prince of the Chatti: It was widely rumored that he had married a second wife. However, everyone asserts that he was of such a mind, and some who are well-informed about this matter report that the affair is still in doubt. There are some supporters of this deed, whom I would not wish, for they will not do this without causing offense to the gospel. I will write to you about the whole matter, as it is, when I have more certain news. For it is dangerous to commit these things to letters.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother with all the family in my name. Farewell, dearest father.</p>
      <p>In Marburg, from the college, 15th day before the calends of July 1540. I also earnestly ask that you assign me a companion, wherever I may be sent. For to be alone among strangers is not so much unpleasant as it is dangerous.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
