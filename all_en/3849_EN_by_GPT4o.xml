      <p>Greetings. Regarding the matters you wrote to me about on the 20th of this month, I am grateful; but please do not think that I, in any way, or even the king, wish to support crimes or desire the Rhaetians to overlook offenses or be negligent in matters of blood. For I know what the Lord says about this matter and that the ancients judged that a republic is not strong if it does not have the means to act against criminals and the incorrigible, just as they did not consider him good who is not harsh with the wicked. But moderation must be applied in all things, and matters must be handled with great skill; judges must be privately advised and inquired of as to why they delay, for often things are delayed for many not insignificant reasons, and one must not immediately resort to the people, a rash judge, a proud and inconstant lord, and a many-headed beast, nor must everything always be stirred up. You understand with your wisdom what I mean and what I can contribute to this matter.</p>
      <p>You have read among the ancient Romans that the glory of a king was that he wished his freedom to be protected not by the harshness of punishments but by the leniency of laws, and not that he pleased the people with milder penalties.</p>
      <p>But I assure you that the king was displeased that the lord of Cambrai spoke about this matter and ordered that the judgment be left to the discretion of the judges.</p>
      <p>Even I, although there are many things that could move me to intercede for one of those captives, refrained, knowing that those who escape the hands of judges against the law will fall into the hands of God, who is the avenger of innocent blood shed. From Augsburg, some write to me that they have received letters written in Antwerp on the 12th of this month, which indicated that when the magistrate was leading one who was an adversary of the Roman Church to punishment, the people treated all the officials and judges very badly, and the matter was not far from sedition, and because of this, Philip moved from Brussels with ten banners of German soldiers, which he intends to leave there and appoint a commander, not without great damage to the city and merchants. The elected emperor awaits the princes in Augsburg, who are holding private assemblies not far from Frankfurt. They also write from Posen, a city in Poland, that the King of Poland is gravely ill, and because he leaves no heir, they fear that his death may be the cause of great disturbances. It is written to me from Lausanne that Viret, a colleague and deacon, was dismissed by the Bernese senate on the 20th of this month and obtained free leave from that republic, and that the ministers of the classis were detained or had a hand laid upon them. These things will accuse some of blame and stir up various rumors; for the evils of others are thought by the wicked to be their opportunity. I can write nothing about peace among the princes.</p>
      <p>The Lord will incline their hearts to the glory of His name and to those things which He has appointed to do. Greet Mr. Walter and Martyr for me, and remember me and my son. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 24.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Coignet, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
