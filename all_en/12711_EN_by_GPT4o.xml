    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] On the 5th, the delegation led by Johannes Sturm, which is negotiating with France on behalf of the Schmalkaldic League, arrived at the camp. It would be unwise to report in writing on the outcome of their mission. However, it is important for the people of Zurich to understand that the aim is not to seek an offensive military pact with France, but a defensive one: Should the rights and territories of Germany, France, or the Confederates be threatened by Emperor Charles V, there is a commitment to mutual assistance. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] How the Confederates, who are of a different faith, can be convinced to enter into such a treaty will be learned later. There is hope for God's help in this matter. However, Bullinger should already consider this with his friends. On his return journey, Hallwyl will speak more extensively about it. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Duke Maurice of Saxony has declared war on the Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony. He could no longer hide his cunning. Hallwyl sends the councilors of Zurich a copy of Mauriceâ€™s letter of renunciation. May God protect His own from the cunning of this world. </p>

      <p>Beloved lord and friend, on the 5th, the men who were negotiating with France on behalf of the Schmalkaldic League returned to our camp. It is not wise to entrust the entirety of their mission's outcome to writing. However, what I consider important for you to know is this: They are negotiating a defensive, not offensive, alliance in such a way that Germany, France, and the Swiss Confederation shall provide mutual help, counsel, and support to each other for the protection of their lands, people, and freedoms against any tyrannical power.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>How this will be achieved among the Confederates, who are otherwise so divided in matters of religion, will be revealed by Him who knows how to bring about all that He desires. How this will happen, you will learn later. For now, it is enough that you have been warned so much about it, so that you may consider these matters with your trusted friends. However, as little as this is yet known, if the Lord God helps me return home, I will provide further information myself.</p>

      <p>Duke Maurice of Saxony has renounced the Elector. He could no longer conceal his malicious intent. A copy of the renunciation will be found with the councilors. The children of this world act according to their cunning nature everywhere. The time will reveal all these swift intrigues. May the Lord God preserve His own. Dated Giengen in the field camp, the 8th day of November in the year 1546. Hartmann von Hallwyl.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, trusted lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
