      <p>S. I know you are wondering, most esteemed father, what outcome our synod had, in which this matter of ours was discussed and examined in every way. This was the most attended assembly of all, with no less than 70 ministers from Italy and Germany gathered, among whom 6 men of great prudence and learning were joined and added to us by the senate of the Three Leagues as presiding officers. Among them, Mr. Conradin Planta, Mr. Consul Willius, and Mr. Rodolphus von Salis most strongly supported and defended this common cause. Gantner first complained about the injustice done to him and Frell, as he was deposed from the ministry without cause and against all reason, and Frell was expelled, who had always been a lover of peace and had harmed no one, and indeed was not an Anabaptist. Since this insult was directed not only at me but at the senate itself, the senate, being angered, added two others to us as auditors and witnesses of Gantner's slanders, etc. I responded by presenting the history of the matter, in which I briefly declared everything as it had happened. Gantner accused me of lying. But Mr. Consul Willius, Mr. Pontisella, along with two others who were sent in the name of the entire senate, approved my speech with their votes and testified that I had brought nothing but the truth to light. I was also prepared to prove and repeat every word of the recited history, and when Gantner was still entirely defending the Anabaptist, the gentlemen responding for me wonderfully shamed Gantner, so that he was almost caught and condemned by his own words and actions in every single word. After I had elicited the state of the controversy from the history of the matter and confirmed my opinion with arguments that heretics should indeed be punished, Gantner opposed me not with sacred scriptures but with Erasmus, Brentius, and some fathers brought in bad faith. I opposed Erasmus to Erasmus, Brentius to Brentius, fathers to fathers, and briefly exposed the error, since he brought forth such testimonies no differently than the Anabaptists themselves, namely that enemies should be loved, not expelled; that it was said to Peter: [Put your sword away;] that our sacrifices should be voluntary, etc. Since Gantner made no distinctions and mixed the duty of the magistrate with the person, considering the weak as heretics and heretics as the weak, he could easily be refuted by anyone. In summary: he proposed scattered brooms and sand without lime to defend his poorly coherent cause and disgraced himself most shamefully. The case entrusted to the brothers was discussed by them as we left. They were all unanimous that the magistrate should punish heretics, except for Marius, Turrianus, and another Italian minister of the Praegallian church, an unlearned and foolish man. Marius had devoted himself to Gantner with all his might, resisted the entire synod, brought up old histories in which it is not read that heretics were punished until the time of Augustine; he had also maliciously criticized your church, indeed you yourselves, as I will explain more fully elsewhere. That Turrianus was a minister of the Plurian church, which is in Italy, and was found to be a supporter of heretics, Camulius, Sozini, etc.</p>
      <p>The third man, as I said, is foolish and most unlearned, who later did not know what he had thought. But our Silvius also supported and confirmed our votes and had already retracted before. All the others, along with the Rhaetian lords, went with great unanimity to the same opinion and in agreement with our confession, bringing forth many most evident arguments for this our cause. A sentence was passed on Gantner by common vote, 1. that he should retract and confess that he had erred shamefully in defending manifest heretics; 2. that he had opposed the magistrate executing his duty hatefully; 3. that he had deserted his calling so many times; 4. that he had expelled another brother from his position against the command of the lords and the laws of the synod and had invaded it himself; 5. that he should acknowledge that he had unjustly contradicted me and that I had said and done nothing in this cause from the opinion of the entire synod except what befits a pious and faithful minister; therefore, that I am absolved from all blame. With these pronounced, Gantner's spirit and countenance fell, and he became like a dead man, yet he did not want to confess that he had erred, but said he had been misunderstood, and when many urged him to acknowledge his errors and seek forgiveness for his fault, fearing worse, he finally subscribed to the above-written articles with his own hand. The form is as follows: "I, Johannes Gantner, agree to these with mouth and heart, in good Christian faith. May the Lord grant that it may turn to his glory and our renunciation. Amen."</p>
      <p>It should be noted, however, that in the prescribed articles, the decree of the synod was prefixed, in which it is explained with all circumstances that it is the magistrate's duty to restrain heretics with the sword.</p>
      <p>He, along with the other articles, subscribed to this. This sentence was later confirmed by the Three Leagues, and they will insert and defend it in their laws, and no one will be safe in the ministry as a member of the synod who will disapprove of this.</p>
      <p>Since it seemed to many that Gantner had done nothing here from the heart, but had one thing hidden in his breast and another ready on his tongue, a penalty was imposed on him that he should be excluded from the fellowship of the synod for a year and removed from the ministry; he should live privately and peacefully, and if after a year his repentance is sufficiently established to the brothers and the whole church, it will be free for the synod to receive him or not.</p>
      <p>Turrianus also, because he favored the Italian heretics, along with Camulius Nicolaus, who had hitherto supplied the heretics with the most abundant treasury, and also with Camillus Sozini, who were all present and found most disgraceful, were excluded. Camillus was privately affected by the penalty of ejection, and Silvius was also deposed for his audacity.</p>
      <p>All were ready to subscribe, but we thought it should be more severely observed in such rascals, partly to deter others, partly because heretics have this peculiarity of simulating and dissimulating everything, subscribing, denying to denials, affirming to affirmations. Ochino, Blandrata, Laelius, Darius, Castalio were frequently, but disgracefully mentioned here because of certain letters that Camulius, that Italian, had once written from Basel to Turrianus, in which he had commended the heretics and especially Ochino and his execrable dialogues. From these letters, all these wolves were revealed to the brothers of the synod. But with what words I do not find to celebrate the zeal of Mr. Julius of Milan, a most eloquent, pious, and learned man. He greets you all and you especially, most reverend father. He was satisfied in this synod. The Clavenna church certainly triumphs along with Lentulus, a most learned man, who also rendered excellent service to our assembly. In short: our victory was so brilliant that everything answered our wishes, and more was accomplished and obtained than anyone could ever have hoped. Let us therefore give thanks to God, our most holy father, who, looking with a gracious eye upon his churches, so dearly redeemed for the wounds of his son Jesus Christ, refreshes, sustains, purges, and preserves them with the inestimable vigor of his spirit. To him, I commend you, my most esteemed father, entirely with us and us with you. You should know, however, that our Marius was also deposed from the ministry, expelled from the fellowship of the synod, and handed over to the judgment of the magistrates of the Three Leagues, not only because he had most hatefully attacked this common doctrine of ours, but also because he had opposed the magistrate in other political matters beyond sound reason, had slandered you, the republic, and your church, had attempted to disturb and overturn everything, and had also been openly accused in the synod by the president of the Valley of Rhucantia for having allowed the violation of the Sabbath by the peasants, for having slandered the Virgin Mary and denied her virginity after childbirth, and for having uttered many other things unworthy of his office and such a minister.</p>
      <p>Thus we have cleansed our threshing floor. May God grant grace that we may rightly use this our notable victory for his glory and our amendment. Amen. It cannot be said how obliging and benevolent the most numerous senate of the Three Leagues was in confirming these our acts. This very quickly. I beg you, forgive me; for the turmoil had not yet subsided." June 20, 1571.</p>
      <p>The mayors, Pontisella, "who certainly provided me with singular support and vigorous assistance", Campell, "who was entirely devoted to his duty, and together with the brothers of the entire synod, who were not a little cheered and confirmed by the tolerable state of the French churches", send greetings. Chur.</p>
