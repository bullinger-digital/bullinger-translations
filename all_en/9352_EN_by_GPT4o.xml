      <p>Dear lord and brother, my willing service and all good things are always ready for you from me. Knowing that your writing, also the last one in response to my last letter, has reached me well. Thank you once again for your diligence, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I cannot withhold from you out of love, which I bear for you in the Three Leagues and the common fatherland, which you have always felt and found with me, that much and various dealings are being talked about concerning the Three Leagues, which have recently occurred with your unrest, also by those who have heard both sides, those who have been banished or punished, and concerning the whole affair. However, as it has come before the common assembly of the Confederates, I understand well that the writings of the Leagues are unequal and that the Three Leagues are giving a response together, but besides that, the Grey League is not less giving its special response, that it willingly agrees to the right and against it, but cannot be found by the other two Leagues, etc., and that otherwise much is being talked about and advised, and not everyone is pleased with the past dealings, even those who are favorable and loyal to the Leagues. So it has been found that I cannot withhold from you, those who do not want to act simply, do not want to send messengers at their own expense, and since it is felt that their good intentions and honorable, fair inclinations do not prevail among the Leagues, they do not want to take on more of their own.</p>
      <p>However, since some fear that this serves to great division and cause and invasion of foreign people, they have insisted on still negotiating for a League day and sending messengers to it, etc., which also could not be obtained until the new French orator or legate, a sensible, friendly lord, intervened earnestly and excellently admonished the lords of the Confederates not to divide from the Leagues, as from an honorable people, and that they also deserve to be heard and do what is proper and right, etc. And he has earnestly requested that the common messengers of the 13 places be sent up at his expense, etc., which he obtained after a long time, and the embassy is to be sent up in 3 weeks, to negotiate what serves peace and unity, and that neither the prince nor anyone else should hold or take anything of his; that those who are rightfully accused should be rightfully heard according to the power of their League letter, and then those found guilty should be punished, those who can honestly defend themselves should be acquitted. Otherwise, no interference should be made in their freedom, etc.</p>
      <p>Hereupon I am now informed by honorable people that it would be good and necessary to admonish yours that they do not reject anything reasonable and do not always direct themselves to rejection and dishonor so many honorable people and despise so much. For truly I can tell you that there are honorable people who wish you Leaguers well and would also gladly do right and do not point you to anything bad. So there are others who perhaps are of a different mind.</p>
      <p>And I can report to you in truth and secrecy that honorable people are anxious for you, especially since you are not of one mind in all things among yourselves, etc. For there is a strange practice that you are attacked by Spaniards, the prince also shows himself, and then others who despise you, as they reckon, do not take on anything of yours, etc. You understand me well, etc. Now you should not be angry. You are indeed as few as we all are, and our affairs are now in this great distress so tight that it is to be feared that we might not be able to hold out in the field for many days due to provisions. Moreover, it is evident that the common man is impoverished and has little left. So there is more discord and discontent among you than you know yourselves; you would realize it when it is too late.</p>
      <p>And it might soon happen (God forbid), that while we intend to protect our freedom, we would come to it faster than fast, and also come to it for the true religion and be subjected to the apostate seat. I do not doubt that the people who are so vehement see here the great costs that have arisen in these tumults, that they would have been taken, etc. But how, if it is not now not brought in, but one would also come for all property, and not now not punish those we would want, but would have to suffer much more punishment and ruin? And the matter seems very dangerous to me, that it is well to lie for oneself and not to reject the good intentions of good friends so bluntly. I often think in our times of the saying of Augustine against Parmenian: when one sees that an evil deed is so strong that it cannot be punished without the destruction of the church, it is better to postpone it to another time so that the church is not destroyed, etc. Therefore, my admonition and request to you and to other good lords and brothers, whom I know well, that you seek the peace and well-being of the church, that you admonish for unity and that one does not reject the warning, request, and good intention of good friends, that when the messengers come to you, they find modesty and not stubbornness, as you then well know how to act and do. With this, we want to sincerely pray to God that he sends his grace so that it means good and not bad for you and your land. I ask you to share this my writing with my gracious lord mayor Willi and Mr. Ulrich Campell and, if possible, Mr. Hercules von Salis the elder, etc., and greet them from me, etc.</p>
      <p>I would have written this opinion to you last Friday; I have been sick the past day and am still miserable. I have written this with difficulty; but love and care for you have compelled me.</p>
      <p>Understand it from me as your faithful and lover. God be with you and your dear wife, whose illness I truly regret. Your letter, belonging to Mr. Hans Caspar GÃ¶ldly, I have sent to him, still know nothing of the letter you sent to my lord treasurer, have also not yet understood from him that he has received anything from you.</p>
      <p>Given on Sunday, June 14, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours always, H. Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
