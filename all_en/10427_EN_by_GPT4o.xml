      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand, dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I want to let you know that I have good bathing companions from Küssnacht and from St. Gallen, and Mrs. Mürrerin, my closest neighbor, is there and has helped me with this. Dear Master Heinrich, since the cellarer is half from the present and half old and new, as my wife has asked you. Dear Master Heinrich, greet your wife and your mother and Mrs. Wirtzin and all neighbors for me, and kiss Annely on the cheek on behalf of my wife and myself, and lend me my house to be filled, as I want to earn it for you, and we ask and send our Annely to Baden. Dear Master, Mrs. Mürrerin sends you her warmest greetings.</p>
      <p>Given on the next Saturday before Medardus in the year of our Lord 1534.</p>
      <p>Niklaus Wyß</p>
      <p>Your servant at all times.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
