      <p>Greetings. I hear that I have been severely accused by a certain adversary in your presence, most learned Bullinger. However, I earnestly and repeatedly implore you, by the fairness you have demonstrated for many years, not to consider me as the accuser has persuaded you to believe.</p>
      <p>I had loved Castellio in such a way that I did not love his errors, if there were any; the honesty and singular integrity of that man were dear to me, and if any vice was attached to those virtues, as often happens, I entirely detested it. How piously I feel about all the articles of the Christian religion can be testified by the entire assembly of our people there, and especially by my most beloved brother in the Lord, Christoph Tretius, with whom I am accustomed to frequently discuss the state of our churches through letters. However, if you prefer to believe the accuser, who asserts uncertainties as certainties, rather than me, who denies all such fabricated crimes, this is indeed permissible for you, a man of utmost prudence; but I will be greatly aggrieved by the injustice.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned man, and embrace me, who is devoted to you. Geneva, June 27, 1564.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johannes a Lasco. To the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
