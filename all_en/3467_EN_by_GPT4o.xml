      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Bullinger, his most esteemed friend and patron, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings. Fifteen days ago, or even fewer, I wrote to you, most honorable and esteemed Lord Bullinger, and now I have almost nothing to write. However, I am sure it will please you to learn of the happy state of our affairs.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish you to know that I and all my people, including the venerable old man Mr. Travers and Mr. Peter Bergomate, are in excellent health by the grace of God, and it will certainly be most pleasing for us to hear the same from you and yours frequently and continuously. Furthermore, I mentioned to you in my last letters, if I am not mistaken, that the Duke of Alba has been appointed governor of the Duchy of Milan, to govern it. As soon as he arrived in his province, he immediately imposed on every head of a family throughout the duchy the burden of paying two gold crowns, and if any heads of families were wealthier, he reserved the right to increase that levy at his discretion, so that each of them is obliged to pay as it is imposed on them, which has greatly alarmed many. However, they report something even more intolerable about him, namely that, having made peace with the Pope (as they say) the greatest, he promised to persecute the Lutherans in the Duchy of Milan, and therefore I hear that many evangelicals are being sought out and harshly harassed. I also hear that the Duke of Parma is not less diligent in this matter, as he too has made a pact with the Antichrist to persecute the faithful of Christ; for the Antichrist does not rest, but exerts his strength. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord God to assist his own and to strengthen them in true faith and to grant peace to the church sometime and everywhere. In the dominion of the Venetians, I do not understand that there is currently much persecution against the faithful.</p>
      <p>And these things I wanted to inform you of in passing. Here we enjoy a rather peaceful state of affairs, and indeed a certain disease had been prevalent among us, about which I wrote to you before; but now it progresses more slowly, so that we hope it will soon be extinguished. Nevertheless, many people have died from it in our valley.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing about our soldiers who are in France, and we understand just as little about the success of the war. Although it was recently reported that a conflict had occurred in France, as I also informed you; but now the news varies, so we have nothing certain. However, if your kindness has any certain information, I ask that you not hesitate to share it with me. I am expecting your letters daily; for I can hardly believe that my brother Caspar will return from there without bringing your letters with him. From which I hope to learn that you, my son, and your family are in good health.</p>
      <p>I will not cease to pray that you will deign to inform me of the success of the envoys who have been sent to France for the sake of religion, until I have learned the outcome of the embassy. And indeed, I take the long stay of the envoys in France as a good omen; for the king, I think, will not allow them to have stayed so long at court without reward, but will send them home having achieved their desires, and may God grant that I am a true prophet. Farewell, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, the chief glory and ornament of Switzerland, and always keep me recommended to you. The venerable Mr. Travers and Mr. Peter Bergomas send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>I also ask that you convey my greetings to your family members, most distinguished men and my very good friends, as well as to the very reverend old men Mr. Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr Vermigli, and the most excellent man Mr. Rudolf Walther, and also Mr. Johann Frisius. To all of whom I also earnestly wish to be commended.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, most happily always.</p>
      <p>Given at Samaden, January 10, 1558.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you and yours, Friedrich von Salis. To the most honorable and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and patron. To the highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind and dear lord in Zurich.</p>
