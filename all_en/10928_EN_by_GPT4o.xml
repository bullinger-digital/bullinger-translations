Bucer's comments on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in a letter to Grynaeus make Myconius believe in the success of the Concord. A postponement, as desired by Constance, would benefit the opponents. [Jakob Schmid], a brother-in-law of Leo [Jud], has inquired about his health. Recommendation of the letter carriers, [...] from Pfirt and [...] from Staufen. The letter is also intended for Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I believe you have received the letters from [Jakob] Bedrot that I sent.</p>
      <p>Today, the responses from you and the people of Bern have been sent by our lords to Strasbourg with strong hope that the matter will turn out successfully.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Bucer has written here to Grynaeus, from which I see (since everything is so clear) that the concord cannot be hindered except by the wickedness of emotions. May we be (as I certainly hope) as free from these as possible! The aim of the matter seems to be this: Christ is wholly consumed by faith, as faith can consume and as Christ can be consumed by faith. And who would deny that? The question about the unworthy seems easy, as long as the Corinthians are considered, whom Paul calls by this name, and the clause is rightly weighed, which he attaches at the end: "But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."</p>
      <p>Rumor flies that the concord has been made. Indeed, how the good rejoice, even those who have long been outside. However, the papists are grumbling, for they have so far been nourished by our discord. They still hope for something to intervene that will delay the plan. We do not understand this, since the people of Constance have advised your council not to convene the common assembly more quickly than is appropriate; for others must first be consulted. If you can do anything here, respond.</p>
      <p>Today, a man from Alsace, a relative of Leo [Jud], was with me, who diligently inquired about his health. He said he was, I believe, his brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>The letter carriers are noble and pious men, one from Pfirt, the other from Staufen. I say this so that you may receive them as is fitting.</p>
      <p>These should be shared with Bullinger. Vertigo and time have prevented me from writing to both.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, Pellican, and everyone. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 31, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the lords Theodor Bibliander or Bullinger, his brothers in the Lord.</p>
