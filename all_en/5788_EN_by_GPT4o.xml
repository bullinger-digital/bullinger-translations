      <p>S. My Blasius cannot indeed sufficiently praise the acts of kindness you have shown him, especially you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have to give you and others my utmost thanks in my name and his, and I pray that henceforth you will have him and me and all of mine commended to you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he has been appointed by our senate to Lausanne, to take up the profession of the arts there; for this to be fortunate and successful for him and the school, I pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I would have preferred him to be able to stay with us; but since there is no vacancy here and the necessity of that school requires it, I cannot contradict and oppose a legitimate calling.</p>
      <p>He can be of no less service to our republic there than if he were here, and perhaps it will happen that he will be transferred here someday.</p>
      <p>If he can be of any service to you or yours there, as he ought to do, he will also do it willingly.</p>
      <p>As for our Savoyard business, I have understood your advice to be good, prudent, and circumspect; as we have used it so far, we will continue to use it henceforth.</p>
      <p>Regarding the restitution, I could oppose many things to you, and those not to be despised; but I do not want to weary you with these matters, I will leave these to be discussed by those whose role it is to decide on these matters.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the decision of Basel will be received with no less danger than it will be rejected; what will happen, however, I still do not know, we are waiting for the prince's response.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing about the Glarus people, whether they have accepted the proposed conditions or not. We have nothing certain from France.</p>
      <p>There were some of the king's guards here these days, who are said to be from Zurich; from them, since they have set out to you, you will learn what is happening there.</p>
      <p>We also hear nothing about the Council of Trent. As for the French alliance, I do not know what will happen; however, I do not think there will be anyone who will accept it.</p>
      <p>The Genevans passed through here the day before yesterday, who are heading to Baden; what they are going to do, I do not know.</p>
      <p>If our people agree with them, the decision of Basel will not be well advised.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that all things may turn to His glory, the salvation of many, and the safety of our republics. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your letters will not be a disadvantage to you; however, if you absolutely wish, I will return them to you.</p>
      <p>All your friends and brothers greet you, Consul Steiger, the treasurers, Grafenried, Haller, Manuel, Diesbach, and also Wytenbach the elder, who today at lunch, to which he had invited us, entrusted me with this, as well as Musculus and my father-in-law.</p>
      <p>May all of yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 27, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
