      <p>Greetings. The magistrate of Basel has prohibited here all kinds of books in uncommon languages, as I wrote before, even though the same magistrate had given me permission to print everything I wanted in the humanities, except for sacred writings, once through the city scribe and again through Marcus, the preacher at St. Leonhard. Now your Augustine writes of new miseries, that he indeed sold his house, but the paper seller has again seized the price; therefore he begs me to free him once more. To this, I respond that I am willing to take on this debt of the paper seller again and ensure that nothing is demanded from him for this sum, but on the condition that he comes down with his presses and types to work either here or in Strasbourg or in some nearby place where it will be more convenient. If he is willing to do this, he will have all the support I promised before, and more. But if he refuses, I will take another printer and be free from the paper seller's obligation. However, if they do not allow books in the humanities to be printed here, as they promised before, I am in doubt about where I should be. This matter could be done most conveniently in Strasbourg; but I will not have certain security; with you, there will be greater security for my person, but whether it will be allowed by you and your magistrate and by the conveniences of the necessary things for this work, I do not know. I ask you to kindly give advice on what you think I should do in this matter. You will write through this same person, who will return immediately. Farewell. Basel, April 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, F[ranciscus] Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
