Bullinger should pray for peace. Greetings, especially to [Diethelm] and [Jakob] Röist.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Truly, Bullinger, I would be lost if I had anything certain to write to you about the fate of wars, whether ours with the Turk or among our own princes. For quite some time, nothing has been written about these matters by trustworthy people; the rumors vary so much that it is tiresome to remember them. Our people are expecting certain news at any moment, whether an agreement has been reached between the Emperor and the French King, which many dare to affirm after four thousand Swiss Confederates have been slaughtered, about which I do not doubt you have more accurate testimonies there. My friends in Augsburg do not mention any of this in their letters, as they usually write to me only what is verified; if anything is communicated to me, I will make sure you also learn of it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the Lord diligently, that He may deign to grant us His peace here and eternally. Greet your entire household with the preachers of the word of grace and all friends.</p>
      <p>You will lovingly convey my greetings to Lord Röist, your consul, an upright and excellent man, along with his worthy son. All of ours send their greetings to you. Pray for us, my dearest and best brother, and with your frequent and pious intercessions, diligently advocate for us before the Lord, that as all human affairs rush headlong with great force every day, our hope and unbroken trust in the Lord Jesus may continually rise stronger and that His power may be perfectly fulfilled in our weakness. Farewell, my honor, in the Lord. October 30, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his esteemed and dearest Bullinger. Zürich.</p>
