      <p>Greetings. I have read your Decades, most distinguished man, with much pleasure of the mind, partly because I am confident that they will bring no small benefit to the Church of Christ, and partly because they usually provide the most evident example of your divine genius and proven integrity. I cannot help but marvel at your mental dexterity and constancy, that even though you see your holy and immense labors being criticized and received with an unjust mind by the ungrateful and impious day by day, by the grace and long-suffering granted to you divinely, they cannot in any way deter you from your holy purpose. It is indeed a virtue of God that, although you have been incessantly attacked by so many of your rivals, you have continued tirelessly in such pious perseverance in perpetual labor, so that at last you may be allowed to bring the business of Christ to the adopted end. Undoubtedly well taught, that to those who are to fight in this militia, the Lord is both able and willing to grant victory soon enough. Your adversaries have long been forced to concede the victory to you in this theological battle, albeit unwillingly. Therefore, we beseech and implore you, most upright man, that, as you have begun to labor in the vineyard of the Lord without weariness, you do not cease to continue. And although the profane and ungrateful world grants you little praise and fame from it, it is enough to be elevated and celebrated by the commendation of the learned and pious, who are convinced that your writings will bring inestimable fruit to the church. What do we care for the judgment of the impious; praise is only given when good men are extolled by men of sincere mind. To this end, indeed, all our efforts must be directed. You are of great esteem among all upright men and especially with God, which is the greatest, very pleasing. What more could you wish for? An honorable and perpetual name for yourself from your holy labors here, as long as this age endures, and most importantly, in future glory, you have earned the splendor of the firmament, having led many to righteousness. And although I am separated from you in body, my dear Bullinger, I am always with you in spirit, as I read your works day and night, from which I never fail to emerge both more learned and more upright. Believe me, I can in no way better dispel the tedium of this time than when I am accustomed to reading your expositions on the Holy Bible; for the works of others are not so solid, polished, clear, and of this quality as yours are. This is not only my opinion, but countless others with me openly profess this without flattery. All this is said to the end that I may spur you on as you willingly run this course. Use the gifts of the Holy Spirit, as you have done so far, with interest for the benefit of the church, by which action a copious reward is stored up for you with the Lord for your perseverance. There are no new matters with us other than those which, if heard, rather trouble pious ears than gladden them. French treaties are being discussed among us, and everyone talks about largesses, but little effort is made to promote piety, equity, and justice. We, the fellow ministers and brothers, have unanimously and vigorously opposed that French treaty, but we have sown seeds in the sand; Queen Money has won. The world is the world and will always remain impure and its affairs vain and foolish. We have never heard anything good about the Emperor. However, may the Lord, who knows, turn all things to the glory of His name. Now it is right to gather the sails. I have dared to disturb your affairs because I have always used you familiarly; I do not think you will take my conversation in an unjust spirit, as you understand this was done by one who does not vainly hope to be in the number of your chief friends. Farewell well, along with your honorable family. I and all the brothers commend ourselves to you and yours in prayers to the Lord. May the Lord also grant that you may live Nestor's years for the benefit of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus, July 30.</p>
      <p>Laurentius Agricola and all the fellow ministers bid and pray that you and your family may fare well, and we ask that you deign to affix an index to the Decades. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Fridolinus Fonteius, your most observant. Greet in my name Rudolf Gwalther and Conrad Gessner, doctor of medicine, men distinguished in both learning and piety.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of God's word in Zurich, his kind lord and friend, to be delivered.</p>
