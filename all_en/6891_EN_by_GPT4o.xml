      <p>Copies of letters from both Landgrave princes have been sent here, my father, which give hope that the Erfurt assembly will not proceed; may it be so! However, what they add, and we knew well enough, is that it was ensured in Augsburg that foreign churches would not be condemned, since I see it was cleverly done by those who thought they could achieve that we would not intervene (for they know that this primarily hinders their plans), this, I say, does not cheer me much. For I ask, if the doctrine of our churches is condemned, and that under the names of Zwinglianism and Calvinism, and whether through us or through the side of the most illustrious prince, the truth is stabbed, does it not come to the same thing? But let us wait for what the Lord will give, who may make it so that we also feel Him watching over us here!</p>
      <p>I have absolutely nothing new to write about our affairs. In France, the peace of the churches seems to depend on the outcome of the Flemish matters; which is plainly miserable. For certainly I can in no way approve of that course of action; and although the beginnings seem joyful, yet I seem to foresee a very sad and disastrous end, unless the Lord also blesses their imprudence. What was written to you about certain magistrates being killed and the city occupied is fabricated, if what we received two days ago in letters written on the 12th of this month is true, namely that no injury has been done to anyone at all, not even to a priest, no idol has been overthrown by our people; only an innumerable crowd attends the sermons held outside the cities in the open air, and the thirst for hearing the word is incredible. Let us therefore also commend these things to the providence of the Lord. Now I come to the English matter, which was as sad for us to hear as I would have gladly wished it could be that you were free from this great trouble: but what can you do? The miserable brothers seek consolation, counsel, and prayers from those churches by whose love they were once refreshed, and now also hope to be refreshed. Some are rather difficult, I admit; but in such great miseries, it is difficult to keep moderation, and since their aim is the best, I think this importunity should be forgiven. From what you will hear in detail from this our brother, of which he also left a copy here with me, you will learn that the papacy was never expelled from there, but rather transferred to the royal majesty; nor is anything else now being sought than that what had been somewhat restored should be gradually reinstated. I once thought it was only about caps and I don't know what external things; but later I understood the controversy to be far different, and now I see openly, not without incredible pain of mind, which I wish were peculiar and personal to me alone! First, since an external call, preceded by a just examination of doctrine and morals, made not by one person but at least by a gathering of brothers, is as it were the basis and foundation of ecclesiastical ministry, what is more disgraceful, what more immoderate than this license of the bishops, that they enroll at their discretion those not called but who come forward of their own accord; soon approve them as suitable for serving (as they call it) or teaching without assigning any place; and finally, when those ministries are vacant, at their pleasure assign them to whichever churches they please, having handed over a certain price for a schedule and taken an oath on two matters, (one to acknowledge the royal majesty as the supreme head of the Anglican church after Christ; the other to follow the laws of the kingdom and especially that excellent book of reformation and all the rites so that they do not disapprove of anything at all)? If one inquires about ecclesiastical discipline, what is there at last, where, no differently than under the papacy, instead of a legitimately chosen presbytery, they have their deans, chancellors, archdeacons, officials, who at their discretion and as is customary in the civil forum, yet from canon law, pronounce excommunication even for monetary and such kinds of disputes; which sentence is afterwards transmitted to the minister to be read in the church, just as a judge to his apparitor, to be valid for as long as they have settled with the judge? For the manner of absolution is generally the same as that of excommunication. How little are they removed from the law of celibacy, who are prohibited from marrying wives without the express permission of the queen and the bishop and the assent of two certain justices of the peace, and having married, are prohibited from keeping them either in colleges or within the precincts of cathedral churches, as if impure or to avoid scandal? What that not only the revenues of benefices but also the ecclesiastical offices themselves are left to the papists, having only taken an oath to observe the reformation, so that the pious brothers are generally subject to many and unlearned and most hostile enemies of true religion in heart, and are obliged to submit to their jurisdiction?</p>
      <p>What that dispensations for non-residence, plurality of benefices, choice of foods, marriage outside the appointed times, obtaining a benefice even in childhood, and other such things are publicly sold in the metropolitan court, which not even Rome itself has anything more disgraceful and unworthy? What that baptism is permitted to women in the case (as they call it) of necessity? And as if these with some other things no better were not enough, behold! now those few pure gospel teachers are either deposed or even thrown into prisons, unless they swear that they will approve all those things inviolably, so that it is not allowed to contradict either by word or writing, and finally even with square caps, surplices, cassocks, and other such things they resemble the priests of Baal. Nor is this the end of miseries, but it is also expressly provided that whatever the royal majesty, with the advice of even only the Archbishop of Canterbury, wishes to institute, change, or abolish in the church rites, it shall immediately be held firm and valid.</p>
      <p>This is therefore the state of the English churches, very miserable, as it seems to me, and indeed plainly intolerable. However, those few demand a twofold counsel from us: one, by what means the queen and the bishops can finally be admonished of their duty? the other, what they themselves can meanwhile do with a good conscience? As for the former, this evil seems now curable only by God; but yet I think something should be tried rather than allowing such a great building to collapse in complete silence. However, I find a twofold way here; one indeed harsher for us, but much more, as it seems to me, convenient for them; the other indeed milder, but not so expeditious. Your one church, my father, is the one whose authority seems able to move both the queen and those bishops: she indeed, to consider with herself to what extent and in what sense it is said that queens are the nurses of the church; they indeed, that just as Augustus once thought of restoring the republic, so they may finally restore the church oppressed by their ancestors. For as far as this church is concerned, I would have you know that it is so hated by that queen, that for that reason she has not even signified by the slightest word that the gift of my annotations is pleasing to her. The cause of this hatred is twofold: one, that we are considered too severe and rigid, which displeases especially those who fear being reproved; the other, that once, without our knowledge, while Mary was still alive, two booklets were published in the English language, one against the rule of women by Mr. Knox, the other on the right of the magistrate by Mr. Goodman. Both, when we understood what they contained, also displeased us, and therefore were prohibited from being sold. But she nevertheless cherishes the conceived opinion. Therefore, if you judge this cause worthy to be undertaken by us, this would seem the most convenient and most useful way for the brothers, that if not by the authority of your magistrates, at least with their permission or connivance, someone from your assembly be chosen, who going to England for this very cause would seek a remedy for all those evils in person with the queen and the bishops. This would indeed be a heroic deed, worthy of your city and, I think, very pleasing to God, even if it did not succeed entirely according to our wish. The way through France is entirely smooth and short, since from here to the port of Dieppe in Normandy, from where they cross to England with a favorable wind in ten hours, it can be reached very easily in eleven days. Many French churches would be greeted and strengthened along the way. The Admiral and his brother Andelot, both meeting on the journey, would be visited. Nor would it be difficult to obtain one or two brothers from the more learned and prudent as companions of the legation, if necessary, who would join their efforts to your legate. If you judge that we can also do something here, that is, letters from this church, there will be no delay on our part. You know this was the custom of the ancient church, that even those not called would nevertheless hasten to extinguish fires, and many arising tumults were composed in many provinces in this way. Nor do I doubt that this pious and charity-filled legation would be very pleasing to the queen herself and at least to the pious bishops, whom I hear are eagerly seeking a suitable occasion, together with the keeper of the great seal, a sincere and religious man. Many from the nobility also favor it; many from the other orders sigh. It is probable that all these, if they see that their safety is of such great concern to foreign churches, will take courage to press more strongly with the royal majesty until they have persuaded her. The time is also very opportune, as there are assemblies there in which it is certain that all these matters will be discussed. I will also say something more with your good permission, my father. If this plan does not displease you, Mr. Gualther seems in every way so suited to take care of, manage, and accomplish this business, that if you choose him, he would almost seem to be sent there by the very voice of God to refresh the most miserable brothers, and finally to save that kingdom.</p>
      <p>This is the most prompt way, as I indeed judge, and not of such great expense or labor. But if this does not please, I think at least letters should be written gravely and copiously both to the royal majesty and to the bishops, to remind them of their duty and office, especially since you see that they abuse your letters against your will to augment this evil. I had written on this subject to the Bishop of London, of which our brother here will provide you with a copy if necessary. For I had already heard something of these matters, and therefore I preferred to urge the bishops by whom this evil is fostered, rather than to give any advice to the brothers, especially since I did not doubt that this had been done by you. However, if it seems good to you, we will either confirm your letters with our seals affixed or confirm others of the same argument: we do not doubt that you will write what is right and just.</p>
      <p>I come to the second head of this consultation: can the brothers meanwhile with a good conscience persevere in the ministry under these laws? Indeed, neither all those corruptions nor the laws about caps and garments prevent me from exhorting them to persevere, since on the contrary, for this very reason, they ought to be diligent in gradually uprooting all such things from the minds of men and cutting them off with the sword of the divine word. But many things here move me to the contrary, although it is very sad in such desolation, as there is now there, to leave the miserable little sheep to the wolves about to enter. For it is one thing to tolerate certain things which you cannot change, another to resume what has already been removed with certain offense to many. You know, however, that Peter was not for any other reason rebuked by Paul in public, than that he consulted for some weak ones in such a way that he meanwhile overthrew others; nor does this seem to me unlike what we are now discussing. Indeed, I think those legislators have much less to pretext than Peter, not only because it is unjust to compare human traditions with divine institutions, but much more because there was no one who was offended by the received rites; for example, that common bread was used in the supper, that the bread was broken, not a wafer put into the mouth, that there was no genuflection nor signing with the cross, that there was no rising at the name of Jesus, that finally the ministers used a common, yet decent cap and garment. Therefore, the offense for which a remedy is sought is fictitious; whereas on the contrary, the conscience of innumerable people is offended by this change, of whom no account is taken at all, so that they are even deprived of their good pastors because of it. What then should the pastors do here? Moreover, since of those things which are so urged, neglecting those which are chief, many are such that because of the attached opinion of worship still residing in the minds of many, they should rather be abominated than numbered among things indifferent, and which are undoubtedly going to recall the people to the old superstitions; can the ministers themselves with a good conscience bring these back into use? But there is something much more serious than all these. Since the ministers are obliged to excommunicate whomever the bishop or his official pleases and again to consider them absolved; since they are compelled to administer everything in their churches at the nod of others, and, what is most serious of all, are admitted to the ministry of teaching on no other condition than if they swear that they will not oppose that whole reformation, that is, those intolerable corruptions, either in writing or in words; and so that they will hold whatever the queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury please to change, abolish, or add, as firm and valid, - who can undertake this condition with a good conscience? What then? Certainly, they do not desert the churches, who are either ejected, or refuse to obey when they are ordered to destroy themselves and their flocks.</p>
      <p>However, I would very much wish, my father, that all these and other things be first weighed there and your opinion be signified to us, before we write anything about this to them, since there are dangerous abysses on both sides. If, however, any middle counsel can be found here, it is perhaps of this kind, that those who are already ejected should seek a hearing at the next assemblies; having obtained which, they should most humbly show that they are not rebels, but rather preferred to withdraw for a time because of conscience, than to stir up disturbances; and then reverently and calmly show what evils will follow from this. If the matter turns out well, they will praise the Lord: if not, they should shake off the dust of their feet. For, as I said, with what conscience they can bind themselves by that oath, we indeed do not see. However, those who still remain in the ministry, I would advise them to persevere in the ministry, having made a modest protestation before the bishop, and having diligently warned the people not to take these things to superstition, until the matter is decided in the assemblies. If the decision is tolerable, they will continue in their office as long as they can; but if the bishops continue to act badly or to assent to those acting badly, then I would advise them to rebuke those worthy of rebuke strongly, and rather prepare themselves for the cross, than either act against their duty or desert the ministry.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to say about these very troublesome matters. I wish indeed I could perform my private ministry in such a way that anyone else would take care of these things! For I am not unaware of the suspicion I have long labored under among those who know me little. But I will defend myself with the testimony of my conscience, and with God's favor, I will continue to help the brothers, if not with counsel, which I wish no one ever required, at least with prayers. I anxiously await your response. Farewell, my father. May the Lord Jesus keep you, if ever, necessary to many churches, and bless you more and more. I would like you to diligently greet all the brothers and colleagues in my name and in the name of our whole assembly. Farewell again. Geneva, September 3. Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>Behold! At this moment we receive letters from Lyon, which indicate that having received letters sent by couriers from Antwerp dated August 23 and 27, a tumult started by some boys against a certain priest has flared up to the point that all idols have been overthrown there and the mass abolished, yet no one has been killed except that one priest. Thus the city is now held by our people, if indeed these are our people, occupied. These are, unless I am a false prophet, the beginnings of such great evils as we have not yet seen. May the Lord have mercy on His own!</p>
