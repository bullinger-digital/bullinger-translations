      <p>S. D. Three days ago, I wrote a few lines through that Pole, so that he would not come to you empty-handed; perhaps he did not return to you. Here is what happened with him in brief:</p>
      <p>So often have foreigners shamefully and outrageously imposed upon us that they do not receive favor unless they are well known. Furthermore, we have (praise be to God) a great abundance of students and ministers, so there is no need to admit foreigners when our own are displaced from their positions. As for beneficence, our people prefer to exercise it towards their own, whom they know, rather than towards strangers, especially since we do not have such great resources that we can assist all our own. Therefore, he was given two gold coins and dismissed. We have an enormous crowd of poor people; I do not think there has been such a calamity in 40 years. We fear worse because some have no moderation in drinking; many knowingly and willingly perish in luxury.</p>
      <p>But this is now almost common everywhere on earth. I await what you know should be sent back, brother. What should I say about Heinrich Pantaleon?</p>
      <p>He has counted the excellent man, Mr. Christoph Schappeler, the minister of God's word among the people of St. Gallen, among the worst disturbers of the republic, MÃ¼nzer and Stork, and has attributed to him horrendous but most false things, which every good person in that church bears with great indignation. But I hope Mr. Bibliander can successfully quell this fire.</p>
      <p>I strongly disapprove of the imprudence and thoughtlessness of some of the younger ones. Furthermore, it is unworthy for a minister of the Swiss church to accuse another minister of the same church of such a serious matter. If someone does not know who the people are, he should ask or remain silent. He is an old, learned, and pious man; he also participated in the first disputations of the Zurich church; he has always been faithful to the Lord and the church and has had no dealings with the seditious. Now indeed, this is the gratitude he receives from Pantaleon, that in a book printed in Switzerland, a minister of the Swiss church is slandered. Certainly, Dares would have struck Entellus, if good men were not striving to extinguish the fire. Mr. Vadianus is very angry about this most unworthy matter; but we, as much as we can, are calming those disturbances.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Zurich, October 24, 1550. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
