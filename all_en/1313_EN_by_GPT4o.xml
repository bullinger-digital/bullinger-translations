      <p>Greetings. After I published my Fifth Decade and freed myself from the pressure of the press, I wrote to you, esteemed lord and brother in the Lord, and also sent a copy of my Decade. Later, I wrote again in the month of March and once more in April, and in May I entrusted letters to a certain Flemish man named Johann, who called himself Utenhove, and at the same time, writing to our friend Gast, I instructed him to have shared letters with you. But if you have written even once since that time, I am unaware. I know that you were gravely ill; but even then I wrote consolatory letters. Meanwhile, since you have recovered, I am quite sure that you have not lacked the leisure to write.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I write to you again, greet you, and wish to know the state of your affairs. We are well here, except that there is a great abundance of poor people and a scarcity of all things. The Lord punishes our unrestrained indulgence in the world. Many predict that a very serious war will arise; if a plague accompanies it, we will have a scourge prepared worthy of three scorpions, whose lashes will be inflicted most severely. May the Lord preserve His church in these tribulations. Farewell. Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
