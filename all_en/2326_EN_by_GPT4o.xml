      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus! That paternal benevolence and kindness of yours, which you have shown to me since I came as an exile from my native soil to these regions for the sake of religion, has alleviated the pain of leaving my homeland and given me the courage to bear the cross of Christ. It has also greatly benefited many other Englishmen, and I cannot doubt your perseverance towards us, because I seem to see not our merits, but your piety in your perpetual benefits towards us. When I recently received a booklet and letters from you, in which I may daily read and hear the words and voice of my most revered father in Christ, I judged myself to be well reminded and incited to diligently pursue and advance in that paternal piety and doctrine of yours as a son. And certainly, that booklet seems worthy not only to me alone but to many other pious and learned individuals, to be translated into more languages, and this courier, Pierre Tonvillan, has translated it into the French language and left it here to be printed, having been called from here to Poland to promote the evangelical cause there. And since I found him to be learned, pious, and honest in familiar association, I gladly gave him my letters to you, by which he also hopes to become more known and pleasing to you; may this hope not deceive him, you will care for all such people according to your piety. If our Spenser has not returned, I hope Mr. Johannes von Ulm will ensure that your notes on the minor prophets, or any other writings you have entrusted to him for me, are copied; for desiring nothing more than such writings of yours, I diligently urged Mr. Johannes von Ulm through letters to lend his efforts to this matter for me, and I hope he will do so faithfully. From England, we have recently received nothing except that the cruel persecution continues or rather increases. May God have mercy on us and, by sending the power of the spirit, send forth such workers into His harvest, who will drive out the foxes from His vineyard, England!</p>
      <p>Please greet your wife and the rest of your family in my name, to whom I always wish the best in Christ. May the Lord preserve you for us and the church of Christ for a long time. Farewell. Geneva, June 28.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted son in Christ, Thomas Lever.</p>
      <p>To the most revered father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
