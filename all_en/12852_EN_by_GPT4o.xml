    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If only the peace between Augsburg and Emperor Charles V were aligned with God's favor! Indeed, Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, promised the people of Augsburg the free exercise of their religion until a general reformation in the empire, but one can well imagine what will come of it, and what it means to now have to submit to the imperial jurisdiction!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Haller and the other Zurich pastors in Augsburg [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] need not fear violent attacks. In the event of a surrender of the Gospel, they will be sent back to Zurich safely. Meyer and Schwyzer, however, will depart as soon as the cold subsides. The Augsburg council is writing about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should ensure that Francesco Stancaro receives support. Frölich believes he has already recommended him to Bullinger. Stancaro is seeking a position in Basel due to the dire conditions in Augsburg. He is an excellent, linguistically skilled theologian and has written a book on the Lord's Supper, in which he allegedly shares the same view as Bullinger in his treatise on the same subject [„De sacramentis“].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Perhaps Rudolf Gwalther can interpret two dreams that Frölich had in the last two nights. In the first dream, he found himself in Leipzig among students when he suddenly approached armed students fearlessly, who were guarding the university area. The latter were astonished that he dared to do this, as the other students advised him against it. One of the guards recognized him as a colleague and scholar. Thus, he was invited to their regular table for the evening, which he accepted. After bidding them farewell, he repeatedly ended up in alleys full of excrement, so that he had to return completely soiled to the armed students. They cleaned him with grass and herbs. And then he woke up.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In the second dream, his belt was half gnawed by mice. Since he did not know if it would break, he tightened it with both hands; yet it was strong enough. Like Daniel, Gwalther or Konrad Gessner should now interpret these dreams!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Apologies for these trifles! Frölich usually pays no attention to his dreams, but these apparently have something to do with his difficult situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Hans Vogler the Younger and his bride [Maria Grafner] from St. Gallen or more precisely from Lindau, where she grew up, will marry tomorrow. Frölich would not join the wedding if he were not invited. He will therefore attend the church service. He has long since reprimanded this disobedient son to his father [Hans Vogler the Elder] because of this marriage.</p>

      <p>We have reconciled with the Emperor. Therefore, we have peace, if only it were the peace that the Lord desires. According to the promise of Lord Granvelle, our religion will remain intact until a common reformation in the empire. We will have to obey the administration of justice that the Emperor will establish. Draw your own conclusions from this!</p>

      <p>The affairs of Lord Haller and the other Zurichers are well. They will not easily be subjected to violence. However, when it comes to the point where the Gospel must be renounced here, your people will be easily and safely dismissed. Lord Laurentius Agricola and Rudolf will return to you shortly after the cold has subsided, as it is written to your esteemed council.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have recommended, if I am not mistaken, to you a certain learned and pious man, Lord Franciscus Stancarus, an Italian. Due to plots and unrest, he has moved to Basel to seek a position there. He is a sincere and incomparable theologian, very knowledgeable in three languages. He has written a book on the sacraments in the Italian language, and as far as I have understood from his account, it is very similar to your book on the same subject. If you can help the man through others, so that he does not suffer from hunger, you will do what you know, etc.</p>

      <p>In the past two nights, I had two dreams after midnight, which I wish Lord Rudolf Gwalther to interpret for me. I seemed to be in Leipzig among students, some of whom were standing guard armed at the thresholds of the gymnasium. When I approached them, they marveled at my audacity, why I was present when others avoided them. However, I was not afraid. Then one of them said: "Leave him, he is one of us, he is well-versed in letters," and they extended their hands to me, asking me to be their guest that evening. But I said: "I will be with you in time; now I must leave," etc. And when I wanted to leave, wishing to cross wide roads and streets, I always ended up in alleys where everything was so filled with human excrement that I could not leave without being soiled. And when I returned, stained and stinking, to some students, they pitied me and pulled out grass and herbs to clean me, and while they were cleaning me, I woke up.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The next and another dream was: It seemed that a certain belt of mine was gnawed by mice up to half, so that I doubted whether it would break when worn. Therefore, I stretched the belt with both hands as strongly as I could and found that it still had enough strength, etc. Tell me, Daniel, Rudolf, or Gessner, what these dreams mean!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You, my venerable Bullinger, forgive these trifles. I am less superstitious than anyone else and do not care about dreams. But these certainly foreshadow difficulties in my affairs.</p>

      <p>Farewell with the sacred choir of the Muses. February 8, 1547. Yours, G. Laetus, etc.</p>

      <p>The son of Lord Johannes Vogler is to celebrate his wedding tomorrow with his bride from St. Gallen, or wherever she is from. I did not want to attend his betrothal otherwise. However, I will be present at the church ceremony upon request. I have long since reprimanded him as disobedient to his excellent father (Ungehorsamer).</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the Christian faithful leader of the church in Zurich, my particularly dear lord and brother, in Zurich.</p>
