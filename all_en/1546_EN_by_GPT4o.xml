      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I commend to your kindness Mr. Johannes Thomas Hausser, envoy and citizen of Magdeburg; for what reason he has been sent, you will learn from him. Furthermore, he will tell you astonishing things about that very serious siege, which they endured for three years. These are people worthy of assistance from all who love the gospel of Christ, whether through generosity or some other means. He has been recommended to me by the brothers in Frankfurt, who have sent him off with honor.</p>
      <p>I would have sent you the dialogue of the Council of Trent, if this pious man could have conveniently carried the booklet with him; or you have already received the book from Oporinus; for he sent several copies to Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Maurician army still lingers in Thuringia, and the bishops are in great fear and do not know where to turn; they weary the Emperor with prayers and letters and receive no response. The landsknechts treat the priests cruelly, removing the testicles of some, blinding others, and cutting off hands; they set cruel examples against the papists; how long they will continue to act with impunity is unknown. It is said that their pay was recently counted out to them in French gold.</p>
      <p>They have as captains the very brutal Prince Albert of Mecklenburg, RÃ¼ckgradt, Rhingraff, and Mr. von Heideck, and I do not know who else. What if this army were to defect to the French or, under the pretext, invade the French with the Luxembourgish soldiers?</p>
      <p>The Emperor acts cunningly in all things and with hidden betrayals. When was Peter Martyr's booklet on the Eucharist completed?</p>
      <p>I also ask you to send me the response sent to the Genevans regarding the articles of the captive Hieronymus; I will faithfully return it and through the next courier.</p>
      <p>The Danes are in great preparation; the king is enlisting knights everywhere, but against whom he will move his army is still unknown. Either he is starting a new war, or he will trouble the Emperor, or he will aid the French. Farewell. Basel, January 25, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
