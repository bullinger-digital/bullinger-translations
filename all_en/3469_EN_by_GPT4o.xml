      <p>S. I received your letter, dear brother, which you sent through the boy Abraham.</p>
      <p>As soon as I understood it to also concern my fellow ministers and brothers, I faithfully read it aloud to them when they were gathered in assembly. They listened kindly, and we all marveled at how you presented the matter of such great importance, so that we could neither understand its beginning nor its end. We hear that some good men hope for a future colloquy or assembly, in which they also hope our churches will be given a place, and that we will be heard and joined with them in the same bond of Christian agreement without compromising the truth. Therefore, they wish to be informed of our willingness, whether, if such an assembly is ever announced and we are invited to appear with other Swiss ministers, we would be willing to attend. However, it seemed to us here that above all, it should be considered where and when, for what purpose, and with whom we should meet and converse. And while these things are being considered, nevertheless, everything should be weighed and conducted prudently and gravely, and also considered beforehand with our other brothers throughout Switzerland, because the salvation of souls is at stake here, and above all, the glory of God and the safety of His word and the church of Christ, peace and tranquility. We are not yet convinced that the desired agreement can be obtained or achieved through assemblies, colloquies, or conventions. To cite examples and experiences here would be too lengthy and even troublesome.</p>
      <p>Regarding the purpose and the interlocutors, we will mention only a few things. If we are to be invited to an assembly or convention or colloquy, we will certainly be invited for a specific purpose, such as to explain the doctrines, rites, and discipline of our churches, or at least those in which we seem to differ from others. But this seems superfluous, since this matter has already been so extensively explained over so many years, in so many confessions and books, that nothing can be added to it by a living voice. Or certainly, we will be called to change the doctrine and rites of our churches; but this will not be our duty nor will it pertain to the safety and tranquility of our churches, indeed we must not deviate even a hair's breadth from the confessed truth and useful rites for the sake of those men. Or we will be invited to express certain words and opinions more conveniently and gently. But to what end should ministers of truth concede from certainties to uncertainties, from the clear to the obscure, from the eloquent to the ambiguous, and express things in words other than what you believe or hold in your mind? Finally, to present ambiguous and slippery expressions to the present age and posterity as a scandal, into which they might stumble and quarrel among themselves? Or we will be called to condemn ourselves and our predecessors in doctrines and rites, but to accept, not so much in words as in the sense and interpretation of the Augsburg Confession, and to subscribe to those who have hitherto opposed our doctrine and our churches, that is, those to whom the Lord has willed us to minister. Here, we especially wish to know from you, and then from our other brothers and fellow ministers who proclaim the gospel with you in Basel, whether you will do this? The Basel church is counted among the Swiss churches. The blessed memory of pious and learned men Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius preached the gospel here. In the disputations held in Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Baden, and in books published in both languages and confessions, they professed their faith, which they declared and defended especially in the matter of the Lord's Supper, not to mention that the most honorable Basel Senate published a confession of faith in the year of our Lord 1534. Here, I say, we wish to know from you, dearest brother, whether, if we are called to a synod from the Swiss churches, you and your fellow ministers, our brothers, will be willing to confess and defend with us this doctrine of Christ, indeed, but proposed by Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and our predecessors. For it seems especially necessary that, before we descend into the arena with others, we first agree excellently among ourselves, lest we be torn apart among our own antagonists to the ruin of the churches entrusted to us. Do not take it amiss that we wish to know this matter, which is now especially necessary to know, especially if a conference should be held, and we wish to know this indeed for the salvation and good of us all. Furthermore, we do not yet see clearly who our interlocutors will be.</p>
      <p>But we certainly know that our brothers, whom they call Lutherans, are endowed with different dispositions and manners. For there are some more fierce and untamed disputants, and there are others more kind and who give many great hope that we may agree through colloquy. The former are the brothers from Jena, Magdeburg, and those who from the beginning of the Worms colloquy harshly disputed with Philip and left all their fellow ministers and departed.</p>
      <p>The latter are Philipp Melanchthon himself, Johannes Brenz, Johannes Pistorius, Jacob Andreae, and the other signatories. But if we are to converse with these or those or with both, we will converse with those who not only once, but even now, have condemned us and our churches. For concerning those more fierce ones, Melanchthon himself wrote to me in these words on October 5: "When our colleagues could not persuade us to approve the condemnation of your churches, they separated from us and privately presented it to the judge Julius, from whom they requested that it be publicly recited in the assembly.</p>
      <p>But the judge's moderation was such that he did not want it recited in the assembly. After that, they departed from here.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, we doubt whether the begun colloquy will proceed. Whatever the outcome, I hope wise men will not disapprove of our conduct, that we did not want to immediately confirm the idols and murders of the popes without the matter being disputed or explained." Thus he wrote.</p>
      <p>However, the same man who wrote this to me and initially behaved well and did not want to condemn us and our churches, for some reason changed his mind with his colleagues within a few days. For on October 21, he himself presented a protestation to the president Julius, in which he condemned Zwingli by name. Those more fierce Saxons condemned Zwingli along with Osiander, Schwenckfeld, the Anabaptists, and I don't know who else. All these were spared by the more moderate ones; only Zwingli was deemed worthy to be condemned before all the imperial legates.</p>
      <p>But there is no doubt that your Oecolampadius and our churches are condemned in him. If you ask for the words of the protestation, here they are (you may have seen the whole protestation): "Neither our churches nor we approve or embrace Zwingli's doctrine or any opinions contrary to our confession, and it is known that our refutations exist." Thus they confirm and offer to be read the books published against us and ours in this controversy as if anew.</p>
      <p>Also: "We have often responded that we embrace the confession presented at Augsburg and no other kind of doctrine" etc. Who can deny that these are very serious and not to be ignored prejudices against our churches and us? Who would believe that these come from those who wish our churches and us to remain unharmed? And if we are to meet in a convention for a colloquy with them and us, would it not be fair for such prejudices to be removed before we meet? Do you think it possible to hope that they can be removed? We frankly confess that we have no hope here; for the protestation of each individual, signed with their own hands, was legitimately presented to the president Julius and accepted and kept by him, to be presented before the king and all the imperial orders or states at the next imperial diet. Will we think that all those Protestant interlocutors will be so vain and frivolous as to undo what they have finally agreed upon with great expense for the sake of the empire and to make themselves commendable to the king? Meanwhile, they could not have gratified the empire and the adversaries more, nor given themselves and theirs more harm. But with that prejudice not removed, will you advise us to come into a colloquy with those who have clearly demonstrated what they think of us and how we appear to them? Moreover, there is another thing: those same more moderate ones and our friends, with whom perhaps we should come to an agreement, before they left Worms, wrote a consensus, which you have now sent in German, but we received long ago in Latin.</p>
      <p>In it, they clearly profess and say: "We firmly profess to embrace the prophetic and apostolic writings and symbols and neither to depart from nor to be about to depart from our confession presented at Augsburg in the year of our Lord 1530, nor to change the doctrine of that confession nor to be about to change it, and to reject doctrines contrary to it" etc. It does not seem enough for them to say this once, unless they repeat and emphasize this same thing with the same words, then again subscribe to what they have written with their own hands and bind themselves to it as if by an oath, and finally publish it in both languages throughout the world. Who does not know that in the Augsburg Confession (for we do not agree with those who think that our doctrine is contained in it as not entirely alien to it) the doctrine of our churches, at least in the matter of the Eucharist, to pass over some other things, is rejected and condemned? For this reason, our churches, at Bucer's suggestion in the year of our Lord 1536, refused to acknowledge the Augsburg Confession in any way, and indeed not only because of the matter of the Lord's Supper, but also because of certain other things, we can never subscribe to it with a clear conscience. With what fruit, then, do you think we can be compared with those who assert with such constancy in the sight of all men that they have changed nothing in the Augsburg Confession, are changing nothing, and will change nothing? The royal majesty also commands this to them; for King Ferdinand, writing from Vienna in Austria on November 9, instructs Julius and the colloquy assessors among other things as follows: "If one or more theologians related to the Augsburg Confession should undertake to defend any opinion or sect outside the Augsburg Confession, then it may be answered against them as is appropriate, and they may be clearly told to refrain from such arguments or opinions inconsistent with the Augsburg Confession, considering that according to the aforementioned imperial decree, this colloquy is held only between the old religion and those related to the Augsburg Confession or their appointed representatives, as also only those related to the old religion and the Augsburg Confession are included in the religious peace, and all others, who are not attached to these two religions, are not intended in this religious peace, but are to be completely excluded. Therefore, if the confessors of the Augsburg Confession are to be our interlocutors in the future convention, they will undoubtedly come prepared to defend and impose their confession and to admit no one into their fellowship unless that confession is first approved and accepted. Meanwhile, we will also come to teach, declare, and defend the doctrine of our churches, unless it pleases the treacherous to do otherwise. They have protested that they will change nothing in their confession, nor will they change anything, nor can we not confess those things which we know to be true, which we also neither want nor can change.</p>
      <p>To what end, then, or with what hope of agreement would we meet? Will prudent men expect anything other than that we will depart from the colloquy with the matter unresolved and perhaps with more embittered minds? If this should happen, will not the common enemies, the papists, the Anabaptists, and the Epicureans, have more abundant material for triumph than they now have outside that unfortunate meeting? Will not the wounds of the churches be torn and lacerated more widely and dangerously than they are now without this extreme blow being inflicted?</p>
      <p>Since all these things are so well known and plainly confessed to you, brother, and to all not devoid of common sense, you yourself understand that it is not the part of the prudent nor will it be for the benefit of the church to provoke these into a colloquy or to want to insinuate or impose ourselves into their colloquies or conventions, who have long since declared and daily do not cease to present to our eyes what is to be expected from them. Therefore, we do not wish to be authors and encouragers to you (nor do we know whether this is your duty or that of a few others) to urge others to this and involve them in useless expenses and also entangle them in dangers from which they will not easily emerge and which may eventually be accompanied by more frequent evils than we now either see or expect. It will undoubtedly be more prudent to wait for better times than these, in which they have as if conspired anew, and for this reason, little hope of more sincere agreement can be expected. Therefore, the Lord must be prayed to, that He may repair by His grace what we cannot achieve and accomplish by our counsels.</p>
      <p>For you do not write these things because we are not sincerely desirous of peace and agreement with them, but because the ways to reach this seem to be such that they do not lead to it at all, but rather disturb us. Nor do we wish to conceal this from you, with whom we have resolved to deal candidly and fraternally, if you think that some are ensnared by certain confessions left in the hands of some princes this summer, as if in these the doctrine of all the Swiss churches is contained, which seems to them to be such that it paves an easy way to enter and mend concord, know that they are mistaken. For they are at the discretion of certain private individuals, to whom nothing of the sort was entrusted, and also unknown to us, presented for the matter that was then being conducted by them, I say, presented in that place and time. We do not wish to be bound by them and explicitly said this to the author later, when we heard they were presented. Nor do we at all think that the doctrine of truth should be proposed in words and opinions that are too obscure or ambiguous, but rather in clear and simple ones, especially in confessions, as we said above. In all these things, however, we do not wish you to be ignorant that we, as is fitting, have not forgotten the words of the apostle, who commands us to be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks us a reason of the hope that is in us, with all meekness and reverence, and therefore we are always ready, if ever we are called, to bear witness to our doctrine or to defend our faith. We think, however, that here too a legitimate and circumspect consultation should first be held about these things, so that everything is done with the good will and appropriate counsel of the holy magistrate and with the consent and commission of other brothers and the church, to the glory of God and His word and for the safety of the church. The tranquility and unity of which should also be carefully considered by us, who see the interlocutors leaving Worms having first taken great care not to be distracted or set against each other by the calumnies and false opinions of their churches, as if the teachers themselves had changed something in doctrine or did not agree perfectly in all things.</p>
      <p>Unless we also consult in this way for the churches entrusted to our faith, we do not know how faithful we are to God and His church. Farewell in Christ, brother, and kindly and lovingly greet all your fellow ministers, our brothers, reverently and affectionately. Let us love one another as brothers and think and speak all as one in the Lord, so that we may be a whole body with the same mind and the same judgment. Heinrich Bullinger, in his own name and in the name of all his fellow ministers, doctors, professors of theology, and ministers of the church. To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Simon Sulzer, minister of the Basel church, our esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
