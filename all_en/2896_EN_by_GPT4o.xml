      <p>Greetings. Your most delightful letter, venerable brother, has been delivered to me, along with Westphal's refutation, for which I thank you doubly: both for the labor expended publicly for all the pious, and because you have deemed me worthy of this testimony of love. I write nothing about the covenant, because we are in doubt: but you will understand the outcome from the news.</p>
      <p>Would that it be such that it brings us common joy. If the neighbors reject what is now finally offered, they will reveal not only their obstinacy, disdain, and contempt for us, but also their implacable hatred.</p>
      <p>The Lord will not allow the abundance of good seed in Austria and Bavaria, though it remains suffocated for a time, to be extinguished. Meanwhile, He shows through omens that He wishes to subdue the indomitable defiance of the world.</p>
      <p>If He begins with us, we are worthy of severe punishment. But we must ask Him to forgive us with paternal clemency. Lord Johannes a Lasco promises some assembly, about which I have no hope, not only because the fervor of striving often blinds minds, but because Vergerius, a frivolous man, as I see, is the principal author of the action. However, if there is anything, as soon as it is announced to you, I have no doubt you will be prepared. We must always ensure that by rejecting discussions, we do not seem to flee from the light. Since the hour now calls me to reading, I will end this letter. Farewell, therefore, distinguished man and brother, always to be highly esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>Greet the fellow ministers diligently. It was painful, as was fitting, that your college was diminished by the death of the holy man Pellicanus. May the Lord gather us to Himself happily. Meanwhile, may He protect and govern you, your family, and all the others perpetually.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 22 April 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and fellow minister.</p>
