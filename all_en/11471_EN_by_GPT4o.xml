    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends as a token of friendship his two books "On the Authority of Holy Scripture" and "On the Origin of Error". When he asked him last summer through a young Englishman [John Butler?] for Roman coins, Amerbach first sent a handwritten list and then the coins themselves, for which he has not yet thanked him. Sends him a silver coin with the portraits of M. Agrippa and C. Marius; the face of the latter, as history reports, even made a murderer recoil. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I send you here, most illustrious man, a small paper gift, some of my works: one on the word of God and its ministers, the other on the origin of the error of idols and the mass, not to teach you, a man otherwise most learned and renowned throughout the world, but so that there may exist with you some token of my gratitude and love towards you.</p>
      <p>For last summer, a certain young noble Englishman, in my name, requested from you coins of Roman antiquity; to whom you showed yourself so accommodating that you first indeed wrote a catalog of that antiquity in your own hand, and then sent the coins themselves, which I was asking for, gold, silver, and bronze, adding moreover that you were otherwise entirely bound to us and prepared to gratify us in greater matters. For that remarkable kindness of yours, I have not yet given thanks in any letter, but now I give the greatest thanks and offer and dedicate myself entirely to you as a sincere friend. I add as a pledge and token the images of M. Agrippa and C. Marius VII cos. (consul for the seventh time), expressed on this silver coin; of which the latter somewhat (though more obscurely) reflects what historians report about Marius's authority, that a soldier, who was coming to kill Marius, was restrained from the cruel and unworthy deed by the severity or majesty of his countenance.</p>
      <p>Receive these, however humble, from your most devoted admirer, cherish him with sincere love, live and farewell, most esteemed man and dearest friend. ZÃ¼rich, 6th of November. In the year of our Lord 1540. Heinrich Bullinger, entirely and sincerely yours.</p>
