      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although I believe you have learned from others what the reason is why, besides other young men, I am compelled to cease instructing your son (who was already favorably known to me by his father's reputation and later was highly recommended by his most courteous letters) in dialectics and rhetoric; yet, since I have heard that our school authorities have sent some accusatory letters to you, to make me appear unfavorably and odious, I thought it my duty to send a brief apologetic explanation, so that if any opinion has already formed in your mind from their untimely denunciation, if reason will shake it, if reason will weaken it, if finally truth will extort it, you may not resist and may release it from your mind either willingly or equitably. Our school authorities have brought forward three main reasons why they thought I should be prohibited from private teaching, the first of which was that they said I was not united as a member of their German church, the second that I teach privately contrary to the custom of the school, the third that I have not lectured on any Aristotelian dialectician or rhetorician to my listeners, but have proposed Ramus, a certain new heretic, in dialectics and rhetoric. Although I am not heard here about these things, so that I might sufficiently clear myself, yet I trust so much in your religious humanity that you will hear me benevolently and not approach with anyone's prejudice unless you have heard the other side. As for the first, I have both confessed and still profess that I am led by certain reasons, so that with a good conscience I cannot yet communicate and unite with this church, the chief of which is that I see these people not only distinctly professing that all heavenly goods, and whatever is necessary for salvation, should be sought or ought to be sought with our only king Christ, who is the only shepherd of his sheep and the only distributor of heavenly goods, but also confessing that they should be demanded and received with their external ministry (which I wish were legitimate and truly consistent), with themselves as ministers of Christ (I wish therefore they were faithful to Christ), with ceremonies, sacraments, and external things, as if branches could be separated from the vine of Christ through created media, as if Christ were not all in all. The second reason is that they do not make from the water of baptism external regeneration a full entrance into Christianity and I do not know what, so that I cannot know where they transfer the washing of Christ in water, fire, and spirit. The third, that in the bread under the bread and with the bread they say they distribute and offer the true body and blood of Christ substantially and essentially to the worthy and unworthy alike for the remission of sins. The fourth, that they do not use excommunication, although Christ instituted it equally with communication and the apostles, as even the ancients, used and had it.</p>
      <p>The fifth and last, that following the example of the papists they assume absolution and even the remission of sins. Moreover, many other things, such as that in the one Christ they contrive I do not know what solutions, that they are often inflated, envious, irascible, obstinate, and do not exhibit fruits worthy of evangelical faith, that they do not listen to anyone who departs from them even a hair's breadth, but rashly incite and stir up the secular arm and magistrate to cruelty, that they pursue their colleagues, our teachers, as most religious, so also most learned, Dr. Martyr and Zanchi, with envy, defame them with lies, and as if they had descended into their error about the sacrament, to say nothing of other things, they spread it back and forth. You see what moves me to still wish to remain in Christian liberty, while Almighty God either removes these errors or transfers me to a healthier congregation. The second reason is so empty and foolish that it collapses by itself, even if I say not a word. For who does not know that in universities and so everywhere in schools this is not only free, but also praised, if those who have made some progress interpret some book privately for the weaker, so that both in schools and at home the muses and studies may resound and be handled. Since this is so, it should not have been imputed to me as a fault if I did what is done everywhere, and moreover, what is not against the laws of this school, and indeed, what I began not without the knowledge, but with the approval of Sturm and Marbach.</p>
      <p>I will now proceed to refute the third, which as it greatly moved our people, so it requires the greatest purification. First, I will speak about dialectics, then there will be a place for rhetoric. Many things moved me to wish to read the dialectical institutions of Ramus rather than those of Aristotle. For I saw that Ramus comprehends well the dialectical virtue by which we foresee, estimate, and perceive anything, by defining, rightly distinguishes the parts of invention and disposition, then pursues each part of both in its place and order, omits no true precept that is handed down by the Aristotelians, yet places no useless one or repeats it, the Aristotelians nowhere clearly define that underlying force of this art, confuse those two true parts of invention and disposition with false fragments of predicables, categories, interpretations, topics, elements, in which they both omit many necessary things about the true parts of arguments and modes of conclusions and often teach useless things, and what are proper to dialectical invention and disposition, they repeat trivially and obscurely involve with many useless things, so that it can neither be said nor expressed enough. Ramus places no precept in the art that he does not explain with the illustrious testimonies of notable men, Cicero, Virgil, and the rest; the Aristotelians prescribe that examples are needed for clear teaching, not obscure but illustrious, yet as if dreaming they prescribed it, they bring no example from good authors or, if they bring one, they propose it more obscurely than it can be recognized.</p>
      <p>Ramus applies the exercise of the art as widely as the power of the human mind extends, so that the youth dedicated to this discipline may perceive the plan of the proposed orator or poet or any example from the kind of argument, the judgment from the species of conclusion, the method from the order of perpetual disposition, then attempt and accomplish something similar and express all parts of the art to confirm the skill of the mind and the prudence of the mind and spirit. The Aristotelians join a suitable exercise to their inert and foolish confusion, they explain the invention and disposition of no notable author with their precepts nor therefore care to attain or imitate its virtues, they clamor and act about the thorns of empty little precepts (as if dialectics were invented only for scholastic altercations). These things impelled me to propose Ramus especially to my students.</p>
      <p>Rhetoric remains, in which for almost the same reasons I preferred this author to others. For he beautifully defines rhetoric, then separates it into two parts, elocution and pronunciation, so that if we have distinguished grammar, rhetoric, dialectics as general and common disciplines in such a way that they are taught easily and clearly, so that they are not mixed with foreign precepts among themselves, but are contained within their own and proper limits, grammar from four parts, orthography, prosody, etymology, and syntax will provide proper and pure speech, dialectics will supply the invention of things and disposition, and the companion of disposition, memory; rhetoric therefore will retain this for itself alone, that it may more magnificently polish the things found and arranged by dialectics, exposed by grammar in pure and proper speech, with the ornaments of elocution and commend them with the grace of pronunciation and action.</p>
      <p>Aristotle and those who followed him, Cicero, Quintilian, and others have involved every description of rhetoric in many obscurities and immense confusion with such a variety of things, that it is scarcely encompassed by the capacity of any human nature. In what way, since they have confused many things about the doctrine of thinking arguments in this most beautiful art, why because this doctrine indeed belongs to dialectics, the natural light buried in the bosom of the mind shows, the plan reproves, reason convinces. What about elocution, which is the proper part of this art, how is it taught by them, almost nowhere is there a general partition of it in its place. Where then is the congruent definition of each member of the general partition, where is the apt conjunction of examples? I omit pronunciation, about which they have confused a few things in a tumultuous confusion. I am silent about disposition and its companion memory not rightly placed among the parts of rhetoric, since they are proper to dialectics.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when I saw these and six hundred other things, I did not want to place my young men, extracted from those whirlpools of confused truth, in the most tranquil harbor and without all circumlocutions lead them by the straight instruction of Ramus to where they ought to strive. For this reason, I also used Cicero's orations against Catiline, so that in them besides the observation of the Latin idiom they might have living and present examples of both arts, so that they might thus hold a greater use of precepts, and what they themselves might attempt to imitate in writing, might be proposed. And this plan could be considered not useless by the wise and perhaps also sufficiently and copiously defended by me, unless I had long ago decided to consider all things as dung, that I may know Christ. And whatever has been done by me or described here in a few words, I testify to God, has been done for the reason that I might be able to benefit young men most in a short time and with an easy method. If it seems otherwise to our people or others, it is allowed by me, provided that this my defense is either received in some way or at least judged worthy of pardon. Which our people did not think at all, since they even greatly threatened imprisonment and banishment, how rightly, how Christianly and piously, let the wiser judge. Furthermore, that they also call me a Swenckfeldian, I did not think worthy of excuse, since I know myself to be of Christ and wish to be considered a Christian, moreover as I remember at Cologne I used to be called without discrimination a fanatic, an Anabaptist, a Lutheran, and a sacramentarian, when I renounced the papacy, so these people without judgment call those Swenckfeldians, fanatics, etc., who even murmur against their eucharistic idol and other deplorable errors. But God will judge us all. You have in a few words the excuse for the interrupted instruction; if it seems worthy of your ears, it pleases, if you have something to criticize, please use Christian kindness and a healthier correction than our people have used, and you will see that I will not only accept it in the best part, but will always give the greatest thanks I can. I love your son wonderfully both because of you, who have held out to me with your most beautiful writings, with Christ interceding, both a torch and clarity, so that I might secede from the papacy, and because of his highest talent and singular modesty, and he brings me the greatest hope of the highest integrity and the highest learning, if he continues to follow in his father's footsteps as he appears to have done so far. I hope the same of the other, who is in Wittenberg; if they do not equal their father, yet they will aspire so closely to his religion and learning that the whole Christian republic will recognize what it owes to the Bullinger family. May Almighty God not only grant this to them, but also bestow upon them the piety of David, the wisdom of Solomon, and the sublimity of Paul.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers in such a way that I cannot commend myself with greater zeal or more from the heart, and I dedicate and offer my observance and readiness entirely to you and your children.</p>
      <p>May the favor of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you and your holy church, amen.</p>
      <p>Given hastily in Strasbourg on the very day of Pentecost in the year etc. 1556. Most devoted to your piety, Johannes Heyden, son.</p>
      <p>To the religious and not at all ordinary man of integrity and doctrine, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, superintendent and faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my lord and friend always and especially to be respected.</p>
