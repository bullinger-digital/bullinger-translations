      <p> S. D. I was indignant, believe me, my dearest Ambrosius, that you, bypassing us who were anxiously expecting you, have retreated to your den, where you have enclosed yourself so completely that no mountain mouse has buried itself deeper this winter. However, your excuse deserves some pardon, as you turned towards Rheinfelden and, returning from there, could reach your home by a more convenient route. Our friendship remains unchanged and perpetual; an opportunity will present itself for you to come to us and converse to our satisfaction. I read the story about the Esslingen harlot; I eagerly wish to hear the conclusion of this tale; you would do us a great favor if you could provide us with it. It pains me greatly that I see our poor Germany completely bound by evils and the greatest of evils: the evil of stupor and blindness. Anyone who wishes imposes upon us, deceives, plunders, and destroys us, and we, though struck heavily, refuse to come to our senses. </p>
      <p> Restore our senses, Christ, Son of God, and free us from impostures and violence! </p>
      <p> The Emperor is said to have won Africa in September and wreaked havoc miserably, also angering the Turks to such an extent that the ships from Genoa, which had sailed to Egypt, were sent back in haste, etc. Thus, the Milanese said on the day in Baden. The Turk had sent a large embassy to Venice and demanded passage. In short: the Emperor and King incite all against us with their land-hunger, bringing us into the greatest danger, meanwhile lying upon us, murdering us, giving us new, interim beliefs, sucking us dry; we plead with them for this. O God, break the pride! </p>
      <p> When Duke Ulrich died on November 6, Schnabel and Lazarus Schwend took on soldiers; it is feared that the Roman King will take the land and set Duke Christoph beside him. Thus, the desolate Austrian Spaniards do in Milan, Gelderland, Saxony, Hesse, Württemberg, Bavaria soon, all to devour; yet one looks on. May God grant his grace that we escape the Austrian wolves and Spanish devils! </p>
      <p> In Baden, nothing special was handled, except what concerns the market towards Milan, the bailiff's wife beyond the mountain, and the legal case of Fleckenstein and the adventure of Bollweiler. The Johanniter have also taken the house and other things from the Bernese at Köniz; it is included in the separation. If any new recruitment happens further in the cities for the sake of freedom, they will and should give no answer behind the superiors, etc. No other day is set. I will inform you further at another time, having written this in haste. God be with you and yours. Amen. Given in Zurich, November 28, 1550. H. Peter Schüren sends his greetings to me; I will write to him myself soon. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his most esteemed lord and brother. </p>
      <p> Winterthur. </p>
