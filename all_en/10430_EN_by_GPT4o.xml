    <p xml:id="regest1">Sharply rejects the Zurich "prudence," as it consists partly of arrogance and partly of fear. At the last assembly, the alliance proposed by Duke Ulrich of Württemberg and Landgrave Philip of Hesse was only discussed to the extent that it was determined that it would not be wise to change the existing legal situation of the Swiss cantons in any way. The plans of the two princes should be kept in abeyance, with the Zurichers wanting to discuss the matter first with the five cantons, in order to then be able to send a joint message to the princes. This is what happens when inexperienced children govern! There was no need to decide so hastily on the alliance, but since the news from Zurich had already leaked to the five cantons, Zurich was forced to do so. The Ensisheim and Innsbruck people have met these days, but parted ways again without a solution. The Hessian military force is divided, with one part remaining in Württemberg, another with the Landgrave, and a third with Wilhelm von Fürstenberg. King Francis I of France has taken the County of Montbéliard as a pledge. Karlstadt's wife should turn to Myconius. Greetings to Andreas Karlstadt and others.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You are reconciled. What more should I add? But listen. For as with everything, I dare to pour this into your lap: It is astonishing how much the Zurich prudence displeases me, both because it is more inflated than a bladder and because it always carries with it the fear conceived from the recent calamity. At the last assembly, nothing was done about the alliance except to declare that it was not appropriate to change anything about their current state. Also, some evil spirit incited them to send a separate delegation to restrain the plans of the princes, the Duke and the Landgrave, but only after referring the matter to the Cantons, so that the delegation would be a joint one. And indeed, it would have been done this way if the others had agreed. Is there not fear in one case, or rather in both, and in the other inflated foolishness? But this is what happens when children rule and inexperienced men are in charge. This high office truly requires different men. We study from childhood, read what the world does and has done from the beginning, and are trained like few others. What if the reins of power were given into our hands? Surely, the same thing would happen as with Phaethon. What then, when children are put in charge, who have never seen or experienced any of this? The alliance should not have been concluded so quickly, nor did the prince demand it. But you were forced to do so because of the most trivial rumors, which have already spread to the Cantons, whatever the Duke wrote to you. A great disgrace, so help me God, and, as I fear, incurable. Should we send a delegation, for whom that most fortunate course would be as beneficial as for the princes? Or should we join those who are enemies of the princes and most hostile to all their actions? Well, I can do nothing; it is time!</p>
      <p>The people of Ensisheim and Innsbruck were here these days but left without any plan, and so they departed. The Hessian army is continually growing - for what purpose is not yet known. The entire army is divided. Part remains in Württemberg, part is with the Landgrave, and part with Wilhelm von Fürstenberg. King Francis I of France has taken the city of Montbéliard under his jurisdiction. The banner that was there has departed. A headache drives me away.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ.</p>
      <p>June 15, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Let Karlstadt's wife turn to me. I will then indicate a prepared house. Greet Karlstadt and the brothers.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most friendly of friends, his esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
