      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Since Christian religion is based not on persuasion but on the power of God, it is not unjust that the pious have always abhorred sophistry, which sought to either attack or obscure the power of the simple word of God. Although this evil was frequent in all ages, in our time it seems to raise its head from the depths through Stancarus, a man driven by fury against God and His Christ, our Lord, so rabidly that he spares no pious person who opposes him as he deserves. This monster does not aim for the lowest, but strives to attack the highest, in which eternal life resides, namely, to remove from the minds of all the most desired knowledge of the one true God and Jesus Christ, whom He sent. And to succeed more easily, he does not come forth with newly invented weapons for attack, but with those long stored in the armory of the Antichrist and worn by long human use, so that unless the hand of God intervenes, there is fear that, according to the prophecy of the Son of God, even the elect may be deceived. For if anywhere the rule of custom was more severe, it was certainly most severe in religion, which we all experience now to our great sorrow. And to give you, our most esteemed brothers and teachers, a recent example of this sorrow, it seemed good to us to explain what has happened to us here, being persuaded by God's mercy that we will find both consolation for such great sorrow and a present remedy for this dire evil from you. For we do not wish to appear as if we could stand in this battle by our own strength and raise our spirits by ourselves, unless, relying on the power of our victorious Lord Jesus Christ, we join hands with you to enter this battle. To provoke you to this, we briefly explain the whole matter.</p>
      <p>Not long ago, this Stancarus published a new booklet on the Trinity and the Mediator (which you have undoubtedly seen), in which he condemns the entire Christian world of Arianism and therefore attacks all the pious in strange and diabolical ways. Although this venomous language deserved to be proscribed by all, it nevertheless has its not infrequent and not common supporters, whose authority moves others, while incautiously trying to avoid one vice, namely, not to tear apart the Mediator, they fall into another much graver evil, so that they do not indeed ignore what is the plain and true knowledge of God, but they greatly err. While we ministers (though aware of our own weakness) strive to avert this evil, we fall among our brothers and listeners into suspicion and the mark of Arianism, while we frankly teach both that Christ is wholly God, namely, man or the Word made flesh, our Mediator, and that God the Father is not so cohered with His beloved Son and the Holy Spirit that we may not frankly glory with the apostles that we have access to God the Father (not as he imagines to God the Trinity) through Jesus Christ. Thus Satan, who is a master of a thousand arts, wishing to possess the whole kingdom and not lose a faithful satellite, wants us to destroy each other with mutual slaughter, so that biting each other we may be consumed in the end. But that Son of the Most High, who promised to be with the little ones until the end, has raised our spirits to better hope, so that we do not despair of the restoration of the union of our spirits, if for your piety and for the bond we have with you in Christ Jesus, you will interpose your judgments drawn from the word of God concerning our confession and that of our listeners. For indeed, whatever part you show to be contrary to the word of God, do not doubt that it will yield, as commanded by its Lord and God, to whom we have sworn in His word, all human prejudices being set aside, which we earnestly beseech you to do from the heart, by God the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>For our prayers should be as important to you as our persuasions about you are to us, so that we do not hesitate to subject ourselves and our spirits to your judgments, because we gladly admire the most abundant gifts of the Spirit of God in you. This is our confession, most esteemed brothers in Christ Jesus, about God and the Mediator. We believe with all our heart according to the Apostolic Creed, which, although we do not ignore it to be the most exact compendium of the whole apostolic scripture, yet lest any suspicion of us remain with the brothers, without any deceit or false interpretation, we stand also with the Nicene Creed, not because it was treated by the consensus of many, but because it agrees exactly with the word of God and expressly convicts the blasphemy of Arius, which we with the true church condemn with anathema. We do not subscribe to other confessions, which even pious men or more sincere churches have issued when asked, first because we are not compelled by the word of God (unless to edify our faith and that promptly), then because most of these are so obscure that you do not know which to follow, and Stancarus fortifies his doctrine with their support, having found a convenient occasion from the frequent (as is the custom of the scholastics) mention of essentiality and relations. We think that what is commonly called the Athanasian Creed is of the same kind, woven from those Gordian knots, which are so far from allowing a pious heart to rest, that it becomes more entangled the more it tries to untie the knots, undoubtedly made by the art of the papal school, so that from here they can more easily draw out the remaining monsters about justification by works, about the Mediator according to humanity only, about the mediation of dead saints, and other things that follow from here, and establish their sandy foundation. For that persuasion about the papacy is vain, that this one article about the Trinity remained intact, since from the rest of its structure it can easily be inferred on what firm foundation they relied, who built such monstrous things, although God in His singular goodness left the entire form (under the dregs) of baptism for the sake of the elect.</p>
      <p>Moved by these reasons, we have exhorted our brothers and listeners here, and we also exhort you, not to compel us to subscribe to these prejudices and such varied ones, about which our conscience does not rest, as it clearly sees that whatever is not of faith is sin. You have heard, most esteemed brothers, our apostolic faith not differing from the Nicene. Yet lest any deceit lie hidden (for this has been objected to us, as if under the pretext of simple words we harbor some poison), our mind and heart with all its recesses must be opened, so that you can give a more exact judgment, if we harbor any error against the prescription of the word of God or now introduce any unusual doctrine into our churches acquired by the blood of Christ. Since Satan through his aforementioned satellite strives with a new stratagem to snatch Christ the Son of God from the pious under the cover of the phrase received in the papacy ("one God in Trinity and three in unity"), we are compelled by our duty and the care of the sheep committed to us to attend more diligently to the reading of the scriptures and the antiquity of the fathers, who were closer to the age of the apostles, to see more closely whether it is so that the name of God absolutely placed in scripture is used for the Trinity, so that God the Trinity (as Augustine was accustomed) can be called, whether finally, when scripture mentions one God, it is to be referred to the Trinity or to the Father alone, and whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, as the Romans wish. Having thoroughly examined these, we confess in this way that scripture never speaks confusedly about God the Father, about His Son, and about the Holy Spirit, but distinctly reveals to the pious the divinity of the Father, the true and perfect divinity of the Son from God the Father, and the divinity of the Spirit from the same. For the root and source of the Son and the Holy Spirit is God the Father, as the Son of God Himself testifies, who acknowledges that He came from God and that all things of His are the Father's. And John says the Word was God with God, to which words Justin frequently subscribes in his dialogue with Trypho and in his two Christian apologies, likewise Basil against the Sabellians and Arius, and Athanasius against the followers of Sabellius. The epithet of one is certainly taught to be attributed to the Father alone both from scripture and from the fathers. For that sentence of the prophet: "Hear, O Israel, your God is one" was explained to us by the Son, who came forth from the bosom of the Father, when He thus responded to the vain boasting of the Jews about the knowledge of God: "It is my Father, whom you say is your God." [John 8.] The faithful interpreter, the apostle Paul, agrees with his master, saying to us, "There is one God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" etc. [1 Cor. 8.] And again, "There is one God, one mediator of God" etc. [1 Tim 2.] But whom, I ask, did Israel know as God, or at least boast of, except Him, for whom he hears reproach from the Son of God? Him, I say, who spoke from heaven saying: "Hear, O Israel" etc. Thus, the name of God taken indefinitely in the scriptures, unless the name of the Son, flesh, or spirit is added, is attributed to the Father. This is testified everywhere by the Gospel of John and all the epistles of all the apostles, whose citations you do not need, since all these things are much known to you. In this sense, all the fathers of that purer age, Justin, Ignatius in his epistles, and Irenaeus in his excellent and catholic confession of faith, which clearly presents what we say to the minds of the pious and more significantly in book 4 chapter 2, adding that sentence previously cited: "Hear, O Israel" etc. Others follow, and Hilary on the synods fol. 325, on the Trinity book 1 fol. 17, book 2 page 16 book 4, Athanasius especially in the fourth sermon against the Arians page 234 and in countless other places, especially in the oration against the followers of Sabellius.</p>
      <p>Basil is not dissimilar in book 1 against Eunomius fol. 318 and in countless other places. Gregory of Nazianzus is in the same sentiment in his apology page 9, especially there "Nor are we so loving of Christ" etc. We omit Tertullian, whose authority was always not common among the pious.</p>
      <p>But what are we, the least? Our confession of faith was to be frankly deposited with you, brothers, since it seemed good to our brothers, who defer much and rightly to you, as they do not doubt that you will give a judgment for the truth and simplicity of faith without prejudice.</p>
      <p>But while the epithet of one God is attributed to the Father, there is a danger that while we avoid Scylla, we fall into Charybdis, lest we either make the Son less than the Father or constitute parts of substances or three gods, each of whom holds a part of divinity. God is the witness of our conscience, who neither wishes to penetrate the majesty of God nor to afflict the Son of God with the least ignominy nor to investigate anything about God according to the reasons of bodies, but rather, weary of that philosophy drawn from scholastic theology, we hide ourselves in the rock of Christ, in whom we prefer to become foolish and imitate this, as they think, negligence rather than their obscure and deadly diligence. We acknowledge the unity of the Son and the Holy Spirit with the Father so simply, namely, that the Son is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of His substance. For we do not think it fitting for such majesty, who is most perfect, to generate something imperfect or partial from Himself. And in that sense, we take those words of our Lord and God.</p>
      <p>"I and the Father", and the Father not in the manner of Sabellius but because we do not see another nature or divinity in the Father, another in the Son. So also with the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Finally, as the Father has worked until now, so also the Son works, for all things are through Him, as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself. We also imagine no beginning of His generation, but as coessential so also coeternal with the Father we firmly believe by faith. For as we do not scrutinize the majesty of the Father's eternity nor wish to rise so high in our minds as to imagine there was ever a time when they were not (may such impiety be far from our thoughts), so we subject our very brief thoughts to the incomprehensible eternity of this Son. In sum, we attribute nothing to the Son, our Lord, that we do not also attribute to the eternal Father, all sophistic speculations being set aside, namely, that the Son and the Holy Spirit are equally from themselves as the Father by reason of I know not what invented indefiniteness, so that from this finally those monsters of the schools may arise, to the extent that, namely, as a person, to be begotten or to proceed, but as God, neither to be begotten nor to acknowledge any procession. And so the matter has been brought to this empty philosophy, that nothing remains but words, relations, personalities, essentialities, the reality being utterly extinguished or so obscured that henceforth such majesty can easily be called into ridicule and doubt by the impious. But to us, there is such a religion of revelation that we do not wish to depart from it by a hair's breadth.</p>
      <p>Let others imagine a confused unity of essence sculpted by the dreams of their brain, we willingly, with reason subdued in obedience to faith, while we are here, know in part and see as in a mirror and enigma, about to contemplate not long after face to face, as it is, the eternal Father and His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, the pledge of our spirit. Moreover, we prove the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit not from that inclusive imagination under the epithet of one God, but from other and most certain places of scripture.</p>
      <p>Indeed, of the Son, John 1 "the Word was God". Also from Thomas's far more excellent confession: "my Lord and my God", then from Paul's testimony: "who is God blessed forever" and countless other testimonies. So also the divinity of the Holy Spirit is most evidently proven from this, that Christ calls Him the Spirit of truth and teaches that He proceeds from the Father and to baptize in His name, and Paul attributes to Him the searching of our groans and the excitation of the hearts of the elect to make faithful vows at one and the same moment, and also calls Him the Spirit of the Son. From which certainly no one unless impious and extremely blasphemous would doubt the true and perfect divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit without any imagination of some divided part of the Father's divine substance. For the ways of God and His thoughts are not like our ways and thoughts. Only those dare to fly beyond these, who while they are searchers of majesty, are justly oppressed by the majesty of God.</p>
      <p>As for invocation, that holy and full of consolation, taught by the word of God we retain, that we may approach the Father through His Son our Lord in one spirit. For so Christ Himself prescribed to His own to pray and the apostles, faithful interpreters of Christ, invite to the same norm. We do not doubt that the patriarchs, although under a cloud, entered the same way, proposing no God the Trinity (as Stancarus and others), or essential Father to their sighs, but the Father Himself through the Son in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>For God was not different then than He is now believed by us. That fixed and perpetual remains: "I am God, who does not change." Nor do we doubt that the Son is to be invoked separately, not only taught by the example of Stephen but also by the prescription of the apostle, who so often prays for grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. For if He is our God and Lord, why should we not testify to this with our prayers and rest upon Him with our groans as in our only refuge given to us by the Father? To whom we establish neither any foreign mediator nor those things which He Himself endured for our sake (as the papists in their litanies and others are accustomed), because He is united to us as our head, of which we are members, in respect of which the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world was seen by John. We unhesitatingly confer the same honor of invocation to the Holy Spirit as to the other Paraclete. Now indeed it will not be difficult for the slanderers to exclaim, therefore the Son is lesser to us, because He is not God from Himself but from the Father, because He is not invoked confusedly or enclosed in one essence, then because He is invoked without a mediator! The Holy Spirit is also lesser, because He proceeds from the Father, because He is obtained from the Father, because He is the pledge of our spirit! Who are you, who put your mouth in heaven and speak blasphemies against the Most High? Who was His counselor, who gave to Him first, since you are His clay, or why do you examine His dispensation, which He revealed without diminishing His majesty for our sake, that you may be most erect in faith because of these things. Here we must veil our face with Moses.</p>
      <p>Here with the father of Samson we must fall to the ground and be astonished before such sublime majesty. These things seem small and contemptible to us, because we ourselves are of small and contemptible judgment and animal, by which we do not comprehend the things of God, only He who came forth from the bosom of the Father has declared to us. His words are: "The Father is greater than I." These we read, in these we believe, casting our judgment before His throne, we do not seek higher things for ourselves. We adore also that apostolic saying, which sustains the spirits and eyes of the pious in expectation, while it says: "The Son will deliver the kingdom to God and the Father and thereafter be subject to the Father, that God may be all in all." In these mysteries, although various people play variously and Stancarus impudently insults the pious because of these, they are so certain to us that we gladly expect that day and are about to enter a far more august school, in which face to face and clearly will be explained by the Son of God, what we now cannot see because of the darkness. But let us not attribute so much to ourselves, as if we wish to gouge out our eyes with a crowbar, religious antiquity must be drawn into this sentiment, which candidly interprets those sentences, from which many take occasion for calumniating and philosophizing and try to soften those, as they think, hard words of Christ and the apostle with their interpretation or recoil, unless they flow into the ears from the mind, no less than the Capernaumites exclaiming: "This is a hard saying, who can bear it? This is our faith about God, which we submit to your spirit, that you may judge our spirit, whether it is from God. Again and again we beseech you, brothers, to embrace us with Christian affection, setting aside all human affection, not for the contention of disputes but for the edification of the church. It is indeed to be wished that we all think the same thing, yet if we think anything different, the Lord will also reveal that to us, who alone holds the key of understanding and opens as He wills and whenever it pleases Him, nor can anyone object to Him, why thus, why He has not revealed to others, who were far more prudent. Rather let us praise the heavenly Father, who not rarely hides His mysteries from the wise and reveals them to the little ones. To whomever it has been revealed, let the former be silent and examine by the word of God the spirit.</p>
      <p>We have added this at the end not for the sake of teaching, but as a testimony of our conscience, lest any sinister persuasion about us remain with you, as if we suppress something else with our mouth and something else closed in our heart. We call God as witness, let Him vindicate if we do anything out of a desire for innovation or ostentation and not driven by zeal for the glory of Christ and the burden of our ministry.</p>
      <p>Woe to us if we preach not the gospel but the decrees of men. About the Mediator, since a copious confession of our churches, with which we agree, was published long ago and approved by the judgment of your churches, we will therefore submit briefly. We believe the Word made flesh or the Son of God made man is not divided but whole as our Mediator to God the Father, not to God the Trinity according to humanity, as Stancarus dreams. We are not ignorant that it seems absurd to human reason that the Son of God should lower Himself to the office of teaching, that He, being God, should pray to God the Father and commend Himself and His own to Him, finally that the same God should be subject to passion, death, and resurrection. But if anyone wishes to examine the principles of our religion by the measure of reason, he will hear nothing not absurd and hard, he will easily stumble at everything, he will abhor many things, unless they are prepared by an artful interpretation. Is it not the most absurd of all that the Word God was made flesh and subjected to all temptations? And yet no one hitherto except the most impious dares to say that it is said according to humanity only...</p>

Let the Genevan church recognize those things prefixed to the Bibles of Stephanus Robertus, the sum of scripture, and they will judge that we have said nothing alien to that sum here. Stanislaus Paklepka, minister of Lublin and superintendent.</p>
