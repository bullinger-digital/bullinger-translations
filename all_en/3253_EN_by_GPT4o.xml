      <p>S. Our CÄ™llus's writing on the greatness of the blessed kingdom of God still presents us with a matter, to which another of Pomponatius on enchantments has been added; for he too was noted by Vergerius at the heads of our city. In both cases, therefore, we are working towards the main goal that (which you also fear not without reason) pious and learned writings are not prejudiced or oppressed. The outcome is in the hand of the Lord; when we see it, I will not hide it from you. The assembly of princes in Frankfurt has been dissolved, in which, as you have heard before, the Duke of Hesse and the Count of Nassau have finally been reconciled with each other through a transaction, and then a deliberation was made on the harmonious arrangement of the articles of Christian doctrine, which should be urged against the papists in the colloquy.</p>
      <p>Then a deliberation was proposed on establishing ecclesiastical censorship for all orders. Also on the rites of the churches and finally on suppressing infamous pamphlets and more bitter writings flying around here and there. The main points of this consultation have been sent to the Saxons, who did not attend the assembly, so that they too may join if they wish. Meanwhile, the doctors of the princes will meet in Worms on the first of August, where it is also hoped that Philipp will be present, so that a more mature deliberation can take place, and there are those who say that Groper is very evasive, pretending that he will have companions who are not purely Catholic, Vicelius and Julius Pelug. May the Lord scatter their tongues and grant ours true [Greek] in Him. Farewell in Christ Jesus with your wife and fellow students.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 29, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my honored, dear lord and brother.</p>
