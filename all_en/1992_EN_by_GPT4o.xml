      <p>S. D. I am accustomed, dearest compater, to complain gravely about myself, that I have written so rarely to you, and deservedly so. But now for one year I have written more to you, and I have not been able to receive any from you. I know that the state of our kingdom is not unknown to you.</p>
      <p>Our king, due to our sins, has passed away, not without great danger to our church. His sister succeeded him, named Maria, to whom may God always be present with His Holy Spirit, so that she may reign and govern all things to the glory of His name. Altars are being erected again throughout the kingdom, private masses are frequently held in many places: true worship of God lies in ruins, true invocation, the correct use of the sacraments; divine things are trampled underfoot, human things prevail. May God, for the sake of His only Son Jesus Christ, be present with His church. All pious preachers are in extreme danger; those who have not yet felt the squalor of prison are expecting it hourly. Meanwhile, by public authority, all are forbidden to preach. In their places, enemies of the gospel are appointed, who from the pulpit propose human and not divine things to the people. Now we trust in God alone; we earnestly pray to Him to comfort us and strengthen us to endure anything for the glory of His name. Hastily, from the prison in London, 3rd September, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greet your dearest wife, Herr Bibliander with his, Herr Pellican with his, Herr Gwalter with his, and all other pious brothers, our compatriot Herr Butler with his.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Hooper, Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>The last of Hooper from the prison in London.</p>
