    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The enclosed letter [No. 2950 from July 14] from Johannes Haller in Augsburg should be delivered by Vadian to Bullinger as soon as possible at Haller's request, as it is said to contain important information for him. Vadian therefore uses the next available messenger [...] and also includes other letters with Haller's letter, which were sent to St. Gallen by distant merchants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Emperor Charles V has convened a Reichstag for all the estates on September 1. Some say that the estates know his ambition and are greatly afraid of the introduction of a monarchy, fearing that if the estates prove too willing, the emperor's orders will be regarded as oracles and the estates will have to implement them against their will. It is certain that the emperor is arranging his entire entourage and provisions as if he intends to attack new enemies, for in Swabia there is (as is known) no one who would not obey his command. Therefore, one must be cautious. Accordingly, the council of St. Gallen has warned the Zurichers, who in turn passed the warning on to the Confederates assembled at the Diet in Baden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Lord miraculously thwarts the plans of men, indicating that one should pay attention to Him alone, while His kingdom does not come on earth without tribulation and persecution, as is evident from His teachings. His will be done. Amen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings. Has the Bohemian Wenzeslaus Fronto [VÃ¡clav Franta] come to Bullinger? He had very earnestly begged Vadian for a letter of recommendation [No. 2946].</p>

      <p>S. Our Haller from Augsburg sent these letters to be delivered to you, believing they contain matters that should not be hidden from you, and requesting that I send them as soon as possible. Therefore, I have sent them with the next available messenger, and I also include what some distant merchants have written to our people.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The Emperor has set the first of September as the day for all the estates of the empire to meet, which some say are held in great anxiety due to his known ambition for monarchy, fearing that if all willingly agree, what he says will be regarded as an oracle, and they will be forced to comply against their will. It is certain, however, that he is arranging all his impediments and provisions as if he intends to attack new enemies; for in Swabia there is no one (as is known) who has not declared they will obey his command. Therefore, vigilance is necessary, as our senate has reminded yours, and your people have not kept this from the Swiss gathered at the Diet in Baden.</p>

      <p>The Lord miraculously overturns human plans and clearly indicates that He alone should be listened to, while at the beginning, so to speak, of His kingdom, which we are taking up in this world, He makes sorrow, anxiety, concern, and persecution companions in all His teachings. Therefore, may His will be done. AMEN.</p>

      <p>Farewell and love me, and write back, I pray, whether a certain Wenzeslaus Fronto, a Bohemian by nation, has come to you, to whom I gave a letter of recommendation requested with great care. For I would very much like to know this. St. Gallen, 19th of July, 1547. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious bishop of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend and master to be revered.</p>
