      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Although you have not written for several years, I have no doubt about your friendly disposition towards me. Therefore, relying on our old friendship, I dare to disturb your affairs and sincerely ask you to support these holy men of God, Calvin and Farel. They have great zeal. But they are holy and learned men to whom I believe much should be granted. Erasmus can explain their cause to you. See to it that you do not fail, but rather assist by interceding and beseeching the senators you know. Christ the Lord will repay you on the day of judgment. Commend me to your family, whom I have always esteemed and still hold in high regard, as much as my smallness allows. Farewell with your family.</p>
      <p>May 4, 1538.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Niklaus von Wattenwyl, his most esteemed lord in Bern.</p>
