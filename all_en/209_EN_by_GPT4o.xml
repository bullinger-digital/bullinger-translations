      <p>Greetings. Excuse my poor writing due to an unusual dizziness of the head. The letters that you mentioned sending through a certain Peter, I have not yet received, which greatly troubles me, especially since I hear that Musculus's letter was attached to them. His wife arrived here in Lindau four days ago with nine children, and it might be important for her to know what her husband intends to do. But the excellent and most holy Christoph Müller, the chief scribe of Lindau, has already informed you, I know, about his affairs, that most pious woman, and also about our matters. Other news that is circulating here, Conrad Zwick has noted down in a document and sends it to you with the condition that you then send everything to Marcellus with letters addressed to him. Let me know about Schöner, whether he is there.</p>
      <p>I commend this young man to you as much as I can, but in such a way that he is diligently recommended by you to the Englishman who is setting out for England around the beginning of September, along with another compatriot of ours who is still staying in Strasbourg, a truly excellent young man. 24th July 1548. Pray for us.</p>
      <p>I am not feeling any better.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
