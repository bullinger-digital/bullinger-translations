      <p>Greetings. I read your letter with great pleasure, most excellent man, dated July 7th from Strasbourg. I could not entrust Bucer's writings, as they are quite numerous, to such a long journey. You know couriers dislike carrying booklets and small packages of letters. If you could obtain the edition of his work on the four Gospels, published in the year of our Lord 1530, you would find the entire discussion you desire described. However, if the book is not available, I will ensure you have a copy: I truly could not obtain it from the courier. He added that he would carry such booklets at the risk of his life. Burcher has not requested anything from me. For I will not deny him my assistance in any matter. I have sent my agreement and that of Mr. Calvin on the sacramental matter, written in a certain form, to Mr. Hooper, with the condition that he also shares it with you. The people of Bern have not yet responded with certainty about what they will do. We may perhaps publish it.</p>
      <p>For we do not think that either the people of Bern or other good men will condemn anything in such clear truth. And it is of great importance that other nations also know that we agree on everything.</p>
      <p>Here we continue in our usual manner in the church and republic, just as you saw us progressing when you were here with us. May God grant us His grace so that we may persevere in truth and goodness until the end. The people of Zürich and Bern remain steadfast in their purpose.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel, Schaffhausen, and the Grisons have embraced that French alliance, along with some others. I wish them better than they seem likely to receive.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us, that He may always guide us with His spirit. More to Mr. Hooper, whom I know will deny you nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, most excellent and eternally esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, the last day of August 1549.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gualther, Bibliander, and others greet you.</p>
      <p>I did not reread, I was in such a hurry.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Johann Utenhove of Ghent, now residing in England, in Cambridge.</p>
