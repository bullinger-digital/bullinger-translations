      <p>Dr. Zanchi, in the meantime, has kindly replied to my letters.</p>
      <p>I am considering suppressing my writing for the sake of concord or transforming it into another form. When he spoke of the young woman whom you had visited and from whom you contracted the illness, he did not mean your wife, but some other and foreign woman. It is good that you are alive and well.</p>
      <p>At that time, however, these things were being discussed among us, as it seemed that your situation was already settled. You say that certain events have occurred that disturb you not insignificantly, and indeed were announced to you while you were writing.</p>
      <p>I anxiously await to know what it is, as I understand it is a matter of great importance that has offended you so much. If you have any more certain information about Swiss affairs and Calais, please inform us.</p>
      <p>The French matter has not yet been discussed in the communities. Yesterday, all the guilds were gathered together and were earnestly admonished to be calm and peaceful, not to obstruct the foreign lords while they are here under protection, and not to offend them with words or deeds. For there is some concern about unrest, as some wish to be French, others Philippists. However, here in Chur, there are few Philippists, many French, and many who believe that all lords should be idle, etc.</p>
      <p>One must fear, however, that something might happen to the Spanish, among those reckless companions, that at night a disgrace or something might occur, as they wander the streets, leading to greater unrest. Otherwise, it is quiet, and one hears neither drums nor pipes.</p>
      <p>The French household is so modest and quiet that it is truly remarkable. Some of the Spaniards, however, pursue prostitutes more shamelessly and at night, which may not end well for them unless they become wise, etc.</p>
