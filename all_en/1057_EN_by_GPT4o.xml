      <p>Greetings. When our Butler greeted me in your name the day before and anxiously expressed your desire to know about the affairs of Magdeburg, how they had transpired, by chance a booklet published in Magdeburg was brought to me by a friend from Nuremberg, from which you will understand everything. That city instills a remarkable expectation of steadfastness in the minds of all, which I wish the neighboring ones would imitate! For there is some doubt about whether they will remain in the faith of Christ or not, as certain things are being attempted with seemingly plausible but very insidious arts, which we hope will be handled more cautiously than the common people promise themselves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have nothing certain from Augsburg, except that it is certainly reported that the Emperor will give his son Philip the daughter of his brother Ferdinand as a wife, with the great consent of his brother, according to the law of canine modesty. If anything happens, you will know shortly. Farewell. St. Gallen, 23rd of October, in the year 50.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the illustrious city of ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
