    <p xml:id="regest1">Further deliberations are being made about what should become of him, and now even Luther is likely to be consulted; he himself insists that only a doctoral promotion within the ecclesiastical framework is in question. He thanks on behalf of his wife [Katharina] for the book [“The Christian Marriage”] and sends a reciprocal gift for Bullinger's wife [Anna]. An exhortation to brotherly unity.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not yet know what I am. They are deliberating on what they want me to do. I believe they are even sending a consultation to Luther himself. Our notary has gone far away. I am waiting to see what will finally happen. I am prepared to become and be named a doctor in the manner and rite of the church; I do not want it in the manner and rite of the pope, and that in the office which is proper to the church. If this matter cannot prevail among those who profess the renewal of the church, I see that we are being tested and that there is another evil in this matter.</p>
      <p>My wife thanks you for the holy gift; she has almost read it all. I am sending a small gift to your wife here, in exchange for pure gold, the dross of the earth.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. I beseech you by the love of Christ, that we all conspire in the Lord as true and genuine disciples of Christ. Farewell again and greet everyone, all, I say, the dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend and brother.</p>
