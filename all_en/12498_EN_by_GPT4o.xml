    <p xml:id="regest1">Did Bullinger receive the "Refutation of the Twelve Causes" by [Sebastian] Coccius, which Haller sent [with letter no. 2443] and which is directed against [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld? Haller now sends the [“Summary of the Christian Religion”] by the martyr Juan Diaz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Colmar [Augustinian] monk Johannes Hoffmeister, in his writing “Verbum dei carnem factum,” targets not only Zwingli, Luther, [Martin] Bucer, and [Johannes] Oekolampad, but especially Bullinger as one of the most significant leaders of the Philistines [Protestants], whom he frequently mentions and from whose writing “De origine erroris” he quotes. Haller has read the entire book to investigate the superstition [of the Mass], and also because Bullinger is mentioned so often in it. Should Bullinger not possess the writing, Haller will send it. However, he did not want to burden the current messenger [...], who is traveling on foot, with it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Philipp] Melanchthon has published the story of Diaz’s martyrdom [“True History”] in a four-leaf quarto. However, it reveals nothing more than what [Frölich and Haller] have already reported.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- There is a shortage of meat in Augsburg, and it is likely to get worse. [King] Ferdinand [I.] has imposed an export duty of three florins per head on cattle from Hungary, so that [Augsburg] now has to pay him approximately 10,000 florins more annually. Previously, it was two Hungarian florins per cattle: one for [the war against Suleiman I.], the other for Ferdinand I. With this ruse, the king, who lives beyond his means, wants to extort even more money from the Germans. But this can hardly continue!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Hans Wilpert] Zoller was well received by his lord [Sebastian Schertlin]. [Zoller] praises [Schertlin’s] piety and candor highly. It would be good if [Zoller’s] relatives would thank Schertlin and the Augsburg authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Hans] Vogler [the Younger] will be reported on by [... Herwart], who is traveling to [Baden] and Zurich today. Haller wanted to spare him from taking this letter along. The city clerk [Georg Frölich] has to postpone his planned trip to [Baden and Zurich]. He is completely occupied with the renovation of newly acquired apartments.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger surely already knows about the edition of the works of Cyril of Alexandria [in the translation] by [Wolfgang] Musculus. Haller and Musculus get along like cat and mouse, because even though Haller shows deference to Musculus, he repeatedly experiences Musculus’s envy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- However, Haller gets along excellently with the pious and learned Sixt [Birck]. Bernardino [Ochino] and [Michael] Keller are both well and send their regards. The very influential Nikolaus [Müller known as] Maier in Augsburg is now being sent [to the Reichstag] in Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The students sent by the council to Wittenberg with a church scholarship a few years ago are almost all unsuitable for church service. Therefore, the people of Augsburg are very annoyed with those who have repeatedly advocated Wittenberg as a training place for pastors. [Konrad] Hofherr should [therefore] be diligent. Haller wants to advocate for his appointment [to Augsburg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger should share news and report whether it is true that robber bands are causing trouble in many places in Switzerland.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Haller hopes that the otherwise already poor population of Illnau has at least received a good pastor.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Savior, etc. I recently sent to you, most illustrious man, the book by Coccius against Schwenckfeld, which I do not know if you have received. I am sending again here the confession of faith by that most illustrious martyr, Juan Diaz.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Otherwise, I have seen nothing new except a certain book by that monk, Brother Johannes Hoffmeister of Colmar, a great rogue and hypocrite, about the Mass, which he titled: "The Word of God Made Flesh, that is, Jesus Christ, our Savior, is the only propitiatory and perpetual sacrifice of His Church, assertion, etc. Also, an Exposition of the Prayers and Ceremonies, which are used in the daily sacred service," in which book he specifically attacks Zwingli, Luther, Bucer, Oecolampadius. But with you, he deals especially as with the greatest enemy. I do not know if you have this book. I wish I knew! If you do not have it, I would send it. I would have sent it with this messenger, but I did not want to burden him, as he is traveling on foot. However, you have the best testimony from this rogue. Among other things, he speaks of you thus: "For he says that among these Philistines, not a common soldier, but not the least among the standard-bearers, and if you consider his learning, not a contemptible enemy, he, I say, says," etc. In the margin of this statement, he noted your name "Bullinger's On the Origin of the Error of the Mass," etc. And throughout the book, he fights with no one more than with you. I read the whole thing, partly to understand the foundations of such great superstition, partly because at first glance I saw your name cited so frequently. Therefore, let me know if you have it or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Melanchthon has published the history of Diaz's martyrdom in only one quire, but nothing else than what we have also indicated to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have no news now, except that there is a great shortage of meat and a greater scarcity is feared. Ferdinand has imposed such a tax on each ox that now three Hungarian florins must be paid for each (as they call them heads) before they can come from Hungary. Hence, our city would annually give Ferdinand about 10,000 florins more than before. For previously, only two Hungarian florins were given (although this was also done in a few years): one to the Turk, the other to Ferdinand. Now Ferdinand has added a third. Therefore, our lords and all the cities of the empire are very irritated. For they feel there is deceit involved. Since that squanderer king has hardly anything else to live on, he wants to deceive Germany with this art and extort money from them. Germany will hardly bear this burden. If they can achieve nothing with prayers, they will shake off this yoke by another way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Zoller is very pleasing and acceptable to his lord. He highly praises his pious and liberal nature. I wish his relatives would thank Schertlin and our lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You will learn about Vogler's business from his lord, who is traveling to the Baths and then to Zurich today. However, I did not want to trouble him with these my letters. The chief scribe had planned a journey to you; but while preparing, he bought some houses, with which he will be so occupied in building that he will postpone the planned journey to another time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You have seen Musculus's Cyril, I suppose. I get along with him somehow, like a cat with a mouse. I defer to him as much as I can, yet I feel how envious he is; which, however, I willingly ignore for the sake of peace and the Lord, in whom our peace is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Sixtus is my heart, a pious, learned, and candid man. Lord Bernardino is well, as is Cellarius, who sends you many greetings. D. Nicolaus Maior has been at home for several days now. He is now sent again to Regensburg, a man of great authority with our senate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The students whom the senate sent to Wittenberg with church stipends a few years ago are entirely unsuitable for the ministry of the word; hence everyone is very offended and especially indignant with those who want to repeatedly call ministers from Wittenberg, as they are useless. I ask you to encourage Curio to be diligent. I will ensure that if there is a vacancy in which he can be useful, he will be called.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>If there is any news with you, please write back. For I hear that many places in Switzerland are being infested by robberies; if this is happening, it is beyond the custom of this nation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>May the Lord keep you with all yours! I wish all the lords and brothers well. Augsburg, the day before the calends of June in the year of salvation 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I am very eager to know who has come to Illnau. I wish that the otherwise miserable people may at least be happy in this, if they have a good pastor!</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and father, to be greatly respected.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
