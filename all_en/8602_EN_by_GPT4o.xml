      <p>Greetings. In what state your affairs are, you could understand from Cornero and Verena, whose arrival to us was most pleasing to me and all of mine. Although indeed nothing has happened with us in the meantime, of which it would be of any interest to inform you, yet I did not want this to come to you without my own [letter]. I thought to add my happy letters, which contain nothing beyond a greeting. I congratulate the new prefects. If only a good one would succeed in the place of the treasurer, whose work would greatly benefit the assemblies of the republic and the church! The rest from Brisacher. Farewell with all yours and our Simler, Vicio, and the rest, whom I wish to be in the best of health.</p>
      <p>In Zürich on Wednesday, when I expect all the brothers of the chapter of the free province.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his esteemed father-in-law.</p>
