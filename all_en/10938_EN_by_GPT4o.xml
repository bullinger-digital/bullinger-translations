    <p xml:id="regest1">Already in the spring, he received a recommendation from Bullinger to [Oswald] Myconius [No. 771] and Mayor [Jakob] Meyer, when he, together with his brother [Hans Heinrich] Zscheckenbürlin, went to Basel regarding his mother's [Sibylla's] claim to her share of the inheritance of the Carthusian prior Hieronymus Zscheckenbürlin. Since the council responded evasively at that time, his brother intends to make another appearance in Basel; Hegner requests support for his concern, as Bullinger will be one of the envoys [to the Basel meeting on September 24/25], whose assistance the Zurich council has promised.</p>

      <p>Pious, well-learned, especially gracious, dear lord and entirely good friend, I offer you my friendly, willing service, as well as anything of love and goodness I can provide, beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear lord, I consider and hope you have not forgotten how I was with you during the last Lent, and informed you how Lord Hieronymus Zscheckenbürlin, the prior in the Carthusian monastery in Basel, who had a large estate that he took away from his own, brought and transferred it to the aforementioned Carthusian monastery, and has since passed away. This estate, my mother, since she is now his brother's daughter, would be the rightful, natural heir. Therefore, my brother and I were of the opinion to petition the honorable council in Basel to grant our mother, as the rightful heir of such a large estate, a reasonable and amicable settlement. I also requested a letter of recommendation from you at that time, which you kindly provided, namely one to my lord Myconius and another to my lord Mayor Meyer, for which I once again thank you with the promise to repay such kindness.</p>
      <p>Now, at that time, we received a convoluted, indefinite response from the honorable council of the city of Basel (which my brother can inform you about), and therefore we continue to seek advice from honest people in Basel and elsewhere on how to proceed further. We have found that we should once again petition the people of Basel and request to come to an amicable agreement with them, which we intend to do with the help and advice of my lords from Zurich. To this end, I have appointed my brother to carry this out with the assistance of my lords' envoys, since our lords have agreed to our request, namely that they will instruct their envoys to assist and advise us most faithfully. Now, since I am informed that you will be one of these envoys, I earnestly and sincerely request, as my especially trusted lord and good friend, that you kindly instruct my aforementioned brother, be advisory and helpful to him (which I know will be successful for us), so that what rightfully belongs to us by divine justice may come to us. For this, I and mine, wherever we can, will be grateful to you, to which I hope, God, the Lord, will reward you - most sincerely deserved.</p>
      <p>Given, in haste, Friday before St. Michael's Day in the year 1500 and 36.</p>
      <p>Your always willing</p>
      <p>Gebhart Hegner, city scribe in Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and honorable lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the great minster of the city of Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and entirely good friend.</p>
