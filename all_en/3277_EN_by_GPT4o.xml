      <p>Greetings. I am sending you the letters of Gerion and Fabritius, honorable lord and godfather, and at the same time, I express my great thanks for sharing them. It is written from Augsburg about the defeat of the papists and their Swiss auxiliaries. It is also reported that in Picardy, the king has lost 10 cohorts; therefore, he is calling for new Swiss troops to be sent there. The people of Fribourg were about to pass through here these days on their way to Italy, but with a change of plan, the king orders them to hasten to Picardy. Thus, miserable and blind men involve themselves in these disturbances and difficulties, which ultimately fall back upon their own heads.</p>
      <p>If only our people would take an example from this! As for our French, they have always been suspect to me, not without reason; they are entirely plotting to impose some form of Buceranism on us. Therefore, we must be cautious in time.</p>
      <p>If the princes had summoned us to a conference, we should have met beforehand and discussed this matter among ourselves above all, and they should have waited for this; now they anticipate us with their confessions and burden us with such prejudice. I am also not at all satisfied with them, nor will Beza go unpunished, once this becomes commonly known. I still suppress everything in silence; I also fear a new schism among us; for there are those who still cling to something of the old contention with ferment, who will rejoice if they see that they have new confessors and defenders of their obscurities. Please advise what you think we should do with Beza.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, things are getting worse and worse. The president of Camerach has warned my lords to be on their guard; for they have something in mind.</p>
      <p>My lords partly believe it, partly not, and it is thought that they would otherwise like to set us against each other. The king has placed some cavalry in the land of Fustini behind Jonve, waiting for something to happen. I am very concerned that nothing good will come of it.</p>
      <p>No one is allowed to speak with our people who come to Geneva, nor to keep company without the council's permission. The French govern there; the old citizens are not allowed to let themselves be noticed.</p>
      <p>May God will that it serves for good, Amen.</p>
      <p>These things I write hastily to you.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you their most loving greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your I. Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed and beloved lord and godfather.</p>
