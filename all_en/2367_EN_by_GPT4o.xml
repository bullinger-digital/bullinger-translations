      <p>S. P. If you seek news, you will see from these things that I inform your lords. May the Lord grant better things; for I expect news of the conflict every hour. The cardinals or legates, who were sent to the Emperor and the King by the Pope for peace, return with nothing accomplished; for the Emperor demands from the King, under the guise of friendship, deceitful treaties against Germany and other friends, and in summary, there is nothing certain in those negotiations, through which more harm will come to the Christian republic than from war. For among other things, the Emperor demands that the King not include his friends in the treaty and that he himself wants the same from his side, so that after peace it is free for the Emperor and the King to make war... on them. See where these things are heading. Therefore, it is better to fight. Hear the rest: that cardinal, who was recently with you, informed me that the Emperor promises the Pope that he wants to restore England to its former state of religion. Therefore, it was immediately decreed that the English Cardinal Paul, who is in Rome, should go to the Emperor and then from him to England, and he will soon be on his way. See and carefully consider the arts of that Emperor, and how cautiously he entangles the whole world in civil wars. You will soon see miserable England in turmoil. The Marquis still lives and is again preparing arms. If you have anything else, I would gladly hear from you. Live well, farewell, most excellent man. Hastily from Solothurn, August 22.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bas[safontaneus].</p>
      <p>Ten from the Emperor's chamber, most distinguished men, are among others taken in this conflict; this I have already.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>To be delivered to Mr. Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
