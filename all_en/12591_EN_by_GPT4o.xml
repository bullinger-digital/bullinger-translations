    <p xml:id="regest1">Ammann [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] has delivered everything that Vadian entrusted to him, including the letter in which Vadian explained the reasons for his silence. Bullinger has, of course, never doubted Vadian's friendship, but would be reluctant to do without his letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He thanks him for sending Luther's writings, which he will read when he has time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He deeply regrets what happened to the people of St. Gallen. However, they should know that the people of Zurich would never abandon them. They also often have to endure undesirable things. But this cannot be avoided when dealing with rough peasants!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Vadian will have already heard about the upcoming city meeting in Aarau next Sunday [August 29]. In this regard, the people of Zurich will probably send a messenger [Melchior Schlosser] to St. Gallen today.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Vadian will have already heard everything about Northern Germany. The Danes, the Swedes, and the Hanseatic cities are said to threaten the imperial Brabant. They are opposed by [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren and Martin von Rossem, who otherwise plan to reach the camp of Emperor [Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Today Bullinger was able to complete the nine books of his commentary on Luke. He has dedicated the work to Mayor Hans Welser. In four days, the last four pages (4 folia imprimenda) will have been published. Due to the war turmoil, [Christoph] Froschauer will not be going to [the next autumn book fair] in Frankfurt. Vogler will report further.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] Vadian should forward the enclosed letters [including No. 2543] to Constance.</p>

      <p>S. D. Ammann Hans Vogler the Elder has delivered everything that you entrusted to him, most esteemed lord, including your explanation for your silence, which has satisfied me, although I have never doubted your loyalty and friendship towards me. I indeed miss your letters and therefore sometimes express my complaint. However, I know to whom I am speaking.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will read the booklet of Luther of blessed memory when I find the leisure; in the meantime, I thank you for having gifted it to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have indeed heard with sorrow what has happened to your people; however, our people will never abandon the city of St. Gallen, to which they are sincerely well-disposed. Our people are also often forced to swallow what they find hard to digest. He who has to deal with rough peasants must endure much that is unreasonable.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You are not unaware, I believe, that the next Sunday a meeting is to be held in Aarau by the cities; but today, for that reason, if I am not mistaken, a messenger has been sent to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Lower Germany, we have nothing that you do not already know. The Danes, Swedes, and Hanseatic cities are said to threaten the Emperor's Brabant, against whom Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, and Martin von Rossem are advancing, who otherwise were to follow the Emperor's camp.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Today I finished the nine books of commentaries on the Gospel of Luke, which I have dedicated to Mayor Hans Welser of Augsburg. They will be completed within four days; for four pages remain to be printed. Christoph Froschauer will not go to Frankfurt due to the dangers of the journey. Vogler will add the rest.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 24, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Please ensure these letters are delivered to Constance.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, Mayor of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
