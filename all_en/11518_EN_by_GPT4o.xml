    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to Grynäus' report on the Worms Colloquium [No. 1469] and is grateful for its outcome. Christoph [Rotacher] deserves Bullinger's goodwill more than his colleagues, about whom Myconius prefers to remain silent. Received Bullinger's letter late. The people of Strasbourg and also a messenger from the Bishop of Basel have departed for the Imperial Diet; the princes have expressed concerns to the Emperor, yet [Johann Friedrich of] Saxony and [Philipp of] Hesse are preparing to participate; the Emperor wants to first negotiate the modalities of the talks but shows no inclination towards reforms. Elector [Joachim II.] is implementing the Reformation in Brandenburg and has appointed Erasmus Alber, who is generously paid; it is hoped that other princes will follow this example. Gessner returns to Zurich with the title of doctor; by nature, he is already a physician, but now he needs practical experience.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I hope that you are now finally satisfied, after you have understood everything that happened at the Worms Colloquium from Grynäus. I hear from laypeople who say that the assembly was much more precious than gold. What will those say whose eyes still look into the matter more diligently? Those ostriches are confused, even in front of those whom they have so far pleased wonderfully. We give thanks to the Lord, praying that we may glory in Him alone.</p>
      <p>You commend Christoph to me, and you do well. As for the others, we care for them as they wish to be cared for by us. If they do any good, I do not know; I know not a few bad things, especially about the other one. Therefore, Christoph is somewhat pained that you almost excuse their insolence; "for I see," he says, "that among our people, behaving well and honorably is the same as acting insolently." I indeed ignore what they do; for I have agreed only to be free from them. This is what they themselves greatly desired; for discipline can be nothing more troublesome, severe, and odious. But enough about this; I mention them reluctantly.</p>
      <p>The rest: Your last letters were delivered to me more than fourteen days after they were written; how this happened, I do not know. And this is the reason why I have been silent for so long.</p>
      <p>On the twenty-second of February, the people of Strasbourg again went to the Imperial Diet. The Bishop of Basel also sent a soldier, now an old man, as a very suitable envoy to the bishop. The princes wrote to the Emperor indicating how unjust it is in many ways if they have to go to Padua, and this because of the place, because of the enmities of certain princes, and because of many other inconveniences. We cannot know what he replied. However, it is rumored that he promised everything so safe that they prepare for the journey, but not without a multitude. This is especially said of Saxony and Hesse, for they are said to prepare up to five hundred horses. Although it is certain that the Emperor said the first consultation would be about a sincere and pious colloquy, he gives no sign at all of reforming the church. This is what some learned men have written to me these days.</p>
      <p>The Elector of Brandenburg has implemented the Reformation in his dominion. He called Erasmus Alber, a learned man and not unknown to me, to support the church in the Lord. He pays him two hundred and fifty gold coins annually.</p>
      <p>There is hope that other princes will soon follow. To conclude: Gessner returns to you adorned with the highest title given for good studies. And as far as I understand, he is not unworthy of the doctoral laurel, although young; for he is a physician not so much by knowledge as by nature. He still lacks practice, so it seems advisable that you provide for him until he has also acquired practical experience.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and brothers. Basel, March 8, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian, Antistes of the people of Zurich, in his Lord.</p>
