    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Myconius' letter [above No. 698] through the brother of F[ranz] Lambert on the same day that [Hans] Rudolf Frey obtained the approval of the Zurich council [for the planned convention]. Wishes to admit the Strasbourg people only towards the end of the consultations, as he fears useless talk and disputes and rejects the view they represent regarding the presence of Christ by virtue of official authority. Desires Vadian as the St. Gallen delegate. Approves the [communion formula adopted in Aarau].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most esteemed and beloved man, was delivered to me conveniently and in time by the brother of F[ranz] Lambert; for on the same day, that Rudolf Frey, a most upright and faithful man, fulfilled his mission and obtained what he sought from our council. We will meet, therefore, when it seems appropriate to our people. However, I would not like the people of Strasbourg to be present at the first meeting. I do not hate these men, God is my witness, nor do I curse or reject their conversation, but at present, I would not like them to be present at our discussion. You know how much they use a multitude of words, how many circumlocutions. We once heard Bucer among us discuss a matter that could have been explained in a few words for several hours. Therefore, it will happen that they will spend whole days discussing while matters remain unfinished if we admit them to the discussion. Und wirt nüt anders druß dann ein wild gehäck (a wild mess). The spirits of our people will also be disheartened when they hear their mitigations. They will find among your people and ours, indeed even among the Bernese, those who are pleased with the mitigation of all things. What will happen? Our people will be confused, and the whole populace will shout at us with this refrain: "We are being misled by these priests", "they disagree among themselves". However, if we, who have one confession, first conspire among ourselves and write down the simple and plain heads of doctrines and rituals, then it will be safe to admit the people of Strasbourg to the discussion, I say, to a discussion in which only the learned participate. You now consider the matter. For I cannot and will never approve of their desire to support the supernatural presence of Christ through the power of the ministry of the word. You will indicate the day in time, and you will call Vadian by name. For unless he is called and named, they will send another. More about this from Frey.</p>
      <p>The confession is not displeasing. I am pleased with what comes from you. You know the spirit I have towards you and Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The envoy is in a hurry.</p>
      <p>December 19, 1535.</p>
      <p>Greet Grynaeus, and the others as well.</p>
      <p>H. Bull. yours.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Myconius.</p>
