      <p>S. P. Your letter, most esteemed and beloved Bullinger, along with the transmitted Decade and the attached consolation, was most welcome to us, not only because it was full of Christian benevolence and piety, but also because it encouraged us to maintain gentleness in our current difficulties. Indeed, we are of the mind and purpose that in this whole state of affairs, we seek or expect nothing other than the glory of Jesus Christ alone, for the promotion and preservation of which we do not refuse to endure any miseries, any calamities, or any danger to life.</p>
      <p>And since all your efforts are connected with the true worship of God and piety, we cannot help but love and cherish you, and therefore, although we cannot repay you with great gratitude in these our straits, we nevertheless wish to reciprocate by gratifying you in every honorable kind of service. May Christ happily preserve you and your endeavors for His glory and the public salvation. Given at Buschhoven, October 18, in the year 1550.</p>
