    <p xml:id="regest1">Borrhaus thanks for the friendly reception of Gerhard Westerburg, whom he recommended, and recognizes Bullinger's friendly affection towards him. He would like to reciprocate this with a service. - Now an opportunity has arisen that is likely to serve Christ and his Church as well. - In the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”], with which the [Zürcher] have excellently justified themselves against Luther, Kaspar Schwenckfeld is mentioned in an unsatisfactory manner. Since Borrhaus believes that the Zürcher and Schwenckfeld argue similarly and are exposed to similar danger, he regrets this misunderstanding all the more with other kind-hearted people, as both Schwenckfeld's teaching and his way of life are welcomed by many as exemplary. Schwenckfeld celebrates the glory and the work of redemption of Christ. Therefore, Borrhaus wishes that the Zürcher and Schwenckfeld would come to an agreement before small differences of opinion escalate into a harmful quarrel to the greatest joy of the enemies and to the detriment of the Church, especially since books already written by Schwenckfeld and his followers are soon to be published, and it would therefore be important to agree on the doctrine beforehand. An agreement is all the more desirable as Schwenckfeld's teaching also enjoys many followers, and an unbiased study of Schwenckfeld's writings would be advisable before they are hastily condemned. After all, Christ has called for the new commandment of love for one's neighbor [John 13:34] and [Paul] has called for the examination of all [teachings] [1 Thessalonians 5:21]. - Borrhaus also harbored a poor opinion of Schwenckfeld for many years, especially because of his teaching on the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus. But when he devoted himself to the study of Schwenckfeld's writings, he soon had to change his view and found that the dispute was superficial and due to the words used. Both Schwenckfeld's refusal to call Christ a "creature" and his use of the word "transfiguration" initially displeased Borrhaus because it gives the impression at first glance that Schwenckfeld mixes the two natures of Christ or at least lets the human nature fall in favor of the divine. But soon Borrhaus had to realize that Schwenckfeld indeed holds on to both natures, but especially emphasizes how much Christ truly became the administrator of all things through his resurrection and exaltation as priest and eternal king, including the gifts of the Spirit. In him "dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" [Colossians 2:9], so that the incarnate Christ becomes equal to God in power and wisdom, and the [believer] becomes a partaker of the future glory; as Peter himself testifies [2 Peter 1:4]. - Borrhaus does not want to be called a defender of Schwenckfeld or even an intrusive arbitrator. His wish is to encourage the [Zürcher] to seek harmony and avoid harmful discord (a plague!). - It is said that Schwenckfeld also wishes for an agreement, especially with the Zürcher, whether through an exchange of letters or through a colloquium. - Bullinger should comply with this legitimate wish, as he would thereby serve Christ and the Church and also exercise his office excellently. Borrhaus willingly offers his help, especially since Christ declares the peacemakers blessed [Matthew 5:9], and because both Solomon [in Proverbs] and [Homer in the Iliad] abhor those who sow discord among brothers. - Borrhaus sends his regards to [Kaspar] Megander, [Konrad] Pellikan, Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, and Erasmus Schmid.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I was very pleased to hear about Gerhard Westerburg, that you received him in your home and treated him so generously; this kindness of yours, most humane Bullinger, although not new and not seeming to deviate from your nature, allowed me to recognize your excellent love and dedication towards me; for which I must greatly congratulate myself, and I understand that I must apply all diligence so that you may feel that I wish to respond to your merits towards me in some measure.</p>
      <p>But as I thought long and hard about an opportunity to show gratitude and remembrance, a matter presented itself, as I believe, by divine reason, about which, if I were to advise, I was confident I could gain no small favor with you, especially since I was persuaded that this effort of mine pertains to the glory of Christ and the tranquility of the church.</p>
      <p>In your apology published to Martin Luther concerning the sacred symbol of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus, among other things, which you discuss accurately and diligently, I read mention of Caspar Schwenckfeld, but in such a way that seemed unworthy to some, both for the cause you are advocating and for his character. For since you are engaged in the same argument, using the same weapons, and are thought to have sustained a common danger thus far, I see that good men are pained that you are so greatly alienated in this matter, in which it is least fitting, when you ought to be united in spirit and strength in such a difficult crisis. As for Schwenckfeld, he is approved by many for his doctrine and innocence of life. For he is said to maintain this integrity free from any suspicion of evil; and if one judges him truly, his doctrine is such that it greatly celebrates the greatness of Christ and brings great light of salvation to the pious. Although I should not interpose my judgment at present, I strive with this letter to make you understand that I am of the mind that I greatly desire, as is fitting, to establish concord between you and Schwenckfeld, lest the dissension, which has already begun to grow and raise its head moderately, should produce a pernicious discord, which would bring joy to the enemies of the gospel and sorrow and mourning to the church. Furthermore, as I hear, books are already prepared both by Schwenckfeld himself and by those who follow his doctrine, which are also about to be published soon; which indeed, if they can be prevented by any means from being published before you agree on the status of such doctrines, I think it would be of no small benefit to the dignity of Christ and the use of the churches. For, as it is rumored, Schwenckfeld's doctrine spreads further than expected, and is approved by many in private to be different than it appears at first glance. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to ensure that his books are read with great care, setting aside disturbances of the mind, and that the faith and hope of this man in the Lord are not rashly despised, of which one pertains to judgment, the other to love. And both are indeed of such a nature that men endowed with the spirit of Christ ought not to neglect them, for Christ has prescribed this law to us as new, that we love one another and do not despise the heavenly gifts in any of his own, but, keeping the apostle's admonitions, we test all things and embrace what is good.</p>
      <p>If you believe me, most illustrious Bullinger, I too for many years thought poorly of Schwenckfeld because of that deification of the Lord Jesus, but as soon as I applied my mind to reading and judging his little books, I began to be somewhat differently affected towards this man, and I discovered that in this dispute, in many places, it is more a matter of word-battling than of real contention. For as far as the creature is concerned, why Schwenckfeld does not want this term to apply to Christ, it was first necessary to see what he meant by the name of creature.</p>
      <p>But after this was neglected, the contention progressed to the point that, while neither side understood the other sufficiently, both parties seemed to have fought an uncertain battle. The same, if I judge correctly, I think happened in the use of deification. In this, because he seemed either to confuse the two natures of Christ or to remove the human nature, asserting only the divine (into which all of Christ's flesh had been absorbed), Schwenckfeld initially displeased me greatly, as an absurd teacher of heavenly matters. But when I began to examine the matter itself, with the faith and diligence I could muster, according to my limited ability, I recognized that his opinion was different from what was commonly spread. For I discovered that he confirmed both natures in Christ, but in such a way that the human, anointed with the fullness of divinity, had obtained all the glory of the Father through the resurrection from the dead and his adoption into the kingdom of majesty. In which kingdom, sitting at the right hand of God the Father, the man Christ has shed the old names (which he had while serving us in the state of the cross) and has taken on new ones, consistent with the divine nature, so that now truly Christ is said and ought to be said to govern all things, dispensing the gifts of the Holy Spirit, himself performing the priesthood and eternal reign through this intimate transfusion of the divine nature into the human (not the mere union of the word, as the sophists imagine). For we read that in him dwells the fullness of the deity bodily, and that all power in heaven and on earth is given to him, that he is anointed without measure with the holy spirit of the Father; through which anointing of the immense spirit, Christ the man is truly said to be equal to the Father in power and wisdom; of which we too are made partakers, but according to the measure of his gift, as of the head, with great consolation and undoubted hope of our similar transformation to the possession of future glory. About which partnership Peter says in these words: "You are partakers of the divine nature." Therefore, when Schwenckfeld seemed to me to hold these views, I began to think better of him and to embrace in him the gifts of the spirit of Christ, which had previously been suspect, through which he would attribute to the flesh exalted to the right hand of the Father the glory which the sacred letters attribute to it and the common faith of the saints acknowledges.</p>
      <p>But indeed, do not understand these things written by me in such a way that I wish to be considered either a defender or a judge of the doctrines of the Schwenckfeldians (which I do not at all assume for myself); but I only wish to act as an encourager, so that you may devise ways to establish concord and avoid the most harmful discord among the saints, the plague. Deliberate among yourselves.</p>
      <p>It is said that Schwenckfeld desires nothing so much as to be engaged with either letters about establishing tranquility or to be admitted to some gathering of learned and pious men, in which he may be allowed to present his views on the kingdom of Christ's glory; and they say he especially desires to do so with you, who profess the gospel of the kingdom in Zurich, to give an account of his faith. This request, O Bullinger, since it seems quite fair and suitable for making peace, I ask you again and again, that you may, with your wisdom, provide how the just will of this man may be satisfied in this matter. When you do this, you will have served the glory of Christ and the common good of the church in great measure and will have performed a work most worthy of your profession. In which matter, if you think I can achieve something with my effort, let me know. I will strive with all my might, so that you may know that neither faith nor diligence will be lacking in me.</p>
      <p>For I am not unaware of how great is the benevolence of God towards the authors of peace, according to the saying of our Lord: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God," as, on the contrary, those who disturb concord among brothers are held in the greatest hatred. Which, besides Solomon, the Greek poet also knows:</p>
      <p>He is without brotherhood, without law, without home, who loves the cruel war of the people.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and I ask you to consider my letter kindly. Impart my greetings to Megander, Pellican, Gwalther, Bibliander, and Erasmus Fabricius.</p>
      <p>In the year 1545, September 26.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in letters and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, friend and brother, to be revered.</p>
