      <p> Greetings. I received your letters through our Jacoud, most esteemed lord and godfather, along with copies of your sermons. And indeed, in this translation, you have rightly, prudently, and justly made certain changes regarding plagiarism, and I thank you for that. I am proceeding very slowly in translating this excellent and holy work of yours due to daily business, although I have progressed up to the last decade. If any fruit from this labor can return to the church, well, it is something for which I will give thanks to the Lord; if not, nevertheless, this exercise has been a great delight and benefit to me, and with this, I will be content. As for new matters, I have nothing to add to what I wrote to you a few days ago. Musculus writes, whom I do not doubt will share with you what he received from Mecardus. </p>
      <p> Among other things, he inserts this in his letters to Mr. Musculus: Then I ask for your judgment on the concord and agreement of Mr. Calvin and Bullinger in the matter of the Eucharist, which some urge greatly, as if it were something in between the Lutherans and Zwinglians and acceptable to all churches. And to this, the noble and learned baron Johannes a Lasco, etc., who is now in Denmark, encourages the most illustrious Elector Palatine and all other churches with his writing, that they may finally all unite against the Antichrist. May the Lord, in His mercy, grant that we all agree on this. Amen. This is what he says. Musculus will provide the rest. We wish to know for certain from you about the death of the pope; it is said that he has died. From England, too, we hear nothing but sad news, although there are those who affirm that the gospel is being preached steadfastly in Ireland and that nothing could be changed there by the queen. Without a doubt, a disastrous calamity threatens England, to which the Lord wished to precede such a clear proclamation of the truth. Would that we also recognize the time of visitation and meet the coming wrath with worthy fruits of repentance. Amen. All of ours greet you. I also wish to convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther, Pellican, and the other most esteemed lords and brothers. Also, please tell Gwalther, I pray, that the son of Johannes Wunderlich is detained by a quartan fever in Mr. Wittenbach's house, and this is the reason why they delay sending him to him, lest he wonder why this is happening or think that I have played with him, who obtained from him that he would receive him. As soon as he begins to feel better, he will come. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet in my name and that of mine. Bern, January 10, 1554. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
