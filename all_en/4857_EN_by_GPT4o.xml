      <p>Coel. Sec. Curio sends many greetings in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>When Mr. Martin Borrhaus handed me some of his questions to be sent to you, I thought, since I haven't done so for a while, to greet you with my letter, venerable and dearest Mr. Bullinger, and at the same time to add a few words about Velsius, who is traveling to you. He was here for several days and did not cease to publicly and privately demand, even with insults, that he be given the opportunity to dispute his doctrines, which he claims to be apodictic. He was given the freedom to discuss privately with individuals, whether ministers or doctors; but he was not allowed to dispute publicly, as his doctrines seemed to aim at disturbing and overthrowing the state of the church. However, Doctor Borrhaus wanted to propose these questions, which I am sending to you, in the ordinary disputation of this academy and to give him the opportunity to argue if he wished; but the proud man, as you will experience yourselves, inflated with his own opinion, bitterly detests and curses all in private and public, certainly unworthy of the spirit by which he claims to be driven to these endeavors.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write these few things to you, best brother and lord, on the occasion of sending Borrhaus's questions, who loves and respects you with me. The other one, whom you have known well for a long time, sits on two chairs and is not yet ashamed.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my best brother, together with all yours, whom I kindly ask you to greet. Basel, June 27, 1561.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zürich, my dearest and most honorable brother and lord. In Zürich.</p>
