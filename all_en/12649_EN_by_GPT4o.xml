    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer would like to respond as conscientiously to Bullinger's diligent letters [a letter not preserved and No. 2598]. He also strives to keep Bullinger as informed as possible. However, for several days there was nothing else to report except what [Georg] Frölich [with No. 2594] and he himself [with No. 2595] wrote to Bullinger and what the Konstanz council also communicated to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The only new thing is the battle [of September 25] with Emperor [Charles V], about which the Konstanz council will inform Zurich. In this, 30 enemy soldiers were killed, but none of the [Schmalkaldic League]. This war is peculiar. They move back and forth. The Emperor hopes that the [Schmalkaldic League] will run out of money and he can then easily destroy them. God can indeed change the situation, but something seems to be in the way at present. May He make it known to the [Schmalkaldic League]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- A famous mathematician [Peter Apianus?] is said to have predicted to the Emperor that he would die this year. When asked if he did not fear the Emperor's wrath, he replied that he need not worry about it because he too would die this year, which happened shortly thereafter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Other signs also indicate that the Emperor should be cautious; that despite all his prudence, he will not get far, as God catches the wise in their craftiness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In [Pruntrut] (in the territory of the Bishop of Basel [Philipp von Gundelsheim]), a woman is said to have caught fire and burned, with a black bird slipping into her sleeve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should know that Blarer has received all his letters. If only the [Schmalkaldic League] had the fearlessness expressed in Bullinger's letters!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [The Schmalkaldic League] believes they are doing everything possible. The same opinion is held by the captain [Hans] Egli, who returned to [Konstanz] due to his gout and other ailments. He praises the fearless and persistent Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]. He reported how the [Schmalkaldic League] used about 12,000 guilders worth of [gun]powder and bullets in four days to bombard the imperial camp. Had they continued for two more days, the imperial forces would have been defeated. However, they ran out of ammunition. So far, about 3,000 imperial soldiers are said to have fallen against only about 100 [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- God seems to want to help the [Schmalkaldic League], but it is as if something is in His way. May the [Schmalkaldic League] recognize and remove the obstacle!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The Italian and German [imperial] mercenaries are dissatisfied. Several have [deserted]. The Emperor has ordered their arrest and execution. He also organized a [controlled] mutiny in the camp to identify the ringleaders of the desertion. He had several of them beheaded. Egli also confirms this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- No further Italians are expected to join, as they fear the epidemic rampant in the imperial army and the [cold] season is approaching. Unfortunately, it is very much feared that the war will drag on over the winter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Blarer was pleased to hear from Bullinger's report about the Diet in Baden the response of the French envoy [Antoine Morelet du Museau] to the [Five] places. May God prevent a conflict among the Confederates! He will likely enlighten or then punish [the Catholic places].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The Bernese's plan [to appoint an orthodox pastor regarding the Eucharist] is truly commendable. The Zurichers should send someone whose wisdom and moderation will affirm this desire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- The pastors sent by the Baslers to Augsburg [Sebastian] Lepusculus and Hieronymus Gunz traveled through Konstanz on [September 28].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Only good things are heard about the Swiss [mercenaries in Schmalkaldic service]. Nothing is known about the disorder mentioned by Bullinger, which is said to prevail in Füssen among them. On behalf of the Konstanz council, Konrad Zwick is departing for Füssen today. He will inquire about the situation and do his best. Upon his return in eight days, Blarer will report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Blarer is relieved to know that [Hans] Schöner has received the money sent by his sister [Sabina]. He immediately informed the sister of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Greetings, especially to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Bullinger's warning in favor of the Landgrave will be heeded by the Konstanzers, even if many have already informed him about it. It is very pleasing that the Landgrave wrote to Bullinger [No. 2581]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Greetings from [Thomas] Blarer and the departing Zwick. Bullinger should pray for the success of the task received from Zwick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- [P.S.:] A wealthy widow [...] from Augsburg, who is staying with her daughter [...] for a few weeks in [Konstanz], conveys a message received from her son [...] about the vile actions and plundering of the Spaniards in Bavaria. They are said to have attacked and set fire to the village of Thierhaupten. The outraged inhabitants defended themselves, killed 300 Spaniards, and hanged 40 prisoners. If this is true, it would be a fine example of how God punishes the enemies by causing them to kill each other!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- A wealthy Florentine [Piero Strozzi], who wants to take revenge on the Emperor, offered the [Schmalkaldic League] a large sum of money interest-free.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- From Memmingen, it is written that an old woman [...] in a nearby village [...] prophesied three weeks ago that the Emperor would be slain on the Lechfeld on September 29, and as confirmation of her statement, she dated her own death. On the reported day, she then also died. The Emperor probably owes the postponement of his death to the masses and other holy acts of the clergy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">- Blarer is surprised that Bullinger did not report on the reaction of the Confederates when they learned that in Memmingen their messenger [Konrad Schweri] (as soon as his mission was known) had the letter intended for the Emperor [from the Nine Places] taken and sent to the Landgrave. It is said that the [Nine Places] are very dissatisfied and want to start a war. Hopefully, it will not come to that!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">- Regarding [Francesco di] Castellalto, something will also be done to be clear about his intentions. Everything will probably turn out well.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wish I could respond to your diligent letters with equal diligence, my venerable and dearest Bullinger! I certainly wish to please you in this matter, as you have requested so often and so earnestly. I would be damned if I had neglected anything here due to my own fault. For several days now, nothing new has been reported beyond what either Lętus and I have written to you or what our council has written to yours, and even now I have nothing further to add.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is nothing new that I know of, except what has already been written to you about the skirmish between our forces and the Emperor, where we lost no men, but he lost over thirty and many were captured. In short: it is a peculiar war. They devour each other like one moves the ninth stone, and the Emperor hopes to capture our forces. After that, he thinks there will be no need, as he will become our master. But when the time comes, God can arrange it so that he will overlook the opportunity. The situation is not quite right, and there is something in the way, whatever it may be, that prevents us from advancing. May God remove it and also give us the insight to recognize and improve it! He will never abandon us and will eventually show His glory and majesty upon us in a way we have never thought of or hoped for.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is said that a renowned mathematician predicted to the Emperor that he would die this year. When some people asked him why he dared to say such a thing, whether he was not afraid the Emperor would not take it well, he replied: "I do not care about the Emperor's wrath, for I too will die this year," and he indeed died shortly thereafter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Truly, the other signs also indicate something significant that the Emperor should rightly be concerned about. Even if God wills it, it will not help that he acts with all caution and hopes to slowly and gradually destroy us. The Lord is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It has been written here that in Trutbrun or Trutbach or Truthausen (the name escapes me, but the first syllable is Trut, and it is in the territory of the Bishop of Basel), a woman was sitting in front of her house on the street, and a black bird flew into her sleeve, and from that moment she began to burn, so that no one could help her. She was completely burned. They think there is something to it. You will now be informed of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have received all your letters, for which I thank you most diligently. I always hope that it may bring benefit. I wish our people were as fearless and determined as you write so courageously and bravely! Through persistent prayer, we will be able to achieve much with the Lord; let us call upon Him without ceasing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Our people write otherwise and believe that nothing is neglected that can be done. Captain Eckle also says this. He has come here these days, sick with gout and otherwise. He says he is an old mercenary and soldier, but he has never seen such wars in all his days as the Landgrave does: he is so completely fearless and persistent. They have fired 12,000 guilders worth of powder and bullets into the Emperor's camp in four days. And if they could have held out for two more days, they would have had to surrender or flee disgracefully. But there was not enough powder, as the gunners did not expect that so much would be fired in such a short time. It is believed that about 3,000 of the Emperor's men have perished so far, while our side has lost not more than 100.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>God does nothing else but seems to want to help us, but there is something in the way that hinders Him on our behalf. Oh, that He may grant us the insight and grace to recognize and remove it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Italians have been dissatisfied; so have the Germans. Many have withdrawn, so the Emperor has ordered them to be praised everywhere and, wherever they go, to be hanged. He has also caused a mutiny among the soldiers and announced in the camp that those who no longer wish to serve should stand in one place, and the others in another. Thus, a large crowd stood in one place, unwilling to serve further. But the leaders and instigators were identified and many of them beheaded, so that now the others remain unwilling. Captain Eckle also reports this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>It is not expected that fresh Italians will come out, as they fear the epidemic that has now broken out in the Emperor's army. Moreover, it is too late in the season, and it is feared that we will have to endure a winter camp.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What you wrote to me about the day in Baden, I was pleased to hear about the French envoy's response to the places. May the dear God prevent a Confederation from being torn apart, although it is to be expected that God will soon enlighten them or punish them severely and terribly. The others can and will be saved by Him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The Bernese's plan is entirely commendable. Do not neglect the opportunity offered, and send those whose Christian prudence and modesty will confirm this counsel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Three days ago, Lepusculus and Hieronymus Guntius, sent by the Baslers, left for Augsburg to appoint ministers to the churches in need.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>We hear nothing but good things about your Confederates. We know nothing yet of the disorder you write about, which is said to be among them in Füssen. But my dear cousin Konrad Zwick is leaving today for our people there on behalf of my lords. He will inquire about everything and handle it as best as he can. When he returns in eight days, as we hope, I will report further to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I am relieved to hear that the money has reached Schöner. I have written to his sister about it. Consider this good for now. I cannot, do not know more at this time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Greet the friends and brothers, your ministers, and commend us to the Lord in your holy intercessions. Commend me in turn to Lavater with all due respect.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>What you have advised about the Landgrave will be of concern to us, although he is repeatedly advised by many to be extremely cautious. I am very pleased with what he wrote to you. We certainly live if he stands firm in the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Farewell again and again, my dearest brother. The last day of September. My brother and Zwick, who is about to leave, send their regards to you, for whom you should pray that the Lord may bless his journey. I was not able to reread this. Therefore, forgive the many errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19"/>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his greatest and most faithful brother and friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>Also, now comes news from a wealthy widow from Augsburg (who has stayed here with her daughters for several weeks) about her son, how the Spaniards are behaving extremely badly in Bavaria. They have robbed everything they found in many places and plundered. And how they also attacked and set fire to a village named Thierhaupten, as the people were unwilling, a part of the local population banded together and killed about 300 Spaniards, also capturing and hanging about forty. That would be a fine judgment of God, that our enemies destroy and kill each other in such a way!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Also, a wealthy Florentine has come out, whom the Emperor has greatly harmed, and he would like to take revenge on him. He offers to lend a large, notable sum of gold without any interest to support the war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>Also, it is written from Memmingen as a complete truth that an old woman somewhere in a village not far from Memmingen prophesied three weeks ago that the Emperor would be slain on St. Michael's Day on the Lechfeld, and that it is true, she also determined her own death in a few days, which she specified. And the woman has now died. We will now wait at any moment to see how it stands with the Emperor. But it is to be feared that his clergy, with their devout masses and other holy exercises, will well earn him an extension of his life! May the good will of God be done in this and everything, etc.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that you have not written to me at all about how the Confederates reacted to the messenger who wanted to go to the Emperor's camp and then behaved in such a way in Memmingen that the letters were taken from him and sent to the Landgrave. For it is said that they are very dissatisfied and want to start a war. One must let it happen, but one will hope for something better.</p>
      <p>With the Castellalto, one will also act to know where one stands. One still hopes and rightly so, that things will turn out well. May the dear God grant it with much grace! We are entrusted to Him.</p>
      <p>Given as in the letters.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
