      <p>Greetings. I owe you and Philipp Galliziani, an excellent and most learned man, great thanks for the faithful work done for the Rhaetians, whom I have no doubt are appeased, after your authority intervened and they saw the abilities with which they were noted.</p>
      <p>However, I have so earnestly requested through a delegation to our republic to avoid a complaint, because I feared that (as has happened before) the prejudices of the senate might also hinder other pious and fruitful studies of scholars; otherwise, nothing is sown or reaped from there for me. I received the money to be sent to Paris from the courier, and since Jacob de Puys is already here, I will consult with Mr. Frobenius, so that the students may receive their due with minimal loss. I am sending 15 gold crowns, which a certain Antwerpian, passing through here from Italy, left with me, asking that I ensure they are delivered to Lelio Sozzini, because he had received them from his father. For since I do not doubt that you know where he is now residing, and some affirm that he himself has set out with Bernardino Ochino to the Rhaetians, I wanted to send them to you, who (I know) will willingly provide assistance to a pious man and friend, either in keeping them safe or, when the occasion arises, in sending them to him. It is very pleasing to hear that the brothers from Locarno are being cleared of the suspicion of vanity, with which they were heavily burdened by the slanders of some very malevolent people. I have not yet learned what news our people have brought; however, there are those who report that the subjects of the Abbot of Kreuzlingen are causing a tragedy for their lord over a minister of the word, whom they received back against his will after he had been dismissed by him. However, I fear that in Baden, where the controversy is to be decided, the greater part will prevail over the better. It is also reported that about 400 citizens of Constance have sent a supplicatory petition to Ferdinand through a delegation, so that with his permission and grace they may have free preaching of the gospel within the city, at least in some temple. Therefore, the Lord must be asked to mercifully incline the heart of the king, so that he may acquiesce to this most pious request; for if this can be obtained, it will be an opportunity for a door to be opened to Christ in many other places, as the king's domain is almost everywhere ripe for the harvest, desiring the evangelical sickle. Albert of Bavaria rages savagely against piety; he has instituted an inquisition in many places not unlike the Spanish one. About 70 citizens in Burghausen have been thrown into custody because they used both forms (as they call it) of the sacrament. In Munich, however, where a considerable part of the citizens have tasted the gospel, when he ordered some of them to be led into chains, those who were commanded did not obey, and with admirable constancy. The Archbishop of Salzburg, whom he has indeed used as a teacher here, has driven many into exile for the sake of religion; but both kick against the goad, about to experience the avenging hand of God. Meanwhile, it is our duty to seriously and constantly commend the afflicted saints to the prayers of our churches. The Ulm senate recently ordered the Interimists and Papists to leave the first temple, so that there may be a place for evangelical ministers there, and to grant them to the Dominicans or Franciscans; for they are not yet so advanced that they wish their city to be entirely free from idolatry, still limping with one shoulder in favor of the eagle.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly sent the money of your people to your young men on another occasion than through Jacob de Puys; but since no other bearer was offered and it cannot even be hoped for due to the difficulties of the times, and other merchants also always tend to deduct something for their fee, it seemed to Mr. Frobenius, whose advice I used, that it should be entrusted to him, whom we will both seriously ask to pay it at the earliest possible time and with the least inconvenience to the excellent young men, because he will leave it here, as it is otherwise not very safe to transport money now. But farewell in the Lord with all yours, whom I wish you to kindly greet in my words. Basel, July 20, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
