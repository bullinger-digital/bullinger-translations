    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only now report on the concord matter: Zurich has agreed [to the letter to Luther], as has Bern despite reservations, as evidenced by the quotes from its letter to the Zurich pastors [No. 919]. Things are not going well in Schaffhausen. [Johannes] Zwick reports in a long letter [No. 921] about the regrettable presumption of the people of Strasbourg; Bullinger intends to write to Bucer and also urges Vadian to do so. Danger threatens from Asia. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>From the very day I returned home, most illustrious man, no messenger has been presented to me to whom I could write letters to you. Therefore, regarding the concord, here is what I have: Our people have accepted everything voluntarily, just as it was formulated in Basel, and they have confirmed their acceptance in writing to the people of Basel. The people of Bern have also accepted everything, except that they thought the response we prepared for the people of Strasbourg should not be sent to Luther himself. In the meantime, they wish that the people of Strasbourg send it to Doctor Luther as intermediaries. Then, in their letters to us, who are in charge of the word, they say among other things: "If Luther could not compare our confession, which is divine, well-founded, holy, and clear, we would be compelled to show our understanding, teaching, and practice of the sacraments in Latin and German to the princes and lords of the world and to defend our truth and innocence against all fabricated complaints and suspicions before all people, etc." These things, the senators and deacons also address us very amicably about other matters, etc. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the consent of the people of Bern. For in those very letters given to us, they say: "We have endured the response set up in Basel by the appointed ones and let it be entirely consistent and conforming to our praiseworthy disputation and also to the previously prepared matters among us regarding these things."</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Schaffhausen, I know what you write. I fear that many things are deplorable among them. For there are those who favor the Anabaptists, those who support the Papists, and others blinded by French and Toulouse gold.</p>
      <p>Zwick has explained in a long letter the insolence and audacity of the people of Strasbourg. I am very sorry about this. However, I will write to Bucer shortly. It will not be without fruit if you also write.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are going quite well. Thanks be to God. I fear that the Asiatic rod (the Turkish threat) may horribly scourge our iniquities. May the Lord have mercy on us. You do me a most welcome favor if you occasionally inform me of such matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell for a long time, a man most esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>On the day of Saint Lucia, 1536.</p>
      <p>Greet my Dominicus for me as familiarly as possible.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, my esteemed and honored lord.</p>
