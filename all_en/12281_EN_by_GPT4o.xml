    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius remains silent because Bullinger is silent, and also due to a lack of [noteworthy] content, because of his workload, and due to [missing] messengers. Since Bullinger's rejection, Myconius has been avoided by almost all Zurichers. He wanted to visit Bullinger a few months ago, but he became ill. Now he can make up for what he missed. - He recommends the bearer [...], a Saxon who comes from Strasbourg, brings Bucer's writing [„De concilio“] against [Johannes] Cochläus, wishes to visit the leaders of the church and school of Zurich, and wants to travel on to Milan. Bullinger should advise him on which route to take: whether through Graubünden or through Uri over the Gotthard. - Myconius thanks for the poem he was looking for [„De quinque primariis evangelicae doctrinae instauratoribus“] by the ungrateful Gwalther. Unfortunately, there was no letter from Bullinger included in the shipment. - [Petrus] Dasypodius informed Myconius about the death of [Kaspar] Megander. Hopefully, a good and pious man will be found as a replacement! - News: In Alsace, an army is being raised; supposedly to prevent the Lord [Claude I of Lorraine, Duke of] Guise from occupying Lorraine. A military leader [...] reported that in the name of the Protestants, 36 companies are to be sent to [King Henry VIII] of England for his fight against [King Francis I] of France. - Emperor [Charles V] has issued an edict against [Duke Henry of Brunswick], who had insulted him as a violator of alliances and defender of heretics. - It is certain that Pope [Paul III] has gathered an army against the Protestants, which is camped near the Alps. - What is the purpose of the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion initiated by [Charles V] and not approved by the Papists? These are mere trifles! - Someone [...], who came directly from Trent, reported about the procurement of prostitutes from Venice [for the council participants]. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Because you are silent, I too remain silent, although in the meantime your silence has not always held me back, but rather the lack of writing material, business, or messengers; for since the time you almost rejected me and have written nothing, no one from Zurich approaches me, no one greets me, no one is a friend except for a few, even among those whom I know I have deserved well, even by their own testimony. Despite these things, I had decided a few months ago to greet you, but the Lord afflicted me with a severe hand, so that even the doctors began to doubt somewhat about my life. Meanwhile, as I was dealing with the Lord and struggling with illness, there was neither the ability nor the opportunity to write. Now that I have been restored, I have the opportunity to finally fulfill my previous intention.</p>
      <p>The Saxon who delivers my letters comes from Strasbourg; he brings a book by Bucer against Cochläus, your enemy. He dines with me and tells me of his plan, namely to go to Zurich to see the church and your school along with the learned men presiding there. Here I say: "I will write, unless time forbids." Therefore, I commend him to you, so that you may at least assist with advice; he intends to visit Milan. You can inform him whether it is easier to travel through Graubünden or through Uri and over the Gotthard. As for him, I ask nothing else. I then thank you for the poem by Gwalther, the most ungrateful man towards me. The little gift was very welcome. It would have been more welcome if it had included yours. After the Lord restored me, I searched for the poem in vain and cannot hope that I will find it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Dasypodius informed me of the death of Megander. I grieve, as is fitting, and I ask that the Lord fill his place in the church with a worthy man, that is, a good and pious one; for the church today has more need of such than of learned men. News: An army is being gathered through Alsace, it is not known for what purpose. However, there is a rumor that the Lord of Guise is to be prevented from occupying Lorraine. A certain leader reported the collection of 36 companies in the name of the Protestants to be sent to England against France, which I do not understand. An edict is said to have been issued against the Duke of Brunswick by the emperor, who was gravely irritated by letters not to be borne, in which he was called a violator of the pact, a defender of heretics, and I do not know what other very turbulent titles. If this is true, I indeed marvel.</p>
      <p>It is certain that soldiers have already been gathered by the Roman pontiff against us and have settled not far from the Alps. Where they have now reached is unknown. The discussion initiated by the emperor, not approved by the papists, what do you think it means? To me, it seems like nonsense. May the Lord direct it according to His will.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Council of Trent, someone who came directly from there said among some of our citizens: "I know this, that because there were not enough prostitutes, they called not a few from Venice; besides, I do not know what they have done." May the Lord Jesus protect His church, for it is gravely afflicted.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your household and all pious brothers. Greet Theodor and Pellican for me.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 4, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and best Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, his lord in Christ, to be respected. Zurich.</p>
