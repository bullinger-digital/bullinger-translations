    <p xml:id="regest1">The intention was to write together with Thomas [Blarer] and Konrad [Zwick], but the former must depart with Ambrosius [Blarer's] wife, and therefore Zwick has handed over his own letter to Bullinger [No. 592]; the statement from the Zwick brothers will follow later. Encloses a letter from Bucer to one of the mayors of Augsburg and requests its return. Froschauer has asked for a preface to a German-Latin [New] Testament.

      <p>Greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>We had decided to write a joint letter to you, dearest brother, namely Thomas, Konrad, and I, but unavoidable matters have prevented this from happening. Now Thomas, about to depart with Ambrosius's wife, has given this letter, which you see here, and instructed me to read it, then send it to you sealed. However, I could not yet write to you about my brother's and my own thoughts. This will be done soon enough.</p>
      <p>So that you do not hold my delay against me, here I send Bucer's letters to the mayor of Augsburg, from which you might understand the benefit of our meeting with this excellent man. One might well quibble in this case. But that was well said in German. However, be careful that the letter is not spread, then return it through this messenger. For I have no copy.</p>
      <p>Froschauer writes about a certain preface to a German-Latin Testament. I do not understand what he means by this. I do not know what moves the good man, as there are thousands more suitable for this task among you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>My brother, cousin Thomas, and I would like you to take a walk to Stein, for we would come to you, neglecting all business, if you were now inclined to take a walk. We would also have much to discuss, not idle talk. Would to God that it were possible for you!</p>
