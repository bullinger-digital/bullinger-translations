    <p xml:id="regest1">There is not only a constant lack of messengers, but he also suffered for two weeks from a carbuncle and could neither thank for the commentary on Matthew nor forward the dispatch from [Johannes] Gast; he recommends the messenger. Bullinger should take care of his health for the sake of the church. It is said that Bucer will return home only for a short time. Bullinger has probably already heard of the defeat of Mary [Regent of the Netherlands] [at Sittard] and the murder of evangelical sermon listeners from Metz at Easter; the monastery [Gorze] is now back in French hands, and Count Wilhelm [of Fürstenberg] is seeking support from [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, who is allegedly recruiting troops. According to a letter from a Polish nobleman transmitted from Wittenberg, the Hungarians have driven the Turks out of Buda; Myconius would like to know more about it; if it is true, Vadian is probably aware of it. Cannot write more; regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Besides the fact that I am constantly lacking messengers, I have been bedridden for fourteen days with a carbuncle, as women call it. I have finally recovered by the grace of the Lord; however, I am still unable to respond to you or thank you for your commentary on Matthew, as my head is not yet fully restored. I have kept this dispatch from Gast with me for over three weeks due to the reasons I mentioned, and because I did not dare to entrust it to just anyone. Finally, I have found the man you see, a good man, whom I would like you to have, if you need his services, recommended.</p>
      <p>You have caused me great pain due to your health; for it is to be feared that it may worsen with age, because you do not spare yourself enough. Something must be taken away from those perpetual labors, and you must think about the church entrusted to you by the Lord, so that you may be able to preside over it for as long as possible, as much as it is in your power.</p>
      <p>For the sake of the Lord, I beg you, do not neglect yourself.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing about Bucer, except that he is supposed to return home in May, but will not stay long due to the magnitude of his affairs; the evangelical harvest is great, but the laborers are very few.</p>
      <p>As for Mary, the sister of Charles, being defeated by the Duke of Jülich on the eve of Easter, and on Easter day many from Metz being killed for listening to the evangelical sermon, you have surely heard. The monastery given to Count Wilhelm is now again held by the French. The Count has gone to complain to Hesse. What will happen, I do not know. There is a rumor that Hesse is recruiting soldiers.</p>
      <p>Someone from Wittenberg wrote, or rather sent letters from a certain Polish nobleman, that Buda was recaptured from the Hungarians by a remarkable stratagem, with all the Turks killed to the last man. If there is any truth to this, I beg you to inform me. If there is any truth, it is unlikely that Lord Vadian, the consul, is unaware of it.</p>
      <p>I am not allowed to converse with you at length. Farewell through the Lord Jesus with your family, with Theodor, and with Pellican, my dearest ones.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of May in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, my brother in the Lord, most venerable. Zurich.</p>
