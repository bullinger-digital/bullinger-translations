      <p>Greetings in the Lord. You cannot believe with what eagerness I received what you wrote against the new founders of papism, a matter long awaited and desired. I will read it with the utmost diligence and return it through a faithful messenger; do not doubt.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has pardoned all the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League, except for some who want to appear French; they are hiring soldiers in the Sundgau and giving them wages.</p>
      <p>It will come to a head in the summer. The Emperor wants to place Lady Maria, the Queen of Hungary, in Dole in Burgundy; for preparations are already being made there for her. What this will mean, we will soon understand. I suspect the Emperor will place Philip, who is now in Augsburg, in the Fugger's house, in custody, so that he can keep the German lands in peace and he can gather an army in Milan, a place where he can collect a rabble of men from all nations.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg is wavering; the great council has handed it over to the small council. All the preachers unanimously oppose all who approve of the Interim and do not want to consent to it in any way. If they accept that impious religion, they will all emigrate to wherever the Lord calls them. But hey, what does this mean? The people of Freiburg have forbidden dancing, as have other noblemen, precisely at the time when people feast, drink, dance, play, and engage in all sorts of foolish things. Some think the Emperor is dead.</p>
      <p>I will add a ridiculous story. The lord of Mörsburg has captured an Anabaptist and a man burdened with many other sects, and he handed him over to the peasants to judge him. The peasants decided that he should be exiled from the land. The Anabaptist refused to swear an oath. The peasants handed him back to the lord of Mörsburg. It happened that the new bishop of Basel, a monk from Lützel, was in Sennheim (Cernay), a small town where Gravella was almost burned. They brought the man before the bishop, who spoke to him with great skill; the poor man said: "You devil's child, what are you saying? Your clothing shows that you have strayed from God; therefore, if you want to make God's creatures better than God, you are avoiding God's elements. But God will soon lay you low with all your followers." He would not speak another word to the bishop. This bishop said to the lord of Mörsburg: "This man is possessed." So they decided to take him to Reiningen to be exorcised. He was taken there in the great cold, placed in cold water, in a tub, exorcised by priests, bathed, beaten, and exorcised; they could not bring him to his senses, like a madman. The poor man said to the priest: "Why do you torment me, a poor man? I have no devil with me; take the monk, he has a proud devil with him, strangle him; then you will experience much evil." So they put him back in prison. Then the Anabaptist said: "If all the priests and monks are not miserably killed before Invocavit, I will return to the old faith" etc. See what kind of revelation this man had. If only it would happen while I am alive and seeing it.</p>
      <p>A theologian from Montbéliard is supposed to come, a Parisian called Ricardotus; they say he is very learned in Greek and Latin, excellent in Hebrew letters. He will be sent by the bishop of Besançon to confer with our Toussaint. They say the rascal is very eloquent. He preached in Italy for several years, therefore he is called Brentius, whom no one knows among foreigners. Thus the papists are accustomed to doing everything secretly. If they achieve nothing by this means, they attack with arms and tyranny.</p>
      <p>What will happen now that the Swiss have been given a response? The misery of the people of Constance does not affect me, because they did not want it otherwise. Farewell with all yours, and greet Bibliander and the others in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 5, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
