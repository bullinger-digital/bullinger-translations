      <p>S. I gladly read about England, what that learned man wrote to you. There are those who write that it is being torn apart by foreign wars and internal dissensions, not only by the Pope's but also by the Emperor's schemes. May the Lord therefore grant that nation a desire for concord, so that they may understand the great evils they are involved in by neglecting it. Our Constance, thrice miserable today, swears allegiance to Ferdinand, with two cohorts of soldiers admitted and all power handed over to those sent by Ferdinand to occupy that old city. The general opinion of the most wretched populace there is that they would rather have their city incorporated into the House of Austria than be vexed by so many inconveniences in the name of the empire. They have accepted the Interim, as the Emperor had urged them to; now they can no longer remain with the Interim, they will become servants of all things and altar servers. This must now be allowed to happen, as they wish it so. Thomas Blaurer has slipped away to I know not where. They say the same of Zwick and Ludwig Hyruss; for Hieronymus is still in the city and among the principal ones is Christopher Schultheiss; but they say only the scribe has changed. Thus we see, discord brings about those more bitter Babylonian confusions. I send you the letters from England with a copy of the German Pasquinade and have nothing else to send along. When anything is brought, I will make sure you have it.</p>
      <p>Regarding Philip, what you wrote, I was very surprised. However, I would wish that he might hide somewhere in Switzerland, which I certainly would not consider unfortunate with such a guest. For Germany today does not have another man of whom I could promise myself greater and firmer things against the satanic wickedness of tyrants than I usually do of Philip alone, nor would it be necessary for everything to be published immediately; many things must be suppressed and reserved for their time, nor will that miserable state of affairs, which we see today, be perpetual. The churches of Christ have often suffered similar and, if I am not mistaken, even harsher things, and indeed from princes bearing the Christian name, as you know.</p>
      <p>Our Jacob Br√ºllisauer departed from this life on the 7th of October of this year at the eleventh hour of the day, remarkably constant in himself up to his last breath and with such faith in Christ that it was a miracle to me how his mind could have been so suddenly converted by the Lord's gift, who was suspected by many good people for the mere name of despised religion. For three whole days before he passed, he spoke so piously and copiously about our death, the life of Christ, and leaving the world, that it was a wonder to all. He was vexed for about eight nights by some specter or rather angel, whether good or bad the Lord knows, who often after, even before midnight, approached his bed, first with a noise turning over papers perhaps found and opening books placed here and there, then closing them, then moving stools to Jacob's bed, then lifting things nearby and dragging them here and there with great noise, finally throwing some things towards the approaching day, but more rarely. He was earnestly asked once and again by Jacob to leave and cease to trouble him and his pregnant wife, but in vain. But when he explained the whole matter to me in the presence of his wife, it seemed that a separate bed should be made for Jacob himself in the lower room, with watchmen who would pray together and be at hand for the patient who was daily getting worse. When this was done, everything was better and more peaceful, and his wife with two children was completely freed from that inconvenience. Jacob himself interpreted it so obstinately as a message of his death that he openly said he would submit to the doctors for the sake of redeeming one conscience, even if he were certain that his life would not be longer. So much for our Jacob. Farewell and greet Lord Musculus in my name. St. Gallen, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed Bishop of Zurich, his revered lord.</p>
      <p>S. When I had sealed these previous ones, a messenger arrived with yours, which I read with great delight. How much more I would prefer Philip to Brentius, even if Brentius is not ungrateful in the name of public misery; but no one after Luther has caused such tumult in the matter of the Eucharist. Would that, warned by adverse events, we might all strive for this one thing, that according to the apostle, the churches which claim purer doctrine might be of one mind! For it cannot be believed that they profess the same faith, who are so divided by conflicting interpretations of the Scriptures. Yesterday, 14 ships with armed sailors arrived in Constance; they came from Bregenz and down the Rhine with about 9 ships; they had been very quiet until the approach. Be very careful, for they intend to occupy the city. The gates leading to Thurgau have been firmly closed, and all the Emperor's wrath will be to the good use of the House of Austria, to which Constance has now been incorporated. It will serve their expansion, and there the foremost seat of the Duchy of Swabia will be established, which the Emperor and Ferdinand certainly intend to arrange. The Gospel is suppressed. It will cause great dispersion and a notable offense, that the common people, so distrustful of their superiors, have fallen away and come to such desperate counsels for the sake of their own benefit. But what can one say? The priest's servants do not like to let the fattest soups cool before the door. The fishermen in Constance have long wanted it; it will happen now. May God keep us from such falls. Amen.</p>
      <p>- Johannes Haller does not doubt in his letters to me that Lord Musculus will obtain some notable place for sowing the word. If anything can be done by my help for this matter, I will not refuse any labor that can benefit such a great man. I send everything back perhaps later than I wanted; but some things were also returned to me slowly by friends. Farewell. On the day above. Joachim Vadian. To the most learned man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
