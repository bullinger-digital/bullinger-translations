    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's commentary on the Epistles of the Apostles and was particularly pleased with the friendly letter; the well-designed and well-written commentary is an enrichment and will serve well in preaching. Is grateful for Bullinger's encouragement [of the church servants] to better fulfill their duties, recognize their own mistakes, and remain vigilant so that the church will one day appear pure and good. Recommends himself to Leo Jud. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord to you, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You sent me the book of commentaries on the canonical epistles of the apostles of Christ, our Savior, a truly excellent and useful book, along with the most delightful letters revealing your most friendly spirit towards me, which indeed I could not receive anything more pleasing or from which I could derive more enjoyment, especially since in these we are allowed to converse or communicate about the expenditure of our common holy religion even when absent. Pardon the word, for there are indeed pious conversations. You have indeed delayed the most desired communication of your letters for a long time, but not without interest. Therefore, I have nothing to repay you with, dearest friend. This alone is left to me, that I commend you and those like you to the Lord with whatever prayers I can, so that He may cause you to grow in the glory of His name, but in what concerns the flesh, to your detriment; for we shall be great, as you know, if in this world we are the refuse and offscouring. I seemed to myself (I speak without flattery) to have grasped a cornucopia; for as the speech of the holy apostles is most delightfully varied, so must your annotations be, as they are indeed, which sacred scripture mentions elsewhere. For it is not fitting for the paraphrases of a faithful theologian to be anything other than a decent and suitable composition of the sacred writings. That book also offered itself to us conveniently, since it is necessary for us in our church (though unequal to this task) to admonish from the epistles of the apostles; if my work has achieved anything, with the Holy Spirit ministering, you too will be no small partaker in the sanctity of the church.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to continually pray to the Lord that we may be able to fulfill the duties of our office both in word and deed. To which I also ask you to often add a spur and goad, since we ourselves often do not see what is on the back of the wallet. What you advised in your letter, about those eager for war, cannot be said how pleasing it was. Also, make sure to keep watch over us, dearest brother, always. For you know how many contagions can attack us and harm the flock of Christ; therefore, it is indeed necessary for you to diligently ensure with us that it is most carefully guarded and that it may someday emerge as the holy, innocent, and immaculate bride of Christ, our Lord, with the grace of the Lord accomplishing this, to whom you, dearest brothers, should earnestly introduce us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Also, please greet Leo Jud on my behalf and commend me to him, a man now almost retired, to whom may the best and greatest God grant a strong and worthy completion of his office until old age.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, and have me as the last in your list of friends, I beseech you. Furtm√ºller and the other brothers greet you, and I ask you to serve me by greeting my brother along with the whole household.</p>
      <p>11th of July, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Dominik Zili, if it were possible, a true friend.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed pastor of the church of Zurich, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
