      <p>Greetings. When I was recently with Farel, your letters to him were shown to me, in which you wrote that you were gradually recovering from a very serious and almost lethal illness. At that time, the life of our Farel was despaired of, so that upon my return I proclaimed him dead everywhere. Now, thanks must be sincerely given to the Lord, who has restored both of you to us and to His church. Your letters, which I received three days ago as witnesses of your health, were no less welcome. Although, to tell the truth, I would have been filled with fuller joy from reading them, had I not read that they were written with the intention that I should not suspect anything hostile from you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, such a suspicion never entered my mind, nor do I think that I gave Ulmius any occasion to report such a thing. He approached me twice. We spoke at length and freely and familiarly about various matters. Mention was made of you and all of yours. Not a syllable, as far as I know, escaped me that would have given rise to a negative opinion. Only upon departure, when he asked me to convey greetings to you in my name, did I except Bibliander because he openly professed himself our enemy. When Ulmius expressed incredulity and, in his piety, almost turned away from it as an ill omen, I briefly explained the reason: that we had been harassed here by a wicked and treacherous man; that although I had promised myself certain support from you, the outcome did not meet my expectations, yet the brotherly friendship between us remained unbroken, and certainly no sign of alienation had been given by you. Indeed, I also added that my colleagues and I took it in good part that we had not been supported by your vote as extensively as we had wished; only Bibliander was threateningly boasting that he had a certain book in hand against my doctrine, and was indiscriminately blurting it out to everyone. The final clause of the conversation was: let Bibliander write as he pleases, I will not deem it worthy of a response. Now, to return to you, my excellent and venerable brother, just as I do not judge you by his character, so I have never been led to believe that you, either approving or being aware, were plotting anything hostile against me. As for him, I have no reason to doubt or conceal that he has both hatefully blurted out many things and threatened what I touched upon regarding the book. For the matter is more than known and widespread. However, what I usually keep silent about with others, I did not think should be kept silent with Ulmius and a few others. Therefore, I would first like to testify to you, as I solemnly affirm, that you are not regarded by me as an enemy, but rather I wish to remain perpetually bound to you by all the ties of brotherly union, and I am confidently assured of this, as I embrace you no less as a unanimous and indivisible partner in the work of the Lord. Then I would like you to be persuaded that I have never either written or spoken, except both lovingly and honorably, about that man who has deserved so well of the church publicly and has always been a friend to me privately. If any concern about this matter has pricked you, you may rest assured in the future.</p>
