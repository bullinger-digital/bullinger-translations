    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hochholzer knows well that he does not need to win Bullinger's favor by writing letters more frequently. Therefore, if he interrupts him with the present letter in his work, it is because many righteous people have asked him to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Almost a year ago, Johannes Senger, pastor in Veltheim, passed away. He left behind a pregnant wife [...] and eight children. A few days ago, she also passed away with one of the boys [...]. The remaining eight orphans are to be raised through the efforts of good people in different places. The oldest child, named Isaak, is the bearer of the letter. He has shown talent in the baking trade. His honest but impoverished relatives wish for him to be employed in Zurich, where there are very good master bakers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Because the boy is decent but inexperienced and simple in dealing with others, the relatives have asked Hochholzer to approach Bullinger on their behalf and in the name of the deceased, even though the boy is a baker. They are convinced that he, who is so influential in Zurich, will do something for the deceased's son in memory of him. Therefore, they ask Bullinger to recommend the boy to Jakob Sprüngli or another capable and skilled baker.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Gabriel [Meyer] and the other relatives would be extremely grateful for this. Hochholzer also knows very well that the charitable Bullinger does not need to be reminded of the Christian duty towards orphans and pastor's children! No one doubts, therefore, that he will take care of Isaak.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Hochholzer wrote three days ago [with No. 2681] but does not know if Bullinger has already received the letter. At least he has not yet received a reply. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Bernese have mustered 12,000 soldiers. Of these, 122 come from the small town of Aarau alone! What will the future bring? May the Lord, in His grace, bring an end to this situation!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I do not need to seek your favor with my frequent letters, esteemed lord, as I have long known your benevolence towards me. However, I would not trouble you with this letter now, if not for the prayers of some good people who have almost compelled me to write to your kindness. You will hear the reason briefly.</p>

      <p>There was among us a good, honest, learned, and faithful man, Mr. Johannes Senger of blessed memory. A few months ago, almost a year, he passed away (after having preached the gospel in the church of Christ in Veltheim with great diligence and faith), leaving behind a pregnant wife with eight children. In recent days, it happened that she also departed this life, along with one of the sons. Thus, there remain eight orphaned children, who will be raised through the efforts of good people here and there. The eldest of them is this young man, Isaac Senger, who brings this letter to you, skilled in the baking trade. It pleased his relatives, who are good and honest people, though of modest means, that he should go to Zurich, where there are excellent masters of this craft, to serve someone for a time for a wage.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And because the young man is decent, yet almost inexperienced in all things concerning human interaction, and simple, they have earnestly asked me to commend this young man to your kindness in the name of his father and themselves, which they were confident you would not take amiss, as they hoped he would be recommended to you on account of his father. Otherwise, it would not pertain to you that we commend a baker to you. But because they know you are held in such high esteem among your people, that whom you love and promote, all wish to see promoted, this is the one thing we ask of you, that, if it can be done, you recommend this young man to Jakob Sprüngli or some other good and honest man skilled in his craft, and request that he be pleased to take him into his household.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If you do this, Mr. Gabriel and other good people will consider it a great benefit. There is no need for me to speak of duty, what we owe to orphans and especially to the children of co-workers in the gospel of Christ, as I know you are wholly inclined, by your usual kindness towards the ministers of Christ, to do good to as many as possible. Therefore, we do not doubt that Isaac will be commended to you for many reasons. I ask that you do not take it amiss. For I could not deny this duty to those good people.</p>

      <p>I wrote to you three days ago. I do not know if you have received that letter. I certainly have received nothing from you. Farewell. All good people greet you.</p>

      <p>Our lords of Bern have conscripted an army of 10,000 soldiers from their subjects, to which number the people of Aarau will contribute 122 soldiers, and that from such a small town! We are uncertain what the future holds. May the Lord, in His grace, resolve it. Amen. Aarau, 20th of November, 1546. Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the church of Zurich, his lord, to be esteemed as a father.</p>
