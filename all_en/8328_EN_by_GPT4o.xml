      <p>S. D. I received your letter written on July 11th from a certain minister traveling to Bern. For almost 3 weeks, if I remember correctly, I have not seen any of your letters, which makes me wonder and fear that perhaps, God forbid, you are unwell. But thanks be to God, this silence is due to the fault of the messengers. Otherwise, I continue to write, and I hope that my last letter, written eight days ago about Polish affairs and other matters, has been delivered to you. What you complain about in your last letter is the same thing I complain about. But why say more? These are the very times foretold by the prophets and apostles. Our Lord says: "It will be as in the days of Noah and Lot, etc. Beware of drunkenness, lest the day of the Lord come upon you suddenly." Therefore, when I see few people seriously converted by our preaching, the prophecy of the Lord comforts me. Remember that many are preached to for judgment, and the Lord once reserved for himself 7,000 when Elijah believed he was the only worshiper of God. The Lord knows who are his, and the word of God is never preached in vain, Isaiah 55. Indeed, we read that Ezekiel was told by the Lord: "Speak and preach to them, whether they listen or not; thus you will have saved your soul." Let us therefore continue steadfastly in the proclamation of the word of God, praying to the Lord to bless our labors, and in all other matters, let us leave judgment to him. I grieve that Mr. Friedrich has been taken from us; yet I rejoice that he has been snatched from this lost world as if from a fire. May the Lord Jesus grant his spirit to his son, so that he may grow in piety and righteousness. Greet him on occasion and convey that I, as is fitting, grieve for his loss. What you wrote about the affairs of the Venetians and the recalled Spanish ships is also reported from elsewhere. It is added, I do not know how truly, hopefully falsely! That the Turk occupies the sea with 400 sails and the Venetians fear such great power so much that they are believed to be ready to surrender Cyprus to redeem peace; the Spaniards are also in great danger. I am not surprised by these things, if they are true, since I am not unaware of what is happening in Spain and what the life and customs of the Venetians are like. May the Lord have mercy on us! If you have anything more recent and certain about these and Italian affairs, please share it.</p>
      <p>Regarding your Katharina, your wife's sister, I cannot inform or report anything certain to you now; however, I am expecting letters from Transylvania, Debrecen, from Mr. Peter Melio, to whom I wrote some time ago.</p>
      <p>If I receive anything, I will ensure you know and have everything in good faith.</p>
      <p>Froschauer will send a curator in the matter of the bookseller's case, which you know. This in response to your letters. I pray that you will take care of these enclosed letters. Our people frequently request the education of their children, and we are otherwise so overwhelmed that we cannot even help our own. Therefore, tell the people where you can. There is no end to this battle. It all lies with my lords; they should educate their children and not burden the preachers and almost give them a salary. What will be the end? And where is reason and understanding? One should not overburden a willing horse! This to you.</p>
      <p>It is written from France that on June 27th, after the royalists pursued the admiral's forces with much effort and lack of all things, the admiral's forces positioned themselves, yet in a great advantage. Nevertheless, the French cavalry attacked them, the admiral's forces, but the admiral's forces drove the royalists into flight, and the flight would have brought great harm to the Swiss, who stood in order, if the king's German knights had not intervened so loyally. Now the admiral is in a great advantage, and they are in great need and scarcity.</p>
      <p>A pint of wine costs from 12 to 18 stüver, and as the Swiss stood in order for 3 days, they finally had to withdraw due to hunger and lack.</p>
      <p>The admiral also withdrew to a strong fortress. The royalists continually receive many people from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>So much in summary.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you and bless you and your family. Greet Mr. Consul and in order our other friends. July 21, 1570.</p>
      <p>With difficulty, I write this amidst business and am finally weighed down by the burden, as I am otherwise not of very strong health.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur in Graubünden, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
