      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Various things are being said here about your inconsistency in preaching; for you could make the people, who are already inclined to defend religion, stronger with your sermons, but they say you do everything coldly, so that you do not provide help to the poor people of Constance, but let them bear it bravely in the Lord. It will be a huge and perpetual disgrace to Switzerland and will bring great harm to future generations that we have left the pious to such a cruel enemy, to say nothing else. Perform your duty diligently and be steadfast in the Lord; you will have the help of the Holy Spirit for everything that the Lord will impose on us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I think you have already received the defect from Lord Zimbert of Schaffhausen along with the letters. There is still a consistent rumor here that the fortress of Ghent has been occupied by the citizens; for I heard from someone from Ensisheim, who learned it from the nobles.</p>
      <p>There the emperor has divided the land; he traveled by night from Worms in a ship to Oppenheim; the artillery that the people of Strasbourg gave him is still hanging in ships, so hastily did he depart. The doctors of the chamber court from Freiburg have been summoned by eight. They have departed with all their belongings, moving down. For they were supposed to be in Speyer on the 8th of September. But now that the emperor is gone, they have gone down in vain so hastily.</p>
      <p>The Frankfurt fair will bring us news about how things stand in the Netherlands with all matters. Our bishop has a mandate from the emperor that he should forbid the priests to keep concubines within four weeks. How will it proceed? The bishop must start with himself, then all the canons; it will become a wild affair. Doctor Berus is very ill, he can no longer... perform mass according to his custom. Strasbourg still holds, how long, God knows. Some people from Strasbourg have come to Schlettstadt; they were not allowed to be accepted as citizens; they were directed to the inn, also not allowed to live with the brothers. There are some Christian women, when they had to follow their husbands from Strasbourg, they publicly took the sacraments in the church and said to many, although they must move away with their husbands out of obedience into the papacy, they still want to testify that they will not accept any other faith than the one they have learned from the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Many women followed them with tearful eyes, encouraging one another. One has already returned, having left her husband, unable to live among the godless people. God will arrange all things well; thus hypocrisy must be uncovered in all cities.</p>
      <p>What has been done or is to be done at the Baden assembly, please share with us. Farewell with all the brothers. 18th of September 1548. None of the brothers dares to write against the Interim.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zürich, my dear trusted lord. Zürich.</p>
