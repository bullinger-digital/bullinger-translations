      <p>God save His honor.</p>
      <p>Dearly beloved, you have asked my lord Doctor Vadian if he has any news regarding the Emperor to inform you. He has informed me and also requested me to investigate as much as possible regarding his affairs, etc.</p>
      <p>Recently, I received a letter from Milan from my sister's son, who is with a merchant, etc., with these words: "Know that the rumor is that the Pope intended to capture the Emperor when he came to Rome; for the Pope is favorable to the French. The Emperor did not dare to venture to Rome and has remained in Aplass until now, and is recruiting many Italians and Spaniards. Furthermore, it is said with certainty in Milan that the French are gathering strong forces and intend to march on Milan, and many Italians are being recruited around Milan. It is certain that the Roman King will come to Milan in April with 28,000 Bohemians and other troops and with three thousand horses, and it is feared that it will be a wild summer in Italy." This is the news, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, I assume you are better informed than I am, but yesterday I was told by a trustworthy person (if it is true) that the Duke of Württemberg has sent a delegation to Constance, requesting assistance against Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria, Munich, the bishop, and all their allies. In response to his request, they are said to have held a large council this Tuesday, namely to provide him with assistance. It is considered serious, etc. This news I report on behalf of my oath to my lord Röist, I hear the same.</p>
      <p>With a thousand greetings from both of us, your humble servant, etc., and others. The rest will be told to you by my dear Jakob Rordorf.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, Thursday after Laetare, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>Let us know the news.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved lord and friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
