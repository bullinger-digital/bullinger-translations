      <p>Greetings. The letter from you, most learned Coelius, was delivered to me by Mr. Hieronymus Massarius, in which you so earnestly request that I clear your name with Mr. Gwalther, my brother-in-law and dearest relative. Indeed, since I had never heard anything about this from him, I was surprised at first when I read your letter, and I could not rest until I had faithfully shared your letter with him. He was also surprised and responded only that he had never seen those poems, nor did he know what they were written about: it is far from him to have attributed the authorship to you. I did not want you to be unaware of this so that you might be more at ease. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, April 9, 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Coelius Secundus Curio, most learned professor of the Basel school, esteemed lord and my dearest brother. Basel.</p>
