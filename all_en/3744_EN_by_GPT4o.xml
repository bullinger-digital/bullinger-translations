      <p>Greetings. I have been afflicted with poor health for more than 14 days and have not yet fully recovered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, during this whole time, I have been unable to write anything, nor can I yet compose lengthy letters. You will inform the most illustrious royal legate that I have received his letters and thank him for his faith and diligence, and greet him very kindly. The most distinguished Mr. Coignet was here last Sunday; but due to my infirmity, I could not meet him. He, in his kindness, came to see me and greeted me.</p>
      <p>You have no doubt heard the news about the Turkish expedition in Hungary from the most illustrious Mr. Friedrich von Salis, whose letters I received, all written from Vienna, and then the latest ones from Samaden, along with the letters from my son Christoph. I do not reply to him, especially since I expect him or his son to come to me soon, and I reserve the entire conversation for that time. You will greet him and the whole family in my name most kindly.</p>
      <p>A messenger sent from Poland has come to us, a minister of Mr. Johannes a Lasco, with extensive letters about the entire state of that kingdom.</p>
      <p>Briefly: the sincere preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ is being propagated in a remarkable manner; but the bishops and clergy are opposing it in a remarkable way. But it has been so arranged from the beginning; this matter is achieved only with the greatest labors.</p>
      <p>I also received from that messenger these letters addressed to Mr. Franz Schwarz, which, I pray, you will kindly take care of diligently.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from the Netherlands, except that negotiations for peace have begun. May the Lord grant us all that which is salutary.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontasella, the consuls, and all good people, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 28th October 1558.</p>
      <p>The Baden Assembly is not yet finished.</p>
      <p>The abbots are plotting something evil, I know not what.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, the ruler, look upon the counsels of men and repay each according to His holy judgment, etc. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his compatriot and most beloved brother. Chur.</p>
