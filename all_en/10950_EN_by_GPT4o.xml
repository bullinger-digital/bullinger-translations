    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on his meeting with Philipp [Melanchthon] and Ambrosius [Blarer] in Tübingen and on the different attitudes of the Upper German cities towards the Wittenberg Concord. Urges the Swiss to maintain unity. Warns against interference [by the Strasbourg] in the decision-making process regarding the Concord. In case of disagreement, the decision should be postponed and premature actions by Basel and St. Gallen should be avoided. It would be best to commit solely to [the First Helvetic Confession]. Asks Bullinger for his opinion on the question of the manducatio indignorum, private absolution, the faith of minors, midwife or emergency baptism, and communion for the sick. Requests that the letter along with the response be returned to him via Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although it is somewhat dangerous to entrust certain matters to letters (for there are those who use them as promissory notes), I want to inform you in good faith that I recently was in Tübingen with Philipp [Melanchthon] and Ambrosius [Blarer] to discuss with both of them the sacramental concord. Philipp responded cautiously and prudently, as he might not know whom to trust, and he himself is otherwise very suspect to his own. Ambrosius spoke freely with me about everything. I understand that he will not subscribe to the articles; for he says he cannot understand what it means to eat the body of Christ unworthily, if one lacks faith and repentance. Furthermore, he does not think it is advisable for the churches to subscribe to such obscure articles. Our church is still contemplating what to do. The same is true for some other churches, namely those of Ulm, Biberach, Isny, and Lindau. The rest have sent their subscriptions to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>We are very concerned about your churches, that they may not be divided. In this matter, my dearest brother, you must make every effort. For the people of Strasbourg boast that they have the support of Basel and St. Gallen. Now, if some of you accept the articles purely and simply, others accept them with a declaration, a third group accepts the declaration but not the articles, and a fourth group perhaps accepts nothing, you will see what trouble you are causing. Satan, I believe, desires discord even among you. O my pious, dear Master Heinrich and brother, how you must guard against this with great diligence! And if you do not give a unanimous answer, you will ruin yourselves, even though you have been at peace with one another until now.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it would be good and necessary for you, brothers of the Swiss churches, to always discuss among yourselves and agree on a common response, and then give it to those in Strasbourg. Confer and discuss with one another in everyone's presence, that is fine. But giving a final answer is not always useful. This is the one thing I want to warn you about, that no one should force their way into your councils. I know, however, how unsafe it is to write these things. Yet my love for your churches compels me. Therefore, I write this to you in good faith. Furthermore, since I do not believe you will be in agreement in giving a response to the people of Strasbourg, the matter should rather be postponed, and Basel and St. Gallen should delay their responses out of a desire for peace rather than hasten to join with Strasbourg and disagree with you.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, some consider it most advisable to give nothing new at this later meeting than what you gave at the first, namely, that you remain with your articles that you previously presented, and ask the people of Strasbourg to also urge Luther to agree to those articles. You might perhaps be able to accept the latest Wittenberg articles, but you must then see how to protect your people from evil suspicion against you. And this is also of great necessity for you. Likewise, if other articles come up today or tomorrow, such as on baptism and absolution, you should again be prepared with a similar answer, namely, that you remain with your articles and do not have to constantly set and accept something new.</p>
      <p>May the Lord give you spirit and wisdom. If only, if only we could all come to a solid agreement! Whether it will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since the main contention is about these Wittenberg articles concerning the eating of the unworthy, I would like you to write to me briefly how you understand that opinion.</p>
      <p>Then write back whether you could accept a private examination in place of confession for the less educated in the churches, and that because of private absolution.</p>
      <p>Also, whether you believe that in infants such new and holy movements are effected as are written about John in the womb.</p>
      <p>Also, what you think about the baptism by midwives, whether you consider it to be admitted and accepted.</p>
      <p>Also, whether you believe people should be taught, if there is any danger to the life of infants, to ensure they are baptized.</p>
      <p>Finally, about celebrating the Lord's Supper with the sick.</p>
      <p>Regarding these matters, I ask you out of love to indicate your opinion to me in a few words.</p>
      <p>I also beg you to conceive an argument from these letters, but to return the letters themselves. For I have kept no copy, indeed I have not even reread them. As for what you are going to write to me, give it to Pellikan before you leave Basel. For there will be someone at hand through whom I will receive them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest and most esteemed brother, and consider my letters written in good faith and from the heart. May Christ keep your wife and mother for a long time.</p>
      <p>September 2, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his very dear lord and brother.</p>
