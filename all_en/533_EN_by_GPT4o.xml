      <p>S. You have the small sum of money, dearest Bullinger, which you requested to be returned to you in the name of Blaurer. It is counted for him each year at five Rhenish coins in gold, 63 for each coin. I pray that, since she was the wife of our Erasmus Fabricius, she may receive this sum from us for many years in good health. However, due to the haste of the messenger, I was not able to discuss further with you. Farewell, therefore, and love me as you always do.</p>
      <p>Strange things are being spread here about the Emperor. I am very afraid that he will not significantly abuse our discord for his own benefit; for we have been seriously warned of this matter from the city of Augsburg through the letters of a most honorable matron. May our Lord deliver us from such a cruel tyranny. It is certain that he recently made an exchange of three hundred thousand thalers from the Belgian region to our vicinity, and it is not unclear whose help he used in doing so. This money was undoubtedly melted down from that silver, which he had ordered to be transported to him in Brabant via the Rhine many months before, and the future assemblies, which he tried to extort from your people to be held, are considered to be of little good omen.</p>
      <p>He is also said to be seeking that the assemblies be celebrated at his expense. However, there are those who think that he will offer the Swiss nothing other than what Cato offered to the Carthaginian senate, when he made it clear to them with a contracted lap that they should either accept peace or war. But the matter itself will quickly show with what spirit he will be towards our people.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 26th day of May, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zürich, my most esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
