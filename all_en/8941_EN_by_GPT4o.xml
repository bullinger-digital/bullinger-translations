      <p>God with us; may He grant us His grace and health in soul and body. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dearest son, Ulrichli was here after the 11th and delivered the letter, which brought us some joy, as it is in a decent state. I always hope for better. Leave everything to God. Know well that all His deeds are good and right and serve us well. I sent J. Hansen immediately; understand well that it is not in a bad state. May God improve it more and more, also with us. If you lack or want anything, let me know. If I could travel, I would not have delayed so long; but now I can do nothing at home, how would it go on the road? Therefore, my Hans Rudolf, take the good will for weary work. Let us always know how things are going and standing. Greet Susanna and the children for us; all of ours greet you. I write this in haste, so I do not write nothing at all. God be with you. There is no news, except that Thie√üli Leman was disgracefully stabbed in the hospital by the tanner from Eglisau; around the 4th he will be buried, and the tanner is in Wellenberg.</p>
      <p>On John the Baptist's Day 1572. In haste.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dearest sons Heinrich and Hans Rudolf Bullinger in Berg.</p>
