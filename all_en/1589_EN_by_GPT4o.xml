      <p> Greetings. You will understand the reason why Calvin and Farel are coming to you from them, as well as what they have done and achieved here. Due to significant business, I am not able to write much now. The contribution from Magdeburg has been postponed to the assembly of the four cities; but when will that take place? The Frankfurt fair is approaching; it would be worthwhile to decide something beforehand. Here, it is said about the Frenchman that he is going to lead a large army into Germany through Lorraine; the Danes and Saxons are also going to enter Germany. Schertli requested from my lords that a training ground be allowed in Aarau, Brugg, or Lenzburg; it was rejected partly by our countrymen and partly because of the neighbors, to whom this has never been granted. I am sending a note about the flooding that occurred in Lower Germany. From Marburg, Lonicerus and others write that on January 12th, the Lahn rose so much that it destroyed the stone bridge along with two others due to the violence of the waters and flooded almost all of Hesse; then also terrible thunder was heard and lightning was seen! I hope they are not omens of some great evil. </p>
      <p> Here in these days, our entire city was in arms and went out to the nearby field to attack a certain wooden fortress made for this purpose. I fear that this too portends some evil. I eagerly await letters from you; for I have received nothing from you for a long time. Froschauer writes about my copies, which he is sending; but the person to whom he entrusted them left them in ZÃ¼rich. Farewell. May all the brothers be safe, as well as your household. Our people send their greetings to you. Bern, March 8, 1552. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
