    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the unnamed bearer of the letter, to whom the response from Zurich can be safely entrusted. The letter from the Basel council to Zurich is rather general, as confidentiality cannot be ensured due to the absence of a secret council. The opponents are exploiting the disunity of the reformed places.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Whatever the person who delivers this letter to you shares, he has in his instructions. Therefore, trust him and do what you can in these matters, so that he may bring back some definite response. He is such a man that everyone hopes for all good things from him. Our council has written to yours, but in general terms, as they did not dare to entrust these more secret matters to the multitude, because everything soon leaks out once it is known. You see what the council was about, which we discussed recently, secretly. Our discord will do nothing but ruin us, if they wish it. For they will crush us unprepared, lacking in counsel and all resources. You will pray with yours to God, that He may help us.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, on Palm Sunday in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his foremost friend.</p>
