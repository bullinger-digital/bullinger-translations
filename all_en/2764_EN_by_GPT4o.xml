      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed Bullinger, dated in ZÃ¼rich on the sixth of October, delivered by Lord Agninus from Frankfurt on the sixth of November. They brought me singular joy, not so much because you kindly promise to ensure that what I have requested will be accomplished according to my wishes, but because you did not disdain to indicate the very friendly letters written to you by Melanchthon, in which he openly testified that he approves of your books "On the Grace of God and Justifying Faith" and added other things that particularly affect you, etc. For I am convinced without a doubt that someone writing such things to you is far removed from the conspiracy of those who dared to revive the sacramental fight. If only I could truly persuade myself of the same regarding Brenz and even Sultzer himself, men otherwise very learned and of blameless life. I am, however, uniquely consoled by the fact that you assert you will not desert the defense of the truth, nor do I have any doubt that, as it has stood until now, so in the future the victory of the struggle will remain with you; for Christ, who dwells in you as living temples by His Spirit, will protect through you, as His instruments, His cause and glory.</p>
      <p>I hear from you that a certain Joachim Westphal has written a virulent pamphlet against Calvin, a man of God; I have heard similar things from some other trustworthy men about a certain Tonstall from England, who has written with equal bitterness against the pious, learned, and most innocent Peter Martyr. From this, we openly recognize from whose spirit they have written, not Christ's, who is modest and truthful, but the adversary Satan's, who is bitter and deceitful and the father of lies (as in John). Furthermore, regarding the wars and other calamities with which God today scourges the unbelieving, unrepentant world that contradicts His saving word everywhere with great stubbornness through false prophets, I fully subscribe to your opinion, often repeated in letters to me, that they are unmistakable signs that the day of the final judgment, acceptable to the pious but dreadful to the impious, is not far off. May the Almighty grant that we may eagerly await it through true and solid faith in His only-begotten Christ. Amen. Farewell happily in the same with all yours, whom you will bid much health from both me and my wife.</p>
      <p>From Worms, November 10, in the year 1555. Entirely devoted to your kindness, Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
