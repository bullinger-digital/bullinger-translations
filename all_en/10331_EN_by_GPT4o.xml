    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends him the letters of Capito and Bucer, which have greatly reassured him regarding his questions about the church and infant baptism. He asks Bullinger to also free him from his remaining doubts, fueled by Kaspar von Schwenckfeld, about the legitimacy of governmental control over preaching. He also encloses Schwenckfeld's letter, but Bullinger should not show it to anyone.</p>

      <p>Grace of God be with you.</p>
      <p>I am sending you, dearest brother, the letters of Capito and Bucer, whom I consulted in my distress of mind and considerable temptation. They respond kindly, and it can hardly be said how much their letters, full of love and spirit, have calmed me. Therefore, the scruple about the church and infant baptism has been largely removed. Another remains, perhaps greater and more dangerous, about which Schwenckfeld (Kaspar von Schwenckfeld) once wrote to me. I had partly refuted his arguments and partly objected to the inconveniences that could arise from them with additional arguments, which then seemed strong to me. Now, in his response, he tries to weaken everything. It appears that the man is very zealous for the glory of God and has a more sincere and ardent zeal. Therefore, I wanted to send you what he writes here, beseeching you, dearest brother, not to disdain to read it out of disdain. For I truly believe that no writings should be despised that do not openly fight against Christ. I hope you will read them for my sake, which you would not otherwise read, so that you may, by the grace given to you, remove this scruple from me and refute the arguments. Bear patiently and with a calm mind, my Heinrich, my weakness, and lend me your hand for your firmness. For I am stuck, and I cannot assert anything against my conscience nor rashly affirm what is not at all known to me or about which I rather doubt. The argument is about the freedom of preaching and whether it is permissible for the magistrate to either prohibit or punish those who dissent from those he has appointed. I ask this one thing, that you faithfully keep Schwenckfeld's letters with you, so they are not given to others to read, whoever they may be. (Bucer is displeasing, Capito is pleasing.) Schwenckfeld will indeed suffer no injury from me, nor will his reputation be harmed. I send this more willingly so that you may see that I am not eager to innovate but diligently seek the truth from all.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and love me as you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in Christ.</p>
