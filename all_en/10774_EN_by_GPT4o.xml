    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter from Zurich to the bailiff [Christoph von Sonnenberg] merely resulted in [the reformed citizens of Weinfelden] now having to travel to the Diet in Lucerne; requests support from the Zurich envoys. The news of Bullinger's and other Zurich citizens' journey to Basel made his colleagues happy and confident; Mötteli also conveyed Bullinger's news about the Schmalkaldic League. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you, excellent man.</p>
      <p>The letters from our lords in Zurich to the bailiff achieved nothing for the success of our affairs, but instead sent us to Lucerne for the confederates' Diet, depleting us with great expenses, as if all our matters were almost disastrous through that man. May the Lord render to him what He sees fit. I earnestly pray that you, as much as you can, encourage the envoys of your lords on our behalf. It is the cause of God; He will advance the business of His Christ even in this way.</p>
      <p>I announced your journey to Basel with some brothers and your lords to some brothers. They (as is fitting) rejoice greatly, especially because they know that you can easily fill the place of all with wisdom, piety, and learning, and confound and convince true enemies, for which they all pray with much zeal for the favorable and happy assistance of the highest deity. I also recounted those things that were transmitted to you by letter from the Schmalkaldic League, as you had read aloud. The brothers give thanks to the Lord with much joy. When you return from the Basel action with favorable (as I pray) omens, please inform us by letter; for we also hope to benefit from knowing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may you wish to have all our churches commended to you. All the brothers greet you, especially Huldrych Amantius, Johannes Schmid, Rudolf Mundprat, Johannes Fridinger, etc.</p>
      <p>Weinfelden, January 27, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Martin Mötteli, always most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord. In Zurich.</p>
