    <p xml:id="regest1">A letter to the Bernese [regarding a joint confession of the Lord's Supper] was unsuccessful. Did the people of Zurich give them cause for concern? Not with Berchtold [Haller], but rather in his surroundings, arrogance seems to play a role. Myconius forwarded the confession of the people of Zurich [No. 482] to Grynaeus, but had to withhold the promised confession of the Bernese. He requests information about the meeting with Bucer in Constance. In Basel, following a sermon by Myconius, a dispute has arisen over the theological doctorate. He requests a statement from the people of Zurich. Capito will come to Basel regarding this matter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I certainly wrote to the people of Bern with all the faith and diligence I could muster, but without success. For Berchtold replied on behalf of everyone that they already understand well enough from previous letters what their position is here, and what the tenor of their words is. Changing this is as impossible as if they were to attempt anything, they would sooner lose the entire gospel than introduce their own into another form of words. Since we did not even mention changing the form, indeed we advised against it, saying there was nothing of the sort to fear, I doubt if you wrote anything of the sort to them after I had completely removed that fear by my own judgment. They asked me to excuse them to you and others. I see neither cause nor way to excuse them. I could defend Berchtold, but not the others. I do not know what insolence I seem to see in some that is not to be praised.</p>
      <p>I sent your confession along with others. What do you think Grynaeus and the others will say when they see the Bernese are not present? Then I will indeed be judged a liar, for I promised to send the Bernese confession soon; I had hoped as you did.</p>
      <p>Then news came to us that the brothers from Zurich, the Bernese, the people of Schaffhausen, the people of St. Gallen, and many Swabians had gathered in Constance with Bucer in recent days. If there is anything, let us know as well.</p>
      <p>Finally, we are so idle here, it seems, that we are debating whether or not doctors of theology should be created in our university. There is a strange commotion; the university and the senate are raging against me. Listen to the origin in brief: Indeed, moved by the tyranny of the Parisian school, on the Sunday immediately after the calends of January, I fought against those theologians with a few verbal jabs during a sermon, when the senate had decreed the day before the calends of January that degrees should be taken. Soon an interpretation followed, as if I wanted the whole school, all degrees, to be abolished in contempt of the senate's decree. I had no such thing in mind. The senate calls, which has never happened before, reproaches the great crime (good God), demands an explanation. I had nothing against the university, unless it wanted to introduce something papistic, I began to speak against the theological doctorate and achieved so much that the matter was referred to the brothers and the learned of the university. Here, therefore, I will defend that after the office's duty bestowed by the church through the spirit, it is not fitting to add a pompous name of honor. I am not. Tell that to Utinger. The contemplation of office indeed humbles, dignity removes. These things, I ask, confer with Pellican, Leo, and Theodor and write back your opinion as quickly as possible. Capito will be here shortly for this great matter. As to friends, these things. If anyone were to spread it, I prefer it written to you alone. You understand me. If a messenger is to be sent, do not delay, unless you wish to fight against me. Write back in any case.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with the brothers and family.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 10, in the morning before the sermon - therefore I was forced to be brief - in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned and pious friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
