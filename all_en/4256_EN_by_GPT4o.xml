      <p>Especially beloved, heart-trusted lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Your letter has been answered by Mr. R. with delay, to which I have not responded in writing, but have given him an answer by word of mouth, as far as I can bear knowledge of all matters, in good faith. I was heartily pleased if the marriage should have its fortunate progress; may the Lord's will be done. Entrusted to them and praying heartily for me.</p>
      <p>Greet your Christian household with all good friends. Ambrosius Blarer, the comforter in the Lord.</p>
