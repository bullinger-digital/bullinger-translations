      <p> Greetings. I can write nothing more about Ganthner. You know, when he was ordered to leave the land, what I thought, and I see things progressing in that way. I pray to God that He either sincerely converts him to Himself or overthrows the stubborn and harmful man, and preserves His church. If our singular friend Mr. Lentulus thinks it is in his interest and is satisfied with this my letter, go ahead, send it to him and greet him most courteously. I also thank him for his diligence, with which he records new matters so diligently. I do not request or read them out of curiosity, but with care and diligence; for it benefits pastors to foresee from afar what is happening and what will happen. Therefore, I thank you very much for diligently sending to me what you receive from him. I will inform Mr. Simler of what you ask; he sends you a copy of his Latin response. Middelburg has surrendered to the prince. He let them withdraw and did not deal with them as Alba did with those in Haarlem; there was found over a million in gold. </p>
      <p> There is great fear among the opposition; the governor does not know where to turn, he is worth nothing, and no one obeys him. It was close that the citadel in Antwerp was taken. Count Palatine Christoph and Count Ludwig of Nassau are advancing with force, and there is talk that Maastricht has been won by them. In France, everything is in turmoil; the Huguenots have taken Rotten and many cities, also Meaux, if it is true as they write; for they are up in many places. The king has gone to Paris, hardly anyone dares to trust him anymore; this is because he holds nothing and allows himself to be misled by the wretched Cardinal of Lorraine and his mother Jezebel. It is also said that the papists are back in his favor. This will perhaps be more fully known now on the day of Laetare in Baden. The king in Poland has been received very friendly and well; however, he has been told to send all his Frenchmen back to France except for a few, because they do not want them in Poland, etc. - As for the Turk being in arms, you know better. May God grant us peace and all good things to you. </p>
      <p> Greet all and each of our friends. Most swiftly. March 19, 1574. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
