      <p>Greetings. I am returning what you recently sent.</p>
      <p>I could not do so sooner or more safely; I give the greatest thanks, adding nothing further; thus this unusual disease, which is now spreading everywhere, has once broken me, so that it has made me almost senseless, indeed truly like a log; I am not of sound mind. Pray for us.</p>
      <p>May Christ keep you and your household safe; my whole household is suffering from this remarkable illness, which, without great pain, also incredibly weakens bodies of great strength, although our most excellent and kind father does not yet treat us as we deserve, to whom be glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to Him, that we may soon see the churches of Christ in France emerge from all these most serious evils with great rejoicing of our spirit. November 12, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
