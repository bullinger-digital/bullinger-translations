    <p xml:id="regest1">Adverse circumstances prevented him from responding to Bullinger's letter. He can report the following about the 10 pounds owed to Bullinger: His father-in-law tried in vain to collect the debt from his brother-in-law. When he bought a house, a debt of 40 guilders remained according to the contract with Hans Löchli, which was supposed to benefit two children; when he moved away from Bremgarten, he left Jakob [Bullinger], the guardian of the children, a promissory note for 20 guilders, while his father-in-law guaranteed the rest.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, and our Savior Jesus Christ be with us at all times.</p>
      <p>My dear lord and brother in the Lord, I have understood your letter and I ask you not to take it amiss that I have not written to you; I was always intending to come to you myself, but I have been constantly troubled by misery and sorrow, now with illness affecting both of us, then with poverty affecting our children, so that I do not have much sustenance.</p>
      <p>But this is the information regarding this letter of debt, where you are to receive 10 pounds: My father-in-law went out there and promised my brother-in-law to bring him half the money at Christmas and the other half at Pentecost, which did not happen. Therefore, my father-in-law went out again and intends to collect it all now.</p>
      <p>How it goes, I will let you know. I will not take anything from him until you and my father-in-law are paid. My father-in-law has the obligation that he must give you the 20 guilders in coin. You and your man came to me in Suhr and wanted to learn a lot from me. There I gave them the correct information, how I bought the house on the spot for 100 guilders; there the 60 guilders are to be in gold, as Hans Löchli's letter stated, and the 40 guilders for the 2 children, should be 17 batzen or 3 pounds for 1 guilder, and if I did not want to go there when the children wanted it, then I should secure them or their guardian and not on the house. If my lords from Bremgarten thought it was enough, if they or their guardian did not want to have enough. So the boy is paid. And when I came from Bremgarten, the letter (the document) for the 20 guilders in coin was given to me; I gave it to your father; you were not far from there, I know well, then your father told me he was not the guardian, Jakob was the guardian, he wanted to give the letter to him, take it and my father-in-law for the rest as a guarantor, who would do well for him. And that happened and Jakob took the letter and my father-in-law took on the rest and not your father, and have since collected the interest, and it is not bad if one wants to do him justice. He tells me, there is a courage to deny it; it is not, there is nothing on it, because it is stated in the letter. Every peasant gladly bears the burden of friends, as I think of their words.</p>
      <p>God be with us all.</p>
      <p>Hans Brennysen, your poor servant in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the pious and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord and good friend.</p>
