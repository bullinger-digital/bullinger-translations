    <p xml:id="regest1">After the meeting in Aarau, the Bernese pastors advocate for another meeting to reach agreement beyond the question of the Lord's Supper. The Basel envoy [Hans] Rudolf Frey has spoken in Bern, on the one hand, regarding Geneva, which is in great distress after the breakdown of negotiations between Bern and the Duke [of Savoy], and on the other hand, regarding a meeting of Swiss pastors. Haller has recommended to Frey as well as [former] mayor [Hans Jakob] von Wattenwyl to invite Vadian, but not the Strasbourg people; however, Schaffhausen and Biel should be included. He requests a copy of the Apology [by Bibliander] and praises Bullinger's letter to Bucer [No. 562]. He criticizes a concord formula [discussed in Aarau]. He is hurt because his letters [No. 689-691] were opened in Aarau. He inquires about Bullinger's commentary on Paul. He recommends the Basel messenger. [Hans Rudolf Frey] is to report news from England. The French king is said to have suffered a stroke. Haller was bedridden for two weeks. He expresses appreciation for the efforts of the Strasbourg people.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After the meeting held in Aarau, dearest Heinrich, and considering, to the best of our ability, what the brothers discussed there, we agreed among ourselves, since we have long experienced that in such difficult matters nothing can be properly resolved in writing, and it is much better for words to be given and heard in person, that another day for a meeting should be designated by you, but with a timely announcement, on which not only matters concerning the Eucharist but also all church rites could be agreed upon among us, so that if, by any chance, something of this kind were demanded of us by a general council or by the princes and Christian cities of Germany, we would have something ready that we could present with one voice and one mouth in good conscience.</p>
      <p>Behold, Rudolf Frey of Basel certainly interrupts our plan according to our wishes, having first secretly heard me, he then seeks the city leaders - partly on behalf of the Genevans, whose situation is in great danger. For our envoys returned from the Duke with the matter unresolved, since our people first demanded that the word of the Lord be safe and free in the free city of the empire. Upon hearing this, the Duke made many excuses about the Emperor, without whose order and consent he dared not admit anything. Our people were instructed that if the word was not safe, they should not negotiate further but return. It will go as with Bremgarten, Freiamt, and Lenzburg. Then also, some ministers of the Swiss churches worked for a meeting. I do not know what was answered about the former, but, dear brother, if we are not separated from Geneva, it will go badly and worse than ever. We are, I fear (I tell you), beset with parties, partisan quarrels, where wisdom, courage, unity, etc., are lacking. If that Basel man could do anything with your people or your people with the people of the mountains, I beg you to ensure that nothing is left untried. The latter succeeded according to the wish of the Basel envoy. I had suggested to this envoy and to our consul from Wattenwil that when the French were called to the meeting, Vadian should be specifically requested, and then that only those of us who are in Switzerland should meet, for the Basel people said they could easily also invite the people of Strasbourg, but I do not know what was done with our people about those two. In the meantime, see to it and take care with your people what you think will be beneficial for the progress of the churches. For your meeting should not be without Vadian. Let the people of Schaffhausen also be present. We will work for the people of Biel on the appointed day.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I beg you, my Heinrich, who have never failed me until now, if possible, to send me a copy of your Apology with the next messenger. Above all, I desire a clear declaration of all matters, which I expect from you alone, because I have found it with you alone until now. Your letter to Bucer, of which you shared a copy, never fades from my memory. If only the whole matter of the Eucharist were thus arranged by you in articles!</p>
      <p>Certainly, I abhor the words of the articles of concord because of the clarity of truth and the offense to the churches; for the sake of the brothers, I would admit some according to my sense. Some understand in the 2nd article "heavenly and divine knowledge": That is, in a supernatural, divine, and ineffable manner. I would understand it as faith. I certainly do not understand the third article. Thus we labor in words, the richest in words, with the greatest poverty and obscurity. In the meantime, I always submit myself to the scriptures and the spirits of the prophets, always ready to be taught.</p>
      <p>I understand that my letters written to you, namely three enclosed together, were opened in Aarau. If it pleases you, then it must please me. I foolishly pour out my foolish feelings just as I do to my walls. If any learned person sees this, they will easily judge me to reveal who I am. I leave everything to your judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I call your Paul, if anything has come out in the meantime.</p>
      <p>December 14, 1535.</p>
      <p>I commend to you the Basel messenger; he has always appeared to be a good man.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>The envoy reports news from England.</p>
      <p>They say the King of France has been struck by apoplexy (stroke).</p>
      <p>For 14 days now, I have been bedridden, today I first left the house.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that the people of Strasbourg have done everything with good zeal so far and especially seek that our churches are not separated from theirs, and that they are eager to participate in our meeting. But you do what seems convenient to you.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
