    <p xml:id="regest1">Met Bullinger during his visit to Konstanz, but due to an excessive workload, he has not been able to write to him until now. He is seriously ill and, on medical advice, should only consume dairy products. Above all, he is recommended the cheese from Kyburg, which Bullinger should procure for him. Greetings. He will only write briefly to Theodor Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Not so long ago, when you set out for Konstanz to visit friends, an opportunity for forming a friendship, however small it may have been, was presented. And I wish I could have given you more of my time. However, the waves of business, which surround me without interruption, have prevented me from doing so. Undoubtedly, you are aware that teachers are bound to their duties like a millstone and endure truly Herculean labors. Moreover, for this reason, I decided to prepare this little letter, because the duty of writing has great weight in rekindling the memory of a friend. There is also something I earnestly request from you. If it were not a serious matter, I would not impose this burden on you. To begin with, it has been a month or more since I fell ill. I have been accustomed, lest you be unaware, to coughing up blood for a long time. For this reason, I decided to consult a doctor. He, being very devoted to me, said: The illness, unless immediately resisted, is fatal. For there are certain small veins in the chest that are torn and ruptured. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious, lest by any delay, this illness grows worse and deteriorates day by day. If I am to live according to the doctor's prescription, I must subsist solely on milk and dairy foods until this ailment is healed. He also permits the consumption of cheese, but not just any cheese, only freshly made sheep's cheese not seasoned with excessive salt. He wants me to avoid foods sprinkled with a large amount of salt. However, he believes that the cheese from Kyburg should be given priority. It has been a year since I heard from a friend that this Kyburg cheese can only be obtained as a gift. Therefore, dearest Heinrich, if you have any influence - and you have much - help me obtain some of this cheese. I will pay the money in good faith. I will not mind waiting until Christmas or longer, as long as I achieve what I so earnestly desire.</p>
      <p>Convey many greetings to Pellicanus, Aman, and all the brothers who love me. I will write to Theodor Bibliander, but only briefly. Due to business, the letters cannot be more verbose.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your household respectfully.</p>
      <p>December 15, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished scholar Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his especially dear friend.</p>
