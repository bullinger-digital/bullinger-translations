      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I received your letter along with two declamations through Johann Fabritius, a man of exceptional piety and learning. I give you immortal thanks, most learned man, and as I would wish, so I would hope that I could repay you more abundantly. Two stipendiaries recalled by the people of Lausanne are philosophizing in a dark prison for two days now, subsisting on barley bread and drinking water due to several offenses. Tomorrow, perhaps, they will be freed to stand in a harsh examination by the nobles; afterwards, they will be recommended to Tübingen to Martin Frecht by the prince's order. I would have preferred them to be future listeners of your theology, indeed more sincere than that which is handled by some there; but the opinion of the nobles of the duchy prevailed.</p>
      <p>The Mass will again be abolished throughout the entire dominion of Württemberg, as you can easily understand from the schedule and the prince's autograph, which he included in the letter given on the recent first of September. Yesterday, our noble prefect reported it to be abolished, but in what manner or reason, I do not know; if I find out, I will inform you. The prince is bathing in the Göppingen baths. I now send you the Emperor's departure to the people of Strasbourg, which I have from Doctor Paul Helius, who is here for the grape harvest. If I receive more from Hedio, to whom I wrote for this reason, I will also share it with you. The Emperor is not far from Kaiserslautern. They fear that he might winter in Alsace if he is driven away by the French; for almost all the other provinces are nearly exhausted. May the Lord's will be done; for indeed our sins and impenitence deserve these things. O good God, preserve the church of Christ, etc. Hastily. Riquewihr, 27th of September, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and Antistes of the church of Zürich, his ever-observant lord.</p>
