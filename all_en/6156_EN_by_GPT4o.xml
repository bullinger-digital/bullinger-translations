      <p>S. D. Our Vogler will explain what he wants and why he has come to you; I commend him to you as if he were myself in the cause he is pursuing. You will serve and gratify both him and Mr. Stampfer, whom you know to be a man worthy of being helped and loved by all. Yesterday evening I received your letters, which greatly disturbed me.</p>
      <p>Why do you write to me alone about matters pertaining to the common government? Why does the consul not write to our consul? Why does the royal envoy not write? Why does no trustworthy man write to both consuls? That would have some appearance; the priestly matters have little appearance.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I did what I could, even at night, and explained the whole business to the consul, asking him to take care of and assist the afflicted matters. I fear that the alliance of kings will be for us the beginning, middle, and end of ruin.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>You will hear more from our Vogler, whom I commend again and again.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet the royal envoy, the consuls, the brothers, and the Saliceos, especially Hercules and Friedrich; remind them to guard themselves against the Spaniards, who have never done us any good and are not likely to do so in the future. May 30, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
