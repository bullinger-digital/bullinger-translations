      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am sending you Musculus's commentary on the first seven chapters of the Gospel of John, and I will also send the rest if it is published, so that I do not appear ungrateful for the benefits you have shown me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I want to inform you: I did not see the son of your mayor; he delivered your letters at dusk when I was not at home. The next day, I searched for him in the public inns, but I could not find the man. After three days, I learned that he had left early in the morning for Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>The arsonist has a well-equipped army; they say he has 12,000 foot soldiers and 1,400 horsemen. He is burning down villages and small towns everywhere. He is trying to completely destroy Hesse. The Emperor is merely a spectator of this tragedy. The Archbishop of Mainz has died, and the canons are disputing among themselves about electing a bishop. The Emperor is planning something with this bishopric. If I hear anything more certain, I will write, and soon we will have the whole business of this matter when our tribune of the people returns from Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Basel, October 17, 1545. Yours, Gastius, in haste.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
