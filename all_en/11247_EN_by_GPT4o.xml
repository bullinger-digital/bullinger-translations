    <p xml:id="regest1">From the letter delivered by Quirinus [von Leiden], it is understood that his earlier letters have not yet arrived. He thanks for the fatherly admonition. After acquiring Plutarch's "Vitae," only the unforeseen journey to Strasbourg forced him to borrow money; the course of the trip confirmed that this was necessary. A more favorable accommodation than with Bedrot is not available, and only thanks to the generosity of Martin Peyer does he have a study room at his disposal. Due to the plague, which has now also claimed Ulpian [Beyel] as a victim, he cannot return to Basel and wishes to stay until the end of Sturm's dialectics lecture; he asks for advice. Greetings and New Year's wishes.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most kind patron, from Quirinus on the day before the Nones of December, written on November 10th, from which I could easily gather that my letters have not yet reached you, as I have already written to you more than once, outlining the course of my life and studies in great detail. However, since my letters must always be sent to Basel, it is not surprising if they are detained there longer, until a convenient messenger comes to you.</p>
      <p>Secondly, as I perceived from your letters to me, my mind was partly moved with sorrow, partly filled with joy, when I read that most friendly admonition of yours regarding the magnitude of my expenses.</p>
      <p>From this, esteemed teacher, I can clearly see that your fatherly affection towards me, conceived long ago, has not yet faded from your mind, but that you are taking diligent care of me, for which I give you immense thanks, and I will also repay you if ever the opportunity arises to serve either you or your children. I will take care, finally, that neither the excellence of my expenses nor any other matter offends and alienates your goodwill from me. Your admonitions, however, are so far from being rejected by me that I rather embrace them with the greatest joy of mind, for, as I hear Plato saying, "it is not dishonorable to know something of the not good, but healing comes from accepting what is said without envy but with goodwill."</p>
      <p>But so that you may have a certain account of my expenses, take everything briefly as follows: Oporinus had begun to lecture on Plutarch's "Lives"; since I was his listener and did not have a copy of that author, I thought it would not be useless to acquire it for myself. For I had decided (and I have not yet regretted the decision) to go through the entire author, so that I might add Greek reading to the Latin reading of Livy. But since I suddenly had to leave Basel, I indeed had money, which even exceeded the sum of florins; however, I was warned by a premonition of the mind that it was not safe to go to that place completely exhausted and to come to those to whom I was recommended by no one. For I feared that I might have to stay in some inn before I found some lodging. Thus, having boarded the ship, I had a not dangerous but most inconvenient voyage; for only on the fourth day did I reach Strasbourg, with the winds rising so unfavorably that in many places we had to stay for several hours and at Breisach for an entire day. And certainly, it would have gone poorly with me if I had not borrowed these coins from Miconius's wife. As for other matters, I dare to promise you solemnly that I have spent nothing in a useless manner, of which I do not doubt to also call Miconius and his family as witnesses. For if I had not had to leave Basel, I would have had enough money until the time of payment arrived.</p>
      <p>As for my present expenses, I do not know what to do; but now I do not want to trouble you again about these. For I hope that you have now received my letters from Basel and Schaffhausen dealing with these matters. I could not find sustenance with anyone at a cheaper price than twenty-seven florins of Strasbourg currency, which amount to almost 29 of our currency. For Dasypodius does not receive anyone into his house for less than 20 crowns. I had no one to turn to except one Bedrot, who offered himself to me, although he could not provide a place for my studies in his home. But Martin Beyer from Schaffhausen assisted me in this, who received me into his hypocaust, which he had rented.</p>
      <p>I see that I cannot stay here longer; however, the plague does not leave Basel at all, which has now also claimed our Ulpian as a victim. I would very much like to stay here until the upcoming Frankfurt fair; for then Sturm will be able to put an end to the dialectics. Now, please support me with your advice, I beg you.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new to write; therefore, I cease now. Please greet on my behalf your most honorable mother and wife and the whole assembly of your family. To all of whom I wish that the new year may begin joyfully, pass joyfully, and have a joyful end with you presiding.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, unique patron, and always keep your Rudolf commended to you.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, on the Nones of December 1538.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rod.</p>
      <p>Your Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed patron and teacher.</p>
