    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is likely well informed about the situation in Bern, particularly regarding the Lutheran-leaning party. As proof of the Bernese council's efforts against this faction, Pfister sends the enclosed mandate. It may seem insignificant, but it is very important. The Bernese pastors were able to spread the Lutheran doctrine by appointing preachers without properly examining them regarding their faith, because they either suspected or were even certain of their Lutheran inclination.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is nothing further to report, especially since Jodocus [Kilchmeyer] always precedes Pfister in writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Nicolaus Pfister to Heinrich Bullinger, a man most learned in every respect, sends greetings. How we are doing and what we are up to, most candid man, especially concerning the Lutheran faction, I believe is not unknown to you. However, so that you may understand more fully the efforts of our most honorable council in suppressing the Lutheran sect, I wanted to send you this mandate; which, although it may be considered insignificant, is nevertheless very useful for what we are attempting. For the pastors of our church have greatly propagated Luther's doctrines in this way, by sending out preachers without a thorough examination (indeed without any examination at all), whom they thought or knew to be imbued with Lutheran doctrine. You, I know, will agree with me.</p>

      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and forgive my importunity. I have nothing else worthy of writing. Jodocus always anticipates my arguments. I ask you to greet your colleagues on my behalf. Bern, December 4.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man both learned and a fervent defender of pure Christian faith, and his dear friend.</p>
