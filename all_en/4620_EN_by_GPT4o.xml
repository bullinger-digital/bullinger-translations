      <p>François Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Most excellent father, until now I have delayed writing both to you and to the most illustrious Mr. Martyr, while he was returning from the court, whom I had sent there to bring me a full account of the state of our France. Now, while I eagerly await him, so that I may not be accused of negligence by you, whom I revere and observe as the best parent, I have decided to write to you what a certain spirit has reported to me. The King of Navarre does not indeed satisfy us, yet he has bound the hope and expectation of all; he retains his authority and dignity and fights over it with the Italian Medici, who, incredibly to say, is driven with such rage against Christian people. Therefore, she wanted to bind him by oath to promise that he would keep the young Charles in the paternal and friendly religion. The Constable, along with Navarre, has driven away the entire army and undoubtedly plots the ruin of the Guises, who earnestly urge from the Italian and Navarre that they be allowed to be absent from the court and either go to Rome or to Lorraine.</p>
      <p>The Admiral and his brother Andelot faithfully offer their service to Navarre; but he especially is extolled to the heavens by all with praises for the excellent speech he delivered before Navarre and the other nobles: that the king was miserably punished by God with life because he dealt so inhumanely with his subjects. The Prince of Condé retains greater constancy in custody than when he was free and unbound; it is most certain that he has expelled the little priest from his chamber, whom the Medici had sent there to perform mass; furthermore, he does not wish to leave custody before the accusation is known and retaliation is established for the slanderers. The widow of Scotland (Mary, Queen of Scots) sets out for Fontainebleau with a certain uncle of hers, agitating herself in wondrous ways and lamenting the loss of both kingdoms; how dear she is to the Scots, she does not ignore. I have nothing at all to say about the assembly of the three estates; they say it has begun to be held, but then postponed, which indeed is most pleasant news to me; for as they were constituted, they brought me great fear, since they were prepared and contrived by the Guises for their own purposes. Many also confirm that an edict has been promulgated, that all who were in custody and chains because of religion should be freed. These are the matters from France.</p>
      <p>Our princes are holding a meeting in Neuburg on the 21st day of this month. Would that they might decide something about restraining the preachers; but I fear that some may cause offense to the Elector Palatine. Our Marbach (does he seem to you an excellent man?): "Indeed," he says, "if it is true what they say about France, that the gospel will be proclaimed there, all will become Zwinglians." Did this voice come from the spirit of God or another? To me and Mr. Zanchi, all are most hostile because of a certain most trifling little book; but God will be a parent and protector to us against their snares.</p>
      <p>Whom I pray, that he may preserve you and your church with his spirit. Most illustrious man and most revered father, farewell and be well, and greet Mr. Martyr, the venerable old man, with all your colleagues most honorably. Strasbourg, January 8, 1561.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
