      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father, what I wanted to write to you, I sent eight days ago; in the meantime, no one from our side has departed because of the holidays. I am writing to Mr. Erastus, who first urged me with his letters to do so; he wishes to understand from me the proceedings of our assembly, which I am sending. It is arranged between Valentin Winckler and me that he will receive these letters from you and faithfully deliver them to Mr. Erastus; for when Mr. Valentin was present, I did not have the time to write.</p>
      <p>I would like you to diligently encourage Valentin to conduct himself as befits a good evangelist, so that if he were to commit anything unworthy (which I do not at all expect), it would not reflect back on us, who have recommended him to foreigners. A servant of the Lord should not fight, but be gentle; this should be diligently instilled in him; in this part, I find something lacking in him; otherwise, he is pious and honest. I assume my letters, which I sent to you last week, have been delivered to you; but I would still like to be informed about it on occasion; they contain certain secrets. It was unfortunate for me that my relatives concealed from me that you had sent me Brentius's book; I thought copies were available at Froschauer's office and that my relatives had received them from there. Now I have sent to Eglin in Davos.</p>
      <p>If you sent it and wish it to be returned, I also desire to be informed about it through my relatives, if you do not have the time. There is nothing here with us now that I can inform you about; I am expecting letters from Hercules von Salis every day. If I have any certain news about Venetian affairs, I will not keep it from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and reverend father in Christ, and forgive me for being a bother to you in your affairs. You wish it so, that I send even empty letters, lest I seem to have neglected my duty.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well, as do we and our family.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 29, 1561.</p>
      <p>May God grant you and all yours a blessed and happy year.</p>
      <p>My wife has given me a young son for the good year; he was born on the 27th of this month, which was the day of John the Evangelist; thus his name is John; he lives and, as I hope, will live, although I have the inconvenience that my wife does not nurse him; but we have a suitable nurse. Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow the councilors are coming; then one expects good care to be taken that nothing is neglected. Today I spent the whole day at a wedding; Captain Florinus von Tschudi was with us, along with other men of the Upper League, who behaved quite humanely, although otherwise they are papists. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and worthy head of the Church of Zurich, his ever-observant lord and patron.</p>
