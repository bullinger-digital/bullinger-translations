      <p> Greetings. For a long time, I had no messenger through whom I could write to you; now I have conveniently come across this one. First of all, we give the Lord the greatest thanks for correcting, with singular providence, what had already been a fault among us. We are very glad that the matter of the oath has been postponed again. We hope that this matter will never again reach the point it had already reached among us, and we do not doubt that if the plan had proceeded, a great sedition would have arisen among the citizens; for a large part of the citizens would never have sworn. We have done everything we could, both privately and publicly, as the whole church will testify. On the day I last wrote to you, we were all summoned to the council because of the freer treatment of this subject in public sermons; but we dealt with the council in such a way that it hardly had anything to respond with. We had already prepared to leave if they had wanted to impose silence on us. As for your letters, we read with great pleasure what you write about the success of the evangelical cause in Poland. May the Lord grant greater increase. Peace has also been established in the empire; only we seem not to have peace. I sent your letters to Calvin through a reliable messenger; I hope that matter will also be settled. </p>
      <p> There is nothing new with us, except that some say the Pope has reconciled with the Viceroy of Naples and that the French have been greatly deceived by him. Many also conjecture that the Emperor is dead; however, nothing certain is known. I will write more soon; for now, I am very busy. All of ours greet you. May yours also be well. Bern, November 18, 1555. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot. </p>
