      <p>We recently received your son, whom you sent to Strasbourg for the cultivation of his intellect, with as much kindness as we could at the time, but not as much as we wished, partly due to the harsh weather and partly due to the speed of his journey. Nevertheless, we showed him all the notable sights. Yesterday, I received letters from our Oporinus from the Frankfurt fair, which indicate that England is full of turmoil and internal seditions; the new queen is cruelly raging against the evangelicals, many of whom she has imprisoned, among them Peter Martyr, a most holy man said to be of no small renown. The Emperor was again defeated in a great conflict by the French. The Margrave of Brandenburg, that cruel tyrant, is acting as a robber in the territory of Bremen with a large army, as is his custom, and is threatening his neighbors with the sword. He intercepted several wagons of Nuremberg merchants at the Frankfurt fair and seized a considerable booty. The death of the Bishop of Basel has stirred up troubles among us; for the people of Solothurn, upon hearing of his death, secretly placed a garrison in Dornach, and the people of Ettingen captured all the peasants except for two who escaped by flight, and took them to the castle of Dornach. They also captured six from the village of Arlesheim, who were allied with the people of Basel for the preaching of the gospel; but they were immediately freed by the envoys of Basel. A delegation was sent by our magistrate to Solothurn to find out with what intention they invaded foreign lands and what they are planning.</p>
      <p>I fear that a sufficient occasion for waging war against the people of Solothurn has been given to the people of Basel. I wanted to inform you of these things in as few words as possible, most distinguished man; if you have any news from England or other parts of the world, please share it. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 24th of September, 1553. Please convey my greetings to my uncle Pellicanus, Mr. Theodor, and other friends.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, my greatest friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
