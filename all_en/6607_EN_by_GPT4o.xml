      <p>Greetings. What shall I write or say, my brother Fabricius? Sorrow follows sorrow and increases beyond measure. You know how much pain has been stirred in me by the deaths of my loved ones.</p>
      <p>Now the death of the most illustrious, learned, and holy man, Mr. Gessner, almost kills me.</p>
      <p>O wretched me, who, half-alive, am forced to follow so many funerals. But since it pleases the Lord so, I willingly submit myself to His discipline.</p>
      <p>Last night he passed away at the 11th hour to the Lord; yesterday, bidding me farewell, he professed his faith and commended himself to the mercy of God through Christ.</p>
      <p>He labored until his last breath; yesterday he even wrote some things. He never lay down, always either sat or walked about.</p>
      <p>On Sunday he was still in the sacred assembly. A most pestilent anthrax seized his heart; a large boil settled under his left armpit. Grief does not allow me to say more.</p>
      <p>All your letters and the money itself were delivered to me intact and correctly. What shall I say? I truly owe you much; therefore, I will not show myself ungrateful to you.</p>
      <p>I give you my greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I will write to Mr. Councillor Tscharner when I have more spirit; meanwhile, you act on my behalf immediately.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I have many things about the uncovered treacheries from France, but I cannot write them.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 14, 1565.</p>
      <p>He will be buried at 4 in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger</p>
