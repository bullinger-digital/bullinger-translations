      <p>Greetings. I am responding to your two letters with one reply, and I ask you, most esteemed sir, not to take it amiss; for you must attribute this to my overwhelming duties, which tend to be more burdensome around Easter. You wrote the first on the first of March, and the second on the fifth of the same month.</p>
      <p>In these, you excuse both yourself and your son Johann and suspect that your brother Hector falsely reported your son. However, my most esteemed lord, I heard this from others, not from Hector, whom I wish to be excused in good faith before you; for even if he speaks broadly, do not think that it was through his report that these matters became known to us.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt about your faith and integrity and do not want you to be concerned about this matter. I know you have a better opinion of me than to believe that I would deprive children of their necessary sustenance, and since I am well aware of my own conscience, I disregard all slanders, accusations, and complaints from everyone. Whether Hector complains about me, I do not know; I do know that he has no just cause for complaint, if indeed he complains about me... I almost daily rebuke him; but I owe him this; I refrain from blows, although he is often deserving of them; yet this is troublesome to me. Therefore, I recently wrote to you that it would be more beneficial for the boy if he were to find a more leisurely host who would not hesitate to use the rod; this would benefit the boy more than can be expressed. I have no complaints about his aptitude for learning, and he learns quite adequately what he is instructed to learn, nor does he reproduce it unsuccessfully, so do not contend with him over his education.</p>
      <p>However, his spirit is unrestrained and more than impertinently extravagant. If you now reprimand him severely with words and admonish him with discipline to abstain from this and that, he listens and does not murmur, but at the first opportunity, he soon returns to his nature. Therefore, I detest that untamed and fearless spirit.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, this fault could be corrected if he were to follow a diligent and tireless teacher. I, as I freely admit and you yourself know, am weary and engaged with other numerous labors.</p>
      <p>If he were manageable and had an inherent fear, I would easily guide him and gladly keep him for the sake of the venerable old man, my incomparable friend, and yours; but since I fear he may be neglected with me, I inform you in time. You will convey this to his father or at least those parts that will not distress him, and indeed suitably; I cannot write to him personally. The parent requested that I write to him through this Laurentius Lumaga. You will kindly greet him and his father-in-law and everyone.</p>
      <p>I would otherwise have much to write if there were only time; I will write another time. Love me as you always do. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 4, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I hope you have promptly and well taken care of the letters intended for my Christophorus. To the noble, steadfast Friedrich von Salis, commissioner in Chiavenna, his kind, dear young lord.</p>
