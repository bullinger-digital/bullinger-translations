      <p>To the most esteemed and faithful brothers in Christ, the ministers and professors of the Church of Zürich in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Unless it had been known and proven to us for many years, most esteemed brothers, with what desire for promoting the glory of God you have cultivated that field, which has been entrusted to you by the heavenly Father, with your continuous labor as diligent farmers, and strive to cultivate it more each day, and how the afflictions of your brothers, who for the name of Christ are thrown into prisons and at any moment expect death itself, move you, we would never have dared even to think of writing to you about these matters. But since it has often been conveyed to us through the words of many pious and authoritative men, and experience itself sufficiently testifies, that nothing is more ancient to you than the honor of that most good and great God, and that you perceive no less pain from the hardships of your brothers, who fall into the bloody hands of the antichristians for defending His word, than if you were enclosed in the same prisons with them and experienced and endured the same: we have therefore decided to send these letters to you all with so much more confidence, so that we may first of all give you immortal thanks for the labor you have expended for our cause, and then to ask and beseech you again and again to continue to offer your assistance to us. We are more confident that you will do this willingly, as it can contribute more to the glory of God by vindicating it from the insults and tyranny of impious men and by arousing and kindling more vehemently the languishing spirits of many sons of God. For although many, and indeed men of great renown, have labored not inconsiderably for our liberation up to this day, and their labor has not been entirely in vain, yet not as much fruit has reached us from it as seemed at first it would.</p>
      <p>For although even the Bernese princes themselves, at most five or four months ago, obtained our liberation from the king, and have long since written letters to our adversaries as witnesses of this matter, and although even Cardinal Tornacensis, most recently returning from Rome and passing through their lands, promised them that as soon as he came to Lyon, he would allow us to leave the prisons and return to our former studies: yet he is so far from having stood by his promises or having decided to stand by them, that neither he nor his followers have ever revealed their deadly hatred and wicked desire to shed our innocent blood more openly than after his arrival. For since they saw that we could never be drawn by their pestilential flatteries into their own impious opinion about religion (which nevertheless could have happened to them nothing more desirable or pleasing), they began to pour out all their efforts, as they say, in open battle, so that the sentence unjustly pronounced against us as convicted of heresy on the third of the Ides of May in the Parisian senate, to which we then appealed, may be ratified, and so that they may finally satisfy their immense and immoderate lust for drinking our blood.</p>
      <p>Since these things are so, we have no other safer refuge to which we can flee as to a sacred anchor than that very leader for whom we have hitherto fought against his enemies. Therefore, since he alone can repel whatever danger threatens us from our head at any moment, when it seems good to him, we especially implore his help with constant prayers. Then we do not hesitate to ask our brothers, to whom the glory of God is of the greatest concern and who pity us, to help us with their protection if they can.</p>
      <p>Among whom, since you hold not the least parts, you will forgive us, if it pleases you, that we do not hesitate to earnestly beseech you through these letters, that as much as it is in your power, you do not disdain to help us with your favor. We write these things to you because we have learned from certain pious men, and indeed from the Swiss, that the legate, who was appointed by the king in Switzerland in place of the one who recently died, is endowed with remarkable humanity and uncommon learning, and is not moderately delighted by the company of pious and learned men, and therefore has decided to live not far from your city. Since this is so, and he (as far as has been indicated to us) thinks very well of orthodox religion, and has considerable influence with the king, and we do not doubt that he will do many things for your sake, we beseech you to recommend our cause to him as ardently as possible, as the enemies of truth attack us more eagerly, and strive with all their might that we may be punished with the ultimate penalty. We also write supplicatory letters to him, in which we trust that some place will be left for us with him because of his singular humanity towards all and the fairness of the cause we defend, especially if your intercessions for us with him are added to them.</p>
      <p>And lest it seem strange to you that we so greatly desire to be snatched from the hands of our enemies and strive for it by whatever way is permitted to us without any detriment to the glory of God, consider that it is not because we place our life before His honor, or refuse to pour it out for the name of Christ (since it is not hidden from us that nothing happier can happen to us, and we know that we will then truly be blessed when we have returned our life to Him from whom we received it, being put to death for His word), but so that we may longer serve to expand His kingdom to the best of our ability, and fulfill our duty towards our parents, to whom we owe our very life after God, and whom the Father of all things has joined to us with no less a bond of necessity than the body to the soul: whose condition we rightly deplore, because they do not truly know Him by whom they were created, but, immersed in darkness more than the Cimmerians, embrace impious superstitions and the wicked doctrines of the Roman Phalaris (as we also once did) as true religion and sincere worship of God. From which great servitude, since the Lord has delivered us by His immense mercy into the true liberty of the sons of God, and has shown us the right way to that heavenly kingdom by His Holy Spirit, we cannot indeed but grieve most deeply for their condition, who, created by the same supreme artificer with us, do not serve Him with us, but, leaving the most clear and abundant fountain of that perennial water, are daily carried to broken cisterns with the greatest danger to their souls.</p>
      <p>These are the chief reasons, dearest brothers, for which we burn with incredible desire to live longer, if it seems good to the Lord, and to escape the hands of those who have conspired for our death: although it does not escape us that even if we die, the Lord will call our parents and others related to us by blood (to whom we owe much more by the law of nature than to others), if they are from the number of His elect, to the knowledge of His Son, our only Savior, when the day appointed by Him comes. Therefore, since our adversaries desire nothing more ardently than that we may soon be dragged to death and our mouths be stopped with burning fire, and they strive for this as the most desired end of all their prayers day and night, we beseech you all, as members of that very body for which we also suffer, and daily expect death like sheep destined for slaughter, to help us with your prayers to the Lord, and not to forget to commend our cause to that pious legate, and also (if it is not troublesome to you) to exhort the most illustrious Zürich princes to this. To whom we would have most gladly written unless we had been fully persuaded that, upon receiving these, you would leave no opportunity to help or relieve us untried. When you have done this, you will be considered to have brought aid not so much to us as to Christ Himself, whose cause we have undertaken to defend and hope to defend to the last breath: from whom also, as the just judge of all, you will receive the reward promised to those who will strive to defend Christ in His members on that supreme day: and you will bind us to you forever, as long as we enjoy this light, although we already feel ourselves to be wonderfully obliged to you. We therefore commend ourselves and all that is ours to you as dearest brothers. Farewell. May the Lord govern you with His Holy Spirit, and daily promote all your efforts and labors to the glory of His name, and to the relief of the miserable members of Christ afflicted by the antichristians. From the prisons of Lyon.</p>
      <p>Your dearest brothers in Christ, for the same name and word long since cast into chains.</p>
      <p>Martialis Alba. Ludwig Corbelius. Peter Scribanus. Karl Fabritius.</p>
      <p>Peter Naverius. Bernard Seguinus.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it will not be burdensome for you, when recommending our cause to the legate, to beseech him to inform the official of Lyon and the royal prefect that he has been asked by the Swiss princes to warn them by letters not to persecute us, whom the King of France has long since considered liberated, with such hatred, nor to cause us any trouble, especially since at this very time it is by no means appropriate to cause trouble for the Swiss. These things, if it pleases you, you will ask him to write to them or something of this kind, which may instill terror in them or at least somewhat recall them from such a wicked mind against us: and finally, the Lord will most abundantly compensate all your labors expended for His cause, which we defend.</p>
      <p>They were burned in Lyon on the 16th of May 1553, steadfast in the faith of Christ. Cordelius was released.</p>
