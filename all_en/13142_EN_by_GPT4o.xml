    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has the righteous monastery bailiff [...] before him, who brings two boys to study in Zurich, whom he would like to accommodate in the same place as Paul, so that the latter can be their tutor. Since Bullinger is already committed to study and students, a recommendation for the two boys is unnecessary. The monastery bailiff also brings, with a fourteen-day delay, the money for Master Otto [Werdmüller]. He will settle accounts with him and thank him for the benefits shown to Paul. Afterwards, he will go with his boys and Paul to the citizen recommended by Bullinger [...]. Bullinger should ensure that all this happens in good agreement with Otto [Werdmüller], so that he remains well-disposed towards Blasius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] No further news has arrived from Italy, except for the enclosed letter for Bullinger and Konrad Gessner, which contains all the essential information. Blasius would like to thank Bullinger for his last letter [not received], and especially for his careful report on the events in Germany, which he sent to them, living in such a remote place in the Alps.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding the dispute [in Chiavenna] between Agostino Mainardi and Camillo Renato, the following can be reported: Blasius had urged both opponents to appear at the next synod after reading Bullinger's writing ["De sacramentis"] and be ready to give an account of their faith. Agostino Mainardi's confession of faith was read before the assembled synod and found to be orthodox, as it aligns with Bullinger's teachings as well as those of the old and new authors. Camillo Renato, on the other hand, did not attend the synod and also did not report in writing. Therefore, he was forbidden to contradict the preacher [Mainardi] in the future. He was obliged to remain silent. But as is well known, preaching to deaf ears is in vain, and Bullinger knows the stubborn spirit of such quarrelsome people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings. May Bullinger remain with the troubled church for a long time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He should entrust the letter intended for Basel to a reliable messenger.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Heinrich Bullinger, greetings. The man you see here in person, most esteemed sir, is the administrator of our monasteries, a good and sincere man, who, out of love for learning, is bringing two young men to you, whom he wishes to place with my Paul and even in his lodging, so that they may use Paul as their tutor. I know it is unnecessary to commend them to you at length, as I have often experienced how eager you are to support studies and students. Therefore, he has also decided to send the money intended for Master Otto [Werdmüller] 14 days ago. He will settle accounts with him and express gratitude for the benefits bestowed upon his son. Then, he will commend my Paul along with his boys to some respectable citizen, as you will show. Therefore, most esteemed brother, ensure that this is done with the good will and grace of Master Otto, so that he does not consider me either stupid or entirely ungrateful, etc.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, we have received no news from Italy in the meantime, except for these letters addressed to you and Master Gessner, which undoubtedly make you aware of all that is worth knowing. Moreover, we read your last letters with great joy, and we are immensely grateful to you for informing us, who dwell in the corners and Alps of the world, so diligently about all the matters currently stirring in Germany, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Finally, regarding the dispute between Master Agostino and Brother Camillo and how it was resolved, take note: After reading your writings on the institution and virtue of the sacraments, we summoned both parties to appear at the next synod, where each would give an account of his faith and doctrine. We read the confession written by Agostino in our assembly and approved it as orthodox and pious, that is, in agreement with your doctrine and that of other authors, both ancient and modern, and conforming in every way. Camillo, however, driven by an unknown spirit, did not appear nor did he write anything in response, to whom (so that he may not contradict the true preacher in the future) we imposed silence. But we fear we have sung a tale to a deaf man. For you know how stubborn and contentious such natures are, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man in the Lord to all of us, through Jesus our Lord, who may deign to preserve you with His kindness for His trembling church for a long time. Amen. Chur, 12th day of December, in the year 1547.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Ensure that the letters intended for Basel are transferred by a reliable messenger, etc.</p>
      <p>Your same Blasius, sincerely, preacher at the Church of St. Regula.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and truly pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful and vigilant Antistes of the great Church of Zurich, his always most esteemed master.</p>
