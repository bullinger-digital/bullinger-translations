      <p>Greetings. Since we are firmly convinced, most revered lord and father, that your excellency and your wife, our dearest mother, along with your beloved entire family, are equally eager to hear from us as we are from you, and wish to know something certain about the state of our journey, I have decided to inform you as much as leisure permits. For we have been hindered by many things, especially in transcribing the writings of the opposing party on the matter of the Holy Trinity, for the benefit of learned men here, who, encouraged by the diligence of Lord Tretius, have turned their attention to writing for the Polish churches, and thus we could not provide more extensive information.</p>
      <p>Know, therefore, my most revered father, that so far, by the grace of God, everything is proceeding according to our wishes.</p>
      <p>But so that the Lord, the best and greatest, may further bless our journey, it will be your duty, as you have begun, to implore divine assistance for us.</p>
      <p>We will soon write more from Strasbourg, as we are setting out by boat early tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>Our boys, Stanislaus and Andreas, occupied here with the Poles in Basel, were unable to write, but they send their warmest greetings to you all and ask for forgiveness for not writing.</p>
      <p>We wish your excellency, our beloved mother, and the rest of our family the best of health.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, May 9, 1563. Written in the second watch of the night. Your excellency's most obedient son in all things, Laurentius Semlinus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent overseer of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord forever.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
