    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should ensure that no [Zürich] printer publishes [Johannes] Zwick's [“Christian, entirely comforting instruction... with a very beautiful explanation of the Our Father, also the seven last words of Christ”], as the [Konstanz] printer [Balthasar Romätsch] is doing so at great expense. If necessary, Bullinger should contact the council and mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], or Blarer will do it himself if Bullinger prefers. Blarer, Romätsch, and also Konrad Z[wick] would be grateful if Bullinger would advocate for this. - [Blarer has entrusted Hans] Welser's letter to Bullinger [No. 2156] [Heinrich von Ulm], who has delivered it to [Jakob] Röist. - It is not yet known [in Konstanz] whether a truce with the Turks has been agreed upon. The [imperial] envoys [Gerhard Veltwyck, Nikolaus Sick, and Giovanni Maria Malvezzi] apparently have not yet returned. Some believe that [Charles V] and [Francis I] are conspiring to divide the world among themselves, without disadvantaging the Pope [Paul III]. - In the matter [of Konrad Zwick's art of war], [Heinrich von Ulm] definitely wants to write to Bullinger to ease his conscience. - Bullinger writes terrible things about [the persecution] of the Waldensians. May the survivors remain on the path of truth and may the opponents feel the punishment of God! Even if they have to testify to the Gospel with their blood, the believers comfort themselves with the thought that they are fighting for the one who sits at the right hand of God and once said: “Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?” - [Heinrich von Ulm] will dispatch a messenger [...] to Zürich, to whom Blarer will entrust his letter. - There is nothing new from the Diet [at Worms]. King [Ferdinand I] and [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] want to reestablish the Swabian League. Many [Protestants] even seem inclined to do so, even though the [Catholics] only seek their own security and the endangerment [of the Protestants]! - Blarer asks Bullinger to advocate with the mayors [Johannes] Haab and [Hans Rudolf] Lavater in Blarer's matter [the alliance between Konstanz and the Swiss Confederation]. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I send this one letter to you to ask, as much as I can, that for my sake, as far as it is in your power, you ensure that your printers there do not soon print with their types what our printer here is already publishing at great expense for his modest means. This concerns the expositions of our excellent Zwick on the seven last words of the Lord, along with some others, etc. It seems fair that charity should obtain from them that they willingly allow the first to see profit who made the initial expenses in this matter, especially since they have enough material from which to gain profit, and you abundantly supply them with arguments to exercise their presses. Therefore, my Bullinger, by your authority with them, ensure that their untimely diligence does not hinder the honest efforts of our poor man. If it is necessary to implore the office of your senate or consuls here, I know you will not hesitate to do so for our sake, unless you prefer that I do it myself. You will greatly gratify not only me and our printer but also our Konrad Zwick, who you know loves and respects you equally.</p>
      <p>I sent you a letter from Welser, the consul of Augsburg, through Röist, to whom our brother-in-law entrusted it to be delivered to you.</p>
      <p>It is still unknown to us whether a truce with the Turks has been obtained, nor do they think the envoys have returned yet. There are those who are convinced that the Emperor and the French King are conspiring in marvelous ways and are entirely focused on dividing the whole world between themselves, if possible, without defrauding the Roman Pontiff in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of the cousin, the brother-in-law will write to you somewhat. He desires in every way to satisfy his mind and free his conscience, as far as it concerns you; then there will be enough opportunities which he can seize without violating the Christian law and make his case.</p>
      <p>The things you wrote about the Waldensians are horrendous and more than cruel. May the Lord be with them; may those who survived this disaster continue steadfastly on the path of truth they have once entered. Their adversaries, who abuse the Lord's tolerance and long-suffering in this way, will one day feel the avenger and vindicator of His saints. We know for what purpose we are placed, and this alone consoles us, that He sits at the right hand of the Father, for whom we fight, and sees everything, who once said: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” [Acts 9:4].</p>
      <p>If it seems good to Him that we testify to His Gospel with our blood, so be it, may His will be done, and may He add grace by His kindness, so that we do nothing unworthy of His name and our profession.</p>
      <p>The brother-in-law will send a messenger there, to whom I have entrusted these hastily written letters to be delivered to you.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing from the Diet that is worth informing you about. The King and the little bishop of Augsburg, on behalf of others as well, are very anxious and leave nothing untried to restore the Swabian League. And I hear that the hearts of many of our people are inclined towards it, although our Catholics seek nothing else in this matter than to be secure from us and to expose us in turn to a thousand dangers.</p>
      <p>But farewell in the Lord, my venerable and dearest brother. I can write no more. June 3, 1545.</p>
      <p>Proceed, commend my cause - about which I recently informed your consuls Lavater and Haab - to them with the utmost faith.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you; may all the brothers there who are your friends be well. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend.</p>
