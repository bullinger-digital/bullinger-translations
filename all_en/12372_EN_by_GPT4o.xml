    <p xml:id="regest1">Since [Johannes Haller] is returning to [Zurich] and can verbally report on Ochino's affection for Bullinger, it would not be necessary for Ochino to write to Bullinger. However, due to the abundance of his heart, he could not refrain from doing so. Bullinger should send [Haller back to Augsburg] as soon as possible, who is so full of virtues and piety that even his enemies must love him. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan. Bullinger should pray for Ochino.</p>

      <p>Most Illustrious.</p>
      <p>As this brother of yours and mine in Christ comes to you, it was not necessary for me to write anything; for he himself could verbally express to your kindness my feelings towards you. However, from the abundance of my heart, I am compelled to disturb you, both very busy and very learned, with my unlettered letters and to make known to you how much I love you in Christ, which you must believe or experience. I also ask you, if you love me, to send this brother back to us as soon as possible; for his modesty, virtue, learning, and piety are such that even enemies (if there are any) are compelled to love him. We will be as brothers most closely united in Christ, and you will deign to greet all the brothers in Christ in my name, especially Pellikan, and remember me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, January 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly,</p>
      <p>Bernardino Ochino of Siena</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed theologian. Zurich.</p>
