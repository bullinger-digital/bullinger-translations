      <p>Greetings. Richard Thürr, an honorable citizen of Chur and my acquaintance, delivered to me a letter and a book from you (most esteemed lord), with which you have gifted me. I cannot express in words how delightful and pleasing both the letter and the book were. For who am I, that you (a man of far greater distinction and excellence) would honor me by gifting books? Indeed, nothing could have been more gratifying or acceptable to me than this gift.</p>
      <p>However, your letter, full of love and goodwill, brought me some sorrow, as it mentioned at the beginning that you, lord, gave me this gift as an example, so that I would not consider you ungrateful. Therefore, I beseech you, my most esteemed lord, why this? What have I done for you that should be remembered, for which gratitude should be given? From you, however, everything has been bestowed upon me that pertains to my benefit and honor. I truly understand that I cannot repay any part of these benefits, nor even think of doing so, with gratitude. The desire to honor you will never be lacking in me. As you command, lord, I will ensure that the copy attached to mine is safely transmitted to Lord Bonett, and I will do so diligently, so do not be concerned about this. My relative Bartholomäus Cornu from Castelmur will be here in Chur this week, to settle accounts with the steward of the monastery along with other leaders of our school. I will entrust this task to my relative; he will execute it faithfully - I am sure - and conveniently as well, since he is a neighbor to the people of Cleven. Farewell, most esteemed lord, and consider me entrusted to your faith. I wish your entire family well, especially the most excellent man, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, my esteemed friend and lord, the provost, my patron and singular benefactor. Chur, 27th of February, in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pontisella, your humble servant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
