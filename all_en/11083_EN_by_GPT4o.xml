    <p xml:id="regest1">Will accompany, by order of the council, together with Myconius, Bucer, and Capito to Bern, where, since Luther's response is still pending, there will hardly be negotiations about [the Eucharist], but rather about the dispute concerning Bucer; whether an agreement with Luther is possible remains to be seen. More should not be inferred from this journey. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wish you to be well, to thrive, and to flourish in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Bucer, along with Capito, is about to depart for Bern these days, having persuaded our council with letters to allow Myconius and me to accompany them, and I believe he has succeeded; for I see that this is how our people view it. Regarding the issue on which we disagree with Luther, I think nothing will be done. For it cannot be addressed until he responds to our confession. But because there is a serious complaint about Bucer and also a serious disagreement among the brothers, I think it will not be useless if they suspend their judgment with us for a while, until Luther responds and it becomes clear whether there is agreement or not. Certainly, we cannot oppose the efforts of those who wish to reconcile the church in such perilous times, until it is clearly established that either they are intolerable to us or we to them. Indeed, truth should be more important than any bond of kinship.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write to you about this matter, so that you would not think that something else was planned when you learn that we have set out. Our council's duty attaches us to them more for the sake of office than for business.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, you will be well with the dearest brothers, whom you will diligently greet for me in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us always in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To Lord Bullinger, dearest friend. Zurich.</p>
