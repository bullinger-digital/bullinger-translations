      <p>Greetings. I have long awaited some news to send to you. Today, an opportunity presents itself, though not very conveniently.</p>
      <p>The frequent and continuous sermons that I have to deliver compel me to be brief against my will. The most important things I write now are these. First, regarding the discussions, Viret was here and complained very seriously about their abolition.</p>
      <p>He also brought an entire booklet, full of words but not arguments, in which the people of Lausanne especially demand restitution. Meanwhile, we also received what you suggested about this matter.</p>
      <p>The method you write about was indeed in place when they were first instituted: but now they have a very different appearance. For anyone, even a foreigner unknown to us, not belonging to the ecclesiastical or classical order, was allowed to bring forward whatever pleased anyone's mind. It was also allowed to oppose different things. Hence, we could not hope for any peace at all. And although from the time those positions were disputed, which gave occasion to remove Sultzer and Beatus from office, they have abstained religiously from opposing and disputing, they nevertheless sought that license again and could not conceal it. And while it was not allowed, you would still hear the most virulent and biting words in their statements, with which they attacked each other. I was present once, and yet they could not restrain their barbs in my presence, but openly bit each other. From that time on, I always thought about imposing some method on this matter. The method was established by the most honorable senate, that each class should meet four times a year.</p>
      <p>They should have their ecclesiastical censures and considerations. They should correct what needs correcting, and send more difficult and excessive matters here. They should also discuss the Scriptures among themselves if anyone has any scruples. In the meantime, if anything worthy of a brotherly convocation happens, it should always be in the power of the deans and jurors to convene the brothers on any day, if it pleases them.</p>
      <p>If there are also some who are either neighbors or otherwise eager for sacred knowledge, they should be allowed to meet, either in Lausanne or elsewhere, according to each one's convenience: but this should be private, not public, and should only be done by the brothers and those who enjoy ecclesiastical functions under the dominion of our lords. This, in my judgment, fair and moderate constitution so moved those stubborn men that they complained as if it were a matter of the churches being entirely at stake. Nor did they keep it among themselves or among us only, but they also spread it everywhere to other churches, giving us the odious and antichristian name of tyranny over the churches. You can hardly believe what kind of letters Calvin sent to Musculus, and Farel to me. We, being well aware before God and the whole church that nothing here was done out of tyranny, but everything out of a desire for peace and love, responded amicably. What we have achieved, I do not know. As I said, Viret came and spoke extensively about this matter before the senate. The senate referred the entire cause to us. We, who have nothing more at heart than that the peace begun should last, so that we are not dissolved again for such a cause, yielded so much that they are allowed to meet again weekly in Lausanne, in order, one after another, to discuss a place of Scripture in weekly turns: but only those things that pertain to the explanation and observations of the text should be brought forward, and no one is allowed to oppose or dispute anything. Those who have nothing to add are not compelled. It is free to attend or not to attend. No foreigner is allowed to bring anything forward: if any are present, they may listen, but not speak. Collections, prayers, etc., should be held as before. By this concession, we hoped we had given them more than enough. (For this plan of ours, when reported to the senate, was confirmed.) But even so, we could not satisfy them, especially in this part where we imposed the necessity of silence on foreigners and those not in ministry. Hence, I had no small dispute with our Viret [Greek] After a long contention, with hands given mutually, we were reconciled. This was done privately between us: otherwise, if the others knew, I know there would be no place for Viret among us anymore. I suppress everything for the sake of peace. I have not even revealed it to Musculus. Only to you. You will also keep it to yourself. You have the account of the discussions, which I remember our Cellarius in Augsburg used to call colocynth, because of the infection of doctrine.</p>
      <p>Then, regarding Christian Hochholtzer, I hear what you write; but he has not yet responded to the senate, which I am surprised about. I congratulate him on this condition, although I would have preferred to have him here with me. I am uncertain and completely at a loss in the election of another. It is not for an old man to administer this province; we have some young learned men, but in whom there is a risk concerning doctrine.</p>
      <p>If you have any advice or help, please let me know promptly. The matter with Schwyz and Glarus I have reported to some of my lords, as you wrote to me, and although I found some displeasure among some regarding the rights of Thurgau, which I did not intend, I have also found enough that I hope it will be brought before the council and something will be done. Some prominent people say to my face: "Why should we deal with Zürich? Everything that we undertake and gladly handle secretly with them is immediately spread from Zürich into the lands." This is for you alone.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I ask you to let me have all the statutes of the city of Zürich, especially concerning the punishment of adultery, as soon as you can; have them copied at my expense. They would like to make some changes here, so I must have it. There is a statute that the guilty person, if they wish to remarry after a year and a half from the appearance, should be removed from the church they have offended with their adultery; thus, every adulterer who is divorced, if they wish to remarry, must be removed from the city. They would like to break this; thereby the door and gate to debauchery would be opened. We have no other excommunication. But they protect themselves with the Zürich reformation. Now I know well that the removal is not from Zürich; but I would like to have the statute so that we can better counter them in other matters. I would prefer that what Zürich has better, we should imitate, and likewise those from Zürich should imitate us in what we have better; so they always want to take the bad as an example, leaving the good standing.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death of Judith, Musculus's daughter recently. Everything is safe both in Musculus's house and in mine. May the Lord preserve you and all yours, whom you will greet from me and mine. All the brothers send their greetings to you and to everyone else. Farewell. In great haste.</p>
      <p>Last of November, 1549, in Bern.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
