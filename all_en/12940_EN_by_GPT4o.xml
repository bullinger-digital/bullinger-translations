    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer is in a hurry. He has no desire to write letters anymore because there are so many false rumors circulating at the moment. Everyone tells what they would like to hear, and soon it turns out to be false! If there were something reliable to report, Blarer would immediately inform. Bullinger should not take offense if he writes less often now. It is simply not possible otherwise! Currently, completely contradictory news is arriving simultaneously from Augsburg, Ulm, or Nuremberg!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should urgently take care of Hans Schöner's matter. Blarer expressed his opinion to him in a letter and asked him to also convey it to Bullinger. On the whole, he finds that Schöner is being too vilified, even though everyone admits that he is a pious man. However, they condemn his behavior and blame his hot-tempered and reckless character for it (not any evil intent). But if he wants to be reconciled, he must humble and submit himself, as these people certainly do not want to give the impression that they have acted wrongly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed are letters from Augsburg [HBBW XIX, No. 2867 and possibly also No. 2858 from Haller]. Blarer is sending them only now because otherwise, he would have had to dispatch a messenger for a fee. They are now being delivered by Augsburg students who are going to study in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The church of Konstanz is entrusted to the hearts of the people of Zurich. The captains [Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz] are still there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] How is it that Vadian has still not sent the records [about the last Diet of Baden]? Bullinger should in the future address communications intended for Vadian first to Blarer, who will forward them to him within two days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] He should also return the highly confidential document.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The envoys from Memmingen, who were supposed to obtain a reduction of the imposed fine of 80,000 florins from Emperor Charles V, have returned without success. They reported that the Emperor had met with King Ferdinand and Duke Maurice, and that Duke Wilhelm V of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, King Christian of Denmark, and Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, were advocating for peace with the Emperor, but he would not be dissuaded from his harsh peace terms. They also reported that 4,000 Spaniards attacked a Saxon town called "Lauw" or "Leuwe" [Glauchau] and killed all the inhabitants. Immediately afterward, the troops of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony are said to have come and burned down the town along with the Spaniards still in it as punishment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Enclosed is a letter from Martin Frecht from Ulm. [Due to lack of time] Blarer could not copy it. Bullinger should return it immediately so that Blarer can respond to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The bailiff [Hans Schnell] of Tettnang in the service of Count Hugo of Montfort-Tettnang recently boasted to a preacher from Konstanz that the Emperor had reconciled with Landgrave Philip of Hesse and the Elector and would now besiege Konstanz to march against the Confederates this summer. He wants to completely exterminate the Swiss!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Welsers and others [from Augsburg] who had fled to Arbon have arranged for the return of their belongings and were completely unconcerned, especially since [Augsburg] is reconciled with the Emperor. Between Lindau and Wangen, Spaniards or Italians attacked the wagon with the "precious loot," killed the driver [...] and brought the wagon to Lindau to Pfäfferli's inn. There they slit open the bales of goods and took the contents along with the horses inland. Only the wagon was left behind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Terrible things are happening in Frankfurt. Several people are being quartered, and many are being horribly tortured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Blarer cannot write more. Greetings to Konrad Pellikan and the other colleagues. Request for prayer. Greetings from Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger should send information about the day in Solothurn.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Surely Bullinger has not received Blarer's letter of April 19 [No. 2886 of the "20th"] with the [aforementioned] document and the letter of April 24. This is therefore his third letter.</p>

      <p>In the greatest haste. Although many rumors are circulating, nothing substantial and reliable is being reported, everything is so baseless that I truly have no desire to write anything in such great human vanity. I am more and more inclined not to write anything back and forth, as everything falls apart everywhere, and I cannot trust any news with certainty. But when I have true and reliable news, it will always be shared with you at the first opportunity I have. The whole world is a rogue and everyone brings up what they would like to be true, in the cities and elsewhere. Therefore, you should not mind if I write more slowly and less frequently about the events in the future. It will not be possible anymore. From Augsburg, Ulm, and Nuremberg, contradictory and conflicting news can be written at any moment!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding Schöner, they have been urgently requested. Considering how to approach his matter. I have written my opinion to him with a request that it be conveyed to you. I find in everything that he is being treated unfairly. Although they all say he is a good, pious man, they still wrong the manner of his actions. They attribute it to his hot-headed simplicity rather than deliberate malice. He will now have to humble and deeply submit himself if he wants to achieve anything. For these people do not want to be seen as having wronged anyone, as you well know!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am sending you letters from Augsburg, which I truly could not deliver to you earlier, as I could not have a messenger in vain. Some students from Augsburg have taken their way to Basel to study there and have brought these letters with them.</p>

      <p>Let our church be entrusted to you without ceasing. Our captains are all still here.</p>

      <p>Vadian has still not sent me the records. I cannot wonder enough how it is going. Afterward, send me yourself what you want to grant me, and if he should also read it, I will always manage to deliver it to him within two days at the latest.</p>

      <p>Now those from Memmingen have come from the Emperor, as they had a mission with him to obtain a reduction of the 80,000 florins imposed on them. They have achieved nothing, etc. But they say that they found the Emperor, King, and Duke Maurice together, etc., and that Jülich, Denmark, and the one from Buren himself are seriously negotiating with the Emperor for peace, but the Emperor wants to make it very difficult and burden it with heavy, unbearable conditions. They also say that a small town in Saxony called Lauw or Leuwe; when the Emperor advanced, he gave it to the Spaniards, and immediately 4,000 Spaniards fell in, killing everyone, men, women, and children, young and old, but the Elector's troops came immediately afterward, and when they saw how they had killed everyone, they set the town on fire and burned it to powder along with the 4,000 Spaniards who were in it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Frechtus from Ulm writes to me, as you can see here. I cannot write anything from it. Send me the letter back and do not omit it; I must write back to him!</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The bailiff of Dettnang, the count of Montfort's official, has recently boasted greatly against a preacher from here, how the Emperor has reconciled with the Landgrave and the Elector, and will now take up arms next to besiege Konstanz, and not because of Konstanz, but he wants to start with Konstanz and end with the Confederates. And all this must happen this summer, so that no one will know or name a Swiss anymore! He has boasted a lot.</p>

    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Welsers and others who have been in Arbon have let their goods, household items, and silverware be brought home, being completely unconcerned, as they are reconciled. And the best wagon with silverware and the like has come between Lindau and Wangen. There some Spaniards or Italians came. They stabbed the wagon driver and brought the wagon to Lindau to Pfäfferli's inn, as if it were theirs. They opened the bales, in which the precious goods were packed, and took everything along with the wagon horses, leaving only the wagon behind.</p>
