    <p xml:id="regest1">On the eve, Blarer learned that the scribe [...] of the bailiff of Nellenburg, Hans Jakob von Landau, brought letters from the Innsbruck government [to Konstanz] and negotiated with some [council] lords; from one [...] of these, Blarer learned that the dispatch was connected with the council planned in Trient and that the [Tridentine] bishop [Cristoforo di Madruzzo] wanted to inquire about the order of the council [of Konstanz 1414 to 1418]; however, Blarer cannot believe that this is the only reason. Bullinger's letter still gave rise to a conversation with Konrad Zwick late in the evening, in which Blarer wanted to find out what he would do if the [council] lords of Zürich again showed their interest in his [military] art? Zwick replied that he would have liked to see this for a long time; that if they had agreed on this [in 1544], Konstanz and [Zürich] would have already benefited from it; but he had the impression that the matter was now being handled in an inappropriate way, perhaps because it does not correspond to God's will; Blarer did not want to conceal this from Bullinger, even though he wrote about it yesterday; he also did not know how the desired goal from him and [Bullinger] could be better achieved than through the way he advocated; how gladly he would nullify the foreseeable negotiations with [Zwick] at the Reichstag [in Worms]; if nothing better should be achieved [in relation to Zwick], it would be good to dissuade [him] from his plan, even if [false hopes had to be given to him]; should the Zürchers begin to negotiate with him correctly, they would soon be clear. If Bullinger finds this communication appropriate, he may pay the messenger; if he does not have the authority from [his council] to do so, he should not pay him at his own expense; Blarer would then only communicate the essentials.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace with all good.</p>
      <p>Last night after my last sermon, I learned that Mr. Hans Jakob von Landau, the bailiff of Nellenburg, had sent a scribe with several letters from the government in Innsbruck, who arrived yesterday and negotiated with some lords. Now, I asked someone about it; he did not want to reveal anything except this: A council has been set for Trient; the bishop there would like to know what order was maintained here in the council. However, I cannot believe that a scribe was sent solely for this matter and negotiated with the secret councilors, but perhaps other recruitments are also present. May God grant grace to all good! I begin to be suspicious of all things.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I was prompted by your letter to speak to my cousin Konrad Zwick late at night, among other things, about what he would think if the lords of Zürich were once again willing to engage with him regarding his art. To this, he replied to me roughly with these words: He would suffer a great loss of his goods if it were to happen, as it was last year when I also spoke with him. Then it must now be evident in the work what great benefit would have resulted for you and the city of Konstanz; although it is not yet too late if one had the desire for the matter. However, he sees well that one now wants to act in an inappropriate way, through which neither you nor others could be helped. Therefore, it would all be in vain, and he could not think otherwise than that it should not be from God. I did not want to withhold this from you out of loyalty, although I also mentioned it in my letter yesterday. I cannot find a better or more convenient way by which we might achieve the good end we are seeking. I would like to destroy the negotiations that are certainly and undoubtedly being undertaken at the Reichstag against my cousin.</p>
      <p>In summary, as I now know better than I knew before, that my advice was good and you can also recognize this from the developments, we will clearly see and understand it in a year from the evidence. Therefore, consider the matter diligently and earnestly. It is sometimes good to delay and also to vainly warn if one cannot achieve better. However, I firmly believe that you would soon find out to what end the matter would lead if a beginning were made by you. I leave it at that and ask you to keep this letter secret from others; for it is certainly important to me.</p>
      <p>Dated in Konstanz, December 29, 1544. If you find this my communication appropriate to the matter, you may pay the messenger; if not, I have no reason to be angry about it; for I have done it out of my careful thoughts. However, if you do not have the command from your own to pay such a messenger in such matters, even if you do not always show them the letters, you should not suffer any personal disadvantage or harm; for which I have also asked you most earnestly. I would otherwise write nothing further than what must be out of great significant necessity.</p>
      <p>To the [dear] Christian [lord Hein]rich Bul[linger, my] especially [beloved] lord. [Zürich].</p>
