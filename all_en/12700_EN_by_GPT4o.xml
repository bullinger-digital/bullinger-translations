    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received Myconius’ letters [No. 2649 and No. 2650] through [Christoph] Froschauer. Myconius should excuse the haste in this response!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Of the eight-page document about the Spanish Inquisition, "New News [from the Netherlands]", Bullinger only possesses four pages. He does not know its printer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is not known whether Jost von Meggen has returned from Rome. It is certain that the [Five Places] are preparing for war and the people of Zurich are on guard. Various reports are circulating about the activities of the former. However, Bullinger thinks that in the event of a victory by the German [Protestants], they fear for their faith. But this is unfounded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger has not heard about the victory of [Count Wilhelm von] Fürstenberg reported by [Johannes] Gast. But the many skirmishes are hardly distinguishable! According to experienced military men, there has never been a war conducted with such cunning, in such a bitter manner, and under such strange circumstances!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The rumor about the plundering of Rorschach by [mercenaries] of [King] Ferdinand [I.] is not true. After the people of Zurich sent letters of complaint to the people of Bregenz regarding their Italian auxiliary troops, they received the response that there was no intention to attack anyone, but rather to fend off a possible attack by the [German] Protestants. They maintain peace with the Confederates and their neighbors. Nevertheless, they are on guard, including the people of St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] What Myconius wrote about the planned invasion of the Bohemians into Saxony and the counteraction by Duke Moritz [of Saxony] was also reported in a letter to the Zurich council. However, Bullinger remained silent on this because even the messenger of this news [Heinrich Thomann] doubted its truthfulness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] On October 23, [Sebastian] Schertlin was still in Augsburg. This and more will be reported by [Hieronymus] Gunz, who brought Bullinger the latest letters from [Hans] Welser [not received], [Georg] Frölich [No. 2639], and [Johannes] Haller [No. 2640] from Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The people of Ulm are truly steadfast. May the Lord strengthen them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] That Myconius refers to Emperor [Charles V.] as the devil is true, as long as it refers to his incarnation. Frölich writes that the Emperor, with God's help, could not devastate Germany, except for a 10 to 15-mile stretch in Bavaria. Likewise, he was prevented from invading Württemberg. Unfortunately, the area around the Danube could not be protected from devastation. Hopefully, the Emperor can be driven back down the Danube!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger wrote on October 30 about the day [of the Four Protestant Places in Zurich] and other matters through the Frenchman [?] Wilhelm [Guillaume Vermod?] [not received]. There is nothing to add to that. Fortunately, the Zurich council and Bullinger exchange all news with each other: Bullinger receives news from the [Schmalkaldic] camp, from Augsburg, Ulm, Constance, and other places. However, there are also several envious people in Zurich who believe that nothing should be entrusted to the "priests" [the preachers], as this has gone badly before! No wonder, especially since the Lord has prophesied this hostility to His own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Bullinger has gladly and repeatedly read Myconius’ second, carefully written letter [No. 2650]. There is nothing more to say about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] On Saturday [October 30], councils and citizens gathered. All matters of the [aforementioned] day and other news [about the war] were discussed. They clearly committed to the Gospel and declared their readiness to risk everything for the [three other] Protestant cities and their neighbors, while still maintaining the alliances and peace with the [Nine] allied Confederates, if they also did so. It was further decided to organize guild meetings in the city, in the counties, lordships, and localities of Zurich, and to inform about the planned eradication of the Gospel by Pope [Paul III.] and the Emperor. For this purpose, a written "presentation" was prepared for reading.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Yesterday [Sunday], all guilds met. It was unanimously decided to bravely commit life and property. Subsequently, they eagerly began with armaments and prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] On Sunday [November 7], the meetings are to take place in the countryside. Bullinger will report further.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] All this is also intended for forwarding to [Francisco de] Enzinas, Gast, and the other colleagues. Greetings to them, to Myconius’ family including [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger] and [Josias] Simler. Bullinger writes early in the morning and cannot read through the letter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. Our Froschauer brought me your letters, most esteemed Myconius, to which I respond briefly. I ask you to forgive the haste.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have not yet seen the complete Spanish Inquisition document, but only two sheets or, so to speak, 4 pages, which make up 8 pages. I do not know who printed it. It is titled: "New News", etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have not yet heard whether Jost von Meggen has returned from Rome or not. However, it is certain that those people are preparing day and night and are already standing ready for war. There are indeed various rumors about their endeavors. I believe they fear for their religion in the event of a successful outcome for the Germans. They suspect that if things go well for the Germans, arms will be brought against them, and they will be forced into our religion, but this is in vain. Our people are diligently vigilant and have not been able to understand anything else so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have not yet heard about what Gastius said regarding Fürstenberg's victory. However, I will not contradict, for they meet every day and almost every moment, so that no one can report each individual battle. Indeed, this war is conducted in such a way that the most experienced military men say that within human memory, none has been conducted with such cunning, bravery, and bitterness of spirit, and with such novelty of circumstances.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The rumor about Ferdinand's men plundering Rorschach is utterly false. When our lords wrote to Bregenz and complained somewhat that they had accepted Italians as reinforcements, they responded very amicably, saying they had no intention of attacking or harming anyone (since they are not at war), but rather to fend off an attack that threatens them every day from the Protestants. Besides that, they are at peace with the Confederates and their neighbors, etc. Meanwhile, our people are nonetheless vigilant. The people of St. Gallen, who are nearby, are also vigilant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Letters were brought to our magistrate indicating the same thing you wrote: that the Bohemians, finally defeated by wicked supplications, are preparing to invade Saxony, and that Duke Moritz is going to oppose their invasion. But because the one who reported this doubted the truth of the matter, I did not want to write to you about uncertainties.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Schertlius was still in Augsburg on October 23, which Guntius can report to you, who brought the latest letters from Augsburg from Welser, Laetus, and Haller. It would be too long to recite what they wrote. You have Guntius as a living letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The people of Ulm are truly steadfast. May the Lord strengthen them!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>You rightly judge the emperor to be the devil, provided you add incarnate. Laetus writes that by the grace of God, they are prevented from devastating Germany according to his plan, except for the 10 or 15 miles around Bavaria. For they have been so strictly confined in iron that they could not come into Württemberg. However, they could not prevent him from devastating around the Danube, for they could not defend both places. They hope to drive him back down the Danube. May God grant it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I wrote about the assemblies of our people and some other matters through Wilhelm Gallus, whom I believe delivered the letters to you on the 30th of this month. Therefore, there is nothing more to add. I certainly owe the greatest thanks to God and our council, who conceal nothing from me of these matters! For I also share all my things with them (the council). Moreover, excellent men write to me from the camp, from Augsburg, Ulm, Constance, and other cities! We also get along excellently among ourselves. May the Lord wish it to be perpetual for the benefit of His church! Meanwhile, there are those who envy us this harmony and shout that too much is believed to the priests! This has happened before and turned out very badly for us; it will also turn out badly now. But we know, my Myconius, what the Lord has foretold! Let us be constant and patient in this!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In your last letters, since there is nothing to which I should respond, I will only say this: I have read and reread them most gladly. For they are written prudently and usefully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Further news: on Saturday, councils and citizens gathered. There, all the matters that had occurred the previous days and otherwise were taken into consideration. And the council and citizens united unanimously on a new agreement to commit themselves to the Gospel and all the cities adhering to the Gospel in the Confederation, and to their neighbors, with life and property; to maintain alliances and peace with the other Confederates who also hold to them; and to hold the communities through the guilds in the city and in all their counties, lordships, cities, lands, and people; to inform them of the state of affairs, what the Pope and the Emperor are planning to eradicate the Gospel in Germany, etc. Therefore, a very beautiful presentation has been prepared in writing. It will be read aloud.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Yesterday, all the guilds gathered. There was a unanimous response, truly to commit life and property: our lords should now be manly, etc. You would have seen wonderful enthusiasm! Thanks be to God! Following this, there is excellent preparation, earnest prayer, and courage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Next Sunday, the matter will be taken up in the countryside. Indeed, they are glad to take the matter courageously in hand, etc. What further happens will not be kept from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>All this you should share with Dr. Dryander, Gast, and the other dear ones; whom you will greet in my name. You and your entire household, with Zwingli and Simler, our sons, will fare well. Zurich, November 1, in the morning at 7 o'clock, in the year 1546. I have not reread it. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, the most faithful and vigilant overseer of the church in Basel, [if] in the Lord [venerable] and [most dear brother].</p>
