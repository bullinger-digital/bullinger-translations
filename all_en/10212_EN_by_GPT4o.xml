    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports a rumor that in the event of war, the Five Places would only pretend to attack Zurich in order to more easily overrun the territories of the allies coming to help. Hostile propaganda. Among the most influential people in Zurich, there are opponents of the Gospel, which deters the allies. As an example, Myconius mentions Clodius Klotz Escher. Bullinger should consider the matter carefully.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Behold what treacheries can do. The people of Bern are warned to be on their guard. For the strategy of war is this: When matters come to war, the first attack will be against the people of Zurich without causing harm, yet in such a way that when the people of Zurich lift their aid, an enemy army will invade their territory from elsewhere, which they then cannot resist adequately in time. Good men complain about this as if it were done with the knowledge of your people. It raises suspicion that they do not discuss current matters with them even when provoked. Indeed, no one will persuade us of such wickedness from your people, but it is easy to believe that it comes from among your own, who contrive such things to make the shadow of discord a true discord, so that we, being divided, may be dragged under the yoke without effort. Therefore, we wrote recently that you should be equally wary of domestic enemies as of foreign ones. Meanwhile, while you neglect this, know that many cities more than dread your friendship, which otherwise would seek nothing more than to expose themselves and their possessions for you, while you defend the justice of the Gospel. Who would willingly join those whom they know to have the worst among the highest? It has not yet been forgotten what was prepared by those people last year. The wound is still raw and indeed hurts more intensely than to disregard their attempt, but what do I say attempt, their wicked and cruel deed. They specifically dread certain individuals, but especially that Clodius. You know him. If he and his associates were somewhat less influential, the situation in Zurich would be better. What I say, I wish you to consider in such a way that you bring it into action, as far as it can be done. This will be among the first things to consult for the welfare of your republic. I write seriously. Therefore, do not neglect it.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with your entire republic, etc.</p>
      <p>27th of January, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Reply.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his special favorable friend. Zurich.</p>
