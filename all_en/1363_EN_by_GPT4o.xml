      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Old age makes me slow, most esteemed brother in Christ Bullinger, which is why I am slow in writing. However, there is no reason for you to fear any danger from this, as if I loved you less or that the holy memory of you has faded from me; let this be far from me, who have so often experienced your kindness through writing and other benefits. There is also another excuse: a few days ago I returned from the baths, not indeed more lively, but older, and upon returning, I could not write due to bodily inflammations and swelling of the feet, which troubles me more than ever. What I have neglected, I will make up for, unless this earthly dwelling, threatening its end, collapses. These two young men, Jakob Hohenbuch and Johannes Keller, the prince's stipendiaries recalled by the people of Lausanne (as you probably know) due to the pestilential plague that is raging there, are being sent to you. I commend them to you, the theological patron (and the firmest foundation of the Church of Christ, as the spirit of Christ has testified through you by teaching and writing throughout all the churches of Germany, not to mention other nations) in a wonderful manner, so that they may be instructed in holy discipline and true piety and sacred learning, which is undoubtedly entrusted more carefully by the prince. And lest you be unaware of what they are like, I will describe them in these few words. They have different dispositions: Keller is a lover, Hohenbuch, with a lofty spirit, despises sacred things and aspires to legal knowledge. Each has shown a very clear example of this malevolence, about which it would be tedious to write further. This has been somewhat smoothed over by the prince and those who hold power here, etc.</p>
      <p>The state of the church, by the mercy of the favorable deity (to whom be grace forever), remains unchanged. The people of Strasbourg, to whom I recently traveled in a hired carriage, are very anxious, guarding the city with daily and nightly watches.</p>
      <p>But now it has ceased, as I hear. The people of Magdeburg, now besieged more severely than ever, refuse to surrender. The liberator of all will come in his own time and transfer all the elect to his eternal kingdom. Amen. Greet on my behalf all the brothers, Pellican, Gwalther, Bibliander, and the others. Our people greet you, especially Ulrich, your brother the scribe, who was with me in Strasbourg. The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, on the first of August, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief theologian of the Church of ZÃ¼rich and esteemed brother.</p>
