      <p>S. D. Rightly do I honor and love you greatly, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, as I learn and experience daily through various means how much you value and love me. From Vienna in Austria, you wrote two or three letters before your journey was fully completed, sending letters from the journey itself, indicating that you had happily reached your homeland; you soon added how kindly you were received and generously honored by the emperor with a gift; you also added copiously and clearly whatever you thought should be narrated to me about Austrian affairs.</p>
      <p>And here I could seem ungrateful, who have not even written a single letter in reply, and indeed I would be considered not only ungrateful but also most unjust, if I were not hindered by what now excuses me to you. I could not safely send any letters to Vienna, and when I heard that you had returned home safe and sound, I was expecting you with our son daily and therefore postponed everything to your own arrival; some illness also intervened, which for several weeks has disrupted all plans and business.</p>
      <p>Now, however, since from those last letters sent from Davos I seem to understand that you might not come to us this winter, I thought it timely to respond to your many letters with this one, so that you would not think yourself entirely neglected by me, whom I rightly hold in the highest regard and cherish among my foremost and closest friends. Therefore, I begin by thanking your kindness, who so diligently, copiously, and elegantly write about all your affairs and always include in them what not only delights me but also helps and instructs me.</p>
      <p>First of all, I congratulate your piety on having obtained that most noble prefecture of Clavenna and pray to the Lord to grant you His principal spirit, with which the renowned King David asked to be endowed, so that you may be equal to such a great office. Many and great things are expected here from your piety by all the pious, and therefore they give the greatest thanks to the Lord, who has appointed you over His people, earnestly beseeching Him to lead, instruct, and confirm you and preserve you in His most holy will for the glory of His name, your own salvation, and the growth and safety of His church, which He redeemed with His precious blood. And you clearly see the Lord Himself favoring your beginnings; for how much opportunity has been provided to support true religion and abolish superstition through that decree of the Three Leagues now published in Davos? In the same assembly, you were elected by the votes of the best men as the president of those places in whose name that decree was promulgated.</p>
      <p>It truly seems to me that the Lord has confirmed you in this matter and as if said: "You see, Friedrich, what I want. You are now designated as prefect, while at the same time stipends are decreed for the ministers of my word. I want, therefore, that under your administration my word may run without hindrance.</p>
      <p>I want the monks, the safest support of Antichristianism, to be abolished." And certainly, you must be most vigilant against these. You will experience their marvelous arts both against true religion and against the very Leagues. This kind of people does not know how to rest.</p>
      <p>Among us, there were monks in the monastery called RÃ¼ti, which was also reformed according to the norm of the Lord's word by the most honorable senate of this city. However, all the monks have died; one remained from all of them; he has pretended for many years to favor our religion, but now after thirty years, he secretly withdraws from the monastery, flees to the Swiss, implores their help, and says he wishes to restore in that monastery the order abolished by the Zurichers. They provide help and counsel to this fugitive and traitor against our republic, to whom other Cantons also seem to join. Therefore, learn from another's example what you should believe about monks; they are the seed of superstitions and disturbances; for they are the offspring of Satan, who was a liar and murderer from the beginning. Our people will not allow the restoration of the order by any means, but others seem not to lack support for the petitioner, what will happen, divine. Certainly, not light contentions are now stirred, and a diet will be held in Baden on December 4; for the abbot of St. Gall is also becoming insolent and oppresses his people severely.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they complain and bravely fight for their freedom. In short: the monks have never accomplished anything good and cause all kinds of evil; they are full of greater oppression and wickedness. Therefore, be vigilant; in all things, pray to the Lord to direct you and govern you with His Holy Spirit, etc. As for our sons, I suspect from what you wrote in your last letters to me that you might keep your son with you this winter for comfort. However, with your permission, I would think you would act more wisely if you were less indulgent with him, but rather promote him more towards the study of letters, and that he be exercised in some school and live with those who will exercise him; for there is no loss more precious than that of time. He is growing up every moment, let alone in days and months.</p>
      <p>How beautiful it would be if he also grew up in letters and improved manners at the same time? But I leave these things to be judged by your prudence. Your father, a most distinguished man and always to be honored by me with the highest respect, wrote to me while you were still in Vienna, asking me to forgive the youthful error and to kindly receive both again, etc. Although I had decided otherwise, the prayers of the venerable and honorable old man prevailed; I replied that I would deny him nothing, provided the boys are obedient henceforth and studious of letters and piety and do not reject discipline.</p>
      <p>I sent letters to the most honorable royal orator in Chur, asking him to diligently take care of them. Meanwhile, whatever you both decide regarding the sons, it will indeed be free and rightly so by me; indeed, I pray to the Lord that all things may be prosperous for them and lead to salvation. You will greet them in my name and that of my whole house, and also the most honorable man, your father, especially my most esteemed lord Travers, your most faithful and kind father-in-law, and your families always dear to me.</p>
      <p>I have with me two copies of sermons published by me this summer on the feasts of Christ our Lord and Savior, etc., which I have reserved for you, my most friendly lords and brothers. I cannot entrust them to just anyone; I fear they may be lost on the journey; therefore, I will reserve them until you come here yourself, or until I find a trustworthy messenger who will willingly take them. I sent copies to all my friends; you should not have been overlooked, as you are among the foremost. I am beginning to recover somewhat and quite well; the Lord will add the rest.</p>
      <p>The news is that the English among us report that both the queen and Cardinal Pole are gravely ill; the English are very angry with their Philip, who seems to be less eager to press for the restitution of Calais, which they do not want to lose at all. They sent a very large delegation to Philip, through which they protest with him, declaring that they will accept no peace without the recovery of Calais. The French king says: "I have not offended England in any way, I have honored the queen; she petulantly declared war on me: therefore, by the grace of God, in this war brought upon me and repelled by me, I have recovered what was my ancestors'. The English took it from my people and possessed it for many years, my ancestors long before had much more. Since I have recovered my property, I do not think I am required by any law to restore it, nor will I allow any talk of restoring Calais, which I do not hold as unjustly and by force occupied, but as recovered by the highest right, etc. What will happen then (if these things are true), you easily see: no peace, but perpetual war. May the Lord have mercy on His people.</p>
      <p>I owe you because you lent to my sons Heinrich and Christoph, for which kindness I give you the greatest thanks and for all the benefits bestowed upon my sons. An opportunity to deserve well will be given sometime.</p>
      <p>I have advised my wife to take account of the clothes and things of your son and brother left with us; when you order those things to be sent to you, I will send them along with the account and what I owe you. But I ask you to ensure that these letters are delivered to my son Christoph, whom I would have preferred to remain in Germany; but since he undertook this journey at your suggestion, I bear it more equitably. Otherwise, I had seriously forbidden him to enter Italy, etc.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 11, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Petrus Martyr, my sons-in-law, Gwalther, and others greet you.</p>
      <p>An elegant work by Martyr on the Eucharist against the Bishop of Winchester is now being printed.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Friedrich von Salis in Samaden, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
