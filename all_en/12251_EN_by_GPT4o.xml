    <p xml:id="regest1">The council of Augsburg has learned from Georg Frölich how Bullinger recommended the pious and learned Matthias Erb (currently in the service of Count Georg of Württemberg) to [the people of Augsburg] in their search for a theologian. However, since the council fears that this appointment might upset the Count, Bullinger should persuade Erb to first submit his resignation to the Count, and then move to Zurich or near Augsburg. Only then would the council summon Erb to Augsburg and ensure that he gets along well with them, which is expected. If this is not the case, Erb would be treated to his satisfaction; this consideration alone is due to the service rendered by Bullinger.</p>

      <p>To the Christian and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, former (Antistes) of the church in Zurich, our dear lord and friend, we, the council of the city of Augsburg, offer our friendly and willing service with diligence beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and friend, our well-learned and dear city clerk Georg Frölich has orally informed us how you, at his written request, have given a recommendation for a theologian named Mr. Matthias Erb, who is pious and learned and currently in the service of our gracious lord Count Georg of Württemberg, and who might be willing to join our church service. It is indeed true that we would gladly provide for a peace-loving theologian with sound doctrine; we also have more than enough of your testimony, which you have given to the aforementioned Mr. Erb. However, since he might not be able to come to our city without displeasing our gracious lord of Württemberg, it is our friendly request that you would kindly use your efforts to promote the matter so that the aforementioned Mr. Erb may amicably take his leave from the mentioned place, and settle in Zurich or perhaps somewhere near Augsburg. Then we would summon him, listen to him on trial, and deal with him with good confidence, and we would agree with him regarding church service based on your and our city clerk's recommendation. But if it is not to be by God's will, we will still treat him in such a way that he will hopefully be satisfied, and this is to be done for you, our dear friend in the Lord, as a friendly recompense (to repay).</p>
      <p>Dated Thursday, 30th July in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>To the Christian and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, former of the church in Zurich, our dear lord and friend.</p>
