    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not want to further trouble Bullinger with the case of the priest [Michel von Üsigen]. The intention [of the Reformers in Frauenfeld] to appoint a schoolmaster at their own expense is met with strong opposition from the Catholics, who threaten to dissolve the political community, even though Mayor [Hans Heinrich] Federli had been commissioned by the entire council to find a schoolmaster. Asks for advice and support.</p>

      <p>Dear sir, since you are otherwise burdened with so many affairs of all churches and undoubtedly are well and thoroughly informed about the matter of our priest, who is still in chains, I found it unnecessary to further disclose this to your honor and trouble you with it.</p>
      <p>However, since our opposition is dealing with us very unfriendly regarding the schoolmaster, and if we want to have the schoolmaster, even at our own expense, they threaten to deny us justice and law, the common church service, and all common elections of the authorities, the mayor, and other common civic offices, which have so far been occupied by the entire community, are to be denied and revoked. Since they are dealing so defiantly with us in such a small, beneficial, and also necessary matter for their children, without any compensation for them and the church, we fear there is something greater behind it; for such an answer was given to our community by them through the governor verbally, which greatly alienates us, since it was decided by an entire council that one should look for a schoolmaster and Mayor Federli was especially instructed, if he knew one, to inform them, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear Master Heinrich, our urgent request to you is that you kindly look after us and remind our lords not to allow such injustice and defiance, and to assist and advise us according to the peace of the land. I wanted to inform you of this in the best way. May God be with you.</p>
      <p>Petrus Rümeli, preacher in Frauenfeld.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the word, to his dear lord's hands.</p>
