      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I wanted to briefly inform you that I have arrived safely and unharmed in Baden.</p>
      <p>My host, a relative, has promised me all his assistance and has so far treated me with great kindness. However, I have written to my Margaret about all matters in brief, for I do not wish to trouble you with these trifles. I commend my family to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell from Baden on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Your son, Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
