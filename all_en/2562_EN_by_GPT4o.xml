      <p>Greetings. As I understand from your letters, my most recent ones have indeed reached you, but the ones I sent to you a little earlier, not so, and those were attached in a bundle, if I am not mistaken, addressed to you. But regarding Theobald Engli, I acknowledge the fault of negligence; for when I had thrown them into the cabinet, which I have prepared for that use, it happened that, when I hastily took out others from there to be sent to you, I nevertheless overlooked those lying in the corner, thinking they were tied with the rest, which now, having been reminded by you, I will search more diligently to clear myself or rather to beg pardon for the fault of negligence from the most excellent and pious man.</p>
      <p>About the Diet of Augsburg being postponed until the first of May, I suppose you have heard; the cause of the delay was undoubtedly that so few princes were present themselves. From Italy, I receive that the Pope, as much as it is in him, is consulting greatly for his leisure and taking care not to incline too much towards one of the contending factions of monks. He has sent the Jubilee to Bologna, to incite the payment of offerings for the perverse and rather overthrown than converted kingdom of England; it is despised by many because he uses too much liberality in this matter. The Sienese still stand firmly against the Florentine, yet they will be in danger unless French reinforcements come to their aid. The progress of the French army towards Vercelli was expected to pass through the territories of Milan towards Siena; but it is reported to have stopped near Arona, perhaps to harass Milan by cutting off supplies.</p>
      <p>The Turkish fleet has remained in the opposite sea to the Kingdom of Naples and has not been brought back to Constantinople, which has happened in all previous centuries; hence, the parts of Italy that are subject to the Emperor fear not a little for themselves. They say he will send an even greater number of ships from Constantinople, so that with a twin fleet he may infest all parts of the sea. He has made a truce for 5 years with the Persian and has received the king's son as a hostage. It is thought he will turn all his power against the bowels of the Christians. They also write that he is already stirring up new matters in Hungary under the pretext of restoring the kingdom to the son of the deceased King Voivode, who is said to have fled there from Poland. And this is about these matters. We have received Calvin's writing, to whom we will write on the occasion offered. Farewell in the Lord with all yours. Basel, 22nd of February, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>I commend to you the young man who carries this, because he seems to be noble and of not bad promise.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
