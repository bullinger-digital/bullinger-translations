      <p>S. I received your letters along with the enclosed writing, most illustrious man, but at the moment, I have nothing significant to respond to them.</p>
      <p>Similar things were almost written to our Diet by brother Herdli, the leader of the Rhaetian soldiers, from the camp. Indeed, these days, a letter was written to Consul Ambrosius in Ulm with the following message: Regarding the news, you have heard before how there is great lament in France. We also received a letter from Antwerp on the 8th of this month, January, by post, stating that the Prince of Orange with his army is in France, not far from Paris, and has taken a small town named Vitry, where he declared himself an enemy against the king and intends to assist the Prince of Cond√©. It is also said that the Queen of England has an understanding with these two princes, as she has seized several ships from Spain via Antwerp, containing over 60,000 ducats; therefore, the Duke of Alba in Antwerp has allowed the English to be detained with body and goods; there is concern that a great war will ensue. In Ulm, a certain mint master also brought those German and heroic songs, which are inscribed on the banners of the princes, whose spirits and forces are said to be united against the Antichrist. There is also much talk among us that these princes, bound by a very close bond, will bring the city of Metz back under the empire, and then, after calming and subduing France, they will turn their attention to Belgium, Italy, and even Rome itself, that abominable seat. It is indeed time that the papal indulgences be once and for all placed under horses and donkeys, which have so far only been imposed on donkeys. However, lest there always be a snake hidden in the grass, unless victory brings peace, it will not be achieved by agreement. For what faith can be placed in the cardinals, as miserable France has experienced for the third time, or when will it happen that Guise with all his Italians will be deprived of the court while the supporter of the Italians is alive? Nevertheless, the Lord must be entreated, that we may enjoy certain peace for the glory of His name and the glorious freedom of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Quickly, Chur, February 1, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary and most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his eternally esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
