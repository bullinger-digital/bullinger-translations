      <p>S. D. Not without great pain of my soul did I read your letter, my most esteemed lord and brother. You write that you are burdened not by one, but by several and indeed serious illnesses, among which deafness is predominant. But what greatly alleviates the pain is that nothing happens to the servants of the Lord outside or against the will of the Lord. I have no doubt that this itself greatly consoles you. You have contracted these illnesses through excessive cares and studies; therefore, you are ill not without praise. Others have brought upon themselves serious illnesses through drinking or debauchery and lie down in disgrace. Certainly, it is glorious to suffer something for the sake of the pursuit of truth and the care of the church, and this is our lot, we who serve Christ and the church; for either tyrants slaughter us or serious illnesses torment us. Our Lord predicted this to us; He also promises strength to endure, faith, and patience. If you invoke Him diligently, as is your piety, you will feel the most present help and consolation; meanwhile, endure in temptations and evils. For surely He will not neglect you, who has so diligently and faithfully cared for you and your affairs until now. With these few words, I wanted to address you, so that I would not write nothing at all through this reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>I continue to complete the remaining sermons; pray that the Lord may help the one who labors. Greet in my name Mr. Gastius, whose silence I do not know what it means.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Zurich, April 8, 1550. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>

      <p>Caesar is well, he goes for a walk two or three times a week.</p>
      <p>He has convened a diet either in Regensburg, Nuremberg, or Augsburg; Augsburg is preferred.</p>
      <p>He sent someone back to Antwerp to prepare letters announcing the diet to be printed for the first of July.</p>
      <p>He wrote to Rome for a new council to be held in Germany, appointed Metz, etc. The Pope responded that he would comply in all things and has become entirely Caesarian, having defected from the French.</p>
      <p>A certain African king, made an exile, came to Caesar for help, etc.</p>
      <p>Written to the senate in April 1550.</p>
