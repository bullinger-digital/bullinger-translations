      <p> Greetings. I recently received your letter, honorable lord and godfather, along with a copy of your work "On the Justifying Grace of God," for which I am immensely grateful, not only in my private name but also in the public name of the church, which owes you much gratitude for your pious labors. Through these, you do not cease to provide pure truth against all heresies, not only for the present but also for future generations. May the Lord keep you whole and unharmed with us for as long as possible, so that many may benefit from your piety. As for Clauser and the outdated constitution on punishing soldiers, I am exceedingly distressed. This year has confronted me with two very serious conflicts, one of which has ended quite well; I wish the other would also have such a fortunate outcome. For I see what the wicked are plotting, and unless the Lord breaks their assault, all piety and justice will be at an end. We will disgracefully fall back into all old filth and return to our own vomit. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us a strong and prudent spirit to confront such evils and avoid the dangers that follow. In these days, before a new magistrate is elected, we will collectively approach the Senate and, as much as is in our power, urge them not to act in a way that, forgetting God and themselves, would bring disgrace upon them before God and men. May the Lord grant success. I have no certain news of new events. It is rumored that a massacre has occurred in England, in which the Imperial forces have largely succumbed and perished. How true this is, I do not know; you will undoubtedly have certain information. It is also said about the castle Twiel that it was almost taken from Duke Württemberg by the deceit of some knights; however, it is uncertain who these were. We wish to know this for certain from you. I have nothing else to write. I am unsure whether I can send copies of the Servetus history or rather the apology against him through this messenger; if I cannot, Witenbach's nephew, who will come next week, will bring them with him. Farewell with all your family, whom you will diligently greet in my name and in the name of mine, along with all the brothers and fellow ministers, my most esteemed lords. Bern, February 23, 1554. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
