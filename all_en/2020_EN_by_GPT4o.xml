      <p>Honorable, learned, and esteemed lords, we commend ourselves to your good grace.</p>
      <p>Honorable lords, being sure and certain that you always persist in this good and healthy will to advance and maintain the word of God, we thought that we would do you a great disservice if we concealed what we have found these days, which is that there is a man among us named Michael Servetus who has judged himself to compose, write, and have printed books on the Holy Scripture containing great and infinite passages that we claim are acceptable according to God and the holy evangelical doctrine. He has been heard by our ministers, and articles have been formed against him, to which he has responded, and to his responses, there has been a reply, and he has replied again, how everything is written down, which for the honor of God we ask you to please see, then return to our present messenger with your good advice. We also ask you to see one of his books that we have given to the present bearer, to communicate with you so that you may know that with good reason we would like to suppress his malicious propositions and entirely write back to us your said good advice, which we greatly desire without, however, distrusting our ministers in any way. You will always oblige us further to pray to God that it may please Him to increase you in His holy graces. From Geneva, this 21st of September 1553. The syndics and council of Geneva, your very good and great friends.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, learned, and esteemed lords, the lords Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and other ministers of the word of God in the church of ZÃ¼rich, our very good and singular friends.</p>
