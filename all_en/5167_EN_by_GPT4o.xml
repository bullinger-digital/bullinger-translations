      <p>Many greetings.</p>
      <p>There is hardly anything left now, most illustrious man and most revered lord in Christ, that I can write to you: for I have diligently written everything that was necessary and that occurred to me while writing to Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>However, whatever it is, out of respect and love for you, I cannot let you go without a greeting, at least so that you understand that I am alive and that I am mindful of your great and numerous merits towards me. I have not seen Parkhurst, Sandys, Lever, Elmer, or Sampson for two whole years, nor have they seen me. However, I have no doubt that they all have the same goodwill towards you, yours, and indeed all of yours, as they ought to have. Nothing new is brought to us from Scotland, except that religion is being received there with favorable minds, is being defended steadfastly, and is being propagated more widely every day. However, they say that the Queen of Scotland still retains her mass.</p>
      <p>God, I hope, will open her eyes someday: for she is otherwise, as it is said, not a bad woman. Would that she would completely rid herself of all the Lotharingian spirits and minds!</p>
      <p>With us, everything is peaceful.</p>
      <p>A few bishops, who went mad during those Marian times, cannot yet return to sanity with sufficient modesty in such a short time. Therefore, they are kept in the tower, so that they do not infect others with their contagion.</p>
      <p>The Pope is scheming both secretly and openly as much as he can. Fourteen months ago, he sent a messenger to Queen Elizabeth: since he cannot yet be received in England, he is still lingering in Flanders. They still hope that something can be accomplished; that not all the roots of their follies have been uprooted; that there are still some whom they do not doubt to be of their party.</p>
      <p>But why do I mention these things? For I have written all of them more extensively to Mr. Peter, as I said.</p>
      <p>I have never seen Mr. Johann Schneider, that young man of yours from Zurich, since our Julius left England. Nor is it surprising; for we are far apart from each other.</p>
      <p>However, I heard a few months ago that he is doing quite well: if there is anything needed, and I can know his circumstances, I will diligently ensure that he lacks nothing from me. I owe this to both your kindness and the city of Zurich, and I profess that I owe it. I am somewhat surprised that our Burcher has not come to us before this time: for he wrote that he would come; and from his letters, he seemed to be on the way. I greatly desire him, and I thank your lordship on his behalf.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you all, and you, my father, especially, and your church and republic in safety: and if there is anyone who wishes you ill, may He grant them a short life and little power. I would write more if more things worthy of being written from such a distance occurred to me.</p>
      <p>Greet that excellent woman, your wife, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Josias Simler, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Haller, Mr. Gesner, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Wick, Mr. Frisius, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, your son, an excellent young man. Although none of us is with me, yet I do not doubt to greet you in the name of all of them; for I know that they think of your lordship as they ought, with the greatest honor. Farewell, my father, and most revered lord: and if I am or can be anything, consider it all to be yours. Salisbury, February 9, 1562. From England.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your lordship, John Jewel, Englishman.</p>
