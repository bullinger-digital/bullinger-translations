      <p>S. D. I have heard from all the regular servants and from Mr. Morlet himself, my predecessor, how dear you were to him and he to you in return, and I wish to renew this friendship between us, or rather to continue it; for nothing could be more pleasing to me than to be able to communicate more often in letters with a learned and excellent man. Mr. Vergerius has written to me twice, and I have ensured that he has from the king what he needs to live honorably. I am writing to him through you, as he requested; please ensure that my letters are delivered to him. The Emperor has published many things against the king in Germany that are not appropriate, and the king has responded to the princes... and reported other things, as you will see; for I am sending you and Mr. Vergerius copies of the letters.</p>
      <p>You feared that your letters would be found among Morlet's heirs; a few were found, and I have them, which are two in total, in which there is nothing that is not worthy of you. However, if you wish, I will burn them or send them back, asking you to inform us if you have anything for the benefit of the republic at any time. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given hastily from Solothurn on the 19th of March. Yours sincerely, De l'Aubespine.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man Mr. Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>From Bassefontaine, the French envoy to the Swiss.</p>
