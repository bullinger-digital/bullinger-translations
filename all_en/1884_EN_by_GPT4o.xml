      <p>[...] imposes. Shameful, obscene, and foul pamphlets, teeming with all impurity and filthy ignorance, were to be condemned, and I greatly wonder how it happened that, while that censor saw and found authors and books in Germany, France, and England, he did not detect a pamphlet well written in a Sodomitic and Amorhic manner, printed by a certain Curtius Novus in the year of our Lord 38, in his very own Italy, almost under his eyes and practically in his own hands. The title of this Canaanite and Sodomitic poem is: Capitolo di messer Giovanni della Casa sopra il forno, and I do not think there exists a more disgraceful and impure poem in the world to the Christian name. Let the Priapeia of the most impure pagans, condemned, hissed, and exploded more than a thousand times, be silent; that ingenious man in the Amorhic art, Giovanni della Casa, has restored the matter to us by writing. Hence, it is indeed deservedly spared by our censor, whoever he may be, who did not want to mention him among the impure.</p>
      <p>Indeed, not only I wonder at this, but every good person with me admires even more the most illustrious prince of the Florentines, Cosimo, celebrated in the letters of many as a patron of good literature, studies, and scholars, for not suppressing such inept, barbarous, and disgraceful authors, preventing them from coming forth in public. For at the end of the pamphlet, it explicitly states "in Florence." But the good prince undoubtedly is unaware of the audacity and nefarious attempts of these men; for there is no doubt he would not allow it, if he knew, that so many good, learned, honest, and pious men of Germany, France, England, and also Italy would be condemned by that Florentine printed paper, not for a trivial matter, but for the most disgraceful matter of all, namely the crime of heresy, which St. Jerome never thought should be left unspoken by a good man, not to mention that the insult to the ministers of the church is entirely connected with the infamy of the most pious and powerful princes and the most extensive republics. Hence, it would seem useful to me if good men in Italy were privately warned not to promise anything to those rabid babblers nor always connive at those things which could sometimes greatly inconvenience many. For He who judges justly, God, lives. Live and farewell, my most esteemed Vergerio, pray to the Lord for us, that He may bless our holy ministry. ZÃ¼rich, in the month of June, in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
