      <p>Greetings. Our Bernardinus Ochino tells the same things about the character of the recently appointed Roman pontiff as you write, as he has known him very well from his early years; he says he is a theologian and has imitated his father in this pursuit, who once claimed to have foreseen from the stars that this offspring would attain the pinnacle of the priesthood and for this reason took care not to marry. Therefore, the Frenchman will embrace him as his own and for this reason will rage even more fiercely against the blood of the saints, and yet the Caesar, no less merciful, continually presents horrible spectacles in Lower Germany. There is no doubt that the first monarchs will now declare their final efforts to eradicate all profession of piety, yet they will receive confusion from the Lord, who watches over the church of His own accord and laughs at the wicked. We receive nothing from the Diet of Augsburg, and there is deep silence with us about all matters.</p>
      <p>We have obtained a place for the English exiles from our senate, having been petitioned by a certain Scot, a minister once famous among them; however, there are those who say he did this at the instigation of a few and that there are some very odious controversies among them, and that he himself, who was here, is condemned by most. He has gone from here to Geneva, as they say, without greeting any of my brothers, as I was absent in Breisgau, and meanwhile no Englishman has appeared, so I am in fear that our senate may consider itself deceived and that we may then be less inclined and favorable towards other exiles as well. Regarding the Locarnese, our people seem to be waiting for something to be reported to them from elsewhere, either through the envoys of Bern or your republic, or through a petition from the exiles themselves, which I indeed wish to be done in a timely manner, while the minds are still warm with recent compassion, and with our knowledge as well, who will not refuse any effort in the most pious cause. But farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours, whom I respectfully greet in my words.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the calends of May, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
