      <p>Excellent Bullinger, I wish you grace and health from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The things that are brought to me from you are most pleasing and delightful to me, not so much because of the gift itself, but because they are sent to me by you. Therefore, I have long been grateful to you for the book you sent me as a gift, and I now thank you for the letters; I also repeatedly pray to the Lord that he may grant me the fortune to be able to return the favor to you. As for me, I am currently staying in Chiavenna due to some of my business, and once these are completed, I will come to you with God's favor. In the meantime, you will pray to the Lord for me, that the Lord may grant abundantly what you wish for me. I have nothing else to write; I only wish to ask you to greet those good men with my words. May the Lord keep you safe for His church through Christ. Hieronymus Zanchi sends you greetings. Chiavenna, on the 4th day of January, in the year 52.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Celso Martinengo.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
