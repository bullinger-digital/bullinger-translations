    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's advice on the difficult circumstances [in Schaffhausen]; Bovillus [Ludwig Oechsli] reported to the council only reluctantly [about the conversation with the Anabaptists], after which an earlier mandate was renewed; the Anabaptist leader Georg Sattler responded to the prohibition of hosting Anabaptists by purchasing a house in Hallau; the Anabaptists have their confidants in the council, and the council's decision was only made due to an ultimatum from the pastors; while the papists keep a low profile and the Anabaptists cause unrest, their opponents lack unity; the letter bearer [Hans Adam Schad?] is to report more details to Bullinger. Vogt returns [Theodor Bibliander's] lectures on Jeremiah with thanks. The "old gentleman" [Michael Eggenstorfer] and Bovillus know nothing about the origins [of the Schaffhausen Monastery of All Saints], but the monastery is older than the city; Vogt quotes [chronicle notes] from an old book in the library: in 1052, Count Eberhard of Nellenburg began the construction [of the monastery], whose altar Pope Leo IX consecrated on August 23; on November 29, 1350, the monastery was devastated by a fire; on May 5/6, 1372, a fire in Schaffhausen claimed approximately 70 victims. In another codex, there is news that there were eight beer and four wine taverns in the city; the Emperors Henry III and IV or Henry IV and V endowed Count Eberhard and the monastery with privileges; the place was so unknown that the addition "located near the village of Hemmental" was used. Vogt cannot provide more details but would like to ensure a precise copy of the monastery's letters on occasion. Greetings. Hopes to receive Bullinger's interpretation of the remaining Gospels soon.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I thank you, most candid and learned man, not so much because you have taught us, through such brotherly correction, to perhaps become more circumspect in the future, but because you also provide advice on what we should do in such a fatal dissension of our town, and you hope that our magistrate will promulgate a more equitable decree, especially if they are reminded of what the Anabaptist plague has caused in terms of tumult and evil in both neighboring and distant cities. However, so that we may also have a place for purification, it seems you have not yet fully explored with whom we are dealing, namely with stubborn, obstinate, and foolish people. For we have long applied all these remedies to them in other cities, but nothing has been achieved. It was barely reported by Bovillus (which we barely extracted from him) to the council. Finally, a certain outdated decree is produced, namely that no one should receive an Anabaptist into their home, that they should not hold public meetings, and if there are any of that faction, they should not cause any disturbance. And so much could our magistrate's decree achieve that Jörg Sattler, the doctor of the Anabaptists, acquired his own house in the most famous village of our district, Hallau, so that he would not be forced to lodge with others. Whatever was reported to the council was blabbered by their Anabaptist supporters. See, my brother, with what kind of monsters we have to struggle, and what is more, if Bovillus had not mentioned our intention to leave, not even that outdated decree would have been renewed. The Papists conceal many things, lest they too be forced to pay the penalties of the deserted religion. The cohort of Anabaptists, whose leader you know, is causing unrest. Those who agree with us are not so unanimous that they can restrain the madness of the others by common χειροτονίᾳ (election). However, as you desire, that we inform you of every discussion, we prefer that the bearer of these, who was present, report to you, although Lingkius and I have proposed to come to you shortly and fully inform you of everything.</p>
      <p>I return Jeremiah and thank you greatly for lending it to me, intending to return it if the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>The old gentleman and Bovillus have no knowledge of the foundation's origins. The former refers to the foundation book, Bovillus says he knows nothing for certain. I compare our town to ivy, which, attached to the oak (the monastery), has risen high, suffocating the oak. The Schaffhausen monastery is older than the city, having given something to the city's mayor and half the council. Over time, many conflicts have arisen between them. The monks have always left as the inferior. It has been burned twice. I have transcribed the following from an old book in our library word for word:</p>
      <p>“In the year of our Lord 1052, Count Eberhard of Nellenburg began to construct the place of Schaffhausen, in which Saint Pope Leo IX consecrated the altar in honor of the Lord's resurrection on the 10th day before the Kalends of September and initiated and confirmed the place with his holy blessings.”</p>
      <p>“In the year of our Lord 1350, on the 3rd day before the Kalends of December, the Monastery of All Saints in Schaffhausen, along with eleven of the best capons and many ornaments, was devastated by fire.”</p>
      <p>“In the year of our Lord 1372, on the day of John before the Latin Gate on the eve of the Ascension, then almost three parts of the city of Schaffhausen were devastated by fire, and then in the fire, nearly 70 noble and ignoble men and women perished.”</p>
      <p>But I also read this in a certain codex: our town had 12 taverns, in 8 of which beer, and in 4 wine, were sold. Henry III and IV, if I am not mistaken, or IV and V, granted privileges to the monastery and Count Eberhard of Nellenburg. The place was so ignoble that it was pointed out by a certain village now turned into a villa, “the court of Schaffhausen located near the village of Hemmental.” I cannot write more certain or more things to you now. If it ever happens to read the letters of the monastery, I would take care to transcribe everything most diligently.</p>
      <p>Lingkius and Sebastian send their regards to you and Megander. The old gentleman (Bucer calls him ex-abbot) and Bovillus wanted me to write you the most dutiful greetings in their name. Farewell and embrace me with the humanity you have hitherto embraced, your most loving. Make sure we soon have what you have dictated to the remaining evangelists; for in this way, you will earn the favor of all ministers, indeed the entire church of Christ, whom may He keep you safe for a long time. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Schaffhausen, on the 12th day before the Kalends of April in the year 1543. Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Simprecht Vogt, preacher in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his venerable lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
