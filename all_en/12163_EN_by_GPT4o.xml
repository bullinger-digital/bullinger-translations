    <p xml:id="regest1">Karlstadt's ghost has tragic consequences for Gast! On Thursday, he was summoned to the council, where a letter was read to him that he had written eight years ago to a Genevan [Sigismund...]. It spoke of the then-concerning state of the Basel church, caused by Karlstadt's machinations and the return of the Papists to Basel. Consequently, Gast was relieved of his position as deacon. He does not know whether to turn to [the Zurichers] or the people of Strasbourg. He definitely does not want to stay in Basel. For 17 years, he served this church, and five times he attended to the plague-stricken. His wife [Apollonia, n√©e Glaser] is in childbed, and he has six children. He has requested a certificate of departure mentioning certain points. Bullinger should advise him and pray for him.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Behold the tragedy fashioned for me from the ghost of Karlstadt. On Thursday, I was summoned to the council; many councilors were present. I did not know the reason. A letter was read to me, which I had written eight years ago to a certain Genevan about the corrupt state of our church in these words: "Karlstadt always keeps us in play, so that we cannot accomplish anything; the vices are rampant, the Papists increase, they return." And because of these words, I was deprived of the office of deacon. What I should do now, I do not know; I do not know where to turn, whether to you or to the people of Strasbourg, with whom I do not agree in all things. I no longer wish to serve our people because of that insult inflicted upon me, even if they were to restore me to my former dignity. Tomorrow I will inform the brothers of my calamity, who are more timid than charming. I served our people for 17 years; the pestilential air infected our people five times in those years, and I was a help to all who were sick. Now at home, I have a wife in childbed and six children, and I am being expelled. Oh, ingratitude more than beastly! Therefore, advise me what I should do. I have requested from them a letter of my departure. They are prepared to give it. I ordered these articles to be added, if they wished.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and pray for me, that I may bear this cross with a calm mind. Basel, March 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
