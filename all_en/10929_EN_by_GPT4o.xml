    <p xml:id="regest1">Hans Jakob Stampfer, the son of Hans Ulrich, delivered the minting dies, which Konstanz had ordered from him at the request of guild master Hans Stoß for the minting of Joachimsthalers, with defects and did not improve them even after a complaint about the defects; mint master [Hans Jakob Zentgraf], who is now addressing his concerns to Stampfer in writing, is understandably urging, as he has promised the payment for the silver at the upcoming Frankfurt Fair. Zwick asks Bullinger to influence the two Stampfers so that Hans Jakob promptly adjusts the dies according to the wishes of Konstanz; he should also be reminded that an appropriate fee has already been paid. Bullinger will always be at service, but does not want to press the matter.</p>

      <p>My friendly, willing service is ready for you in advance.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and friend, a few weeks ago it happened that my lords allowed their mint master to mint Joachimsthalers. And as our die cutter was somewhat unwilling about the matter, we, who are appointed for this, inquired about another. In this, Master Ulrich Stampfer, the goldsmith's son, was pointed out to us through Hans Stoß, guild master here, and as we also gladly want to promote the same (and rather than to Augsburg), we have allowed the mint master to write to him about it. This has happened, and as I know no other, according to the opinion, as one can well gather from the letter, as far as he is willing to make the dies good and correct, also according to the sent samples, and in a specified time, etc., and for the first dies to take 4 florins for the preparation, he should start making them; but if he could not make them or did not want to take the money, he should let us know further. Thereupon he made them and his son Jacob brought the dies himself. However, they were too soft and cut to the measure that nothing could be minted with them. Therefore, they were returned to him to make others. And as the mint master wanted to satisfy him more for his wages, he did not want to take the 4 florins. Thereupon the mint master, at our, the appointed ones', request and to prevent disputes, amicably agreed with him and paid him 13 florins over his previous writing. We have also since then agreed to give something, so that he would not have complaints, and he was also released from the inn, and with this decision, he was dismissed, that he should immediately make other, correct dies; for it is not of little concern that a new coin is not struck. He was also clearly shown all defects and especially the width. Now when the dies were brought here, the faults were not changed. Therefore, the mint master sent the dies back to him, along with a letter in which his opinion and request will be understood. However, since the mint master is understandably complaining about this matter for honest reasons and especially because he has long since received silver for 900 or 1000 guilders and promised to pay at the upcoming Frankfurt Fair - the merchant also wants to have the money -, but he is being delayed by the die cutter; thereby he and the merchant may well come into great disputes and costs. Therefore, he has reasonably disclosed such concerns to us, the appointed ones. And we were indeed willing to report this to our lords, so that they themselves would have written to the council in Zurich. However, we wanted to spare Master Ulrich and his son, and, as I know no other, than that he means well to you, I have offered to write to you about it; I have also not informed anyone outside the council.</p>
      <p>And hereupon I earnestly request you to be diligent with the aforementioned Master Ulrich and his son, that he prepares the dies with the best diligence and speed, so that the coin may be made, and pay good attention to everything that is written to him, and spare nothing, also consider that he has received his honorable payment for it, and that perhaps great costs, also possibly disadvantage to himself, may arise from it. You may also let him hear this my writing and promote the matter for the best, for it is truly of great concern.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. I promise that my service will never be lacking to you and ask that you consider this my importunity favorably.</p>
      <p>Conrad Zwick, yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his incomparable lord and friend.</p>
