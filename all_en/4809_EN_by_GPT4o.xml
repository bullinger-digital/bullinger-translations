      <p>If it were not for a timely messenger, dearest Bullinger, I would not have written back at this time; for now I am less free than ever before. I am occupied all day with investigating and eradicating errors and vices.</p>
      <p>I have no certain news from Scotland; but what I hear, Julius will report. He himself will be the bearer of letters to all of you.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May 23, from the journey, in Thetford.</p>
      <p>You say you have written about the councils and sent me [two] books, which I have not yet seen: but I hope they will reach my hands. If your Christophorus comes to England, I will oblige him in whatever way I can.</p>
      <p>Julius was with me, for whose sake I wrote to Oxford. I hear that your standard-bearer's son is with the Bedfordian.</p>
      <p>When I come to London, I will summon him to me, and treat the Z端rcher in the Z端rcher manner. I wish all the best to all the people of Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Mine are all yours.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you in the month of March.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Z端rich.</p>
