      <p>Paul, an Italian by birth, a man of proven integrity to us, when he recently wrote to our Count Celsus, mentioned among other things that he had brought letters to me from the most illustrious Duchess of Ferrara, which he had left with you. However, since letters recently came from Mr. Gwalther, where there is no mention of this matter, and a little before, Johannes Liner, a merchant from St. Gallen, passing through here, said that you had written through a certain Hebrew: I suspected that you had been deceived by him. For he was not seen by us, nor do I doubt that he went where greater hope of profit shone. If by chance those letters have been lost, I wish the Duchess to be informed. Therefore, since this noble man, whom she has used as an intermediary with the King of France for many years, was about to make a journey there, I asked him to inquire from you what had become of that packet which Paul left with you, so that he may report back to his lady.</p>
      <p>There are more frequent reports of the death of the King of England than I would like. Therefore, we already mourn him as if dead: or rather, we mourn for the church, which has suffered an immeasurable loss in one head. Now we are anxiously suspended in expectation as to which direction the troubled affairs will incline. Meanwhile, it is more than lamentable that Germany is being consumed by mutual wounds and internal strife. But it is no wonder if the Lord applies such violent remedies to desperate diseases. And what remains, except that we earnestly pray that He does not allow His church to be overwhelmed, but rather preserves it amidst these shipwrecks? Farewell, most distinguished man and most esteemed brother in Christ. Greet your fellow ministers, your wife, sons-in-law, and daughters respectfully.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect you all with His defense and guide you with His spirit. My colleagues send you many greetings. Geneva, August 4, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, brother and most esteemed fellow minister.</p>
