    <p xml:id="regest1">The scout could not detect anything unusual in Uri. Neither the people of Constance nor St. Gallen are aware of any impending danger from Innsbruck or Italy, but they promised to report such matters in a timely manner. Vadian wrote that the legate Ennio Filonardi would return to Lucerne. Bullinger recommends the bearer as a very poor person who also received support in Zurich. Bern wrote that the Five Cantons were counting on Zurich's imminent re-Catholicization; Zurich vigorously denied this.</p>

      <p>The scout who returned from Uri reported nothing of the sort happening there, nor did he acknowledge that any assembly was ever held for that matter. Neither the people of Constance nor those of St. Gallen have reported any threats looming from Innsbruck or Italy. Furthermore, they promised to immediately reveal and warn us in due time if they sense any danger approaching us, the people of Bern, or our own people. Vadian wrote to me on the day before the first of April in these words: "They say Ennio will return to Lucerne, a fitting lid for the pot; for he is doing the Pope's business. How well he wishes us is clear."</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware of these things, and I will write more when the opportunity presents itself. The bearer of this letter is truly miserable. Our people give him half a gold coin every week. Please keep him in your care.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>April 6, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern have written to my lords, saying they understand that the Five Cantons are letting it be known that Zurich will soon adopt the old faith again, etc. They have replied: they hope not to ever experience that day, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, chief pastor of the people of Basel, dearest brother.</p>
