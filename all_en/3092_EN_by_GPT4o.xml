      <p>Greetings. I received your last letter sent through Mr. Fierz, to which I cannot respond at length now; for not everyone has yet fully read your commentaries on the Apocalypse. I am urging them strongly and hope that within a few days all will have completed the reading.</p>
      <p>The German preface was read by the school authorities, Treasurer Haller and Claudius von Madiis. If anything is decided by them in this matter, I will inform you promptly and will also return the German preface once we have made sufficient use of it. I will delete the names of the councilors as you instructed; I will also see how it might be possible to insert what you excerpted from that Frenchman's writing about the name or number of the beast. If permission is granted to Apiarius to print, he will print one or two pages and bring them with him, so that you can approve the form of the letters. Either I or Musculus will assist in the correction.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva (as I am informed by Consul Nägelin and Treasurer Dilger) whipped a certain criminal through the forum on the day of the Lord's Nativity. This act has so inflamed the spirits of our people anew, that nothing could be more so.</p>
      <p>For it appears that they use their so-called Christian liberty not according to love and for edification, but entirely for the contempt of others and the destruction of many. It is incredible how much their minds are alienated by such actions, especially those who still cling to papal superstition in France and elsewhere. They also say that the minister (whose name I do not know, whether it was Calvin or someone else) who preached that day, when he saw a larger congregation than usual on other weekdays, raged in a remarkable manner, because he saw from their attendance that superstition and the observance of this day still clung to their minds.</p>
      <p>What these things will eventually bring forth, the Lord knows. No one reproaches Christian liberty in such matters, but that they do not seem to use it according to the apostolic rule. This also separates from them the minds of those who have hitherto seemed to favor them greatly. They have also constructed a type of maritime vessel, which they call a Galleon, to use on Lake Geneva. Its use can only be against us, since almost the entire region adjacent to the lake on both sides is under Bernese dominion. There are also other things that greatly distress me, as I fear that this discord may eventually break out into some greater evil, which God in His mercy may avert. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My mother and wife, as well as all the brothers, send their greetings to you and yours. Musculus himself writes. May all the lords and brothers with you, Mr. Martyr, Gualther, Theodor, etc., be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, my dear and esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
