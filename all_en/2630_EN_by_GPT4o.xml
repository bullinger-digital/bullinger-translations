      <p>Greetings. I have received, most memorable man, my confession along with three copies of your agreement, for which I give you the utmost thanks, while currently lying in the Baths of the Margrave.</p>
      <p>I will attempt to translate your Confession or Agreement into German; however, I do not know where it will be printed, as there is no printing press in Neuburg, having been dismantled by the Spanish.</p>
      <p>Regarding the discussion at the diet concerning religion, I have long shared the same opinion as you; but the Saxons and Meisseners embrace a civil gospel and wish to refer it to politics, not understanding that the nature of the matter cannot bear this. It is also not difficult for the adversaries to promise us what they attested with letters and seals 15 years ago and delivered nothing but war. I certainly foresee the same will happen in these matters.</p>
      <p>How absurdly the Bernese, Baselers, and other compatriots are said to have acted in the case of the Lucerners and a certain tailor, is a great delight to the papists and indeed not without reason.</p>
      <p>Believe me, they do not rejoice so much over the fate of all England as they do over the lamentable fate of the Lucerners. May the Lord avert vengeance. Who could have thought of more horrible things?</p>
      <p>I have now been called to the illustrious Prince Otto-Heinrich of the Palatinate in the Baths of the Margrave, where I am currently lying ill with one leg, hoping, however, to be better soon, and then perhaps I will bathe.</p>
      <p>From your Agreement, I have gained two Lutherans. They are indeed miserable people. Those who condemn without seeing, when they truly see and hear, are immediately conquered by the truth, although they are rare, for the obstinate are destined for Gehenna.</p>
      <p>My prince is sending his envoy Adam von Hohenegkh, the master of the court, to the renowned magistrate of Zurich to obtain a loan of several thousand gold coins. Although this cause may seem and be more alien than to succeed prosperously, for many reasons I would wish these prayers not to be entirely rejected. This matter can be done and handled quietly, so as not to be prejudicial; therefore, there is nothing to doubt about the given and kept faith. Prince Otto-Heinrich has many prerogatives and expectations of soon freeing himself from all his debts; the electorate awaits him daily, to which the Palatinate of the Rhine and all of Upper Bavaria adhere. Even if these do not succeed, our duchy's estates are so arranged that they (who are also sureties and guarantors) will certainly keep them. Therefore, I would like this business to be promoted. Farewell and write something with this man. From the Baths of the Margrave, May 6th, in the year etc. 55.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Laetus etc.</p>
      <p>To the earnest and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the preeminent of the church in Zurich, etc., my trusted, dear lord and brother, to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
