    <p xml:id="regest1">The two prisoners, Hans Leemann and Jakob Graf, who during the Second Kappel War attempted to lead the Zurich Free District Knonauer Amt to a separate peace at the instigation of the Five Places, were indeed brought to trial in Zurich, but were eventually released on the intercession of the Zurich lake communities and the Knonauer Amt. They were, however, sentenced to the loss of honor and heavy fines and are not allowed to leave their place of residence. The matter is all the more painful because Zurich was in a desperate situation at the time of the betrayal. Thanks for the news from France and England, which are also confirmed by other sources. Luther published writings "On the Private Mass and Ordination of Priests" and his letter of March 11, 1534, to Nikolaus von Amsdorf, in which Oecolampadius and Erasmus are reviled. With this, he harms the Church. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>What should I report about the captives? They have escaped. First, because almost the entire Lake Zurich once threatened to do the same in war as these two advised their people to do - Lake Zurich threatened to make peace with the Five Places if the city refused the conditions of peace, which it could not do without breaking its oath. However, Leemann (for this is the name of one of the captives) was captured by the Five Places before the disaster and sent to his people, to the Free District, to encourage the remnants to surrender, which he did through the messenger Graf (thus the other captive is called). But that district did not want to accept the offered condition and even rejected it with indignation. Eventually, Leemann escaped and returned to the army -, then because almost the entire Lake and the district, which they call the Free District, petitioned the senate for the captives. Here many things were thrown back and forth. They were finally released, but not without some penalty. For they are marked with infamy, pay the greatest expenses, and are prohibited from leaving their own residences in the Zurich territory. So disgracefully has one fought, and there has been so much treachery that if one were to punish it now, the number is so great that a greater misfortune (disaster) is to be feared. I write this to you alone, and with great sorrow. These causes are not known to everyone. The best people have grieved over the common treachery; the city was also quite miserable. Then they left the Free District, alone to Horgen, etc. You know all this. Burn these letters, etc.</p>
      <p>What you write about France and England was most welcome; a certain royal attendant from the city of Paris, a good and pious man, writes the same. Many indeed chatter about the future war. Meanwhile, write what you have heard, pray for us, and farewell forever.</p>
      <p>I am deeply grieved by Luther's impudence in his recent pamphlets about the private mass and writings against Erasmus. For I see that this man will cause more harm to the Church of God than he has ever benefited it. Meanwhile, Bucer does not cease to prefer him to all the learned in Europe in the gospel, I wonder with what intention. He openly preaches that Oecolampadius, that most holy man, your predecessor, was strangled by Satan in these furious quarrels. See what this monk dares. He outright counts Erasmus among the Arians and pours out loads of insults and slanders on that old man who has deserved so well of the Church and letters. See, I beseech you, in what great dangers the Church is involved, in what great storms of persecutions and temptations it is shaken. May the Lord preserve us in truth. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>April 18, 1534.</p>
      <p>Utinger wishes you well. My mother greets your wife.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, bishop of the holy church of Basel, my most esteemed brother. Basel.</p>
