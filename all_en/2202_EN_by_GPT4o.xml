      <p>Greetings. I have again discussed your relative with Mr. Bernhard, the consul, who, as he is very fond of you, just like the other, wishes to consider the interests of an excellent man and, if possible, to do him a favor in your name. He indicated that he would like him to come to us at some point, as he is not so far away, and to communicate his plans in person with some of the leading figures of the republic, at least in private. If he decides to do this, I would like him to make me aware of his presence; for I will not hesitate to accompany him and recommend him to certain friends. Calvin's writing on the heresy and punishment of Servetus has now been published, and in my judgment, it is holy and precise, although I have not yet been able to see it in its entirety. I believe it will greatly benefit the church, as it strongly challenges and refutes the pernicious error, which many are convinced of, that heretics should not be punished. I hear that Ulm is summoning ministers from everywhere to restore the subverted religion, and I rejoice for that reason; but I am greatly surprised that I do not understand them to be deliberating and acting on the restoration of Frecht and the rest of his associates and fellow captives, about whose faith and sincerity they can have no doubts. Schwenckfeld is said to be spreading his poison more widely and effectively every day, not without serious harm to the church and the ruin of many, whom this plague infects, as they are less solidly grounded. It would be expedient to counter this with some solid writing, and not to either despise or ignore impiety any longer. Our Lycosthenes is being restored day by day by the wonderful and almost miraculous power of God, so that he is again hoped to serve the church, for which we most deservedly give thanks to the eternal Father for the great benefit to us and pray that he may wish this to be long-lasting for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family. Basel, February 26, 1554. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
