      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>What I was going to write, I have entrusted to Konrad Klauser to convey, whom I commend to you wholeheartedly. He recounts countless benefits he has received from you. If you continue to bestow upon him according to your kindness, you will gain the greatest praise from God and all the saints. For the young man seems to be of excellent promise.</p>
      <p>I have received the commentaries on John. For these, I give thanks.</p>
      <p>I anxiously await your letters. For you have not written for a long time. I do not know why this is. I do not dare to doubt that your mind is estranged from us. Certainly, I hold you among the foremost in the list of friends. Therefore, continue to love the one who loves you and farewell.</p>
      <p>September 21, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant leader of the Basel church, and by far the dearest colleague.</p>
