    <p xml:id="regest1">Awaits Bullinger's response to his last letter [No. 476]. Due to the Zurich Confession [No. 482], the most prominent fellow ministers from the rural chapters of Bern were summoned. Without their and the magistrate's consent, the city of Bern wants to do nothing. The people of Zurich should also involve their rural pastors, as Luther, after an agreement, will fill all countries with his victory cries. Bullinger will soon receive the decision. Assures Bullinger of his friendship and requests the sending of his commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. [Otto] Brunfels has died. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since you did not respond to my last letter, dearest Heinrich, I continue to await your reply. As for your confession regarding the Eucharist, we have summoned the most prominent brothers from each chapter of our rural area - the Bernese region has 14 chapters - without whose consent, and indeed that of the magistrate, we have decided to do nothing at all in the name of the churches. We do not know whether you in Zurich, without those you have in the countryside, are willing to undertake this arduous task alone. You will see, surely, when Luther has grasped your confession, however you may have either implied or explicitly delivered it, with what triumph and praise of victory he will fill the whole world. But more on this soon. As soon as a decision has been made by the brothers, we will send yours along with ours to you. In the meantime, you will ensure that, however I may have revealed my freedom or rather ignorance in this matter, the firm, constant, and perpetual friendship between us remains, which unless you had long held in the highest regard, you would not have easily opened the depths of my heart.</p>
      <p>If there are any notes on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, either that messenger or Christophorus, whom we expect at the Christmas holidays, should bring them. Brunfels has departed from the living. Greet the fellow ministers, your wife, and family.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>December 10, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, as little as it is, Bercht. Hall.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed churchman of Zurich in piety and learning, his brother.</p>
