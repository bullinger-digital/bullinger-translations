      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Our old friend, the esteemed Bullinger, dear lord and brother in Christ, Johannes Winzurner, a man rightly commendable for his noble qualities, unless a fatal misfortune has miserably and unhappily obscured them, has come to us. He recounted the entire action of his tragedy to us in a long and free speech, not without sighs, and although he admits that he has gravely sinned in this matter, he nevertheless complains that he is continually burdened with false and fabricated new rumors, and that they thrive and gain strength by the mobility of their nature, so that wherever he is transferred to any church, even if he is sought as a pastor, he may freely reside. Therefore, to restrain this beast, he says he is going to Zürich and has decided to conduct his case there with the opposing party in court. To do this more conveniently, especially with your advice, in which you are very strong, he thought it would be helpful if we wrote to your kindness in a few words about how he conducted himself when he once served as a colleague in the neighboring churches. Although the crime greatly offends us, we cannot help but also greatly grieve for the unfortunate man on behalf of the church, whom we know, and freely testify, that he opposed the most vehement assaults of the adversaries like a bronze wall during the beginnings of the preaching of the gospel among the Rhetians in the greatest turmoil and amidst the very weapons, so that if the Rhetians have any remnants of evangelical truth, we judge that they owe it in large part to his courage and skill in the Lord. Nor does he seem to have entirely lost the same piety of spirit. For recently at Sitterdorf in Thurgau, where, after the pastor had died, the papists began a consultation with the utmost effort about the restoration of the abominable mass, he, since he was present unexpectedly, was asked by the pious to speak to the people, and he delivered a speech against this beast in a public sacred assembly with such virtue and prudence that not a single step was conceded to the papists' opinion. From this, it is not obscurely apparent that through Christ's intercession, his faith has not yet failed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, not difficult to persuade, dearest Bullinger, trusting in your kindness, we remind you of this matter, that if there is any remaining hope, if there is any remedy for extinguishing the offense and a way to end this evil, especially in such a shortage of ministers, the church of Christ may not be deprived of this man, who is not commonly adorned with learning and grace. For perhaps he has withdrawn for a time, so that we may recover him forever; perhaps he has fallen through weakness, so that he may rise again in Christ with greater strength of spirit, and lest perhaps the excellence of his gifts should exalt him. For we see in the church outstanding men who have tamed lions and the fiercest bears, who have conquered the dreadful Philistine, who nevertheless could not tame and conquer this most gentle Venus, who also have not been (as they say) cast down from the bridge, by the goodness of Him who came into the world to seek and save sinners and what was lost.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we see that the falls of the reborn and truly repentant are not only a consolation to afflicted consciences but also that when they return, they are sometimes more suitable for strengthening the brothers and more robust against impending evils. For we have Christ as the craftsman who knows how to shape from the clay of our weakness and errors an image similar to Himself through the renewal of the mind. That He may exercise this art in this matter, we must ardently pray with our wishes. Therefore, most learned and kind man, refresh in the Lord the afflicted bowels, lest in any way it happens that such a one is swallowed up by excessive grief. If you, according to your moderation, restore him as a useful minister to the church, whom the deceitful imposture of the flesh made useless, we do not doubt that you will have accomplished a matter most pleasing to both angels and all the pious, especially to Christ, the archbishop of souls. Farewell in Christ; please convey our greetings to the doctors of your church, the pious and learned men, in our name, and have us and our church commended in your prayers. St. Gallen, January 13, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Valentinus Fortmüller, Antonius Cilius, Johannes Kessler.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most outstanding teacher of truth of the church of Zürich and indeed of the whole church of Christ, dear lord and brother in Christ.</p>
