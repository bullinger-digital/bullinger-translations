    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas could not write for a while because he spent the past week in Strasbourg due to a very annoying matter, as if there weren't already enough conflicts in this world! He would have much to share with Bullinger about his private worries and the tangled political situation. God willing, he will soon discuss this personally with Bullinger!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Here he only wants to address the following: Currently, there is a "Belgian" named Valérand [Poullain] in Basel, a frivolous and deceitful person. He has stirred up the entire city of Basel with a scandalous affair. The most respected men in Basel (like Oswald Myconius and the mayor) and in Strasbourg (like Martin Bucer or Peter Martyr Vermigli) know him by now. He was commissioned by Jacques de Bourgogne, Lord of Falais, to bring a noble girl from "Belgium" to Basel. During the dangerous journey, when she was completely dependent on him and could seek advice from no one else, he beguiled her with sweet words. Now he tarnishes her reputation with false statements! The whole turmoil is due to his corrupt nature as well as the Englishman [John Hooper] now living in Zurich, who completely turned Poullain's head at the beginning of the affair.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Should Poullain come to Zurich, then the people of Zurich should be warned about him and his scheming! He is talkative, mentally agile, and capable of deceiving unsuspecting people. If the letter carrier [...] could have waited, Myconius would have described Poullain even more aptly than Enzinas. Myconius often says in reference to Poullain that he would never have become a Christian if Christians had to be such unstable scatterbrains as this one!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Regarding Enzinas' letter of recommendation for Hooper [HBBW XIX, No. 2861], the following should be noted: Enzinas only praised Hooper's beliefs in it. He did not comment on his way of life. In connection with the mentioned affair, it became increasingly clear to him that Hooper is not as upright as assumed (while the lifestyle of his wife [Anne t’Serclaes] deserves only praise, quite the opposite!). But enough of that. More on this orally.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enzinas hereby sends the "[Christian, rightful and steadfast] Appeal [and Protestation]" of the [deposed] Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann von Wied. He received it from Peter Medmann, who sends his regards to Bullinger and may already be in Strasbourg by now. The Archbishop was deposed. The Administrator [Adolf III of Schaumburg] only causes unrest. Enzinas will tell Bullinger something very remarkable about the elderly Archbishop.</p>

      <p>S. D. I spent the past week in Strasbourg, called there for some very annoying matters, as if there were no corner in this fateful age free from the most sorrowful conflicts over the greatest matters. Therefore, I could not write to you in the previous days. Otherwise, there are quite a few things, both public and private, that I would gladly share with you; within my heart are the most sorrowful pains, and outside, in the entire republic, there is horrible turmoil. I will share more serious matters in person, God willing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What now urges me, I will say in a few words: There is a certain Belgian man in this city, named Valérand, a turbulent and deceitful man, who has disturbed our entire republic with his very wicked and impious cause, as is known to the principal men of this and the Strasbourg city, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Myconius, and finally our consul. It would be too long to narrate the whole affair; the summary is this: He deceived with fraudulent words a most honorable and noble girl, exiled from her homeland for her profession of religion, deprived of all counsel and placed in the danger of the journey, whom he was bringing from Belgium under the patronage of Lord Falais, to whom he himself was indebted. Now he seeks false testimonies everywhere, with which he may harm the reputation of the most honorable girl. Into these straits and impious contentions, he was led first by his own most perverse nature, and then also by the Englishman who is with you; for he, when he initially involved himself in this cause, not by judgment but by inconsiderate affection, made Valérand, a foolish man, completely insane.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I say this so that, if Valérand should happen to come to you, you may recognize the nature of the man and know in what causes he is involved, which will not only be damaging to himself but also disgraceful to the most honorable men. Let the other brothers also be warned not to be deceived by this man, who is both talkative and of a versatile mind, and can deceive a person not attentive at first glance. If time permitted this messenger, Myconius would depict the man to you far differently than I can, about whom he often says: "If Christians ought to be as turbulent and restless as this man, I would never want to be a Christian." To this, I would not want my recommendation, which I gave to the Englishman for you, to be a fraud to me or to the truth. I praised him for his zeal for doctrine; I still feel the same. I did not touch upon his morals, which I see daily to be less upright than I had thought, especially in this cause. I praised his wife more extensively, whom I feel is worthy of all praise. But enough of these matters. I only wanted you and the brothers to be warned not to be deceived by the appearance of right from not good men. I will narrate the whole cause in person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I send to you the appeal of the Archbishop of Cologne, which Peter Medmann gave to me, who happened to turn towards us in Strasbourg. He greets you most diligently. The Archbishop is plainly deposed; the administrator disturbs everything. There is an example in this old man worthy of memory, which I will narrate more closely when I see you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell with the whole church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>8th day of May 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
