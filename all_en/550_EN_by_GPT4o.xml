      <p>PRAISE BE TO GOD! London, June 4, in the year of our Lord 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes!</p>
      <p>You are surprised (as you write to me in your recent letter dated March 24) that I have been able to restrain myself from writing to you since the day I left Germany, especially since you have now sent me another letter. But if I make up for (you say) what has been neglected so far, you will accept any excuse; if not, even a clever one will not suffice with you, etc. I reply, my most esteemed lord and friend, that I have not written to you all this time because I have scarcely had the leisure, since I came here, to complete and write what necessity demanded I accomplish. Germany did not suit me very well: for the air was contrary, indeed most hostile, to my constitution; the diet and wine of that region agreed with me little more, especially in winter with the hypocausts; so that now, since I have entered England, especially since February, it seems to me that my strength has been exhausted, and almost no vigor remains.</p>
      <p>Therefore, henceforth (unless God restores me to good health, of which there is no sign) I will write even fewer letters to you (especially since I hardly write in Latin to anyone other than you, because it is a most troublesome task for me) than I have done in the past two years. Nor would I want you to take it badly, because through Lord John Butler and John Burcher you can learn as conveniently about the state of the English kingdom, the Scottish war, and my affairs as from my own letters.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I hold your truly pious exhortations in high regard, and I will diligently observe the examples of the pious and the threats of the Lord against the impious despisers of the divine word, which you abundantly offer from the sacred texts in your letters: and I will continually beseech the Most Good and Great God in my prayers, that He may not lead me into temptation because of my most grievous past sins, but deliver me from all evil.</p>
      <p>For the two decades of your sermons, which I believe Lord John Hooper will give me here in your name, I owe you great thanks. I also wish to send you something good in return; but rarely are theological books published in this region except in our vernacular language: when I see one worthy of reading, I will send it to one of my compatriots in Germany for Lord John Butler, so that he can interpret the summary of the book for you in Latin. I conveyed your greetings to Bartholomew Traherne in your name, and also encouraged him, as you wished, to continue being faithful to the Lord and steadfast in the truth: which he most certainly does; for he is a truly pious man, fearing God. He tried as much as he could (he was one of the members of the last parliament) to prevent a mixture in the reformation of the Lord's Supper: but it was not in his power to persuade his fellow citizens of this. Therefore, as Lord John Butler can further report to your piety from my little letters, we have a uniform communion of the Eucharist throughout the kingdom, in the manner of the churches of Nuremberg and some Saxon churches; for they do not yet want to admit your rites concerning the dispensation of the sacraments, nor do I doubt that Lord Martin Bucer and other learned men from Germany and Italy, who are here with the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury and lecture in the academies of our region, teach, indeed advise and persuade that it is not necessary, perhaps even not fitting.</p>
      <p>Thus our bishops and magistrates seem at present at least to do well, while for the sake of preserving public peace and not giving any offense to the Lutherans, they lend an ear to these most learned German theologians of yours, submit their judgment to them, and thus retain some pontifical ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letter written on November 19, 1548, I can give no response, because in it you wish, if I could, to inform you how Lord Canterbury received your letter and your book. But I have no familiarity or conversation with him or with similar nobles or men endowed with such authority, so that I would know such things, and therefore I ask you not to think ill of me for not having informed you of this matter all this year. You will kindly greet all your fellow believers, especially your wife and your whole family, in my name; my wife also sends many greetings to you and your most chaste wife. May the Lord Jesus keep you forever, amen.</p>
      <p>Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a friend especially dear to me. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
