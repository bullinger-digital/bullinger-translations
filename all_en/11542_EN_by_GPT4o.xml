    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares Bullinger's skepticism towards religious discussions, which he [expressed in 1538], now more than ever after the experiences of the last two years. He also has little hope for the current Imperial Diet in Regensburg, about the beginning of which Rudolf Gwalther reports [No. 1497]; although Emperor [Charles V] desires peace, he is under the influence of the increasingly hardened Papists, with whom cooperation remains as impossible as it was in Hagenau and Worms. Due to the lack of messengers, he could not write for a long time, as he is no longer working in Kassel, but in Nidda as a preacher - due to certain occurrences at the court, he prefers this -; he asks Bullinger to write to him for the Frankfurt Autumn Fair and urges him to publish commentaries on the Gospels. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from God through Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Your letters, most illustrious man, written to me several years ago, were read with great pleasure as they are the most abundant witnesses of your love towards me and your most sincere spirit. I was pleased to see you, such a man, speak so clearly and candidly about the kingdom of Christ and those who now profess the gospel, about the assemblies of the Germans and the reading of the ancient fathers. And indeed, now taught by experience itself, I cannot but agree with your judgment, which you expressed about the assemblies at that time, namely that such assemblies have always brought more harm than benefit to the church of Christ. For having attended so many assemblies over the span of two years now in the name of our most illustrious prince, I always depart with a more mournful face and spirit, and more saddened than when I arrived. Thus, that most cunning spirit of Satan exerts his power in those synods through his own, and with some splendid hypocrisy, he tries to impose nothing but poison on the sons of God who are not sufficiently wise and who sometimes look more to earthly peace than to that of Christ, which surpasses all understanding, and he attempts to preserve it in the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I cannot promise myself much good even from these assemblies, which are now being held in Regensburg. For what has been done so far in Regensburg, you will learn from the letters of the most learned young man Rudolf Gwalther from Zurich, who is now enjoying the Regensburg air with us. The Emperor indeed has begun matters quite graciously and shows some humanity, and there is no doubt that he seriously seeks peace and political tranquility for Germany. Especially since he sees such dangers threatening the empire from the Turks, and since he is completely ignorant of the true knowledge of Christ and is still entirely besieged by the Papists, so that you could swear he is plainly a slave of the Pope, I do not yet see how the kingdom of Christ can be promoted. The hardened papal rabble daily makes their latter deeds worse than their former with a certain zeal, so that no one can fail to see that Satan, that unclean spirit, along with seven spirits more wicked than himself, has plainly occupied their hearts. But what agreement can there be between light and darkness, between Belial and Christ? Therefore, the end that the assembly in Hagenau met with, along with that in Worms, I also predict for the Regensburg assembly (as far as the kingdom of Christ is concerned).</p>
      <p>As for why I have not sent you any letters until now, I do not want you to attribute it to my negligence; for convenient messengers do not present themselves to me outside the Frankfurt fairs, since I am no longer working with the people of Kassel, but with those of Nidda as a preacher for certain reasons, and due to certain court consultations, which if completed, I would prefer to be undone, I am glad to be absent. Nor was I allowed, nor am I now allowed, to go to Frankfurt due to the celebrated synods. I pray, however, that your kindness may deign to refresh me somewhat with your letters at the next Frankfurt fair, namely the autumn one, amidst the great noise and fury of the world. For with the dexterity of spirit and firm constancy, our friendship once begun in Christ will flourish perpetually. And I pray and beseech you to publish the evangelists illuminated by your commentaries for the benefit of the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus most happily together with your wife and children. Dionysius Melander sends his greetings to you, and we earnestly ask that you convey our greetings to Bibliander, Pellican, and all the fellow students of the Zurich church. Dr. Draconites also instructed me to greet you in his name most reverently.</p>
      <p>From Regensburg, hastily, April 12, 1541. Johannes Pistorius from Nidda, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man both in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
