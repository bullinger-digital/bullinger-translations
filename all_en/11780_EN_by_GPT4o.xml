    <p xml:id="regest1">Turns to Bullinger again, after having already sought his advice once before. Joachim Mötteli declared in Baden to a delegation [of the Reformed in Weinfelden] that he was unable to provide them with a new preacher by Easter; after they had addressed their complaint to the [Thurgau] governor [Melchior Heinrich], he demanded that Martin Mötteli temporarily serve there again, albeit in a completely unsecured position. In a conversation with Ludwig[?] von Ulm, Joachim Mötteli gave the impression of further seeking a pretext to accuse Martin Mötteli. Therefore, he asks for mediation for a new position; he is determined to leave Weinfelden and has sufficiently proven that he does not do this lightly. Also writes to Mayor [Johannes] Haab. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dearest lord and brother, as I was recently with you (as I have been many times before) and sought your advice on my concerns, I once again urgently ask you not to be angry that I trouble you; for I am entirely assured of your goodness, as I have experienced many times before through your actions.</p>
      <p>On the initiative and advice of Mayor Haab, my gracious lord, our envoys went to Baden with the consent of the governor, but they could not achieve anything with young lord Joachim Mötteli, except as much as the governor's previous judgment allowed; they are to provide another preacher as soon as possible, but they have delayed due to the time and Easter festival (since I did not want to preach anymore based on Joachim's complaint and the previous judgment from some brothers' advice), so they are unprovided for at this time. Joachim then said he could not break a promise, but he would look for one immediately, which the envoys also complained about to my lord governor, that he had driven out their preacher and would not give them another during the holy time. The governor then spoke with Joachim, and as a result, the governor offered me ten guilders to assure the people of Weinfelden until further notice. I suspect, until young lord Joachim finds another. What my lord Mayor Haab, along with some other lords, decided, judged, and advised our envoys during the hearing, Mayor Haab can report to you precisely. However, as I understood from the envoys, they found no comfort (help, solution) to keep me, but had to let Joachim grant his fief to whomever he wanted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I asked our court lord, young lord Ludwig von Ulm, who is also of our faith, for advice on the matter. He told me that when he was with Joachim Mötteli during Holy Week, he pleaded with him on behalf of the community and myself, but could not achieve anything, except that he asked about my preaching, whether I preached rebelliously against taxes and authorities; to which he completely justified me. To this, Joachim said: "Well, when we come together again, we will talk further about it." I suspect he might find a pretext to accuse me and justify his actions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, friendly lord and brother, do your best, as you have always comforted me, and help me find a place (somewhere to stay) and let me know this within fourteen days at the latest by my own messenger at my expense, for it cannot wait; I might be forced to leave suddenly by command. I would like to prevent this if I knew where to go. For I am entirely determined to free myself from this predicament once and for all. And if I do not find a place with you, which I do not hope, I will look elsewhere as soon as possible, God willing, wherever I may go. For if the man is allowed so much, I want to be untroubled with him (you understand me well). He might not stop until he brings me to disgrace and harm. I hope my service is not only bound to the people of Weinfelden. I hope good brothers can recognize that I can leave honorably; for I have endured enough great danger in my office. Therefore, I will leave once. You alone have kept me here for two years now, which has cost me a great sum; not that I blame you (would reproach you), but so you see how with great harm and danger I can also follow good brothers. For the Lord is rich enough to preserve my livelihood for better use, who has also preserved me until now. Yet I do not want to tempt God when fairness is denied to me in the world, although I know myself to be completely innocent before God, as I also think I am completely justified with you and many brothers.</p>
      <p>I have also written briefly to Mayor Haab about the matter; let him receive the letter. Let me be commended to you as always. I mean well with the gospel. May God make it according to His providence.</p>
      <p>Always faithfully commended to God. Greet your dear wife and all good lords and brothers, especially Theodorus.</p>
      <p>Given in Weinfelden, on the 30th day of March in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Martin Mötteli in Weinfelden, servant of the word.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his especially gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
