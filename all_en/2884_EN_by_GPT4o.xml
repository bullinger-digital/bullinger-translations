      <p>Honorable, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir, I offer you my friendly willing service, and whatever I can in honor, love, and goodness, beforehand. I have received and read your letter along with the enclosed booklet with special thanks, and also your request to my brother-in-law Bartholomäus Steckhen regarding Mr. Johannes Jaßkhe from Danzig in Prussia, his letter, and what he had to send to you in Leipzig through his agents or brother, to be forwarded to me and sent to you, to be kept most faithfully, and he and I are inclined to serve you in this and other matters with special willingness. However, since my aforementioned brother-in-law has moved their business from Leipzig to Nuremberg for certain reasons and has nothing more to handle or do there, they cannot serve you in that place; yet they have offered, since they have a trusted friend in Nuremberg and he has an agent in Leipzig, named Hieronymus Schrutenbach, perhaps through him your concerns could be addressed. My brother-in-law and I offer to gladly serve in this matter and to write to Nuremberg and Leipzig and to send your letters there and receive others, if that is your intention, although perhaps, if my brother-in-law were in Leipzig or went there, as previously happened, your matters could be better and more securely taken care of.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the utmost diligence will be applied by us on your behalf; for in your service, we shall need no effort or labor.</p>
      <p>That pious Christians in Italy and France must suffer is indeed lamentable, yet the Lord is to be praised that He allows His word to take root everywhere and to be confirmed through steadfast confession and also the blood of the believers, and it is to be feared that with the new pope, who is said to have died, and with the fortune of the king in France, even more will begin.</p>
      <p>Our messenger, who arrived on Saturday from Nuremberg, reports reliably that Ferdinand has become Roman Emperor and that the city of Nördlingen has sworn special allegiance to His Majesty; for he has ridden to Werd and then to Vienna to conclude a seven-month peace and agreement with the Turks, intending to hold a diet in Augsburg on May 17, as I understand, with some princes and then to convene a general diet in Nuremberg. May God send it for good and possibly a Christian government for the German nation. Otherwise, I know nothing new. But if you have anything, I ask you to inform me according to your offer without burdening yourself; whatever comes to me shall likewise be shared with you without reservation.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on Tuesday from the senate on the 4th of April in the year 1556. Your willing servant, Josua Keßler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the churches in Zurich, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
      <p>Josua Keßler, city scribe of St. Gallen.</p>
