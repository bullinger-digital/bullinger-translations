      <p>Greetings and best wishes. The bearer of this letter to your esteemed self, dearest compater, is the envoy of the King of France to the Rhaetians. He requested a recommendation from me to you. I could not refuse him this. However, I frankly stated: The minister of the Church of Chur does not involve himself in royal affairs, nor is my recommendation directed towards such matters, but rather towards understanding that you favor Christ and true piety and earnestly desire the propagation of the kingdom of Christ, so that in this matter and cause you may engage in frequent discussions. He greeted me here four years ago. I understood from the French that he is very dear to the King and has much influence with the King, and can greatly assist the faithful, as he is otherwise very powerful and of great authority with the King. Dr. Johannes Calvin recommended him to me with these words: "I commend to you, my Bullinger, the King's envoy to the Rhaetians, in such a way that I dare to vouch for his piety and integrity. You will therefore receive the man as familiarly as one of us. I also wish this testimony to be valid with Dr. Peter Martyr and other brothers. His wife, similar to him, practices piety without pretense. Whatever kindness you show him, I will consider as done to me. Geneva, May 6, 1557." He soon adds: If you inform our brothers in Chur of his integrity, I hope he will prove to be such that you will never regret this testimony. Farewell again. This is from Calvin.</p>
      <p>Thus, I commend him to you and Dr. Philipp as well, so that you may be spurs to him towards piety, and that he may advance in it. You will share this with our Philipp, whom I wish well. When I have more leisure, I will write more. In the meantime, farewell, always mindful of your duty.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 13, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Church of Chur, compater, brother in Christ, and very dear friend, Chur.</p>
