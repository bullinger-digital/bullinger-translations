    <p xml:id="regest1">In their great concern about the illness of Bullinger and Leo [Juda], they were able to breathe a sigh of relief through the news from Jakob [Funcklin] about the improvement in their health condition; [Johannes] Zwick has fallen ill with a worse disease than the previous one, but the doctors are confident. He cannot fully agree with Bullinger's view of [Martin] Bucer; he himself admires him for his many talents and his selflessness and sincerity in faith, even if he sometimes makes all-too-human errors or is not successful. Bucer reports from the situation in Cologne that Ottheinrich [of the Palatinate], [the Archbishop of] Cologne [Hermann von Wied], and [Wilhelm of JÃ¼lich-Berg-Kleve-]Geldern are unanimously striving for the introduction of the Reformation, which Pope [Paul III] is trying to prevent by convening the Council of Trent. If Bullinger criticizes Schwenckfeld's doctrine [in his commentary on Matthew], he should not conceal his name, so that he can no longer claim alleged agreement with Lutheran and Zwinglian scholars; Schwenckfeld does not mince words in his writings against the "Creaturists," so one should do the same to him; Vadian's counter-writing "Pro veritate carnis triumphantis Christi" is highly valued by scholars, but further criticism is necessary. They are very pleased with Bullinger's [Matthew] commentary; Bullinger has sent 84 pages, the rest is still missing. Agrees with Bullinger's view on the plans of [Francis I]; if it is true that [Suleiman I] is sending him 10,000 horsemen through Venetia, he will harm himself even more than Christendom. Congratulations on the success of the admonitory letter to the Five Places. Thanks for Theodor [Bibliander's] excellent writing ["Ad nominis christiani socios consultatio"]; since there is a lack of willingness to follow good advice, a defeat of the Germans [against the Turks] is more likely than a victory. Return of [Konrad] Zwick from the Diet [at Speyer], but Blarer has so far learned little; regarding religion, nothing has happened, secular interests were in the foreground; more on this from Jakob [Funcklin]. Best wishes and greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We were almost breathless at the unpleasant rumor that you, our dearest and sweetest leader, along with Leo, were ill and even on the verge of death. Ah, Christ the Savior, what will be the state of your church soon, if you, in your anger, transfer these most faithful and highest bishops of ours to the heavenly realm at such an untimely moment? Have mercy, have mercy on your sheep, who will soon be thrown to the gaping wolves if they are left without the care and protection of shepherds; vindicate the glory of your name from our enemies, to whom we will be prey unless you extend your helping hand to us. We breathe somewhat easier again, after this good Jakob now indicates to us that you are somewhat better; we truly pray to the best Father in heaven, that with His healing hand, He may graciously restore you to the firmest and most lasting health for us and His church. You are indeed worthy of a very long life, and may you live excellently, since your sole concern is that others may not die poorly, and we entirely hope that the good shepherd, who came for this sole purpose, that His sheep may have life and have it more abundantly, will not fail our prayers and those of many faithful with His most present divine power. Our Zwick has again relapsed into not the former, but a much sharper illness, but now, by the Lord's benefit, he is in such a state that we confidently trust, even with the doctors' encouragement, that he will easily overcome it, and hence we give the greatest thanks to the author of life, who did not wish us to have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
      <p>What you write about Bucer, I fear I cannot agree with you on everything, although I too (why should I dissemble) find some things lacking in him, as indeed no son of Adam is perfect in every respect. I greatly love the man both for his remarkable and varied qualities of mind, and especially for the utmost integrity and sincerity, which I have always observed in him, in seeking the true glory of Christ and the propagation of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>But if he errs somewhere (as we are miserable little men) in his methods of action and what he attempts with great effort does not succeed, those who have sometimes attempted the same among the same or similar people will judge this to be forgivable.</p>
      <p>But you, be of the most secure mind: No one will hear anything of this from me, who would wish, if I could with the peril of life and property, to unite all beautifully in Christ, to separate none at all.</p>
      <p>About the situation in Cologne, he wrote only this among other things: "Otto Heinrich, the Archbishop of Cologne and Geldern have set their minds on restoring the churches and are engaged in a certain holy undertaking, which the pope, however, is trying to thwart by convening a general council at Trent, where it will appear that he has finally yielded to equity. May the Lord avert his attempt and unite His own, wherever they may be, in Himself," etc. Thus he.</p>
      <p>Many excellent lovers of Christian truth wish the impious error of Schwenckfeld to be refuted and exposed in such a way that everyone everywhere may understand that this is not a sheep of Christ, as he might appear if you were to judge from his blameless morals and splendid words, but a most rapacious and harmful wolf, selling himself with great authority in sheep's clothing even to many learned and good men. Therefore, you will have done a work not to be regretted, my venerable Bullinger, if you strip away the persona he sustains with marvelous tricks, and plainly propose him, who he is, with his name most clearly expressed, to be seen and abhorred by all. For from this he conciliates the favor of many, because he persuades most of the most learned and best of the Lutheran and Zwinglian factions, as he calls them, not to be opposed to him; who, if they understood openly otherwise, would more prudently and happily guard themselves. Those who publicly sin against Christian truth, I do not see why they should not also be publicly accused. He has vomited his poison in published booklets against the Creaturists and does not conceal anything; why should we not also strongly and openly oppose him as a wall for the house of Israel? All the learned, as many as I have heard either in person or in writing, kiss Vadian's writing with reverence and approve it with their vote, and plainly understand that he is the one who can contend with this enemy on equal terms, and yet it would be to the benefit of the church of Christ if he were also pressed and finished off by the authority and learning of others. Among whom you seem to us especially suited for this task; therefore, go ahead, dare, strive, engage, attack this most harmful enemy in open battle, doubting nothing of the victory, which will most certainly follow, deserving well of the church of Christ in this name as in many others.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries, the more we look into them, the more they please us in every way, so that I would not wish to add even a word to what I recently wrote to you about them. May the Lord, for whose glory and church this your labor sweats, most kindly impart His spirit to you, by whose dictation you may happily put the finishing touch to so holy a work. You sent 84 pages; we desire the rest. What you write about the plans of the French, we see, alas, to be too true. They affirm that the Turk is sending 10,000 horsemen through Venetia; if this is true, as I am led to believe by certain conjectures, it will be the end of his safety, and he will harm himself more than the Christian world with this untimely war. We greatly rejoice that your admonitory letters have had such an effect among the others of the Five Places.</p>
      <p>For Theodor's most serious and truly golden booklet, I give you the greatest thanks. He writes what is the case; but what madness is ours: Minds are lacking that obey sound advice, so that we must greatly fear that we will see devastation sooner than the victory of the Germans. May the Lord look kindly upon His afflicted church!</p>
      <p>Our Zwick has returned these days from the Diet, with whom, due to his and my own business, I have discussed very little about common matters.</p>
      <p>Nothing at all has been done in the matter of religion; everything is in a pitiable state of disarray, and what do I say "cohere" when everything is miserably torn apart and exposed? Private interests, hatreds, and enmities reign and prevail among all; nothing is done without lust and betrayals, and the greater part far surpasses the better, so that those who are sound can do nothing at all. The treasuries are being drained, and a great amount of silver and gold is considered the sinew of war; everything is being referred to human reasoning; but of the Lord, on whom alone all salvation depends, there is no mention at all, no piety and Christian repentance, so that the sons of men will utterly perish in their inventions. Let us earnestly pray to the Lord that some remnants, in which His name may be sanctified, may be preserved, which we will indeed prepare for Him by the diligent performance of our duty, planting and watering, which He will then happily promote to a mature harvest with heavenly increase. I have taken care to have the speech of the apostolic legate transcribed for you, so that you may see what monster he is continually bringing forth. The rest from Jakob; for more was not at all permitted. We earnestly beseech you to continue doing what you are doing, and love us in return, which we will understand you to do if you take the greatest care of your health, than which hardly anything is more precious to us.</p>
      <p>May our venerable brothers Pellicanus, Leo, Theodorus, Megander, and especially our best friend Gwalther, whom you will commend to us as accurately as you can, be greeted most lovingly. You will also greet your most chaste wife in our solid health, in Christ, with my and my little wife's words. The Zwick family, along with my brother, send their greetings to you. You diligently intercede with the Lord for us, that among these pressures and storms, with His few, He may keep us whole. April 27, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
