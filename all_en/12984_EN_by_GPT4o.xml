    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] The Ermatingen pastor Georg Seemann, who [delivers this letter], insisted on being recommended by Blarer. He is requesting a scholarship for his son Maximilian. Blarer cannot refuse this request, especially since the father has dedicated his son to God for church service from a young age. Should the people of Zurich also grant a scholarship to foreigners, Bullinger (whose influence is great) should actively support the father's wish. The people of Zurich will certainly not regret the expenditure. Although Blarer only knows the boy by sight, he has known for years from others that the father is counted among the best pastors, both in his way of life and his teachings. If a letter from Blarer to the Zurich schoolmasters or the council would be useful, Blarer is ready to write it immediately. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz has praised Bullinger's reliability and willingness to serve and will always be grateful to him for it. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Regarding the matter of Hans Schöner, Blarer fully agrees with Bullinger's proposal [in a letter not received]. However, it should suffice if only Blarer and Bullinger write to Augsburg, preferably not only to the Augsburg council but also to individual persons, especially the mayors Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot. Georg Frölich will do his duty anyway. If Bullinger agrees, he should send his letters intended for Augsburg as soon as possible, with the next messenger, so that Blarer can add them to his own. May the Lord grant success to the matter, so that the elderly Schöner may spend his twilight years pleasantly, and then, like Simeon, say to God: "now let him depart in peace." Greetings to Schöner, to whom Blarer cannot write now. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] What Bullinger wrote about the English King Edward VI has also been heard in Konstanz from other sources, including Gabriel Arnold, the treasurer of the Palatine Elector Friedrich II, who is presumably now in Zurich. Arnold reported that the young king, who is almost still a child, repeatedly and very earnestly asked for a Bible during his coronation ceremony, when he saw only the crown and scepter, until it was brought to him. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] A similar zeal for God's will is also said to be shown by the new Polish King Sigismund II Augustus. In a letter from Peter Buffler that arrived yesterday, it is stated how he learned from Hans Gutteter, coming from Poland and Bohemia, about the young king's zealous turn to the Gospel, which he has proclaimed to the great annoyance of the [Catholic] priests in Lithuania. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Buffler also reports that King Ferdinand is lying with hussars and up to 4000 other soldiers nine small miles from Prague, near Leitmeritz. Ferdinand wants to break the Bohemian alliance and punish the leaders. The Bohemians are very afraid. According to Buffler, a great uprising is therefore to be feared. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Blarer has received the letters from Bullinger addressed to him, as well as those to Gervasius Schuler [not received] and Johannes Haller [not received], from the young [Augustin...?]. Bullinger should not worry that the letter intended for the fickle Claude [d'Aliod] could not yet be delivered. It will happen. Konrad Zwick thanks Bullinger for his kindness and sends greetings. Blarer intends to forward the two letters to Haller and Schuler to Augsburg and Memmingen tomorrow. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] In Konstanz, people are eagerly awaiting [the report] on the diet in Baden [which began on June 20]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest9"> [9] Gabriel Arnold is especially recommended to Bullinger, should he still be in Zurich. Arnold has done a great deal for the church and the pious. Therefore, he and his brother [Christoph] were expelled from the country. They lost their house, possessions, and property. It is thanks to him and his brother that the princes [of Palatinate-Neuburg], Count Palatine Ottheinrich and Duke Philipp the Contentious, turned to the Gospel and the bailiffs agreed to take over the debts and interest of their princes to be allowed to keep the Gospel. Arnold long held the office of treasurer for the two princes. Had they followed his advice, they would not be so bitterly poor today. Arnold was [in 1539] in Augsburg at the same time as Blarer, where he inspired everyone. Blarer would have given him a letter of recommendation, but when he met him early in the morning shortly before the sermon, Arnold was not yet sure if he would really leave. But then he was already gone. Bullinger will naturally have received him in a Christian manner even without Blarer's letter of recommendation. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest10"> [10] Greetings, also to the entire household. </p>

      <p>S. This good man, Georg Seemann from Ermatingen, a priest of the church, has earnestly requested, not so much by himself as through others, that he be recommended to you through my favor, so that the fruits of this recommendation might also return to his son Maximilian, in such a way that he might be received into the college of poor students there. I could not refuse such an honorable request, especially since I know that he is entirely committed to dedicating his son to the ministry of the church from a young age. If it is not against your laws that others besides your own people feel this ecclesiastical beneficence, I beseech and implore you again and again, that if you can do anything here (and you can do much), you strongly support these efforts, which are not unworthy of a good parent. For I believe that whatever office and generosity is extended to him is not placed in an unworthy person. The boy is known to me only by face and a brief greeting. I have learned from the testimony of many good people over many years that the father is a man who is not counted among the common pastors of the churches of Christ, whether you consider the piety of his life or his sound doctrine. If you think it would be beneficial for him that I write to either the principals of that college or rather to your council, I would be easily persuaded to do so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Marcellus Theodorichus praises your faithfulness and willingness to serve him beyond measure, and he will always be grateful to you wherever possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding our Schöner's case, I agree with your opinion and the proposal you sent. However, I think it is enough if we write to him. It would be better if we not only wrote to the senate but also sent letters to some private individuals, especially to the consuls Welser and Herrbrot. For I have no doubt that Lętus will do his duty. If you agree, send your letters with the first messenger, so that they can be sent to Augsburg together with mine as soon as possible. May the Lord, in whose hand are the hearts of kings and magistrates, show us the successful outcome of our pious efforts with His spirit, so that the good old man may spend the rest of his life with some comfort and soon sing with Simeon: "Now let your servant depart, Lord," etc. Greet him with my words as accurately and lovingly as you can, for I cannot respond to his letters now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What you write about the Englishman, we have also received from others elsewhere, including the Palatine treasurer Gabriel Arnold, who is now, unless I am mistaken, with you. Among other things, he solemnly affirmed to me that the young man, almost still a boy, when he was about to be inaugurated as king and saw the crown and scepter before him, said with great gravity: "But where among these is the Holy Bible?" And he did not cease to ask until it was brought to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now a similar zeal for the divine law is being written to me about the new and [...] king of Poland. For yesterday the excellent Bufler wrote: "Hans Gutteter has now come from Poland and Bohemia, and he reports how the young king has very earnestly accepted the word of God. And he has it preached purely and clearly in Lithuania, where he then rules. It greatly displeases the priests, because more than half of Lithuania and Poland are governed by the priests."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>He also reports how the king, with the hussars and other troops, up to 4000 strong, is lying at Littewirs, 9 small miles from Prague. And he intends shortly to break the alliance that the Bohemians have made and punish some leaders, which greatly frightens the Bohemians. And it is to be feared that it might lead to a great uprising, etc. This is from Buffler.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The young man has now returned your letters to me, addressed to Gervasius and Haller, from whom I also received your little letter to me. You need not be concerned about the lame Claude, as the letters could not be delivered. This will be done at another opportunity. Your cousin expresses great thanks for your kind humanity and instructs me to send you his warmest greetings. I hope to send the two remaining letters tomorrow: one to Augsburg, the other to Memmingen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We are eagerly awaiting what your diet will bring us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I commend to you, as diligently as I can, that excellent man Gabriel Arnold, if he is still there with you, since his merits for the saints and the church of Christ are great - for which he is also in exile with his brother, having lost all their goods and their houses completely destroyed, especially because he was the author and helper with his brother, so that their princes would receive the Gospel and so that the provincials (to retain it) would take on the debts and interests accumulated by the princes. He held the treasurership of his princes, Lord Otto and Philipp, for a long time, but in such a way that, if they had acquiesced to his advice, they would not only not be in this poverty now, but among the wealthiest princes. He was with me in previous years in Augsburg, where the virtues of the man wonderfully moved all good people. I would have given him letters of recommendation to you, if he had not doubted his departure when he met me early in the morning before the sermon. But then he left with a firm decision without waiting for my letters. However, I know that you, with your observance of the saints, have nevertheless received him in Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Farewell. From Konstanz, 2nd day before the calends of July 1547. May your household be greeted with all who love us in the Lord.</p>
