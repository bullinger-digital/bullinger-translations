    <p xml:id="regest1">[Abbot Diethelm Blarer] of St. Gallen, who was in Zürich together with envoys from [Lucerne] and [Schwyz] to reverse the redemption of Toggenburg, was treated correctly but without any goodwill; he did not receive a definitive answer from the council. Zürich and Basel are advocating to keep themselves free from foreign lords; if this does not bear fruit, Zürich will have to be cautious. The proponents of a concord with Luther have indeed raised reservations [during the negotiations in Wittenberg], but have conceded on the matter. Bucer has reworked his explanations on the Lord's Supper in the Gospel commentary and sent it to [the printer] Herwagen. Ends, as [Hans] Widenhuber urges and the sermon hour approaches.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>What the monk from St. Gallen presented before the four places is not hidden from you. He desires to annul the purchase that the Toggenburgers made. With us, he is not worth much. However, since the envoys from the two places are with him, people have been appointed to them and have given them wine, led them to and in the council, but have not taken them anywhere else, nor offered them any special company. My lord Röist was assigned to him; but he never wanted to be with him, as he bears little goodwill towards him and his clerical servants. He has not received any definitive answer, as others will also be heard who are involved in the matter. With such an attached (qualified) answer, they have dismissed him. The monk is well-fed, fat, and strong. Note well, St. Benedict's rule does not harm him.</p>
      <p>By God's grace, there is no wavering in faith among us. The proposal of my lords from Zürich and Basel is the same, concerning wars, alliances, and pensions, which they understand well and can assess what will come of it. But if everyone runs to war and entangles themselves in alliances and the favor of princes, they will have better opportunities over time to also prepare themselves, if no warning or plea helps. I hope to God that this will not happen to the detriment of faith.</p>
      <p>I see that the leaders and advisors of this concord are deceived in their hope. They swore by Luther's words, who demanded a retraction from us. They subscribed, however, they refused the revocation; but nevertheless, they joined in communion with them.</p>
      <p>Bucer has retracted what he once wrote about the Eucharist in the four Gospels. He sent it to Basel to Herwagen.</p>
      <p>I could not write more as Widenhuber is hurrying and the sermon hour is approaching.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed man.</p>
      <p>July 22, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, the most prudent councilor of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
