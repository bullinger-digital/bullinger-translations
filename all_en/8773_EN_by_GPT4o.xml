      <p>Greetings. You excuse yourself, brother, and ask for forgiveness for having written me lengthy letters.</p>
      <p>However, I thank you greatly for this, and to briefly say what I feel about this so varied, arduous, and perilous matter: I thank our God, who directs you and your fellow ministers with His spirit, so that you do not fall into imprudence or break under fear, and who also moves the hearts of the magistrates towards better things. I truly acknowledge that your labors and dangers are serious. But since you experience the presence of God and His present help, these should console and encourage you towards constancy: you see the fruits corresponding to the labor. I am not the one who can call you away from there to us and give you a place here worthy of your labors, diligence, and faith. I certainly know that the Lord, the most generous rewarder of all good things, will never fail you or your children, and there is no place in the church of God that does not have its inconveniences, and also dangers; we must endure and overcome with patience while we live here. As for the advice you seek from me in the matter you know, I suggest this counsel to you: since for many reasons you cannot (as I understood from your letters) withdraw from the synod, indeed it is beneficial for you to attend, if I were in your place, I would approach the magistrate of Chur and fully explain the matter to him: "I had to go to the synod; meanwhile, I am warned by friends to beware for myself; there are those who have said they would either stab me or shoot me with a bullet. Now, I do not want to attempt anything without your knowledge, lest it be later objected to me: 'If your affairs were such and you foresaw that, why did you not also use our counsel and help?' Therefore, I am here and ask for your advice and, if indeed I must go, whether you would like to assign someone from your own to accompany me, etc. For I will not abandon my duty or the good of the church for any cause of fear" etc. But you yourself would propose these things more suitably. I send you two booklets poured out rather than written in these days and deliberately set forth in few words (containing much, I think). I could not send more copies now.</p>
      <p>You will greet the honorable consuls, Campell, Gregor, Pontisella, Bonet, and all other friends in order. Farewell eternally together with your wife and children.</p>
      <p>May the Lord free and protect you from absurd men and strengthen you with His principal spirit!</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 12, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our Aernius, who dines with me today, sends you his most friendly greetings.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
