    <p xml:id="regest1">Review of [Johannes] Stumpf's [writing on] Thurgau. He too would have preferred if the "Speculum Osiandri" had not been published, but since Osiander does not cease to revile the dead, Bullinger sees in the attack on him God's righteous judgment, even though Christians should actually overcome evil with good. The raids of the Turks are deserved punishment for sins, while the [Christian] princes are at war with each other. In the second letter, Vadian writes that it would have been better for Osiander's reputation if he had not published his "Coniecturae"; contrary to Christian teaching, it predicts the end of the world in 1688, although according to the words of Christ and Paul, the day and hour are not known. The style of the book corresponds to that of Osiander's "Harmonia [evangelica", Basel 1537], while his letter to Zwingli [Z IX 232-276, No. 659; Osiander GA II 537-578, No. 90] is more like [Willibald] Pirckheimer's book against Oekolampad [VD 16 P 2915, 2916 or 2917]; the author has probably adorned himself with borrowed plumes. Bullinger sends a letter indicating the whereabouts of [Johannes] Cochläus [No. 1946]; Cochläus is said to have fared like Uzzah [2 Sam 6:6-8] at the Corpus Christi procession [June 12, 1544], as he seemed to perish under the weight of the Host, as [Martin] Frecht reports [above No. 1970, 11f] - Vadian should let Frecht know that Bullinger has done him the service of friendship -; the story of Albert Hardenberg [see No. 1972] will please Vadian; he should return the letters promptly. Bullinger can also send him a copy of his letter to [Johannes Reekamp, Abbot of] Aduard [No. 1934]; he does not have copies of his letter to Johannes a Lasco [No. 1933] and another letter [to the same], which he sent to Friesland through [Christoph] Froschauer. Greetings to Kessler.</p>

      <p>S. D. In these days I received letters from you, most esteemed Vadian (Joachim von Watt). In the former, you discuss Thurgau and promise us your assistance; our most delightful and courteous friend, Mr. Kessler, also promises the same. May the Lord repay you, since we are unable to respond to your merits and benefits. I too wish that the "Speculum Osiandri" had neither been composed nor published. However, since he does not cease to revile the dead and tear apart their corpses, I believe it is by God's judgment that he hears what he does not wish to, having said what he wished. Although Christians ought to overcome evil with good, in such an age and among such people, there must indeed be many stumbling blocks; but woe to those by whose fault and work these stumbling blocks are placed. What shall I say about the Turkish raids? Our sins deserve these and far graver things. Meanwhile, our princes weary and destroy each other with mutual swords. In your latter letters, you write about Osiander's "Conjectures," which, had they not been published, would have held him in higher esteem among the piously learned and the learnedly pious. He asserts that the Lord said no one can pronounce the day and hour, but that this does not apply to the last year of things and the end of the world; therefore, he defines and sets the year of the Lord 1688 as the end, against all antiquity, against the church, and against Christian and apostolic doctrine. For in Mark, the Lord explicitly said: "Of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father," and the apostle Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5 interprets "day and hour" as "times" or "time," saying "περὶ δὲ τῶν χρόνων" ("concerning the times") etc. But we set these things aside. As far as I can judge, I believe the style he uses in this last book does not differ much from that used in the "Harmonia," but the style of the letter written to Zwingli differs from both; furthermore, it matches the little book that Pirckheimer wrote against Oecolampadius, so I plainly think that he once adorned himself with borrowed plumes. But let him be. Here I send you letters sent to me in recent days. From them, you will understand where Cochläus is, about whom Frecht writes that he was considered dead for a while after being carried away from the procession in which the papists are accustomed to carry around the impanated god on the feast of Corpus Christi; he bore such a heavy burden, having carried the creator of the world in bread. Thus, he almost exhibited the spectacle of Uzzah to the foolish people. From others, you will understand the marvelous works of God in his saints. You will derive not a little benefit and pleasure from the story of Albert Hardenberg. However, please return them in good faith by the next messenger. If you wish to see what I wrote to the abbey of Aduard in Great Friesland, I will send a copy. I did not care to have copied what I gave to the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco. Indeed, I have now sent many more and more copious letters to Friesland through Froschauer, which I could not have copied, etc. Farewell. Zurich, September 5, 1544. May Kessler be well.</p>
      <p>H(einrich) Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Joachim Vadian (Joachim von Watt), most worthy consul of St. Gallen, his ever-esteemed lord.</p>
