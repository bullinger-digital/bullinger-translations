      <p>Greetings, my highly esteemed and dearest Bullinger. On the day before the calends of September, we arrived here very happily and found everything auspicious with favorable divine will, and so far we are enjoying great convenience, so that we may give the greatest thanks to the Lord, who has not rejected our ministry in this not regrettable church here, which I wish (for I desire it uniquely) I may be able to prove to Him! However, this will be more successful, the more diligently your prayers to God on my behalf assist me, which I implore and beseech you not to deny me as much as I can. For that lavish hospitality you recently extended to me and mine, I do not hope that I can ever return worthy thanks; however, I will ensure that you never find anything lacking in my most grateful heart.</p>
      <p>I have nothing at all new to write to you, nor have I received any letters from anyone during all this time that I have been here. I am anxiously expecting what will be written from Augsburg, as some of our merchants returning from the Zurzach fair firmly assert that all the preachers have been expelled from Augsburg. If this is true, and thus the bloody efforts of the Council of Trent are now swelling, it will indeed be over for all of us. But He still lives and conquers, and will triumph mightily over the world and its prince, that prince of shepherds, Christ, to whose glory, with Him giving us courage, we will devote our affairs, life, and all things.</p>
      <p>What you recently reminded me of will never fall from my mind, the more it grieved me that you were not content to have done it once, but also the next day, after that sumptuous lunch of brothers and friends, you accompanied me to the lodging, having called our Gwalther as a witness to do the same; for this repetition seemed to be a kind of grave doubt about my sincere devotion and love towards you and your church, which I will indeed strive to uproot from your minds to the very roots.</p>
      <p>But I cannot add anything to these, since the good Maurice here, our fellow member and the director of the school here, is almost snatching the letter from my hands, hastening his departure. I commend to you, as much as I can, this pious and learned young man, and I earnestly ask you to write something to me through him upon his return. Funck respectfully greets you and commends himself to you. My little wife bids me to write greetings to you and your wife. They affirm that the French, aided by some unknown treacheries, have occupied a certain very fortified town of the Emperor in the Piedmont region. Farewell, my soul, and love me truly with the bowels of charity, with all suspicion set aside, as you have hitherto been accustomed. Again and again, farewell. 16th of September, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
