      <p>Most illustrious man, today I received a letter from you dated the 15th of this month. I have little to respond to it, since I recently sent Aurelius to you, laden with letters. I gave Charles de Moulin his; he will reply, I suppose. The writings, which you say you have not received, I greatly fear may have been lost. A Rhaetian boy here, recommended to me by friends, was seeking a position; since none appeared, I sent him back after supporting him for several days, not without some provision. I had given him to deliver to Mr. Baionensis, who, after reading them, would send them to you; but I will inquire, if I know, where they have ended up.</p>
      <p>I am also distressed that in your latest letters you make no mention of those I wrote to you from Augsburg and sent to Schaffhausen to Rugger. May God turn it to good; I will also have to inquire about these somewhere, I know not where. I beg you, ensure that those I send to Baionensis are immediately given to the host at the Crown; inside are letters to the brothers in Italy, and they are of no small importance. Farewell and greetings to all the brothers; pray for me.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, April 21, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
