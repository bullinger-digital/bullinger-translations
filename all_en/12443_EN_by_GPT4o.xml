      <p>Grace and peace. Your Metzler, dearest Ambrosius, returns to you with our good grace. For he conducted himself among us in such a way that we are going to praise him and always consider him as one of our own, even if he has not returned. If he returns, we will gladly receive him again. We hope that he will be of considerable benefit to the church someday, especially if he continues to enrich and enhance his talents through constant and uninterrupted study. Therefore, we commend him to you, to your father, and to all good people. May the Lord Jesus keep both you and him safe for a long time.</p>
