    <p xml:id="regest1">Why does Lavater ask again [in a letter not preserved] a question that his father [Hans Rudolf] and Bullinger had already discussed with him before he left Zurich? Bullinger has now consulted with Ludwig's father again on this matter. He absolutely does not want his son to abandon the religion he has been taught. Furthermore, he wants him to receive a different pension if the current provider [Johannes Marbach] does not desist from his plan. Finally, he asked Bullinger to advise Ludwig [once more].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The people of Strasbourg teach that in the Lord's Supper both faith and the true body of Christ are offered, and that participants who do not believe in it "eat" their condemnation [1 Cor 11:29]. How then could Bullinger recommend Lavater to participate in the Lord's Supper? Moreover, the body of Christ is at the right hand of God and is present in the meal sacramentally and spiritually, as already stated in the response of the people of Zurich to Luther. Therefore, Lavater should ask the people of Strasbourg not to force him to participate, especially since they teach that those who, like him (and in accordance with the teaching of their church), do not believe in the offering of the true body of Christ, would be condemned by their participation in the Lord's Supper. However, he should assure the people of Strasbourg that he does not despise their teaching and is well aware that it is not his place to dispute with them about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- This was already explained to Lavater before his departure. That he now raises the question again is surprising! Bullinger told him at that time what Joachim Forrer from Winterthur experienced in Strasbourg, and how he refused to participate in the Lord's Supper, but otherwise associated with the people of Strasbourg. He also informed him about the assurance given by [Petrus] Dasypodius that the students from Zurich would not be forced to participate in the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger would not advise against participation in the Lord's Supper if the people of Strasbourg did not emphasize their belief so strongly and reject the notion of a memorial meal. Because of this insistence, it is not possible for those who think differently to participate in their Lord's Supper without pretending to believe the same as the people of Strasbourg. Yet, any hypocrisy is forbidden, especially in the sacraments. Lavater will now understand how he should behave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He will also know what to do in the case of any other differing points of doctrine (of which Bullinger is not yet aware). However, he should always behave moderately.</p>

      <p>Now, regarding what you want me to respond to, I do not see why I should be greatly concerned, unless you have not understood or have forgotten those things which both your father and I instructed you upon your departure. As for the Lord's Supper, I have again conferred with your father. He absolutely wants you to return imbued with the same religion with which you were instructed when you left, especially concerning the Lord's Supper. He also instructs you to change your lodging (unless your host desists from his plan) and to seek another suitable host, and I truly advise you on what to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If they teach, as I hear they do, to convey true faith and to believe that the Lord's body is really offered in the Supper to those who partake, and in an ineffable manner, if they add, as I hear they do, that those who do not approach with this faith eat judgment upon themselves, how, I ask, can I be an authority for you in this judgment? For I do not believe that you feel and believe that Christ's body is really offered in the Supper. Our church does not believe this, nor does Scripture teach it to be believed. But this is to be believed: that Christ's body is a true body and remains in glory and is indeed really at the right hand of the Father, sacramentally and spiritually in the Supper; concerning which there is no need to institute a new dispute. You know what we have answered to Luther. Therefore, I would say: "I pray, gentlemen, that you allow me to enjoy and live by my faith thus far, and do not urge me to those things by which my conscience is burdened. You say that he eats judgment who does not believe that Christ's body is really offered in the Lord's Supper. This I cannot believe for many reasons, especially since I feel, as the Zurich church teaches, and as it confessed against Luther. Therefore, do not impose this burden on me. I do not despise your church. Again, I am not one who wishes or ought to confer or dispute with you," and the rest, which you can add yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I said these and similar things to you upon your departure. I am surprised, therefore, why you repeat the question. I told you what happened to Joachim Forrer from Winterthur and how he also did not wish to participate in this matter, but did not withdraw from their communion in other respects. I told you what I requested from Mr. Dasypodius, namely that he should not force you to the Supper. He indeed replied that no one is forced.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Nor would I think it necessary to abstain from their Supper, unless they so accurately pressed this article that Christ is really, that is, the very body of Christ is present, and made this article the principal matter in the business of the Supper, while Christ says: "Do this in remembrance of me," and when we do not wish to approach the Supper. We do not wish to approach not because of a minor doctrinal disagreement or because we entirely disagree with them in the whole religion, but because of that article, which they press against the articles of faith and against the nature of the commemorative Supper, and make the Supper less agreeable to us, so that we cannot approach unless we are willing to pretend to enjoy what we do not believe inwardly. You know, however, that hypocrisy should be absent from Christians, especially in mysteries. You understand well enough how to conduct yourself in this matter, so that they understand that you are not separating from the church by any fault of your own, but rather because of the fault of the doctrine and the article, which they newly introduce into the Supper; otherwise, you agree with the church in other respects.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Meanwhile, I do not command you to agree with doctrines if they also have others contrary to sound doctrine, which I do not yet know. I believe you understand what needs to be done. However, you will do everything with modesty.</p>
