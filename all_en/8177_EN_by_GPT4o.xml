      <p>Greetings. Our courier set out on his journey later than promised. Meanwhile, I received a letter from my brother, who is in Lausanne, written on February 4th, in which he writes that the plague has ceased there and that this news is being consistently spread everywhere. He humbly requests to be sent to Heidelberg, if it seems convenient to you, reverend father, and to the other heads of the school, etc.</p>
      <p>Bellieurius returned on February 6th very quickly by arranged horses; it is still unknown what his unexpected and unforeseen arrival brings. Tugginerus wrote from the royal camp on January 23rd that peace is almost concluded, which is most desired by both parties, and he hopes that they will want to be at home with their families by the upcoming Easter. He also promises to bring the belongings left behind by the deceased Beatus Wilhelm Bonsteter to Zurich for the heirs. A certain Subsylvanus named Aerni Am Sto√ü, a leader of the musketeers, killed the noble Granvylerius in the previous conflict, and took from the dead man a signet ring along with another ring, which has something made from unicorn horn embedded in it; he wants to give the signet ring to the heir, the son, to be redeemed through the intercession of Tugginerus, who was asked for this by our superior, while he wants to keep the other unicorn ring for himself. I read this from Tugginerus's own handwriting, after I had already sealed the previous letters; I also wanted to quickly write this to you, even though it is not of great importance.</p>
      <p>In Biel/Bienne, February 16th, the year as above.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Vinslerus.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>At the Great Minster, Zurich.</p>
