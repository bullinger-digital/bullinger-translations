      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The brothers have gathered and deliberated on the matter proposed by Mr. Beza. However, what he and his followers thought should be done could not be agreed upon. For who would subject themselves to the emperor as much as they wish? Or why should we immerse ourselves again in those matters from which, by the Lord's goodness, we have barely emerged? Those colloquies have turned out very badly not only for us but for all churches. Experience speaks; there is no need for more extensive demonstration. For you rightly mentioned the last one at Maulbronn. Not that we reject all colloquies, but with those people who are determined to win in all their opinions, unwilling to yield even a hair's breadth to the enthusiasts. Why then should we tempt the Lord? Thus, the response to Mr. Beza is: We will never fail the French churches, as long as we can help them. However, it does not seem that they should be helped through colloquies with the Lutherans. The matter itself speaks to this. Nor do we wish to throw ourselves into those dangers. But if we understand that we will have brothers agreeing on this matter, then we will gladly consider issuing some simple common confession, provided this can also be done with the good grace of our magistrate, who is also no small part of the church. It seems most convenient here that a new confession is not believed, but rather an old one, once issued, is renewed. Such as the one that seems to be in the second part of the work against Luther, published in our response, if the offensive parts written against Luther and the name of Luther are first removed. Therefore, it should be published with a simple exposition, or another similar one should be published. However, it should not be published until the Palatine prince has been consulted. Therefore, a preface and protestation should be added, as we have understood to be necessary from him. Then again, it should be discussed with the magistrate and other brothers and churches of the Rhaetians, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Biel, Mulhouse, etc., so that their consent is also obtained. And so that all these things are attempted prudently with the fear of God, not hastily, but maturely, and not spread among the public until everything has been completed. Then also a consultation can be made about Basel, so that we do not have that church against us, or at least, so that some who are more favorable to our enemies than is proper do not disturb a good matter. This is the summary of our consultation. In the meantime, we await Beza's response to these matters. Farewell well.</p>
