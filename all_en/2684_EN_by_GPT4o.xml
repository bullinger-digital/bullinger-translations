      <p>Greetings and best wishes. The reason, most illustrious man, that you rarely receive my letters is that, as I have often mentioned before, I am hindered by an innate rustic modesty, and I am ashamed to interrupt your most honorable affairs with my inept and untimely letters. Moreover, what I heard from others was mostly either entirely uncertain or plainly false. I would have written long ago about the diet (assembly), which provided sufficient material for writing; but since something certain was expected daily, I did not want to burden your most learned ears with uncertainties, lest I become a burden with things that are unclear and unknown, which I have heard but not read. The longer I wait, the more the matters discussed seem to vanish into nothing, far from achieving the hoped-for outcome. For so far, as you know, the end of the diet has been delayed by disputes, especially because the electors and allies of the Augsburg Confession wanted to allow those who are secular and shaven (clergy) the freedom to defect from papal idolatry to the sound doctrine of the Gospel without losing their ministry; this the adversaries did not want. Furthermore, the allies of the Confession contended that no one in the empire should be proscribed by the Emperor and the royal majesty without consulting the holy electors. But when the king noticed that the article of religion was being considered and brought to an end far differently than expected, he urged that they decide on public peace and bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>As for religion and the judgment of the chamber, they could be deferred to future diets, and therefore nothing should be pronounced about them at this time. The bishops and some, though few, princes are of the same opinion. The six electors and allies of the Confession do not want to decide anything about common peace unless the discussion of religion is first brought to an end. There is a long-standing dispute on both sides about these matters. The king sends three envoys to the six electors to inform them of the obstinacy of their envoys and how they plainly do not want to concede anything. Furthermore, since the Emperor's majesty could not be present at the diet, matters that have been discussed in religion should be postponed to another more convenient time, namely the future March, and should not be considered valid (for it seems to the Dauphin, the papal legate, that the king and bishops have conceded too much); but the discussion should be started anew in future diets.</p>
      <p>As for the reason for postponing the diet to another time, he adds this cause, which he has hitherto concealed: the Turk has made an incursion into Hungary, and he cannot be absent from his own for long. To which the electors gave no response to the envoys, but promised to respond in writing to the royal majesty through the envoys. It is known that the Duke of Saxony responded in this manner: the king should remember his duty, lest he rashly rescind his own promises; why does he not consider how contrary it is to the concord and pacification of Passau to abandon what has been initiated and prolonged to this day and this diet, having consumed and expended so much time and expense, and how much it would detract from his authority and bring great disgrace to depart with the matter unfinished; does he think anyone would leave their seats uncertain whether to bring aid to enemies or friends, to wage war against the Turk to their own ruin or salvation. Nor should the article on religion be suspended and that on peace be concluded, since this public peace is established. Finally, what the envoys have done so far was done by his command, indeed less was conceded in his presence. This duke has set an example for others; others will undoubtedly follow. Meanwhile, you can clearly perceive and understand what the devil's minions are plotting from this abundance, as they call it. They have secretly tried to persuade the king with these frivolous arguments, which at first glance seem to present an appearance of integrity. The king has already been persuaded and is of the same opinion; but these are added as supports; for they fear that it might collapse. It was intended to secretly support the king with these. However, it became known to all through the secretary of this doctor communicating it to his colleague. All these things partly from my lord, who would have written himself if he had not had to go elsewhere at the very moment when the courier happened to be available. He therefore ordered me to convey many greetings to you and to Mr. Gessner and your other colleagues, and you will learn more certain things from him in the future, partly from the Saxon envoys. It is also reported that the Imperial and French forces have engaged in a naval battle and that more than seven ships on the French side have been lost, and five on the other side, that the queen of England is not pregnant, but that the deception has been revealed. Mr. Schenckius also greets you, who ordered me to offer you his services.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask your kindness to add this one thing to the many benefits you have bestowed upon me, to remember my brother, so that, if possible, he might be accepted into your stipend. We are already wholly devoted to you; I can promise nothing else but that we will earnestly pray to the best and greatest God to recompense your kindness for both past and future in perpetuity. Farewell, most learned man, and keep me commended to you. May your most honorable wife and the whole family be safe. I would wish for your Rudolf to compete with me in letters, although I know I am inferior; yet I would dare to write to him more confidently about everything that happens here than to you; but since I do not know if it would be pleasing to him, I would ask, if it could be done without inconvenience, to communicate it to him. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Maximilian Seemann. Letters have reached us from Hungary, in which were enclosed letters to you from Mr. Feierthei; I send these to you enclosed with mine. The one who delivered them was an intimate friend of Mr. Feierthei; he spoke many good things about that gentleman, and that he had completely bid farewell to life and had married a wife, with whom he lived most honorably and Christianly, and many other things, which I do not doubt he himself has informed you. Behold, most learned man, how I confuse everything; attribute it to haste; for the courier was in such a hurry to depart that I could scarcely remember what was to be written, let alone write everything in order.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you to consider it kindly, again and again. To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich, to be pursued with the highest respect as lord and patron. In Zürich.</p>
