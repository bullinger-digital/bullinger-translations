      <p>Greetings. The assembly of princes in Frankfurt has concluded, in which a peaceful agreement was reached between the Duke of Hesse (Cattorum) and the Prince of Nassau; you know they were in a serious dispute over the County of Katzenelnbogen (Melibocensem). Then, there was a deliberation on the harmonious agreement of the articles of Christian doctrine, which should be pressed against the Papists in the colloquy at Worms. There was also a proposal for deliberation on ecclesiastical censure (I fear they might attempt more than they can achieve) to be established for all orders. They also discussed somewhat about the rites of the churches.</p>
      <p>I would prefer them to be free for the benefit of the churches rather than all churches being bound, even to their own detriment, to the rites of any one church. I know they must be in clear agreement on explicit matters; but in the meantime, there are many things that are free, so that you do not bind them without harm. Furthermore, there was discussion about suppressing infamous pamphlets and harsher writings flying around here and there. I wish that under this pretext, good, wholesome, and useful books are not also banned! Otherwise, who would not wish for the removal of bitter and infamous pamphlets from the midst? The Saxons did not attend this assembly.</p>
      <p>These matters were therefore sent to them, so that they too, if they wish (perhaps they will not be very willing), may subscribe. The princes also indicated to their learned men and ministers to arrange their affairs so that they may appear in Worms at the beginning of August and first confer and consult among themselves, then meet in colloquy with the adversaries. These things are certain.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I hear that the Roman King will not be present at the colloquy for the agreements, but has entrusted his duties to the Bishop of Speyer.</p>
      <p>It is said that both the Elector of Saxony (Saxo augustus) and the Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg, who were appointed as assessors for the colloquy, will also not be present, but will send delegates to act on their behalf. I do not yet see what good I should hope for from this colloquy, especially with the minds of the colloquy deputies so scattered. - The Queen of England declared war on the King of France through a herald on June 9, I believe at Reims. It is certain that a herald was sent to declare war and the king accepted it magnanimously.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is written from Antwerp that the queen is quite disturbed by some seditious people, so that she cannot yet lead an army against the King of France in favor of King Philip, which she would otherwise desire. It is also written to me that the Livonian War has rekindled and that the Prussians and Poles, with their forces joined, are vigorously attacking the Livonians. It is said that an army is being recruited in Germany to be led into Hungary.</p>
      <p>Thus you see everything burning with war and rumors of war. - In Baden, the assemblies are being held by the Franco-Swiss, that is, the French.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that they are divided in their votes, while some yield or permit soldiers to the king, others deny it, etc. The assemblies are not yet finished, so we have something certain, etc.</p>
      <p>I now wish to hear from you what has been done in your assemblies, what is happening in Italy by the armies acting in Piedmont and on the border of Naples. So far, I have shared what I have received from friends.</p>
      <p>You will share these common matters with your consuls, with Mr. Gallicius, whom you will greet, and Pontasella, then send to Mr. Friedrich von Salis-Samedan or to his father-in-law Mr. Johann Travers von Zuoz, whom you will greet diligently. Due to private matters, I was not able to write to them; his son Johann Travers von Salis is well. Live and farewell to you too with your family and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 6, in the year of our Lord 1557.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, esteemed and beloved lord, godfather, and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
