      <p>Greetings. I could not refrain, most learned man, from writing to you when this man and a certain messenger of a friend offered themselves; but what should I write? The deplorable state of the church and this torn and afflicted bride of Christ from all sides? Would that it might happen someday to see the former state of the church, would that I might someday behold that primitive purity. By Hercules, nothing more blessed would ever happen to me, nothing sweeter and more delightful, and nothing more pleasant. Why, I ask, is such φιλονεικια (contentiousness) fostered on both sides?</p>
      <p>Indeed, the serpent is nurtured in its own bosom. I said the same to Brenz and the followers of Brenz; but immediately I was proclaimed everywhere as a Zwinglian, even at the court of the prince. As much as I owe to Zwingli, as much also to Luther and to you and similar dearest fathers and friends, whose writings rescued me from that Babylonian pit, God himself is my witness. Furthermore, it is right to complain, indeed to beseech God himself from heaven, for I mourn sincerely and celebrate a grief not unlike the lamentations of the prophets, that the members of Christ are afflicted everywhere with such cruel malice, the unity of the church is torn apart for trivial and no causes. You, Bullinger, have accomplished much, whose writings I always hold in high esteem, in the same way as those of the most learned Martyr, the most renowned and gentle disputant, of my most skilled father Bibliander, of my most friendly brother Gwalther, of the most loving Ochino, of the most eloquent Calvin, of the pious and upright Viret, of Philipp, my most candid teacher, of the most serious Caelius, of the most profound Borrhaus, of the most sincere Sulcer, and of similar writers I have always cherished and felt reverently about them, nor have I ever despised Brenz or Illyricus, who have demanded this one thing, if ever we can strive for and reconcile the dissenters. But, as I see, in vain, we waste oil and effort, whatever we contribute to this matter, nor do I see any other cause except the one φιλονεικιαν (contentiousness), partly also φιλαυτιαν (self-love), which, as the apostle testifies everywhere, leads its imitators to hell.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be imitators and followers of Christ and the apostles, I beseech you, and of Paul and Barnabas with the others, investigate the controversy undertaken and do not disturb the church of God for slight or no causes. Then it will happen that no one will regret their actions.</p>
      <p>These things arise from no other source than συμπαθεια (sympathy); for I love and revere you as fathers, but I admonish as one most desirous of the salvation of all, and I wish the same not only for you but for all. For I see that one clings too much to the signified, the other to the sign, neither notices the relation of the sign and the signified or very obscurely, and hence there is such a variety of opinion and sectarian multitude. But let this suffice for the present, written out of my love for you.</p>
      <p>I pray for peace and tranquility for you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, you and all the faithful of Christ. Given in Tübingen, March 11, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Skalichius on my own behalf.</p>
      <p>Greet Gisner and the other named men in my name, I beg again and again.</p>
      <p>To his most reverend and pious friend Heinrich Bullinger, as to a dearest father, to his own hands. In the absence of Bullinger, to Martyr, Bibliander... Gwalther.</p>
