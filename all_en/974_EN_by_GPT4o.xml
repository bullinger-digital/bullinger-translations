      <p>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>That you received our letters a little later, dearest brothers in the Lord, was not done so much by our will as by necessity: since our classis (assembly) is divided into three colloquies (meetings) which only convene on fixed days, it is inevitable that a longer interval of time is often spent in sending letters back and forth, so that they may be approved by the votes of individual brothers, than we would like. We are truly grateful to you for having deigned to spare us some time, despite being occupied with many serious matters. For although we did not obtain all that we hoped for, namely that our cause, once known, would either gain something more equitable from our brothers, or at least that a specific response would be given to those things which compelled us to undertake this matter, nevertheless, that exhortation to concord and peace which you judged should be applied to both of us was wonderfully pleasing and delightful to us.</p>
      <p>And we will strive to follow and embrace it willingly. Indeed, we are not conscious of having committed anything in this matter that should have alienated our brothers from us. For we have advocated not our own cause but that of the church, and (unless we are mistaken) so moderately that they could easily understand what kind of conscience we brought to this matter. There are, we admit, some harsh things scattered in the letters: yet we seem to have tempered them in such a way that we do not quite know what they could justly complain about.</p>
      <p>Regarding the cause itself, we thought it necessary to write to you again, not to abuse your leisure, which you indicate is very little and we already knew: but to respond to certain things, which either due to our obscurity you do not seem to have fully understood, or we also (being too slow) could not fully understand from your letters.</p>
      <p>For firstly, it is one thing not to have impeded a senate decree than to have advised it.</p>
      <p>We not only say that our brothers advised it, but also added that harsh threat, but it can be proven by the reading of the mandate itself.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this matter was neither so small that we should not have been moved, nor so negligible that nothing should have been answered to it.</p>
      <p>But let us bury these things in perpetual oblivion. However, what you think, according to the opinion of Saint Paul, that colloquies have been restored to us, is precisely what we would like to agree upon among ourselves. For no one can or should be a better judge of this cause than the spirit of the Lord speaking through the apostle. This is what we strive for, that what Paul grants us is not taken away. Two, he says, or three should speak, the others should judge. But if you interpret this as if the others are ordered to be silent, why does Paul add: But if something is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent, for you can all prophesy one by one? What then? Indeed, because the Corinthians were abusing the gift of prophecy, and often it happened that when the church had gathered, each one would claim for himself according to his own judgment, and interpret some passage of scripture as it occurred to him: which can also be inferred to have been customary in the synagogue from Luke chapter 4, where it is reported that when Christ entered the synagogue, although he was neither a scribe nor a Pharisee, nor co-opted among the teachers of the law by men, the book of Isaiah was handed to him, from which he later interpreted the passage that occurred when the book was opened. Likewise, in Acts 13 where Paul and Barnabas are mentioned as having entered the synagogue. After the reading of the law and the prophets (says Luke) the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them saying: Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it. Therefore, when many in the Corinthian church had transferred this custom to vain ostentation, and great confusion arose from it, almost all the benefit of meeting was lost, Paul orders that only two or three should speak, that is, to treat a certain passage or question in the assembly, and the others should examine according to the norm of scripture, if anything has been said less correctly or omitted by them. In this matter, lest any confusion should arise again, he applied that rule by which the church was protected and its spirit was left free (as was right). For he wanted in that judgment those to speak to whom something had been revealed, that is, to whom the spirit of the Lord suggested something pertinent to the matter being discussed.</p>
      <p>He finally wanted the spirit of prophecy not to be confined to certain men, but to be free for anyone to prophesy in turn, in judging what had been said by two or three: provided that what the spirit of the Lord suggested was brought forth for the edification and love of the church. We consider this to be the genuine opinion of Paul, and you too (unless we misunderstand), most learned Bullinger, seem to hold this view in your commentaries on Paul's epistles. Let us now see, I ask, whether that custom corresponds to Paul's opinion which was recently instituted, or rather that which was abolished. The apostle permits two or three to speak.</p>
      <p>For us, one is enough, and always has been. The others are commanded to judge, and those to whom something is revealed are commanded to bring it forth. What is more equitable than this?</p>
      <p>Therefore, we were once allowed all this, and if anyone brought something either inept, false, or useless, he was admonished: yet it was free for anyone to say what seemed to contribute to the edification of the church and the matter in dispute. Now, however, after one has spoken, two speak in tongues (a gift which, besides being distinct from prophecy, can only be obtained in our colloquy, in which those who teach languages are appointed). Then the whole multitude is dismissed except for the ministers, who discuss among themselves the morals and doctrine of the one who spoke that day. Where is this freedom, which was not taken away by St. Paul but only restrained, so that everything would be referred to charity? Where is that discussion for which the church used to gather? What if the Lord had revealed something to someone from the dismissed crowd? What if someone weak or doubtful or even false heard something, about which he had thought to inquire if it had been allowed? What if there are many to whom it has not been satisfactory? And to understand what the multitude is, we know (having experienced it in reality) that many are hidden in the crowd here who, whether you consider their learning or piety, can teach no less than be taught, and should be preferred to some ministers. But we are also commanded to avoid all occasions of contention. Certainly deservedly, but not therefore as if the spirit of the Lord should be bound. What if those who are now allowed to speak are either unlearned or impious, should silence then also be observed?</p>
      <p>You see, I think, where these things tend: namely, that we desire to have restored to us what the spirit of the Lord granted, that each one may have his own freedom to prophesy in the Lord, provided that everything is done decently and in order, and nothing absurd, useless, impious, or less appropriate is said in judging those things which have been said by the one who spoke, that is, he himself first explained a passage of scripture and proposed it to the others for judgment. This is the right which we complain has been taken from us to the great detriment of our church and which we finally demand to be restored. Previously, no contentions arose in our churches: although we cannot promise that none will arise with the one who was the author of them being separated, we will certainly make every effort to prevent them from arising, and if they emerge against our will, to extinguish them immediately. We cannot better prevent the dissension of judgments than by allowing each one the power to modestly and in place declare his opinion, so that just as fire from the striking of flint, so also from the comparison of reasons, without any contention, the truth may shine forth.</p>
      <p>Since these things are so, we ask you again and again not to think that if we have again endeavored to prove our cause to our brothers in Bern, it is done by us either out of stubbornness or contempt of your authority (which will always be supreme with us, as it should be). God is witness that nothing is thought of here by us, nothing is sought, which does not seem greatly to pertain to the amplification of his glory and dignity. Indeed, concerning this matter, we have decided to act not by writing, as we have done so far, but by sending envoys to our brothers, and to do so so kindly and moderately that we hope they will not hear a single word by which they could justly be offended. For we are attempting either that the cause be approved, or that a response be given to those things which certainly did not rashly throw us into this dispute, in the judgment of which we will not reject the authority of any good and learned person, much less that singular judgment of yours combined with the highest piety. May the God of peace and concord unite and strengthen us all in the Lord Jesus, so that against the certain and imminent assaults of Satan we may fight that noble fight for which the Lord has prepared the most ample reward of immortality from eternity. Farewell.</p>
