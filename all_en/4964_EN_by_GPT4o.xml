      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, for which I am particularly grateful, as you conceal nothing from me of those matters which are newly written by friends, which I never read, even if they are sad, without some notable benefit. This is especially because I hope that I will soon be freed from so many impending and now even pressing evils with greater rejoicing, and I expect the day of my dissolution in this otherwise ripe age for death with more joy. I am sending the letters of our Hoser, who also wrote to me, but nothing entirely new, since there are other matters between us about which we repeatedly write to each other. He indicates, however, that two leading senators have recently died suddenly, then that some contentious preachers from LÃ¼neburg were together and are giving birth to some new monstrosity, about which he wrote to you, hoping that they will be common to you and me; for he had no time left to write the same to me. Therefore, you will write about these things at your next convenience.</p>
      <p>He gave me that supplicatory booklet of the churches of Christ in France presented to the king and now translated into German, which (if I judge correctly) could have been drawn out with a much more suitable and fervent thread; but it is nevertheless pure and simple and perhaps more pathetic and vehement in its own language than when translated into ours. He also sent the history of the persecution of the Neapolitan church, where eighty-eight martyrs of Christ are commemorated, whose necks, not in the usual manner, but whose throats the ingenious tyranny wanted to strike, and indeed those bloody spectacles are miserable, but to pious eyes, since this blood is precious in the eyes of the Lord, they are to be viewed differently and as if praiseworthy, only so much strength is available to happily expand the boundaries of the Christian kingdom. Hoser added a sheet, and this very one also printed, which briefly includes the confession of the ministers of Strasbourg about the eating and presence of the body and blood of Christ, which seems quite modest to me, indeed taken from the temperament of our Bucer; for they disguise and cover all their error and novelty under the mode they call heavenly. The rest, which they plainly admit as true and reject as false, clearly frustrate and overthrow their inexplicable miracle. The rumor of the death of Christoph, the bishop of Constance, after it was reported to the Emperor, soon sent a courier (as they call it) to Constance, who, after finding him indeed lying down but not yet dead, after spending several days there, left again by courier, leaving the bishop in uncertain health. But when, a few hours later, he died as the disease grew violently worse, another courier followed Bolviller without delay, hoping to catch up with him with almost winged speed and to make him certain of the bishop's death, not without notable news, so that now he is also considered to have returned as the indefatigable busybody. The canons, the majority of whom stood by Empser while Christoph was still alive, received him into their college in the past few days, to make room for the vote of episcopal election, so that he too would be a canon. Some of the canons, Mr. von Stein with a few others, opposed, but in vain.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus Christ will easily deal with both him and other such earthworms with the strength of His arm.</p>
      <p>In this, farewell well and eternally with all yours. Commend me diligently to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received what you sent back, written at Neckar or Lech. I can do nothing, because contrary to expectation, the servant of Gessner has already been indicated to me here.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again. September 15, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I am sending to you all that Hoser gave; I ask you greatly to return them.</p>
