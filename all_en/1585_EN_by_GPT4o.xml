      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Although I am not unaware, most esteemed and learned man in every kind of discipline, that you are occupied and distracted by many other and more serious matters, yet your singular love for me and my brother, and likewise our perpetual respect for you, in which I wish all things both honorable and beneficial to happen to you, advises and commands me to express and show some mark of gratitude for the benefit you bestowed upon us last year. No other way has occurred to me, after long consideration and distraction of mind in various directions, by which this could be done, than to address your dignity, with which you are endowed, in some letter, perhaps written with a crude style, but with sincere intent, to testify my grateful mind towards your favor to me. Therefore, know, most excellent and dearest man to me, that I embrace your benefit and all your virtue with such reverence, that I am unable to express adequately, as I ought and as your dignity demands, not only with these my clumsy letters, but not even with words, which is greater, nor with any thought. Therefore, I truly cannot find any proper formula for giving thanks for the divine benefit, unless perhaps you wish this, that I should pray and beseech the best and greatest Lord with the most holy prayers, that He may ensure your dignity, humanity, with which you are endowed, and all your affairs to turn out most prosperously; this, if I understand it to be pleasing to your dignity, I will indeed do and strive in every way, so that you may never perceive me to have been idle or negligent. Now I will make an end of writing and I ask and beseech your love and humanity towards me and my brother, that you may take my letters, written in a humble and imperfect style, in good part and hold us commended to you for your zeal in Christ. Farewell again and again, most excellent man, and continue to love us as you have begun. Oxford, England, on the calends of March in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johannes Conrad von Ulm from Thurgau.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most revered lord.</p>
