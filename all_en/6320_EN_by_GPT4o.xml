      <p>The French envoy detained him.</p>
      <p>[...] for ours could not return due to the force of the storm [...] The French lord has called a meeting at his expense. He is allowed to present his proposal to the communities. The assembly is set for January of the coming year, if I am not mistaken, on the 7th of January, etc.</p>
      <p>The Spanish embassy has not initiated anything before the council, nor made any oral proposal, but instead invited the envoys as guests and handed each of them a document, with a request to bring it home for their communities. Therefore, a council was held the next day, and the Spanish lord was refused to proceed this time; since the French lord is in negotiation, it might cause the parties to come together and unrest to arise; however, they want to otherwise orally inform each of their lords at home of their desires, etc. In summary of the document presented: he extols his king to the stars regarding power and majesty; he seeks firm and serious friendship with the Rhaetians. The consul wanted to give a document, sent for it; but Mr. Tscharner had not yet copied it.</p>
      <p>However, he does not currently request an assembly; he does this solely to greet the communities and report the favorable will of his king; in the meantime, he wants to negotiate further, etc. - It proceeds so shamelessly that it is a disgrace above all disgrace.</p>
      <p>The rumor has spread across the land among the peasantry that the lords, who are lying in Chur, are giving out to each the nearest. There is a great influx; behaving in such a shameless manner that the authorities have enough to defend against, who should rightly be ashamed of such shameless behavior before foreign lords. You have the summary.</p>
      <p>I doubt what the outcome will be; I promise myself nothing good. The plans of that other Frenchman disturb them greatly." Chur, 3rd of December, year 1564.</p>
      <p>My lords of the Three Leagues have warned the Spanish lords about the expenses, so that later, if they do not receive a favorable response, they would not have to complain and might say that they were deprived of what was theirs and nothing was done for it, etc.</p>
