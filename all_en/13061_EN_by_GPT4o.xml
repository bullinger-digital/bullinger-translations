    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A few days ago, Vadian received a letter from friends in Augsburg, which concerned personal matters. However, the letter included Emperor Charles V's proposal, in which he outlined his goals for the Imperial Diet he convened. During the first session of the Diet, Maximilian read the proposal as if he were Calliope herself. The continuation of the Council of Trent is only mentioned in passing in the document. However, it is clear that the Emperor is trying to deprive the Germans of their freedoms and wants to find out whether they, now exhausted and subjugated, will finally be satisfied with the heresies and his conspiracy politics or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In relation to the Imperial Chamber Court, very insidious measures are proposed. The Emperor obviously aims to shape everything according to his wishes in the future. He uses the catastrophic situation caused by the last war to subject the Germans to the will of the Pope and his followers and to make them not only accept every atrocity but even declare it holy and impose it on the whole world under threat of cruel punishments, unless one wants to believe that the Emperor, with his unjust proposals, seeks the glory of Spanish power to then create just conditions among the estates of the German Empire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] God knows the hearts of men. But in light of recent events, Vadian can only perceive intrigues and conspiracies everywhere in the service of imperial tyranny. It is now a matter of waiting to see how the estates will respond to the Emperor's proposal to find out whether the Germans are still courageous or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should return the enclosed proposal. In great haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] As soon as Vadian learns anything about the response of the estates, he will keep Bullinger informed. The Swiss still have a bad reputation with the estates. It is believed that the Emperor is about to form a secret alliance with the estates, if this has not already happened, as Vadian suspects. Then he will attack Constance and the Swiss. The sick Emperor was carried to the first session of the Diet. However, his presence was not significant. Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, is the Emperor's right hand.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Today, I received letters from friends in Augsburg, which only mention personal matters. However, they included Emperor Charles's proposal from the first session of the Imperial Diet, presented by Archduke Maximilian and delivered by a certain Calliopius, written quite sincerely. I wanted to send it to you so that you would not be without it, being certain of its possession by me. In it, you will understand the direction of everything. The continuation of the Council of Trent is proposed coldly, and a bait is set to test whether the exhausted and overly oppressed German liberty will accept this cesspool of errors and factions or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the ordinary judgment of the Imperial Chamber, everything is proposed very insidiously, and the entire matter is handled in such a way that the Emperor has undoubtedly decided to moderate everything according to his own will. At the same time, the tragedy and universal misery of the past war have continued to aim at making every abomination not only accepted but also declared sacred and imposed on the whole world under dire penalties, unless one believes that the Emperor, in his unjust proposal, seeks the glory of Spanish power to finally bring about justice among the estates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Lord knows the hearts of men, although I indeed cannot gather anything else from the quality of past events than that everything is full of clandestine arts, factions, and more than tyrannical schemes among all. We will inquire from the response of the estates whether Germany still has any heart and spirit or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell and return the example once you have read it. St. Gallen, September 11, in the year of our Lord 1547, very quickly.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>As soon as I have obtained the response of the estates, I will ensure it is delivered to you without delay. For Switzerland is perpetually ill-regarded by them and is believed to be in a silent, concluded alliance with what the Emperor is planning and, as I think, is achieving. Soon, Constance and then Switzerland will be attacked. The sick Emperor appeared in the first session of the Diet, supported by others' wings; but in it, aside from his person, as I hear, there was nothing of importance. Granvelle is the mind and spirit of the Emperor, etc.</p>
      <p>To his master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
