    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter bearer Celio Secondo [Curione], who was expelled from Italy, was recommended after thorough examination to the mayor [Hans Franz] Nägeli and the treasurer [Sulpitius] Haller in Bern, who contributed to Curione being granted a teaching position in Lausanne. Since Curione had left his wife and children in Lucca, the Bern council allowed him to fetch them and supported him in this; Curione's journey led him to [Renata], the Duchess of Ferrara, who advised him and issued him a [letter of recommendation], which they enclose in copy. When Curione returned to Zurich, he asked for support for his further journey to Bern; they request kind reception and accommodation of the scholar along with his family [in Königsfelden] as well as the provision of a horse for the further journey to Bern. They have also asked mayor [Hans Franz] Nägeli and [Hans Rudolf von] Graffenried for support for Curione. Blessing wish.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus, with the offering of friendly greetings, friendship, love, and whatever we can honor, love, and do good for you, we are prepared to do so beforehand.</p>
      <p>Pious, faithful, especially favorable and trusted lord and brother, the bearer of this letter, Celio Secondo, a highly and excellently learned man, came a few months ago from Italy, expelled and persecuted by the Pope. As we have learned about his faith, teachings, and reputation through many conversations, we have sent letters to our especially beloved lords, Mayor Nägeli and Treasurer Haller, with a diligent request to consider such an honorable, learned man and to help him obtain a position (office, employment). They have received this very kindly from us and have arranged for him to be appointed as a lecturer in Lausanne or have helped him so much that he is appointed there. May God reward their faithfulness.</p>
      <p>However, since the pious man left his wife and child behind in Lucca, Italy, he has been allowed to travel back to fetch them. The honorable council in Bern has also provided him with some crowns for expenses, as well as a city messenger up to here (Zurich), and further letters to the mayor and council in Chur, etc. After a long, difficult, and dangerous journey, he came to the Duchess of Ferrara, who is a born queen from France, daughter of King Louis, who helped and advised him. She also wrote a letter, a copy of which we have attached here for your better information and knowledge of the truth.</p>
      <p>When he came to us in Zurich and informed us that he had spent heavily, as is understandable, and requested that we help and advise him so that he could come to Bern with his children as soon as possible, we have paid for his lodging here and sent him to you at our expense, for the sake of the servant and horse that carry the children. Therefore, our earnest and urgent request to you is that you, for God's sake and for the sake of His holy word, kindly receive the learned, pious man, accommodate him with his wife and children, and also help him to be sent off as soon as possible, and provide him with a horse to carry the children, and also advise him according to his needs. Such actions will please God, who Himself accounts for all that happens to His faithful servants.</p>
      <p>So I hope in the faithfulness, love, and friendliness of the Christian authorities in Bern, they will not bear any displeasure against you for this. We have also written to Mayor Nägeli and Graffenried, our especially trusted ones, about this, and asked them to support the honorable, learned man, etc. Whatever we can do to show you love and service, we are willing to do so. May God faithfully protect you and yours. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, on the 20th day of November in the year 1542. Yours always entirely willing</p>
      <p>Caspar Megander and Heinrich Bullinger, servants of the church</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and wise Lux Löwensprung, steward in Königsfelden, their especially favorable, dear lord and brother.</p>
