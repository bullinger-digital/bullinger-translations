      <p>God with us. Beloved son, if you are well and the weather has not harmed you, then praise be to God. At the lake, it went very badly on Friday evening, there was a terrible storm and hail; the hail started at Goldbach and extended to Meilen in the fields.</p>
      <p>In Meilen, it did no harm. The greatest damage was in KÃ¼snacht and Herrliberg, but it was less harmful there. However, it was so severe that no one has seen the like, and yet there is still something standing that can reward the labor. May God give His blessing and protect us in the future; for it is a great punishment. May God have mercy on us. As for all of us, we are fairly well; but otherwise, there are many sick people here and there.</p>
      <p>No news yet, and the report of the victory of the Venetians is not further confirmed, so I fear there is nothing to it.</p>
      <p>All the people greet you. Greet Susanna and the children for us. When is Joel coming back? God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on Monday, September 1, Verena 1572. Bullinger.</p>
