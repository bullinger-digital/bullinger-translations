    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter will report on his situation in Basel. The libraries are being merged under his collaboration by order of the Basel council. He is giving lectures on Deuteronomy. In Basel, no one knows anything certain about the peace terms of Kaaden. Myconius is like a father to him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If you are well, I am glad. The bearer of this letter will inform you about our well-being and what we are doing. We are striving to create one library from many by the order of the council.</p>
      <p>I am lecturing on Deuteronomy in Hebrew alternately. I believe no one here knows the terms of peace. If you know, please share. Myconius is like a father to me. May God grant him a long and healthy life.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. I wish to send my regards to Mr. Theodor, Leo, Pellicanus, the provost, Heinrich Utinger, NÃ¼scheler, Golden, Mr. Johann Jakob Aman, Colin, and all the others, as well as all their spouses, in my words.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 14, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, Carolostadius.</p>
      <p>To the wise and distinguished Mr. H. Bullinger, the chief preacher in Zurich, my dearest brother.</p>
