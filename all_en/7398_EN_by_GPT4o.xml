      <p>God with us. Beloved son, I thank God that things are going reasonably well for you and others who serve you. God is always to be asked for grace and improvement; for without Him, we are nothing. From France, it is said that their peace negotiations have completely collapsed, that the king has issued a proclamation in which he declares that the prince will not accept peace, etc. He commands all lords, knights, and people who are with the prince to leave the prince within 8 days and come to the king, and those who do so, he will forgive and let them stay; but those who do not, will lose everything and stand in the highest disgrace, etc. And with this, he wanted to separate them. However, it is written that not one has left the prince and that they are preparing to fight, as they see that it cannot be otherwise. And as the king has positioned himself to prevent the prince from coming to Orléans, the prince has pushed through the king's camp and sacrificed the Italians who were in his way and has come to Orléans. Where he now wants to go, no one knows; but it is thought that a battle will soon take place. May God grant... and grace. Alone is the pope and the Spaniard..., that the king may not accept peace, and not that the two seek their own, and his land and people go to ruin, etc.</p>
      <p>What my Polish friends have written from Heidelberg about Poland, you have here attached, as well as what was sent to me from the Netherlands from Basel; it comes by post from Antwerp, and please send me back the same note enclosed in the letter. Yesterday, a letter came to me from Nuremberg, written on February 20. In summary: Duke Hans Wilhelm of Saxony has issued a mandate concerning religion, and that in his land only according to the Augsburg Confession and Luther's books should be preached; condemning therein Dr. Victorinus Strigel's declaration on the Lord's Supper, etc. Subsequently, he has issued a publication in which he justifies his move to France, leading 3000 horsemen to the king against the rebels; he writes very amusing things therein. May the Lord repay him. He personally goes to the king. Thus, the foolish Germans are brought together. Subsequently, the high lord of Neroberg writes that on February 22: the wedding in Munich between the one from Bavaria and the lady from Lorraine will be held, upon which envoys from the pope, Italian princes, emperor, bishops, etc., will come together. The true conspiracy of the Antichrist, and they are in great concern that nothing good will be practiced. Also, there is talk that the emperor is planning to appoint Duke Wolfgang, Count Palatine and Duke of Zweibrücken, as the commander and then order the circles to rise and march against the Elector Palatine with force as against a rebel and drive him out, as last year the circles in Franconia, Saxony, etc., had to join Duke Augustus against Duke Hans Friedrich, etc. May God will that nothing comes of this matter or that God Himself sits in judgment. Every apostate is worse than an infidel; thus it appears in Maximilian, and the German nation is badly placed with those three Italian heads Maximilian, Ferdinand, Charles, etc. May God improve it.</p>
      <p>For what we have done for Susanna, you need not thank so highly; the will is good from the heart, but the services are common. By God's grace, all is well with us; only Josias is suffering from podagra (gout), and I have strained myself on Saturday with a stitch in the left side by the heart and unspeakable cold, that it almost began (as Treasurer Werdmüller of blessed memory says) to puff. It has made me very weak; yet now a great discharge and expulsion is coming.</p>
      <p>The stitch does not hurt much more and is improving quickly. During the carnival, I did not go anywhere, etc.</p>
      <p>It does not matter at all that godfather young lord does not recognize me; for even if he knew me, he could not have refrained from his intended ride on my account; moreover, I would not have gone home with him; for I hurried, as it was frozen, that I over the...</p>
