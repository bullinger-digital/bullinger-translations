      <p>Greetings. Today we inspected the Zofingen classis, which usually meets in the village called Long Valley. There, letters from Mr. Beza were delivered to me along with this bundle, which I am sending to you attached to these.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Mr. Claudius from Madiis received letters from our senate through the same messenger.</p>
      <p>What they contain, I still do not know; however, after reading them, he soon asked me if I knew for certain whether you would be coming to Regensberg (as I had previously told him that I had written to you about this matter). Although I said that I hoped for this, I could not affirm anything for certain, so he soon decided to send his own messenger to you. Therefore, when we arrived here in the evening, we immediately hired this messenger, who brings these to you, and we still ask and beseech you to come there with my brother on the next Wednesday evening; for it seems to be something significant and very necessary that our senate wishes to communicate with you, although, as I wrote, I do not yet know what it is.</p>
      <p>Therefore, grant us, and not only us but for the common benefit of our republics, that you come. Bring with you your sons and sons-in-law, and whomever else you wish; for all will be most welcome to us.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow we will set out for Aarau, and on Wednesday we will hold a synod there, which we will easily conclude quickly, so that we may still come to Regensberg that evening, even if it means departing late.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>My colleagues, as well as the steward Telamonius and Hemmanus Haberer, send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>I write no more, because I will discuss everything else with you in person. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zofingen, May 29, at nightfall.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I had already sealed the letters when Mr. from Madiis again reminded me to add this: if it is absolutely impossible for you to come, please let us know immediately through this messenger; for it may then happen that he himself will come up to you in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
