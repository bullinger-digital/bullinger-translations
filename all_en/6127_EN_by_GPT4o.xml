      <p>Venerable, well-learned sir, I am always at your service.</p>
      <p>As I have previously written to you from Baden, I hope this letter reaches you, in which I thank you for your honorable gifts from Baden that you have sent us. If that letter did not reach you, I thank you most highly as before.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I ask you to always keep me in your thoughts. Herewith my godfather, Mr. Hans Felberg, comes to Zurich on account of some of his business matters that he has to attend to.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my request to you is to encourage him as before, although I have no complaints about him; he has conducted himself properly so far, only that he may continue as he has.</p>
      <p>Such would be my request to you.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend you to God Almighty at all times.</p>
      <p>Dated at Neunforn on the 7th of May in 1564. Your willing servant, Benedikt Stokar.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the church minister in Zurich, my gracious lord and good friend, to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
