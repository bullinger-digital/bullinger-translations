      <p>To act well. Although I had not previously had any exchange of letters with you, my dear Lord Bullinger, I did not hesitate to send you these letters, as the opportunity arose, and because I had no doubt about your piety, that you would receive them kindly. Moreover, Master Hermann von Wied (Aquilomontanus) who is very dear to me, has corresponded with you several times, to which you have also responded, and he has left me the letters you sent to him. He has entrusted the care of his children and his affairs to me and Gerard Campius, who, I believe, has greeted you in my name several times. But, my dear Bullinger, the main reason for writing to you is to inform you and your fellow ministers about the state and condition of our church in Friesland, which they call East Friesland. I know that the preachers of Emden have already explained this more clearly to you and Gerard in their writings. You will understand that nothing has yet changed in our religion, although the preachers of the cities have been forbidden from the pulpit. Other opportunities are given through infant baptism or the joining of those entering marriage for the first time, which the church diligently observes, although no bell is rung. However, the magistrates still insist that we resume some pious ceremonies, as they call them, conforming to the Eastern churches, although we have consistently refused so far. We do not know what will happen to us because of this. We can only understand that our magistrate (otherwise truly pious, although seized by the fear of impending danger, dares not attempt anything for religion) hopes to spread his reputation by making some change, so that it may seem that they have begun and not despised the command of the supreme dictator of all Germany, while, alas, Clio wishes to have one foot in the camps and the other in the theaters. For this reason, Master a Lasco, a man absolutely pious and learned, has departed from us to England again, whose wife has gone to her husband, so I know nothing else, since she was at my house one or two months ago. What we should expect can be easily judged from the example of Master a Lasco and the aforementioned. However, we are prepared for either outcome with divine assistance, although we also have those who are more concerned with the affairs of this life than with Christ. Thus, we are in danger, although we are safe under the wings of the Most High. We pray again and again that you assist us with both public and private prayers. I have discussed our cause with the people of Strasbourg; but I do not know what response Hedio has given me, although I have found others who praise our constancy. However, under the guise of piety, many attack us with the argument that churches should not be abandoned because of some rites, which they call pious, although they have no sources in scripture, as if it were necessary to serve the forum or the time, which is easily granted in other matters, but we deny it in religion, where only God should be heard.</p>
      <p>These few things I have written to you with a neglected hand, as you see, my Bullinger, earnestly praying that you do not disdain to respond to me occasionally with very kind letters to a certain citizen of Strasbourg named Gabriel, who has taken upon himself the care to transmit them to me and to pray for me, an old and infirm man, who has long been anxiously seeking your acquaintance. May God kindly keep me in the profession of His name and in obedience to His word, and if there is anything to suffer, may He supply us with strength according to His promise. I would finally like to consult you on this matter, if we were expelled by the order of the magistrate, whether it would be permissible to comply. I have read the opinions of some here; but I would also seek yours and those of the pious privately elsewhere in my country, where, however, public superstition is hidden, yet having no commerce with impiety and, given the opportunity to profess the true faith, to profess it. For this urges me, wherever I have been in the ministry of the word, I would by no means wish to see anything there that would conflict with piety or our doctrine hitherto. Therefore, I would like to be absent from there, although I inhabit my own property and would not leave ecclesiastical and my own, not someone else's. Farewell, my dear Bullinger, with the other ministers, and pray for us. Strasbourg, June 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety and learning, Peter Campensis in East Friesland.</p>
      <p>I am fully persuaded that you will not take it amiss that I have added Pellican's letters to yours, since I have written nothing private, and they would be more easily delivered together.</p>
