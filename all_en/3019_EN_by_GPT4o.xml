      <p>Franciscus Hotomanus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Having returned from Frankfurt, where I had gone together with Mr. Calvin, I found two things most pleasing to me: your letters and the instructions, which I was eagerly expecting. But nothing was as delightful and welcome as that remarkable expression and rather testimony of your love towards me, as you wished to gratify me in a matter truly trivial. For all of this, venerable father, I am as grateful as I can be. I will compare the instructions with my book as quickly and diligently as I can, and, God willing, I will send them back to you intact. Your son was received by me so that we could discuss his accommodation together. For although I now have very small lodgings, namely Leveri, who moved into Mr. Martyr's house, I still wished to find some way to accommodate you. He immediately replied that through the efforts of the Reverend Mr. Dasypodius, he had found a most convenient and suitable accommodation with a certain German, an honest man, for which I sincerely congratulated him; for as much as I heard from his own mouth, his previous residence was not sufficiently suitable for his studies. Therefore, in the future, I will strive in other matters so that you cannot judge me to be ungrateful for your kindness.</p>
      <p>Mr. Calvin is to return within four days. In Frankfurt, a certain Velsius, who was a captive in Cologne the previous year, a rather talkative and bold man, announced to the pastor of the English church, Mr. Horn, shortly before Mr. Calvin's arrival, that he had certain prophetic revelations, about which he would like to dispute later.</p>
      <p>When he heard that Mr. Calvin was coming, he wanted him to preside. The main proposition was this: either there is free will, or God is a tyrant. He disputed for two days in such a way that, with the unanimous consent of all ranks and people, if he had anything left to lose in terms of reputation, it was entirely taken from him. Calvin, on the other hand, was praised to the skies by all the Germans, not so much for his learning, which has long been known, but for his sharpness of mind and a certain admirable skill in disputation. Thanks were given by the senate, and wine was honorably sent by attendants for three days. What he accomplished in the matter of the French church is still uncertain; for I had to return with the matter unfinished. He was received at a banquet by our professors, my colleagues; upon entering Sturm's lecture, he was most warmly greeted both by him, who descended from the pulpit, and by all the standing audience. Our preacher, requesting that a place for preaching be provided to him, was refused; God knows the reason; for no more is permitted. I ask him to have mercy on the church and the republic of Strasbourg and to bless these labors.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Martyr, and to my venerable father and compatriot, greetings. Mr. Sleidanus has been ill for 40 days now, but only slightly. Farewell. September 21, 1556.</p>
