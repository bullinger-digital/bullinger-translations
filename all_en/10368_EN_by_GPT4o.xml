Speculations about an attack by France on King Ferdinand. Furthermore, Gaßner conveyed news about the activities of the Augsburg councils concerning the abolition of the Catholic faith.

      <p>God with us. Amen. In haste.</p>
      <p>My dear one, Thomas, the preacher in Lindau, writes to me, certainly, that Jakob Bedrot from Strasbourg writes that the price of grain is falling sharply, and there is a government there that has just taken the matter into their hands, as also in Basel. However, there is a general concern that a harmful war may arise among them, about which he does not want to write much at this time. (I hear that Lorraine and France are one, perhaps the Frenchman is preparing to attack King Ferdinand in Frankfurt, etc.) That is a speculation, etc. Furthermore, the aforementioned Thomas has joyfully reported that the city clerk in Lindau, his brother-in-law from Augsburg, the Greek writer, writes that a council in Augsburg has been dealing intensely and strictly for 14 days to abolish the papacy among them, and today, Wednesday, 14 days later, it has appeared before a common or large council. Do not doubt anymore, everything that is against divine truth will be abolished, etc.</p>
      <p>May God grant you and all of us such works that we may also improve and grow in them. May it happen that we are ashamed of our actions or moved by love. That is what I wish from God, especially for Zurich.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother for me.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, in haste, Wednesday before Laetare in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler, now in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my dear M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
