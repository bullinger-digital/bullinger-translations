      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, a messenger sent by the Elector Palatine came to our magistrate. He brought letters from your son to you and from our Rudolf to me, which I am sending. He informed the magistrate that he had held Adam Neuser from Avignon in chains; this man, having escaped, is now perhaps hiding with Brunner, with whom he was once familiar; he suspects this, but has nothing certain. Therefore, since Brunner is now acting in the jurisdiction of ZÃ¼rich, he asks that they either send him captured to Heidelberg or keep him in chains and inform the prince, etc. When asked if I knew Adam and Brunner, I explained what you also know about both; I showed that Brunner serves the church under our Mr. Gregor from Ulm, etc. The messenger was dismissed this morning, as he is hurrying to Basel and Strasbourg to receive responses there on the same matter.</p>
      <p>I will tell you what our people have responded when I find out; however, I believe they will diligently do their duty and report this to the prince. Beldius wrote a few days ago that his son-in-law was in Solothurn and there learned that the French are very upset about being expelled from Finale by the Spanish; therefore, the king will request a legion from the Swiss to lead into Piedmont, and from there to turn towards Milan. Others say there are cities in Occitania that do not want to accept peace, which he wants to bring into order. It seems doubtful to me whether this is being done seriously or deceitfully; we will have more certain information soon. May the Lord bless you and yours and keep you from all evil. If I can, I will soon come to you. Petronius Grebelius is on leave; on Friday the proposal will be made. I am not writing anything else to our Rudolf other than that we will write about everything through Froschauer; now there is no leisure. August 7, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear Rudolf Gwalther. Urdorf.</p>
