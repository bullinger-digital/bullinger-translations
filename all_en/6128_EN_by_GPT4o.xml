      <p>Greetings. Who and what kind of man of piety and learning Franz Schwarz was, both his Rhetia and Tragedy, to say nothing of other writings, clearly show; he was certainly a dear and respected brother to me in many ways.</p>
      <p>He died this year in Poland, but left behind here with us a wife and two children, one daughter who is of marriageable age, and this son, who delivers this to you, a male, all pious and good, but as it often happens to pious and learned men, poor. Both, however, have been taught the craft, namely the weaving of silk fabrics, which we call hormisinos, so that, provided the material is supplied to the craft, they can and indeed usually do earn a decent living for themselves and their mother.</p>
      <p>However, this present plague has brought us, besides other damages, this as well, that many who lived quite liberally from this craft are now, because they cannot practice it, almost perishing from hunger. I said almost, because the church, to the extent of its ability, supplies all the poor with enough to live a Christian life.</p>
      <p>Partly for this reason and partly because of the plague itself, which has now invaded the greater part of the town and has taken about two hundred up to this hour, the mother judged it would be wise for herself and her children if this son were sent to Zürich or Geneva and entrusted to some friend who would take care of him, at least for this time, until the plague is extinguished and he can return home to his craft. For this recommendation, she judged that I could be of considerable help because of the many friends of some authority I have in both places. I certainly could not deny this pious service to an honest and pious widow for the son of such a great man and friend. To whom there better than to you, who are strong in counsel and authority, love the pious, and do not disdain the recommendations of friends, could I commend this young man? Therefore, I commend to you, excellent Father Bullinger, this son of an excellent, learned, and most pious man. If he can earn his living there by practicing his craft, it would be worth the effort; if not, it would be most welcome if he could be placed with some citizen, so that he may live from his honest and Christian service and in the meantime learn the German language and, if possible, commercial arithmetic. If neither of these can be obtained, finally let him be sent with some good man to Geneva and recommended to Count Ulrich, who will then perform his duty with the church. You will certainly have done a pious and Christian work and one most pleasing to many friends.</p>
      <p>Our Frisian had a great friendship with the father of this one; I do not doubt that he will do something in favor of the deceased friend.</p>
      <p>From Italy we have this: The army of that robber Macchoni, who was ravaging everything in Calabria under the pretext of evangelical liberty, is completely dispersed. However, two nobles were burned for religion's sake in Naples and many were thrown into prison, among whom is also Count Caserta. The bishop's vicar, whom they call suffragan, was taking care to introduce the Spanish Inquisition into the kingdom.</p>
      <p>The people, because of this Spanish novelty and the cruel extermination of the two nobles, took up arms, ran to the bishop's palace first to kill him if they could capture him, and when he fled, they branded his captured brother with a hot iron on both cheeks for perpetual infamy, then went to the castle of the viceroy, demanding why the Spanish Inquisition was being attempted to be introduced into the kingdom against the liberty of the kingdom and the promise of Charles V.</p>
      <p>The viceroy dealt gently with the people and finally managed to make the people content to wait for a response from King Philip; for the viceroy sent a messenger to him with horses arranged for this business. Thus they remain quiet until the king's response.</p>
      <p>In Spain, many are being burned; one day the king ordered 40 to be burned at once; hence a considerable tumult was stirred up. The Venetians recently decreed that anyone who fled to their land for the sake of religion, which they call Lutheranism, must leave within 15 days. As for that Lyon business, about which Beza and Viretus, at present I cannot and should not desert this church, placed in such calamity, when it now most needs ministers to console it.</p>
      <p>Indeed, what an excellent shepherd I would be if I were to desert the sheep now. Therefore, I am compelled to wait until the Lord, through His mercy, removes this plague and unites the church again.</p>
      <p>Then I will deliver the letters that are written to it, and I will show those that are to me and allow the brothers to deliberate.</p>
      <p>It is the same to me to be in Lyon or Chiavenna, as long as I serve Christ. I ask you in the meantime to commend me and my church to the Lord Jesus in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Yesterday even ten died and now two distinguished men. May the Lord keep us and look not on us, but on the face of His Christ.</p>
      <p>May He also keep you and all pastors, pious and learned men, who can help the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Frederick, your most observant, sends you many greetings. Farewell, excellent father.</p>
      <p>I am returning Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, May 7, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant H[ieronymus] Zanchi. The one who should have delivered this to you and whom I had recommended to you was seized by the plague the day before he was to set out on his journey; he is still ill, but there is hope of recovery.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beg; there are none found who are willing to take the letters. Up to this day, which is May 21, 287 and perhaps more have died of the plague among us; for today I have not yet spoken with anyone, whether any have perished or not. We commend ourselves to your prayers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you and your church. Philip is gathering soldiers in Milan, 4,000 Italians and 4,000 Spaniards; it is unknown for what purpose. To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most revered father of the Zürich church and most esteemed by me. Zürich.</p>
