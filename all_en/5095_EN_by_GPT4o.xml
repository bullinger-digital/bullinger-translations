      <p>S. D. I do indeed remember your intercession; but there is a great abundance of those who have little or nothing, who themselves are of holy life and proven doctrine. I wish we had many positions so that we could help everyone.</p>
      <p>Rumor spreads that the fathers in Trent have asked the pope to submit himself to the council and to release the oaths made to it, so that they might act more freely, whereupon the pope became angry and in his holy wrath suspended the council for 4 months. It is certain that in October, the people of Trent, upon the arrival of the Cardinal of Mantua, fired or discharged those larger bronze cannons in honor, but the fire fell into the gunpowder and killed 18 people, wounding many more seriously. The plague has raged very severely through Austria and is said to be ascending or creeping against the Danube.</p>
      <p>It is written from Bern that a meeting was held in Lyon between the envoys of the King of France and the Duke of Savoy; the king demands many things from the latter, especially the County of Nice; there are 6 articles. The Savoyards denied everything; the royal envoys clearly said that the king is reclaiming these as his own and not only reclaiming but also wanting to demonstrate his right to everyone. The king's envoy Coignet writes to me from the court at the end of November and indicates that the Spanish are threatening the French vehemently unless they expel the heretics, but the French, being bold, do not take the threats seriously; the churches are growing throughout all of France more than can be believed; the future assembly of the kingdom is in mid-December, and it will be attempted to promote these matters of the kingdom, especially religion, with peace. We must pray to the Lord to support the pious efforts and scatter the impious.</p>
      <p>He says he will return to Switzerland after the Christmas holidays. I am now receiving letters from friends in Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>They have removed the round bread from the action of the sacred supper and this month began to break the bread; there is the highest hope for the best things; the prince is excellent. Let us pray to the Lord diligently, and He will do it.</p>
      <p>Kindly support our excellent old man; he is devout, devout; the afflicted is his priest. Greet him and share with him the main points of these matters.</p>
      <p>I think it would be good if the mayor reported on all things, and what his plan is, and that he would be content; one should do justice to the matter with his advice and knowledge, etc. Farewell. December 19, 1561.</p>
      <p>I did not reread.</p>
      <p>Greet my brother-in-law, Mr. Mayor, for me.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, citizen of Winterthur, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
