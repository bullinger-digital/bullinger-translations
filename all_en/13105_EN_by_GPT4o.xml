    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger criticized Kilchmeyer in his last letter [not received] for his negligence in correspondence. He would be right if Kilchmeyer's heavy workload and the unexpected or rapid departures of messengers traveling to Zurich did not explain why he writes so rarely. Bullinger should not take this amiss, but continue to write and admonish, comfort, and guide him! Bullinger is responsible for Kilchmeyer, as an already exhausted old man, having to work so hard, while he never considered him worthy of even the smallest position within the city walls of Zurich before! Bullinger should excuse Kilchmeyer's displeasure. He already knows that the path to peace and glory is arduous, that difficult and dangerous tasks are not for the lazy, and that Bullinger has the common good in mind, not the one Kilchmeyer can imagine, but the one that serves the salvation of the common homeland. But enough of that!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] When Kilchmeyer [at the end of October 1546] was preparing to travel to Bern, he assured the Zurich council that he intended to return, unless God had other plans for him. He also decided to leave Bern again the following summer. When he recently spent a few days in Zurich with some Bernese, he discussed this extensively with the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater. He informed the latter that Johannes Haller should replace him in Bern because he would be highly suitable for it, being learned, strong, pious, and persevering.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Likewise, Kilchmeyer recommended Haller to some Bernese officials so much (while concealing his intention to leave Bern) that Haller has now become a topic in the Bernese council. Kilchmeyer also plans to continue advocating for Haller's appointment to Bern unless he is clearly told that this is hopeless. Kilchmeyer has placed great hopes on Haller since his childhood. He often prophesied to him that he would be his successor in Küsnacht. But what if this [God-inspired] hope referred to Bern?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] However, Kilchmeyer does not know whether Haller is still in Augsburg or already in Zurich, whether he is dead or still alive. Bullinger should inform him of this in his next letter [not received] and advocate for Haller's appointment to Bern, his homeland, and for Kilchmeyer's recall to Zurich. Kilchmeyer would also be satisfied with a minor position and salary (and why not in the city?). He never had great demands and was always content with little! In short: Even if God has blessed his preaching activity, the stronger and more learned Haller will fill the position that Kilchmeyer only reluctantly occupies much better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The preceding was written on October 25. Kilchmeyer was counting on a messenger [Luzius Tscharner?], who ultimately did not depart. So he left the letter unfinished. Then, unexpectedly, on October 30, a Zurich messenger [Melchior Schlosser] appeared, to whom he would have liked to give the letter, but he could not finish it because he had to preach. The next day, he was able to complete the letter in greater peace and entrusted it to the Grison Luzius Tscharner, without changing the passage about Haller, even though he had meanwhile learned from the Zurich messenger that Haller, thank God, was still alive and had returned home. This pleases him all the more, as he can now hope to be replaced by Haller and appointed in the city of Zurich, especially since he also learned of the death of Heinrich Buchter! Therefore, he now hopes, with the support of Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, and others, to easily obtain some small position.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to Johannes Fries. He should know that the Bernese library will not purchase his books offered for sale. Bullinger should also inform Lorenz Meyer (Agricola) that his writing "De bellicis rebus" was well delivered to Kilchmeyer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Two more letters are enclosed with the present letter. One letter [No. 3049] is from a pious and learned Frenchman [Jean Hotot], who is currently staying in Bern after spending several months in Zurich with Georg Rubli. Rubli was supposed to send his belongings after him, but they have still not arrived in Bern. Bullinger should ensure that the Frenchman receives his luggage as soon as possible. The other letter [not received] is from a pastor [Kaspar Seidensticker] working in the Bernese countryside, who asks Bullinger to safely deliver the money enclosed with his letter to [Ambrosius Blarer and Konrad Zwick] in Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings, among others, to Rudolf Gwalther, Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Johann Jakob Ammann, Rudolf Collin, as well as to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and Bullinger's brother Johannes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [P.S.:] The present letter was finished when Tscharner postponed his planned journey. Therefore, Kilchmeyer did not enclose the above-announced letter with the money shipment intended for Constance with his present letter. This shipment will be delivered by Tscharner later, as he was commissioned by the preacher [Seidensticker] to advocate for him with Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Furthermore, regarding the Frenchman who has been staying in Bern for a few days: On November 1, he was informed by letter that his luggage had been in Solothurn for almost three weeks. He thanks the Zurichers for their efforts. He will now ensure that his belongings are brought to him from there to Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace. You reproach me, most learned man and dearest brother, in your latest letters for being very negligent in replying, in which you would indeed be more justified if not for the burden of my duties and the hurried and sudden departure of messengers absolving me. Therefore, as it is your role to interpret everything favorably and to turn it to the better, I beseech you not to cease writing, advising, comforting, and finally instructing me, nor let my tardiness deter and discourage you, attributing it to negligence, which is clearly due to my occupations. I believe it is all the more your duty not to do this, as it is clear that through your work and diligence, I have been compelled into these labors, now as an old man and almost exhausted in bodily strength, which I never seemed to you worthy of even the lowest position within the walls of Zürich before. See where impatience leads me as an old man! But spare me, I beg you. For I know that the path to rest and true glory is through labors, and that arduous and dangerous tasks are not entrusted to the lazy, and that you have done everything with excessive zeal for the sake of promoting public welfare, not considering what I can do, but what the salvation of our homeland demands. But enough of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>When I was about to leave for Bern, I declared in the renowned council of Zürich that I would return unless the Lord of hosts ordered otherwise. Thus, I have also decided to leave Bern in the coming summer and return to Zürich; this I recently disclosed to the consuls while spending a few days in the city of Zürich with some Bernese. I also discussed somewhat with Lavater about Mr. Johannes Haller, that he should be placed in my position, whom we all know to be learned, strong, pious, and constant, and most suitable for bearing such burdens.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Similarly, I have recommended Mr. Haller to some leading figures in Bern (while keeping my intention secret), so much so that a question about him has been raised in the council, and I will not cease to pursue this matter until he is called, or I understand in plain words that I am advocating this cause in vain. For he seemed to me from his cradle to be of great promise, so that I often told him to his face that he would be my successor in Küsnacht. What if this hope referred to Bern?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Where he is now, I do not know: in Augsburg or Zürich, among the living or the dead? But wherever he may be, I wish him well, and I ask you to inform me about him in your next letters, and to exert your efforts to have him sent to Bern, to cultivate his homeland (as is the duty of a good man), and to receive me back in Zürich, where I desire nothing that is due to clear and great talents, but only the smallest position (which can be within the city walls). I will be content with a small salary, and for this, I will be very rich. I have never sought great things, but (to boast about myself in a holy manner) I have possessed and abandoned the greatest things with a cheerful mind; nor has anything been lacking to me that the necessity and dignity of this life also require. In short: although the Lord has greatly blessed the word of life through me, his useless servant, it will be for someone stronger and more learned to take on the function that I now reluctantly sustain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I wrote this on October 25, thinking that the messenger I had found would depart; when this did not happen, I left the letters unfinished, ready to complete and send them to you on another occasion when the opportunity presented itself. And so, on October 30, unexpectedly, a Zurich messenger appeared, to whom I would have gladly given them, but at that time, I could not complete them due to public sermons. Therefore, I postponed it to the following day, when, being a little calmer, I completed them and entrusted them to the excellent man Lucius Tscharner from Rhaetia, without changing anything about Haller, whose condition I had said above I was unaware of. Now, however, the messenger has informed and assured me that he is alive and in his homeland (praise be to God!), which was all the more pleasing to me, as I now hope more easily to achieve my wish, namely, that he be appointed in my place, and that I may obtain some position within the walls of Zürich. I believe this can be done more conveniently because I also hear that Mr. Buchter has bid farewell to the land, and I hope from my heart that with your help, Bibliander's, and others', I can be promoted to some corner without trouble.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and give my many greetings to our Fries, then let him know that there is indeed no hope with us that his books will be accepted for sale in our library. Furthermore, the booklet by Mr. Lorenz Agricola "De bellicis rebus" was delivered to me with the utmost fidelity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Two other letters are attached to my letter, one of which is from a certain Frenchman who is now staying with us, who was in Zürich with Georg Rubli in the previous months, to whom he entrusted his luggage to be sent to Bern after his departure, which he has not yet seen, as he asked me to inform you. Thus, in the name of the Frenchman (for he is a pious and learned man), I beg you to ensure that he receives his luggage as soon as possible. The other letter is from a certain preacher in our countryside, who implores your help with his own letter, to ensure that the money enclosed with the letters pertaining to Constance is delivered to its place, as his hand will instruct you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell again. Given in Bern, October 31. Greet in my name Mr. Gwalther, Bibliander, Pellican, Ammann, Collin, and all the brothers together with your wife, your brother Mr. Johannes, and the whole family. 1547. I. Kilchmeyer, always yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>After the letters were completed and everything was prepared, Lucius Tscharner did not want to depart as planned, so I did not send the letters containing money and pertaining to Constance, as my letter states, but I retained them with me until Lucius departs, and this for the reason that the preacher who sends the money to Constance entrusted his matter to Lucius Tscharner to be executed with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What I wrote about that Frenchman, who recently stayed with you and now has been in Bern for a few days, about sending his luggage through Rubli, a citizen of Zürich, appeared to be written in vain on the first day of November, because on that day the Frenchman received letters that his luggage was in Solothurn (and this for almost the third week), from where he will ensure it is brought to him, thanking you all for your efforts.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor at the provostry in Zürich, his brother in the Lord and esteemed colleague forever.</p>
