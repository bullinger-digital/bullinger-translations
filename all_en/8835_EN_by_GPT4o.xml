      <p>The Lord be with you, who may strengthen you in all things! As you see, the envoys of our lords are coming, not to support the bulls nor to oppose the bull-bearers, but to conveniently settle the disturbances and ensure that things are conducted lawfully. Two envoys in the name of the Five Cantons are also coming. You cannot be unaware of what is to be expected from them; however, if they hear the demands of the consenting Rhetian people, they will not be able to justly resist; if they wish to, they will not have supporters. First and foremost, pray to the Lord and ensure that the whole church prays; then approach the envoys of our lords and inform them of everything. If possible, bring with you the most honorable man, Mr. Willi, the consul, who can also add his testimony. You can trust these envoys; they are men of integrity and friends of true religion. I write this to you in haste. I pray to the Lord to be with you and that from these modest beginnings a great war does not flare up because of our sins. Lord, have mercy on us and save us!</p>
      <p>Farewell forever and write by the next messenger; I am very concerned.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 23, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet all of ours in order.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
