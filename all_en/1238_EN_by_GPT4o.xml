      <p>S. P. A. Since my last letter to you, not even a fly of letters has been returned to us from you. Nevertheless, I was about to write to you long ago, if only I could have conveyed something certain about the affairs of Mr. Hooper (whose desire I was especially sure you were held by); but since I could not, I thought it should be postponed until his rather unfortunate controversy with the bishops was settled.</p>
      <p>Now that this has happened, I could not restrain myself from informing you of the matter itself in a few words. You know (unless I am mistaken) that Mr. Hooper, for more or less nine months now, has received the bishopric of Gloucester offered by the royal majesty on the condition that he would not be compelled to any superstition, especially in the inauguration itself (which they call consecration), which indeed was easily obtained from the king and the royal senate. However, the bishops have brought this matter to such a point, by some means or other, with the royal senate (no doubt more eager for their own glory than that of Christ the Lord), that they have revoked this freedom once granted by the word of God, so that Hooper was urged to a certain papal inauguration (at least as far as the garments and the carrying of the pastoral staff are concerned). He, however, resisted the bishops for a long time and with great vigor, asserting with very strong arguments that a Christian man, instructed about the impiety of using such garments in the ministry of the church, could not use these garments in the ministry of the church with a clear conscience, since they bring with them the opinion of merit, hypocrisy, and a thousand kinds of superstitions and offenses, and also because they obscure the priesthood of Christ the Lord too much.</p>
      <p>Among the more learned, he had only Mr. a Lasco supporting his opinion, who did not hesitate to subscribe alone to Mr. Hooper's writing. Bucer (of blessed memory) and Peter Martyr, when asked what they thought, wrote that they indeed wished by all means that such garments were removed from the church; however, they did not think (since it is established that all things are pure to the pure) that the pious, otherwise instructed about the impiety of garments in the ministry of the church, could not use them. After a long resistance, Hooper was imprisoned, and perhaps 15 days after his imprisonment, overcome by the obstinacy of the bishops, good Hooper submitted himself and his cause to the judgment of the royal senate; and so it happened that he was inaugurated in the ordinary way in the middle of Lent, not without our greatest sorrow and that of all the pious, however, nor without the gravest offense to many men and brothers: which I did not want to keep hidden from you, although I do it unwillingly for my affection towards Mr. Hooper; nor would I certainly do it now, unless I knew you were very favorably disposed towards Hooper, and indeed you are another Hooper. I would gladly add more here, if only it were safe to entrust everything to letters; but I would prefer to do it in person rather than in private letters. In the meantime, take care not to say a word about me to Mr. Hooper; nor will it be worthwhile to remind the man much of this matter now, since the matter is settled and can no longer be corrected by any remedy: if, however, you think something should be written to him and he should be reminded according to your prudence, you can indeed do so, and I have especially indicated this to you with that intention; however, you will be able to do it with greater fruit if you write that it was indicated to you by a certain friend, suppressing my name or that of anyone else. I hope, however, that this case will be useful to Hooper himself and also to the church. He set out for his bishopric fifteen days before Easter, where, as we hear, he is diligently performing his duty: for which reason, thanks be to the Lord God, to whom I commend his ministry and also yours from the heart. If only I could obtain a release from our church, I will visit Mr. Hooper for a few months; and if I can be of any use to him in his ministry, I will not refuse whatever the Lord will give; and I promised him this when he was leaving here. Furthermore, our church is succeeding quite happily, except that we are still not allowed to administer the sacraments purely through the bishops.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the word is preached most purely by our Martin Micronius with the greatest benefit to the church, who, as he speaks popularly, in the manner of the Zurichers, so he also prudently deals with the interpretation of the word, bringing nothing twisted or trivial that does not contribute to the greatest edification. Discipline, as far as it is allowed, is now being established by us; of which part is the catechism, which we are now preparing, and also the prophecy or collation of scriptures, which we will undertake next week together with the English. We will indeed conduct it in Latin every Monday, after the lecture of Mr. a Lasco, who is now interpreting the Gospel of John with the greatest admiration and benefit of all the listeners; and also in German on Wednesdays, and that after the lecture of Mr. Gwalter, who will interpret Genesis in the Latin language: thus we will have two collations each week; in the former, both those recent lectures will be discussed with the greatest modesty, and in the latter, the sermons held throughout the week. This matter cannot be done without the greatest benefit, with the Lord God giving, whose it is to give the increase of all good things. Mrs. Hooper, who is still in London, asked that I send these letters, which I have attached to mine, to you together. Please greet your dear and chaste wife for me, and Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalter, Zwingli, Wolf, Phrysius, and Sebastian. However, do not omit Mr. Gessner, and especially my host Mr. Butler, to whom, along with his wife and indeed the whole church, I pray for all happiness in the Lord. Farewell, man and teacher always to be respected by me, in Him who is our life. Amen. London, April 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours truly from the heart, Johannes Utenhovius.</p>
      <p>Mr. Martin greets you dutifully, who, now still ministering alone to the German church, is variously hindered, and therefore I could not write now; but he will make up for it another time.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
