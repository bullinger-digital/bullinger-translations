    <p xml:id="regest1">Mayor [Hans] Ziegler's initiative in favor of Lutheranism, which Ritter reported on [No. 827], cannot in any way be traced back to the written statements of Jud and Bullinger; the apology of the Confessio Tetrapolitana, approved by the people of Zurich, explicitly reaffirms the doctrine of the Lord's Supper from the Bern Disputation. If Burgauer had been pretending, it would be disgraceful, yet Bullinger could not help but accept his justification.</p>

      <p>To Erasmus Ritter, Antistes of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You have indeed done a most pleasing thing, dear Erasmus, but you have presented a matter to me that is entirely new and either completely shameless or entirely unknown to you. For if Benedict boasts from my letters, as you say he does, he is the most shameless of men. But if you have not seen those letters of mine, which he interprets falsely, you are telling a story entirely unknown. For those letters of ours written to that man are such that nothing ambiguous can be drawn from them; so far from it, that he could neither infer nor suspect a defection from Zwingli to Luther. Therefore, without any letters either from Leo or from me, Mayor Ziegler proposed in the council what you say he proposed; for he reported the most shameless lies about us. I beseech you, my dear Erasmus, to have better thoughts about us than to suspect that we would ever concede even a little from the confessed truth. What Benedict boasts, I do not know, but this I know: that the Apology of the Four Cities, for which we are criticized by some because we said we could bear it as not adverse to us, plainly and explicitly approves the Bern Disputation, which opposed the substantial and corporal presence of the body of Christ in the bread.</p>
      <p>And in my last letters to Benedict, I advised him that his justification made to me shows that he holds and teaches the same as Zwingli did before him. So far is it from being possible for him to extract from our letters that we are planning a defection to Luther, who boasts of a corporal and carnal presence. But if Benedict has proposed lies to me, he will bear the shame and disgrace, nor will he conceal it, and he will defend himself with lies perpetually. He indeed confessed to me in clear words that he does not believe that the sacraments bring grace; that the sign and the thing signified are joined only among the saints, that the impious receive nothing after the sign, but the pious receive the thing by the benefit of faith. I could not disapprove of this. Nor am I ashamed if he says that I do not disapprove of these things, nor do I think it offends you. But if he has lied to me about anything, I do not know; but once informed, I will not be silent. But if I certainly knew that he was abusing our letters and wanted to approve some defection with them, you would see, Erasmus, how ungrateful a thing he would do to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and think on those things which edify the church, and continue to advise me.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 24, 1536.</p>
