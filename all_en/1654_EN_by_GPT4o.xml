      <p>Greetings. I have returned home again, most illustrious and always esteemed brother; for some time I stayed in Urdorf for the sake of restoring my health. I am now waiting to see what progress I have made and whether the Lord wishes to bless me; for there are things that afflict my health. For this reason, I have written to you little or rarely for some time. In recent days, Mr. Wolfgang Haller, very well known to you, a young and mature man, pious and learned, succeeded Mr. Otto. Mr. Gessner has recovered, whom we all thought was certainly going to die; but the Lord has delivered us from that difficulty. Otherwise, we are all well now.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter to you, Heinrich Effrem from Cologne, is highly recommended as an honest and noble, pious and learned man, recommended to me by Mr. Calvin; but since he is seeking a position to teach and could not hope for anything here, as there are many professors among us, he has decided to go to you, as your school is more renowned. I therefore ask your kindness to recommend him to good and learned people, in case he is received and can benefit the students with his work, diligence, and study. He came to Geneva from France; for he studied for some time in Paris.</p>
      <p>Nothing is heard about the Emperor. I fear he will soon return with the detriment of many. War is waged, and in war, peace is negotiated for no other purpose than to weaken the strength of the German princes, increase expenses, and meanwhile, the Emperor can prepare himself; then there will be a solid war, now it is only a half war, just like our wars at Kappel, where they wanted to fight, and yet did nothing to the enemy; but when it came to them, they acted against us. May the Lord grant better things and deliver Germany from evil. I am very anxious.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord for holy and peaceful blessing. Farewell forever, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 12, 1552. Greet the brothers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the Basel church, his esteemed and very dear lord and brother. Basel.</p>
