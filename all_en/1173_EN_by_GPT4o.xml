      <p>Most illustrious man, when I returned from the Valtellina, where I had been drawn for the sake of Christ, I found that your letters had been delivered to my home, those in which you gave a response to my four letters. For this, I am most grateful to you; for not only did you do something extremely pleasing to me, but your speech greatly inspired the other brothers who are with us and who admire you wonderfully. I was about to set out on a journey to come to you; but partly business entangled me, partly the severe cold, which has been most harsh this year, held me back. But I will free myself in the month of April, as I see, and I will come straight to you. Meanwhile, see what one of the brothers, who recently defected from the Pope and lives with us, writes to you. I was the author for him, indeed I dictated in Italian, what he wrote to you in Latin. You see more; but I would think it advisable if these letters were spread throughout all of Germany not only in Latin but also in your vernacular language; for many minds would be moved, who would read both the indignation and that papal rage against you, and those things which he imprudently babbles about his council and about instituting new rites. I have written copiously about all these matters and about the whole council, but in the Italian language, and the book is already printed, which now Fr[anciscus] Niger, a very loving and good man of yours and very useful to the church (believe me), is translating into Latin. I will bring it myself to you, as I hope; but in the meantime, I would not think the translation and publication of this letter should be delayed, if it seems so to you. If I had your little work on the church, I could have translated it and still could; send it, I beg, as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I have a man with me skilled in the Slavic language, whom I will bring with me; but unless God inflames Edward's mind with his own fans so that he wishes to provide the expense, I will attempt the rest in vain. You work on this matter, brother, as much as you can, and also so that we can help the afflicted brothers and attack the kingdom of Satan with Italian pamphlets, which I also diligently do in this my poverty, and I clearly experience that I am troublesome and harmful to him, as God wills, who chooses the weak things of the world to confound the strong. I earnestly pray to you: give this Massurius letter to one of your disciples, say Josiah or Samuel, to be copied and send one copy to Mr. Haller, another to Mr. Theodor Beza; for he will communicate it to Mr. Calvin in my words. A certain Spaniard from the Salamanca family had a bishopric in Carinthia, but lived in Italy in a town of the Venetian domain, named Conegliano. He, the most avaricious of all mortals (as papist bishops are wont to be), had gathered a huge sum of money; but very recently one of his own strangled him and carried off the treasure and shortly after the rascal was caught and ended his life by the noose. The Duchess of Ferrara was still stuck in the mire of the mass to the great scandal and sorrow of the faithful; but recently she openly withdrew and cleansed herself to the great joy of our people. But at what time? Precisely when the Pharisees rage more. God lives and manifests himself everywhere in his own. Greet for me the whole church and the whole school, which I love and cherish from the heart. Pray for our churches to our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be honor and glory. Amen.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the Ides of February 1551.</p>
      <p>P[eter] Paul Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
