      <p>I am glad, most reverend sir, that you deign to write letters to me out of your kindness, which I would indeed enjoy even more if I had the material to respond to such a man; but I hope you will consider my spirit towards you more than my style. I have experienced your good will towards me more and more, as you have always been like a parent to me, not only in letters but also in deed. For when I was in Zürich, I enjoyed your company in all things; then, as I departed from Zürich towards Lausanne, you recommended me to the best of men in such a way that everything succeeded according to my wishes. Most recently, you were also not a small cause that the most illustrious and most Christian prince received me into his court or household. Now also, as you congratulate me on this my happiness and prescribe the virtues with which I ought to be endowed so that I may please both God and the prince, in this matter you show not only that you are especially concerned with my advancement, but also that your mind will not be satisfied until you see my affairs established in the place to which you have promoted me. Therefore, for this inclination of your mind towards me and the benefits bestowed, I first give and have great thanks, then I earnestly pray to the best and greatest God that he may preserve you and all yours safe in his grace and protection for a long time and that he may grant me and offer such an opportunity that I may be able to declare my grateful mind towards you in deed and actions to you and yours. Meanwhile, with God's help, I will strive to advance in piety and the studies of liberal virtues and arts, so that your most faithful precepts may seem to have had no small influence on me.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious prince and my most gracious lord is devoted with the greatest zeal to letters and good arts. I showed him your letters written to me, which, having been read with delight, he bade you farewell with a calm mind. If you ever write to him, without a doubt you will do something most pleasing. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Geneva, May 3, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Philipp, Baron von Hohensax, etc. Swiss.</p>
