      <p>To Rudolf Weingartner, Bishop of the Tuggen, grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You requested in your recent letter that we prepare for you very brief declamations on Luke 6:20ff and Matthew 16:13ff. Regarding the former gospel, we have this: Just as in Matthew chapter five [Mt 5:13ff], Christ interprets the law, so in this place he teaches that the law requires the spirit, that we believe, Galatians 3:2ff, and love, 1 Timothy 1:5ff, Romans 13:8ff. Meanwhile, he also attacks the interpretations of the Pharisees, hence in the same Matthew: "Unless your righteousness exceeds" etc. [Mt 5:20]. In this place, after he has long labored in explaining the law, he finally sums it up and says: "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful" [Lk 6:36], who, since "he allows his sun to rise on the good and the evil," Matthew 5:45, you likewise do good to both benefactors and malefactors. And it is a place of charity, which is required here, which has mercy on the neighbor, 1 John 3:10ff, which does not rashly judge a brother, Romans 14:10ff, condemns no one, that is, does not slander, Psalm 15:3, and forgives everyone their offense: Matthew 6:12, 18:21ff. In summary, charity never fails to do good, gives a full measure and receives: 2 Corinthians 8:13ff. And thus far about the law, how it requires charity.</p>
      <p>Now he also blames the Pharisees with their interpretation, saying: "Can a blind man lead a blind man?" [Lk 6:39]. The Pharisees, being blind, without faith and mercy, could not be of any help to the unlearned; for it cannot be that a disciple is above the teacher. The Pharisees, however, are teachers, yet blind, therefore it was necessary for the people to be blind; for the same perfection is in the disciples as in the teacher. In the teachers none, therefore in the disciples none. It is necessary that we perform the same deeds that we teach with our mouth: "Why do you see the speck" etc. [Lk 6:41]. On this matter, see Romans 2:17ff. In summary, charity is primarily required by God in the law and is the perfection of the law. And whoever wants to teach others must himself be learned, and whoever wants to correct anyone in any matter must himself be free from that vice. Hence to Timothy Paul says: "A bishop must be irreproachable" [1 Tim 3:2].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in Matthew 16, Christ wanted to show his people of the new testament once what is required of them and that they are those who confess Jesus to be the Christ. First, however, it is required that they believe, that is, faith is required: Hebrews 11:1ff, Romans 10:6ff. "Who do you say that I am?" [Mt 16:15]. That faith does not come from us, but from God alone: John 6:44. "Flesh and blood" etc. [Mt 16:17]. That faith is by which we confess and believe in our heart that Christ is the Son of God, who has granted us life by his passion and resurrection and is righteousness and satisfaction before the Father: John 6:40, Romans 4:24f, 10:9, 1 Corinthians 1:30. "You are the Christ" [Mt 16:16].</p>
      <p>Those who bear this faith in their heart and confess it with their mouth are founded upon the rock Christ, 1 Corinthians 3:11, 1 Peter 2:2ff, 1 Corinthians 10:4 and "upon this rock" [Mt 16:18]. Therefore, neither death nor hell prevails against them, because "death is swallowed up" etc., 1 Corinthians 15:54, and faith is victory, Matthew 16:16ff, 1 John 5:4, and "those who belong to Christ crucify the flesh," Galatians 5:24, so that the remnants of sin are not counted, Romans 8:2ff, "and the gates of hell shall not prevail" [Mt 16:18]. But so that all the faithful might know about that victory and salvation, apostles are chosen and to them are given the keys, by which this salvation is unlocked, namely the word of the gospel. On this matter, Zwingli is more precise in "Commentary, On the Keys". Farewell now.</p>
