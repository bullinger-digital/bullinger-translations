    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Recently, Enzinas entrusted an employee [...] of the printer Christoph [Froschauer] with his letter to Bullinger [No. 2694] along with a package of books. It contained some smaller prints for [Hieronymus] Sailer. Enzinas is now sending books for Sailer again with the current messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] How does Bullinger like the terrible story [of Juan Diaz]? He will certainly have to admit that this matter required a report! But what should one do if no writer is available for it? Then one must take up the pen oneself, even if one is neither a very good writer nor a historian, to fully meet the demands of the scholars. It is important that [now also] the latter are informed about this incident. Perhaps Enzinas will write something better about it someday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] [Oswald] Myconius has shown Enzinas the letter from Bullinger addressed to him [No. 2695]. What a sad message! Almost the same was reported from Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] From [Hieronymus] Sailer, however, much more pleasant news was learned. In a skirmish, 2000 riders of the Emperor [Charles V] are said to have been killed. He himself fled to Lauingen with 8 riders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] If Bullinger learns anything new about the last news or anything else, he would like to report it. If he furthermore receives anything verified about the Baden Diet, he should write about it to Sailer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. In recent days, I wrote to you through the servant of Christoph the printer, to whom I entrusted a small package of books, which I believe has been delivered to you. It contained some other small items to be sent to Sailer. Again, through this messenger, I am sending other booklets, which I earnestly request you to forward to the same Sailer.</p>

      <p>I wish to know from you how you find the rather grim little story. The subject matter, as you could clearly see from the content itself, was certainly worthy of someone skilled to work on it. But what can one do when there is no one among those who can handle such subjects with praise, who would take it up? Surely, our intention will be commendable, even if the effort does not fully satisfy the ears of the learned. I certainly cannot help but regret that something might have been detracted from the dignity of the matters due to the weakness of the speech and perhaps a more disordered arrangement. However it may be, it will be helpful to have provided the subject to the more learned, and if life permits and something better can be accomplished by us, we will not neglect the opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Myconius showed me your letters, which brought us very sad news, even though the same had previously been reported to us from Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, later we learned quite the opposite. Specifically, I received from Sailer news of the Emperor's defeat, in which two thousand of his cavalry fell in a small battle, and he himself was forced to flee to Lauingen with eight horsemen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Whatever you have, whether about this defeat or otherwise, share with us, and if you have received anything certain about the Swiss Diet, inform Sailer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my words. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 6, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
