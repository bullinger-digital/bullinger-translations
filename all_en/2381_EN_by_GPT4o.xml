      <p>Greetings. The Christian work that I had thought to bring forth into the light soon, I have been compelled to keep a little longer in the womb by some brothers here who are not to be disregarded, and who are moved by many and not insignificant reasons. "There is no need," they say, "to spur on the tyrants, who are already eager to rage against the children of God, by publishing our books at this time, especially when almost everywhere, but particularly in France and England, countless people are detained in prisons for the sake of religion, and indeed they are very learned men and adorned with every kind of virtue, whose safety we must consult by whatever means we can, and not in any way incite the rulers to their death. This is demanded by Christian charity." You see, most learned Bullinger, what has chiefly led me to follow their advice at present, and to decide to keep in the womb for a little while longer the work I was already laboring to bring forth. Such is the situation with that work you were expecting. However, the one you were not expecting, nor was I thinking of bringing forth, indeed the one I had scarcely conceived from philosophical seed, I was somehow compelled to bring into the light quickly, so that I was forced to make an abortion. It displeases me indeed, so much so that I am even ashamed for anyone to see it; but nevertheless, since it has been born in this way, so that I do not fail in my duty and obligation, I send it to you, such as it is, with its nurse. If anything displeases you either in me as the parent or in the work itself, it will be your concern, as candid as you are, to advise me, and mine, as is fitting, to obey you, yet to take these my childish things in good part. Farewell and love me. Strasbourg, September 2, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you, H[ieronymus] Zanchi. To the most learned and excellent pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, as to a most revered father. Zürich.</p>
