      <p>S. D. I received your letter, honorable and most beloved brother, dated July 6th, promptly and was grieved that the pious had rejoiced in vain for so long, as I understand from you that what was considered certain about Condé's victory is false. Again, I received some consolation from the fact that you now report with certainty from the letters written by the most illustrious prince to the people of Lyon that peace might already be established. May it be pious, stable, and just!</p>
      <p>However, as I write this, letters brought from the Swiss camp, who are serving under Frölich, are shown to me, from which I understand that Guise deceitfully withdrew and pretended peace, while he intended to achieve something else, and thus the Swiss are called to Paris and commanded to hurry. If these things are true, as I fear, I pray to the Lord that He may open Condé's eyes and see that nothing should be done with these cunning robbers, and that they should not be trusted at all. If only he had not doubled the expenses for so long and neglected the good opportunity with delay! But we will pray to the Lord to assist in these nearly desperate matters. Today I received letters from Chur and Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hercules von Salis greets you.</p>
      <p>Good men from Rhaetia advise and urge me to inform you diligently, to inform the lords, especially the most illustrious prince and admiral, not to neglect the Rhaetians, but to send an envoy to them with letters, etc.; for the Rhaetians are ready to send an equipped army. Fabritius writes to me in these words: "I fear that if our people see themselves being neglected, the ardor with which they are inflamed in this cause for Condé will turn into indignation. Do what you think is best." Hercules also writes that soldiers are being gathered in Bologna by the Pope, who are to be sent to Provence. Other good men warn that shortly 4000 Swiss papists will be enlisted by the Pope, and several leaders are named, and it is certain that some from the Immontani have been to Trento and have already returned home, boasting that Madrutz, Lazarus von Schwendi, and Count von Helfenstein will gather German soldiers for Savoy against the French and Bernese. And I could mention many things of this kind, from all of which I gather that the impious are planning great things.</p>
      <p>It would therefore be timely for Condé to also look after his own affairs and those of the pious. I hope you have received my letters written at the beginning of this month about these matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all the brothers, especially Budé and Jonville, and continue to write to us diligently and frequently about what is happening in France; for we can make good use of this information. Zurich, July 17, 1562.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet our Beza for us, who alone is in danger for all of us.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. John Calvin, minister of the church of Geneva, his esteemed and most beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
      <p>Quickly.</p>
