      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord! That craftsman from Cremona came to me bearing letters from Vergerio; I also entrusted to him the packet I had eight days ago. He is hastening to Geneva to live there by his craft and to be secure from severe persecution. He will undoubtedly inform you about Italian affairs.</p>
      <p>I would write more, but the courier is in too much of a hurry; in eight days, if I find a suitable courier, I will write about everything. Philippus Gallicius has become a colleague of our church, a learned man and patient in labor; he will often write to you in our name. Farewell. From Chur, 22nd of February, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Be so kind as to greet Franz with his family in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and esteemed lord.</p>
