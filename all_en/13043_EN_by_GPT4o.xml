    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As Myconius learned again from Konstanz, Emperor Charles V is pursuing the plan of a reunited religion, which he wants to impose on all of Germany. What will become of this? A bad tree does not bear good fruit! Only the willingness to repent could please the [Protestants]. Hopefully, God will intervene if the Emperor undertakes something against His word! He will hardly have anything else in mind now, after the Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, has been reinstated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is learned from Strasbourg that the Emperor wants to winter there and is already expected. A noble refugee [...] said the Emperor wants to go to Strasbourg, Speyer, and Mainz and will never leave Germany again in his lifetime.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Vadian wrote to a friend [...] that recently St. Gallen and Schaffhausen were summoned to the Augsburg Reichstag with splendid documents. Is this summons perhaps identical to the one that was also sent to Basel? The Emperor is thus courting the Confederation, which he will attack at the first opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is said that the people of Lucerne did not come to the Zurich shooting festival and the participation of the people of Konstanz is questionable. Myconius is amazed at both, as he almost had the impression that the festival was organized because of the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The plans of the French King Henry II are not clear. He already has three troops with mercenaries and wants to muster a fourth in the coming spring. He was anointed king but not yet crowned (allegedly for significant reasons). Thus, the world plays its game!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Myconius is worried about the Gospel, as people are turning away from it more and more and show no willingness to repent. Love is growing cold, even among those who proclaim it. God help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, John Hooper, and his wife Anne [née t’Serclaes].</p>

      <p>S. From Konstanz, I have again learned about the common religious order that Emperor Charles V is instituting, which he intends to spread throughout all of Germany by edict. What do you think? Can a bad tree produce good fruit? What will happen then? Only repentance could please us. I would hope that the Lord will awaken, after he attempts to lay his hand on His word, unless perhaps he is attempting something else - which I do not think, now that the Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, has been reinstated.</p>

      <p>It is reported from Strasbourg that the same Emperor has chosen it for his winter quarters and is expected; this was communicated to me from there in recent days. A noble exile here reports that the Emperor has chosen Strasbourg, Speyer, and Mainz, where he will henceforth reside, never to leave Germany again.</p>

      <p>Vadian wrote to a certain friend that St. Gallen and Schaffhausen were recently summoned to the Reichstag with the most splendid documents. I do not know if this is the same as the summons by which our people were called. In summary: He is courting Switzerland, which he will seek to attack if he can, when the opportunity arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There is a rumor here that the people of Lucerne did not come to that shooting festival, and it is doubtful whether the people of Konstanz have arrived. I would be surprised at both if it were so. I was almost convinced that the meeting was organized because of the people of Konstanz.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>No one knows what the French King Henry II is planning. He has three armies of German soldiers and is about to enlist a fourth by next spring. He was recently anointed, but not yet crowned. They say there are great reasons for delaying that coronation. Thus, the world plays its game.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am very fearful for the Gospel, as I see it declining more and more every day among everyone, and no one turns to repentance. We all grow cold in love, even those of us who teach love. May the Lord help us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and all other pious people. Please convey my greetings to John Hooper and his excellent wife in the Lord. Basel, August 18, 1547. Yours, O. M.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the best minister of Christ, his venerable lord in Christ. Zürich.</p>
