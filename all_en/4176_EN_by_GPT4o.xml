      <p>Greetings. The rest with Mr. Valentin.</p>
      <p>Siderhar was informed by Georgius Carly through the proconsul (for he himself went abroad), he knows for certain that the papal [...] in Glarus are fleeing with their treasures, partly to Gr√§pelen, partly elsewhere. This you certainly know; but if you do not, warn the pious people of Glarus, and be vigilant; it is a sign of war and a premonition. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord.</p>
