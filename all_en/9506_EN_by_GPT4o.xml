      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, reverend lord and godfather, and I thank you greatly for sharing with us what was written to you from Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>We were very pleased with it; if only we could soon hear these things confirmed by other trustworthy sources as well. Letters have been brought to Lord Friedrich Hesse from Italy, which I quickly transcribed after Mr. Conrad Beldius translated them into the German language, and I am sending them to you here, so that if by chance you had not heard of this from anyone else before, you might learn here in passing about this victory against the Turks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Amann Schuler, Mr. Treasurer, Beldius, and the scribe Elmer, to whom I also showed your letters, send their greetings to you and yours. They also thank you greatly.</p>
      <p>My wife, along with the whole household, wishes you well. In haste. Glarus, November 27, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hugo, your godfather.</p>
      <p>Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Franciscus Madius, the prefect, passed away, who was of great authority among us and a fierce enemy of evangelical truth, and in the recent Glarus discord, he, along with the Five Cantons of the Swiss, strongly incited against the followers of Christ.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
