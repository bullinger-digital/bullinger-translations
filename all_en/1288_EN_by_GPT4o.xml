      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father through Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Here are the letters for you, most esteemed and beloved Bullinger. I therefore return you to yourself, so that it may be most true, as he said: "All return to their origins and seek their mother," although I wish they could have stayed longer with the same host, with whom they have been so familiar until now, if it had not seemed otherwise to God who arranges all things. However, I do not want to hide from you, relying on your kindness, that I have kept one or two for myself; for it seemed unworthy that the writings of so many illustrious men to Vadianus (Joachim von Watt) should be with me, while yours, of which there was such a multitude and which I especially delighted in, were completely lacking. From these, I chose those that came into my hands during the collection, where mention was made of your works, wherever you promise commentaries on the letters of Paul, the Gospel of Matthew and John, etc. For your autograph itself pleases me gently and from it to know the promises you have made with such faith, learning, clarity, and supreme judgment to countless witnesses. For this reason, that letter also stayed with me, in which you inquire whether the body of Christ, due to its union with the Word, inseparably takes on conditions foreign to the body, and this is more pleasing because we read the response to this, as clear and learned, so also most salutary against the pestilential opinions of certain ill-disposed men. That letter also stayed, in which you enumerate the coins of admirable antiquity, which Vadianus, not unaware that I am very thirsty for antiquity, kindly showed me. Where I saw that shekel, of which you make mention in Matthew, also Themistocles and that Athenian ox with the greatest observation and admiration. Therefore, a most delightful letter, because it commemorates monuments that we have remaining from that antiquity. I also retained the autograph of the letter to you from Philipp Melanchthon, in which it is evident how candidly the most learned man judged your commentaries on the Gospel of John, and if there are any other things of that kind, in which there is no danger, but much splendor and grace.</p>
      <p>I read and preserved by Vadianus's order these last two given to Vadianus, the final farewell. In which matter, if I have done anything unworthy of our duty and friendship, forgive, most humane Bullinger, this offense committed by excessive observation of you. Therefore, if you also wish these to be returned home, I will ensure they are delivered to you with the utmost faith; but if I have obtained by prayers that they remain with me, you will do something not just pleasing but most pleasing to me; for such testimonies are to me like a treasure and a great part of the wealth with which I delight. Moreover, that you have received me into the family of your friends with such an open embrace and sealed it with a symbol of perpetual friendship, I cannot congratulate myself enough, nor could anything have been more important to me. For this immortal gift, I give and hold immortal thanks. If only I could in some way testify in return how much I value you and how fervently I love you. Farewell, most esteemed teacher, and as you have begun, continue to love me. St. Gallen, May 22, 1551. Please convey our greetings to Mr. Pellicanus, Theodor, Gwalther, Gessner, Frisius, the best and most learned men. Keep our church, which is Christ's, in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler of St. Gallen, yours. To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
