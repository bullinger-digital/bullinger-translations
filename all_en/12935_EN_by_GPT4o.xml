    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In Konstanz, letters are continuously arriving, mentioning an agreement between Duke Maurice of Saxony and the Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. The Elector is said to have shown himself friendly towards the Duke. However, he did not want to pardon the councilors of the young Maurice because they had led him astray. The estates of both Saxonies also wish to stand together and not let foreigners into the country. Similar reports are coming from Nuremberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Shortly before, however, King Ferdinand and Duke Maurice are said to have sent 15 companies to Emperor Charles V. These unknowingly set up their night camp only five miles from the electoral Saxon troops. The latter then advanced during the night, attacked early in the morning, and destroyed 12 companies. However, the cavalrymen on both sides did not participate in the battle to avoid fighting against friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Because the Emperor can no longer obtain provisions, it is feared that he will move back to the Danube.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is reported that the Bohemians have rebelled and the King is executing the most significant nobles, starting with [Count Hieronymus von] Schlick. Others claim that the Bohemian nobility has eventually defected to the Emperor. These reports are likely false.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is strange that there is hardly any news about the neighboring Catholic priests and their allies!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The imperial mercenaries, especially those left behind in Augsburg and Ulm, are highly dissatisfied and deserting because they are poorly paid. It is also said that the Emperor is in poor health and lacks money and soldiers. Although he expects new soldiers, he probably will not have money for them. He could only wage war for so long because wealthy merchants provided him with tons of gold.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Vadian has still not sent the records [about the Baden Diet of March 28]. How negligent, especially since several people from St. Gallen have come to Konstanz in the last two days! These records would be so useful to Blarer. Hopefully, everything will go well at the Solothurn Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In Konstanz, things are still as Blarer last reported. May the Lord protect His own from a deceptive security!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Enclosed is a highly confidential document written by a pious layman [...]. Blarer could only keep it for half a day before he had to send it on. Therefore, he could only make a copy of it in haste. Besides the discreet and cautious Konrad Pellikan, with whom Bullinger is now staying [at the Urdorf Bath], no one should know about it. What does Bullinger think about it? The author would be willing to elaborate on the document in a dialogue. Bullinger should return it at the next opportunity, as Blarer has only this one copy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings to Pellikan. May God grant him and Bullinger a good bath so that they can better serve the troubled church! Blarer would have liked to join the bathers, but he had no good excuse for it, especially since he is currently (thank God!) in good health. The bathers should pray for Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is said to be preparing. Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz are still in Konstanz. Hopefully, Blarer will soon be able to convey good news!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] He thanks Bullinger for his detailed letter [No. 2881] and wishes to be informed immediately about the meeting in Solothurn. Last Sunday [April 17], the Englishman John Butler brought a greeting from Vadian, but (and how strange!) not the aforementioned documents!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings to Hans Schöner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Best wishes for Bullinger and Pellikan at the bath!</p>

      <p>It is consistently reported here that Duke Maurice has reconciled with the Elector and is being treated very amicably, but his advisors, who led the young blood astray, are not to be pardoned. The two territories, Saxony and Duke Maurice's, have also pledged to stand together, putting their lives and goods together and not allowing any foreigners into their lands. This is also continuously reported from Nuremberg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Recently, and just before the agreement, the King and Duke Maurice sent 15 companies of soldiers to the Emperor. They camped five miles away from the Saxon troops without suspecting anything. However, the Saxons marched all night and unexpectedly attacked them in the morning, destroying 12 companies. The cavalry on both sides held their positions and watched, not wanting to attack each other, as they were friends.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor is reportedly unable to receive provisions, leading to concerns that he might retreat back to the Danube.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Bohemians are said to be very active and have gathered with force (although there is a rumor that the Bohemian nobility has nevertheless sided with the Emperor), and the King is now executing the most prominent in Bohemia, starting with Schlick. However, according to credible reports, this may not be true, also due to other credible reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is hardly any news about our priests and their relatives. I do not know what the reason is.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The soldiers in the garrisons of the cities are being poorly paid. Therefore, some are deserting and are dissatisfied in Augsburg and Ulm. The Emperor is said to be weak in body, wealth, and troops, but he expects fresh troops. Regarding money, it is believed that it will be difficult for him, because if some wealthy merchants had not previously advanced him gold, he and his people would not have been able to sustain the war for so long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The records have not yet reached me from Dr. Vadian, which I regret very much, as he is so negligent. People from St. Gallen have been here for the past two days, and I would have liked to have them for certain reasons. God willing, everything will be handled well in Solothurn.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Everything around us is still as it was previously reported to you. May God graciously keep us in peace and protect us from all evil security, etc.</p>

      <p>Herewith I send you a writing from a good pious man. It was only in my hands for half a day. I had to send it away immediately and therefore copied it in haste and wanted to let you read it in the highest confidence. However, per amicicię nostrę fidem te obtestor, do not reveal anything about this to anyone, except perhaps to Pellicanus, who is with you now, whom I know to be a prudent and discreet man. Write your opinion on what you think of this judgment. It was sent to me in the highest confidence by a layman who intends to put the essence of this argument into a dialogue and elaborate further. But with the next opportunity, you should send it back to me and not fail to do so, as I have no other copy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>To the most pious man, Dr. Pellicanus, convey my most abundant greetings in the Lord. May He grant that you may bathe happily, so that you may still be able to serve the afflicted church for a long time. I would have liked with all my heart to join your company, if it were allowed by any honest pretext. But in the meantime, I must give thanks to my Savior Christ, that my healthy body does not need this remedy at this time. Commend us and our church to the Lord very diligently!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Landgrave is said to be in somewhat considerable preparation. The leaders Schertlin and Marcell are still here. I hope to write you adventurous news soon. May God arrange everything with grace!</p>

      <p>Thank you for your diligent writing with a request to inform me promptly about what you will learn from the day in Solothurn. Vadianus sent me a greeting last Sunday through our Englishman (Butlerus was in St. Gallen). I am disappointed that he did not send me the records.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Convey greetings to Schöner.</p>

      <p>May God let you and the pious Pellicanus bathe well and happily, I wish from the heart. Dated April 20th.</p>
