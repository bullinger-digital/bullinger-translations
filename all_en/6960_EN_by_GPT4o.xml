      <p>Revered father, greetings. Philipp is preparing an expedition against our people in Flanders, and seven thousand Spaniards have already landed in Genoa; they will winter in the Duchy of Milan and set out for Flanders in early spring. Philipp is also expected daily. I write what is certain, I leave the rest to common rumor.</p>
      <p>Due to the persecution that is raging in Italy, some are continually fleeing to us. We are all well; I pray to God that He may also preserve you and all the children for a long time. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, December 12, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Hieronymus Zanchi.</p>
      <p>I would have sent to you and to the other brothers, who are accustomed to gift me with your new writings, some copies of my book as a token of gratitude; but none have yet been sent to me. Therefore, accept my good will. To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy and revered father of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
