      <p>Greetings. For your service, most excellent and learned Bullinger, I give immense thanks and will ensure that you understand it is not misplaced, although there was no need to spur a horse that runs willingly. I am otherwise of a mind most ready to gratify both you and all pious and learned men, and especially the republic. There was much less need to send anything for your booklets, which I did not give to Froschauer in Frankfurt for this reason, that something should be sent by you in return, to whom I thought, and still think, many more should be sent due to your merit, if you wished. However, because you wish this coin to be with me as a pledge and token of friendship, I have gladly received it and will diligently ensure to preserve it in your favor, as long as I live. I have already begun your sermons on the Apocalypse, as you will see from the sample, which I send to Froschauer or rather to you; I only wish I could hope to satisfy Froschauer as easily as I do you. I will certainly strive to copy faithfully, from which today I was very nearly diverted by changing a single word, when on page 4 of the first quire, which I also send here, I read that you called Epiphanius the bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, where, since I do not dare to write Salamis with a diphthong, I would have preferred to put bishop of Constantia in Cyprus (for thus the Greek inscription of Epiphanius has it), although I am not unaware that in Suidas it is [Greek]. Therefore, I left it as Salamis, as your autograph had it, and I will do the same henceforth, wherever I find something tolerable that might seem to me ineptly curious in your writings. One thing pains me, that the copy is not better written, which I would have done myself if the shortness of time allowed; for I will hasten the edition for the next fair, as much as it is in my power, with the greatest effort; for I have already understood sufficiently that it is desired by many. Therefore, because it will have to be reprinted not long after in the so-called octavo format, if any lighter errors have crept into the first edition, it will be easier to ensure they are avoided in the second. I hope the same will happen shortly with the second edition of your Orations, for which in the meantime I would wish something could be found by you that might be added to the second edition, so that with some addition the second edition might come forth to the public at the next (as I hope) fair; for I hope all the remaining copies I have will be sold at the next fair. And I wish that I could have printed your sermons at my own expense and risk through Froschauer, as I desired it to be done in my name. But what he was reluctant to permit me, he will perhaps be compelled to permit another to reprint. For I do not think there will be a lack of Genevans, if there are no others, whom I have understood to be so greatly desirous of this book, that some have even affirmed they would translate it into French. But I cease, and pray to the Lord, that He may preserve both you and me and all the pious for a long time for the glory of His name and the benefit of both the literary and ecclesiastical republic.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and forgive these our trifles; for it is not permitted otherwise.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Oporinus, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To D. Theodor, Gualther, Gesner, Frisius, etc., friends, give many greetings in my name on occasion.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
