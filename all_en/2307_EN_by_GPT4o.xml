      <p>Greetings. Therefore, I will do as you advise, most honorable and learned Bullinger, and write more often, but briefly and only about necessary matters; this is also required by the friendship confirmed between us in Christ and the Christian piety we profess, which is nurtured and preserved more by actions themselves than by many words. I am truly amazed that among the professors of the gospel, there are those who do not approve of your most pious and at the same time most learned little book "On the Grace of God"; but what... This is the nature of the world, my ever most esteemed Bullinger (as no one is unaware), to disapprove of what should be approved and to approve of what should be disapproved. Here certainly (as far as I know) there is no learned person who does not also approve of almost all your other works, since the matters themselves are openly confirmed by the word of God. I thank you for loving me and not undervaluing my respect towards you; this is your humanity and piety.</p>
      <p>Your son is very dear to me, and in whatever matter I can assist him, I will not fail. I always see him attending both theological and philosophical lectures, both those of Dr. Peter and mine, and he listens not without benefit; however, I have not yet had the opportunity to test him. He listens well. I have often offered myself, and he knows I will always be available to him. As for your request for the treatise I had on restraining heretics to be either printed or at least a copy sent to you, after thanking you for valuing my trifles so highly, know that I have brought almost nothing new except the method, which is not always the same for everyone, that has not been said before by others, including you, Dr. Bullinger, and the most pious Dr. Calvin. However, I will send a copy, to comply with your wish, once I have completed it; I have indeed completed it in the school, but in the meantime, I am waiting for a certain book published and printed this year by someone unknown about not killing heretics, so that if perhaps any new arguments against sound doctrine are found there, I may refute them, and then send it to you, so that if you judge anything needs to be corrected, explained, added, or removed, you may correct, explain, add, or remove it. Then indeed, if you and other learned men judge it to be useful to the Church of Christ, I will ensure, as you first urge, that it is printed; for I wish nothing of my works to be published without consulting learned and pious men, especially you, Dr. Calvin, and Dr. Peter Martyr, and that all things may ultimately be done for the glory of the Lord and the benefit of the Church of Christ. My wife sends you great thanks and prays for your perpetual health. Farewell, most learned Bullinger, and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, June 10, 1554.</p>
      <p>Zanchi, most devoted to you.</p>
