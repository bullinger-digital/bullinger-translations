      <p> Greetings. I wrote to you yesterday and the day before yesterday, which I assume you have received, and I now await your reply. However, so that I do not let this messenger leave without a letter (even though I have nothing new to add to my previous ones), I wanted to send you this single line; for in these turbulent times, great diligence is needed both in prayers and in sharing counsel. It is rumored, though uncertainly, that Cond√©, having gathered his forces, is marching towards Paris, and if he were wise, he would do this in time and target the very head of the war and the torch of all evil, Guise, before he can increase his forces! What your people have written to ours or what ours will respond, I do not know. We rely on God's providence for nothing, except that we do not have to open the mills against the Confederates; we would otherwise pray for them to stay at home. And if we could achieve this one thing, we would have accomplished something; but I fear we are just watching until it also comes to us; for then we will do nothing. I am strongly advocating that a delegation be sent to Solothurn to speak with the Confederates, to see if they can be persuaded to send a common peace delegation before any outbreak occurs. Our people fear peace almost as much as war, believing that if they are disarmed, they will be the first to be slaughtered. I do not yet know what will happen, whether a delegation will be sent or not; but be assured, if you send one, ours will send one too. May God graciously help His church. </p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 23, around noon.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I received your letter dated April 19 along with Beldius's letter, to whom I ask you to ensure this is safely delivered. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
