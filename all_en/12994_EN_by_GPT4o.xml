    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer received all of Bullinger's letters [not preserved] at the same time. He thought that with the letter he had entrusted to the young Maximilian [Seemann], he had communicated that it would be good if, in the matter of Hans Schöner, personal letters were first written to the Augsburg mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser, and only then letters to the entire Augsburg council. Wasn't the young Maximilian with Bullinger? And if so, what could he achieve with his request in Zurich? As soon as Blarer receives Bullinger's letters for the two mayors, he will add his own and ensure that everything reaches Augsburg as quickly as possible. Welser is to take a cure with his wife [Barbara, née Adler] in Pfäfers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Sebastian Schertlin sends his regards to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding the Diet, Blarer only learned that the Swiss cantons got along very well with each other. May this continue to be the case! Here, some boast that the Bishop of Constance, Johann von Weeze, successfully justified himself to the Swiss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If the copies [of Johannes Honter's] Geography have not yet been paid to the printer [Christoph Froschauer], Bullinger should do so. Blarer will ensure that Bullinger receives the money with the next reliable messenger. He has not yet seen the employee or the rider [...] who brought these copies. This person is said to have gone somewhere with a person from Constance [...] and will only return tomorrow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The excellent Englishman, John Butler, will report orally about Constance and England.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The people from Constance who returned from the wedding celebrated in Zurich [between Georg Escher vom Luchs and Dorothea von Menlishofen] were full of praise for the people of Zurich. Yes, they even felt uncomfortable because they cannot reciprocate this generosity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer encloses Bullinger's response [No. 2938] to the marriage matter with this letter. He is deeply grateful to Bullinger and God that the Zurich pastors share the same view as their colleagues in Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Whether he should ever respond to the other letter (Bullinger knows which one) is uncertain. He would know what to say, but he might express himself awkwardly. If he were in Zurich right now, he would secretly confide something to Bullinger that he might not yet know. May God turn everything for the best!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Blarer has nothing certain to report about the people of Constance. Butler knows what is being said here about Emperor Charles V. Some credible correspondents report that the Emperor is determined to win back the German cities [Mulhouse and Rottweil] that have become disloyal to the Empire by turning to the Swiss. He also wants to see if anyone would come to the aid of the people of Constance. The people of Zurich should pray for the people of Constance, for they are likely exposed to even greater danger than others!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] What was decided at the Diet regarding Joachim Mötteli von Rappenstein? It is about time that he is punished!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. I received all your letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. I believe I have informed you in the letter I sent through the young Maximilian about what I think regarding Schöner's case, namely that we should write to some private individuals, specifically the mayors Herbrot and Welser, to pave the way for letters to the council. Let me know if that young man was with you and what he achieved there. As soon as you send your letters, I will ensure that mine are added and delivered to Augsburg as soon as possible. I hear that Welser is taking a cure with his wife in Pfäfers.</p>

      <p>Our Schärtlin sends his regards and greets you most cordially.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding your Diet, we hear nothing here except that everyone is getting along very well, which, as they now affirm to be true, I pray to the Lord that it may always be said truly of them (the Swiss Diet). They boast here that our bishop has excellently justified himself to your people with great applause from all. If there is anything, please write to us diligently.</p>

      <p>If the copies of the Geography are not yet paid for, I ask you to settle it with the bookseller in my name, and I will send you the money with the next reliable messenger. I have not yet seen the servant or rider who brought them, and he has gone again with a fellow citizen of ours, whose name I do not know, and will return tomorrow or the day after.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our excellent Englishman, Butler, will faithfully report to you about what is happening here and in England.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our people returning from the wedding celebrated in Zurich speak wonderfully of your people's hospitality, even complaining that it was excessive! We have nothing with which we can properly respond.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I return the writing on marriage, giving you my greatest thanks and also to God through Christ Jesus, that your opinion so beautifully confirms ours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding the other letter, which you know, I am uncertain whether I will respond further. I certainly have something to say, but perhaps I would not say it well. I will let it rest. But if I were with you, I would whisper something in your ear that you might not have known before. May the dear God arrange everything and lead it to a good end with much grace. Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I have nothing certain to write about our affairs; they are still entirely uncertain. Butler knows what is being said here about the Emperor. Some credible correspondents write that the Emperor has clearly decided to bring the cities that the Swiss Confederates have taken from the Empire back to the Empire and to prove himself a greater supporter of the Empire. He also wants to see if anyone will take up the cause of the people of Constance, etc. Pray for us constantly! For it may be that we are involved in greater dangers than others, as we cannot be corrected by the blows of others.</p>

      <p>I would like to know how Joachim Möttlin fared at the Diet. It is time that he was punished.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Greet your household and friends. Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the people of Zurich, his dear brother, etc.</p>
