      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg we have this: Many of the princes have come here. The Imperial Majesty is here in power along with his consort, the three ecclesiastical electors of Mainz, Trier, Cologne, the bishops of Salzburg, Passau, Eichstätt, etc., along with other prelates. Also, the Duke of Saxony, the elector, along with his consort and brother, the Duke of Holstein, the Duke in Bavaria along with his consort and two eldest sons, the Duke of Jülich and Cleves, the Duke of Württemberg with his eldest son, Duke Eberhard, the Duke of Zweibrücken, Count Palatine Wolfgang, George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the Dukes of Legnica and Münsterberg, the Duke of Pomerania, the grandson of the Elector of Brandenburg, Margrave Charles of Baden, etc.</p>
      <p>Before this, on March 23, the Imperial Majesty made the proposition: 1. How to improve the division in religion and abolish the sects, and by sects, he means what is not aligned with the Roman Church and the Augsburg Confession; 2. About the police and coins; 3. About the Imperial Chamber Court and public peace; 4. About the Turkish defense and aid (this is the most important), where the Imperial Majesty desires urgent help, 8000 cavalry and 40000 infantry, and then a steady aid, for 6 years, a double Roman tax. This means the money must be collected. He initiates an unnecessary war in Hungary, and if he cannot bring the matter to a conclusion, he turns a private matter into an imperial matter. The young Austrian nobles want to inherit all the kingdoms, which is why Charles V waged war against France for so long, who also unjustly seized Milan, Gelderland, etc.; thus Maximilian turns to Hungary and Transylvania, sends Lazarus von Schwendi down, provokes the Turks with force, and stirs up the hornet's nest. And when they arm themselves, he cries murder and demands everyone to rush and help sweat in the bloodbath he has arranged, saying that the Turk is the hereditary enemy of Christendom, etc., against which no one dares to say: "Why do you provoke him, why do you not content yourself with your land and leave Hungary and Transylvania to those to whom they rightfully belong? We cannot put all of Germany in danger for your private matters." But the judgments of God prepare us for slaughter, which we have long deserved due to extreme impiety. One of our citizens, Heinrich Wegman, has said that the Elector of Heidelberg rode into Ulm with 500 horses, that he is traveling to Augsburg for the Imperial Diet, and he also spoke ill of him, saying that he has become a Zwinglian heretic, etc. God be with you.</p>
