      <p>Greetings. I recently sent you, most learned man, the dialogue of Paul Rasdorfer, which he titled Syfrid. If you have received it, which I do not doubt, you certainly received it flawed and poorly written in some places. Since I could not persuade him by any means to allow me to make a copy of his dialogue, I arranged for it to be transcribed by another of his not ordinary friends, so that I could keep my promise. While this person was neither skilled in Latin nor accustomed to his handwriting, he made errors in some words, but even so, you can easily discern the mind and opinion of him and all our preachers, which they now hold on the matter of the Eucharist, although this is scarcely a shadow of the absurdity they daily proclaim to the people with loud voices and lengthy speeches. But let this not be hidden from you: They are once again in discord, and indeed more seriously than ever before, to the extent that the council itself, with great effort, barely managed to restore peace; thus erupts a peace that is not forged by the spirit of God, and the exile, which they threatened upon me and others, almost befell them.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Kempten, August 5.</p>
      <p>Your Benedict Euander.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed master Heinrich Bullinger, the chief preacher of Zurich, his most revered lord, distinguished in piety and learning.</p>
