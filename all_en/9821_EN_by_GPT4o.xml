      <p>I am not only tormented, my dear brother Tobias, by the stone, but I am most miserably afflicted by the constant pains and most severe difficulties of the bladder and urine. For now it is plainly bloody, now very thick and green, like grass, now tinged with other colors, it barely flows. There are also frequent headaches and dissolutions of the whole body and its strength. In the meantime, however, I rejoice that I am gradually consumed by these my familiar and more than familiar diseases, so that I may not be forced to see the destruction of my homeland, which I fear is too near. But I may be forced to see more than I wish; may the will of the Lord be done, which is always holy and good. I pray to Him to have mercy on me and all of us. Although I am indeed weak and daily the inconveniences of old age increase, nevertheless I am engaged in unceasing labors.</p>
      <p>May you pray with me to the Lord to bless these labors. Farewell again. I wanted to add this to the appendix of your letter, so that you may know what my miserable condition is, etc. Praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, etc.</p>
