      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the Gospel in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, according to our agreement (regarding the chronicle with Mr. Röist, treasurer of Cham, Horgen, Lavater, and other supporters of the cause in Zurich), I am informed that Ägidius Tschudi from Glarus is also writing and intends to publish a chronicle; therefore, in my opinion, our work (however belated it may be) would nonetheless be somewhat more honorable for our lords of Zurich and the city. Therefore, I wish to solicit this without delay, and you may also, if you deem it advisable, inform Mr. Röist and others of this, as others are also on the verge of publishing, etc. I also think Lavater is good for the promotion of the cause. I would also like to provide a copy to everyone (if it proceeds). Therefore, do your best according to my trust, which I place solely in you (especially in this matter), and do not take this restless writing of mine amiss, for it concerns me to receive a comforting response from you, through which the remaining work might be easier for me. And whatever you wish to offer me in this regard, entrust it to Peter Wick at the White Cross, and commend it to the lord.</p>
      <p>Given on Sunday after Felicis and Regulae in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Stumpf.</p>
