      <p>Greetings. Your response was very welcome to me, because I feared that perhaps my letters, which I sent 14 days ago, had not reached you. You wisely advise about Titian, so that we may be more vigilant, lest such monstrosities insinuate themselves into our practices and cause irreparable harm to the church before they are noticed. You also wisely warned about the Servetus affair, because we are therefore privately and publicly more diligent in demonstrating and preserving true doctrine in that regard, and unless some secret monster is being nurtured, everything seems to be settled for tranquility.</p>
      <p>We receive the most calamitous news about the English, that is, by the latest decree of the queen and parliament, all Englishmen living outside the kingdom are banished to Italy, because they do not want them to have a residence in Germany or France, not even those who left the kingdom with the queen's permission, unless they want all their possessions confiscated and themselves proscribed as eternally absent, intending to exclude them from heaven and shut them in hell, if they could. But the Lord is the one who will not abandon those who seek and diligently honor His name with His principal spirit, so that they may establish any land as their homeland. And it is more fitting for us all to make an effort so that those turning to us may have a place and not be harshly rejected by us, as I have learned with some pain from your letters that this has been done by some.</p>
      <p>I strongly approve of the Locarno initiative, but I would like not only for that church to be purged of the suspicion of Anabaptism by a delegate, but also of certain other levities, which are said to have been discovered in them by the authorities, and punished with the consent of the evangelical orders, which, however, I have not been able to learn what kind they are, despite serious inquiry, and I suspect they are slanders, with which even the innocent are smeared out of hatred for religion. But their refutation will be easier for that reason. There are those who think he will come to us as well, which would be very pleasing to me, so that I may converse more familiarly with the man of God.</p>
      <p>I am sending here 6 copies of the Psalms impiously perverted, and this by the order of Prince Otto of the Palatinate, as you will understand from the letters of Diller included here. I know you will shudder at such furious impiety. But to what depths does the human mind not fall when once bound by the chains of Satanic superstition? It is worthwhile to know such things, so that the benefit of the evangelical light may be held in greater esteem and the purity of doctrine more diligently preserved. But you, my esteemed Bullinger, will rightly discern these things yourself according to your piety and judgment, I know. Therefore, farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours, whom I wish to greet reverently with my words. Basel, June 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
