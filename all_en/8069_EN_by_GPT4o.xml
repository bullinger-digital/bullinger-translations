      <p>S. D. In my recent letters to you, my brother, I have received no news from anyone about that French conflict, which makes me very suspicious. Certainly, the captains of the Swiss, who serve the king, write the story to their lords in such a plausible manner that they deserve some credibility. Since I can do nothing else, I cry out to the Lord: "And you, Lord, how long?" In the meantime, I acknowledge our wicked life, which does not correspond to the gospel of Christ, deserves these and harsher things, and I do not doubt that the Lord, against the unwilling gates of hell, will preserve His truth safe against those giants and boasters and has many reasons by which He can preserve His church in the midst of storms. In the meantime, we must be silent before God and live in faith and patience. In this matter, you must encourage yours. Moreover, you can hardly believe how much insolence these men swell with. A delegation is now being sent by all 13 dynasties of the Swiss to yours, to which our people have also allowed themselves to be joined, not as enemies, but as friends, who can extinguish or restrain the fervor of others. You cannot be ignorant of the cause. It concerns the bishop and his claim of 7000 florins along with the costs, for which a report and judgment are to be made. And if then the Gotthard League and the people of Salis still want to think that they are being treated too shortly: what can be settled with money should not be allowed to go further. It almost happened that a much greater harm followed, where nothing is better in a storm than to stand firm. I have written about this matter to Consul Willi and the Salis through our envoy, from whom you will learn more. He wishes well for the cause and would like it to be settled, so that nothing worse follows. You easily understand the rest. Therefore, I urge you to work for concord and not to advise more dangerous attempts for the sake of a sum of money.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and bless us! Farewell. The Lord be with you and your household. Speak with Mr. Karl and also commend this cause to him. Greet him most amicably, Pontisella, Ganthner, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 11, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
