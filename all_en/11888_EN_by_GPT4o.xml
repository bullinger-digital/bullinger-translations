    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Rümlang's letter [No. 1841] and consulted with others about it, but can only respond briefly. Working on a reply to a writing by Johannes Cochläus and considering dedicating it to the Bernese mayor [Hans Franz] Nägeli, although unsure if he would be pleased about it. Is saddened by the divisions among the Bernese pastors reported by Rümlang and praises his loyalty; if [Peter] Kunz should succumb to his illness, it is important to carefully consider who should be appointed in his place. The approach Rümlang suggests for overcoming the conflict is not promising; the Zurich council rejects further meetings and would not be willing to interfere in Bernese church matters. From Basel, there is a fear that it would take an opposing position, in Schaffhausen there is discord, and in St. Gallen, Vadian would mediate in favor of Bucer and Luther; since the matter would only be worsened by the intervention of the authorities, the only option is to hope in Christ and trust that time will reveal the true nature of the opponents; Rümlang should report if the teachings of Zurich are publicly attacked, so they can respond. Theodor [Bibliander] warns [Pierre] Toussain in a letter against engaging in [Württemberg] church customs. Request for more frequent writing and for an opinion on the dedication of the still unfinished writing against Cochläus, whose printing will begin soon. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your lengthy letters written about various matters, and I am all the more grateful for them, Eberhard, my dearest brother in the Lord. I have read them and discussed them with the main people, to hear their advice on this serious matter. What seemed right to them and to me, I will summarize as briefly as I can. For I am very much overwhelmed by both private and public affairs, and I am not one who is otherwise weak in mind and body, able to bear all these burdens. Certainly, I am not allowed even a full hour to breathe or to spend free from cares.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am now writing against Johannes Cochläus, who previously published a book against my little book on the authority and perfection of the scriptures. This Cochläus is the one who published a book against the Bernese Reformation. I am considering whether to dedicate the book to Mayor Nägeli, as I will openly mention the Bernese disputation. Perhaps I would not be doing something very pleasing to Nägeli; therefore, I am still considering it.</p>
      <p>But to the matter: I have learned with both sorrow and joy about the history you diligently wrote concerning the events in your church. I am sorrowful because the church, which has so far beautifully cohered in piety, is being disturbed and torn apart by the factions of a few ministers. May the Lord look upon it! However, I rejoice that I see the Lord not abandoning you with His grace, but continually stirring the minds of not a few who urge and defend truth and unity, opposing factions. To these, I pray, may He grant a greater spirit, so that what they do, they may do perpetually and sincerely, and not be worn out by any labors from the work they have begun. I especially praise your constancy and faith, Eberhard, and I pray that the Lord may always preserve you in His grace. If the Lord should take away Kunz, whom you write is afflicted, so that the church might become more peaceful, see that you do not misuse this opportunity. Then it is most necessary to be vigilant and to consult on who might succeed in the place of the deceased.</p>
      <p>This would be the only way to repair and recover lost matters. May the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the method you suggest for restoring concord does not seem to be a certain one, indeed it seems to all of us that more disturbances would arise from it, and that peaceful churches would be infected with contention and diseases. First of all, we know well that our magistrate will do nothing in this matter. For they have once decided to manage their own affairs (as it is said), to establish no new disputations, no assemblies for the sake of religion, but to remain in what they have once accepted and to wait until those come who teach better things. For they have learned from many arguments, and finally to their greatest detriment, that matters of religion do not proceed by treaties or assemblies. Nor is there any doubt that we would gravely offend them if we suggested such a thing to them. And if they were to respond conveniently, they would respond with nothing other than that the Bernese have their own ministers, their own church, their own governance, into which they do not wish to insert themselves uninvited. They have disputed and certain articles of religion, to which they wish to adhere and in which they testify to remain, as the delegates who come to Baden testify. Nor would it be without great scandal if they were to stir up that wasp's nest in these ulcerated times. And similar things to these.</p>
      <p>You know what we can hope for from the people of Basel. I fear that they may oppose both you and us. I can promise nothing solid from Schaffhausen. They are divided by factions. There are papists, Anabaptists, evangelicals, Franciscans, Epicureans, and I do not know what worse. St. Gallen has only Vadian, who would intervene as an arbitrator in the conflict and take care by all means that nothing is taken away from Bucer or Luther. But I do not know what kind of pact and agreement would be formed by the magistrates, even against the will of the ministers. Therefore, to have such people come together, to consult on matters of religion, to remove the sacramental dissension, what else would it be than to make a bad matter worse? I have attended so many assemblies; but I know that with matters continually deteriorating, they have never ended with matters happily concluded.</p>
      <p>For just as arts and practices are never not exercised, so they especially reign in such assemblies. Therefore, I would wish that you would lay aside that persuasion of yours that through assemblies tranquility would be restored to the church. What then will happen? Shall we despair and offer the herb to that sordid kind of people? By no means. There are many things we can do in the meantime; there is what time and especially Christ will do. Christ will not abandon His own, even if He exercises them with these troubles in the meantime. He is to be invoked, He is to be prayed to. He walks among the lampstands and holds the stars in His right hand. Time reveals all things, and truth is the daughter of time. We have not fought for several years. Enemies have seemed to many to be friends. Yet with time, as it is said, they show what they are, and by acting badly, they make their own cause worse. Just wait and see what will happen next. They will not cease to paint themselves with their own colors until they are recognized by all. They will provide a very ample opportunity for acting with fruit and glory. What will we do in the meantime? We will be vigilant; we will defend the business of truth, purity, sincerity, simplicity with words, deeds, writings.</p>
      <p>If you hear your people criticizing the ministers for what we do, what we teach, write, publish, if they have done this so clearly and in the presence of witnesses that they cannot retract what they have once spat out, report this. Thus, perhaps there will be an opportunity to write to the senate and to those who criticize us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Theodor writes now to Toussain about the common cause of religion; he exhorts him not to allow himself to be entangled in ceremonies, etc. This too will contribute greatly to the defense of the truth. See to it that Toussain receives these letters and quickly. Perhaps the brothers, the ministers of the duke, think that matters are being conducted with our knowledge; but they will understand that they are being conducted without our knowledge, indeed with us as enemies.</p>
      <p>This is what I could write amidst the greatest affairs. Nor do we have anything better now. But I pray that you write more frequently. I also wish to hear your advice on the dedication of the response to Cochläus's book, whether you advise it to be inscribed to Nägeli or another who would be delighted by the dedication. But within the first eight days, the first sheet will be printed. I have not yet completed the work halfway.</p>
      <p>Faithfully greet Erasmus, Megander, Bibliander, Pellican, Gwalther, for me, and finally everyone. Everyone greets you.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, the last day of January - I received yours at 7 a.m., I closed this at 10 a.m. - 1544.</p>
      <p>I will write to Gyron, Hagius, Haller, Gravenried, and finally greet all the pious for us all.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger from the heart.</p>
      <p>[To the?] most illustrious in piety and lineage [... man?] Eberhard von [Rümlang], friend and [brother?] most dear. Treasurer in Bern.</p>
