      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Heinrich Lüthi wishes Christ's happiness from the heart.</p>
      <p>I was indeed very much delighted not long ago for two reasons, as soon as a certain rumor spread among us that you, Zwingli's successor (whose untimely death almost kills me), have taken on the task of preaching the gospel in Zürich—a task certainly difficult, but honorable. Partly because of the happiness of your church, knowing that it is well provided for, having received such a faithful and vigilant pastor by God's goodness, and partly because I hope that we, who preach the gospel in the Zürich area, are quite fortunate to have found another patron to whom we can turn in uncertain matters or if anything else presses, as to the last, as they say, anchor. You will indeed strive with all your might to adorn your office and act as such a bishop as many promise themselves you will be, namely prudent, pure, incorrupt, wonderfully devoted to public peace, modest, who by your modesty will lead even the ill-disposed and resistant to embrace the truth, which indeed often has more power than the importunate vehemence and biting criticism of some who attack sinners. With a certain prudence, you know that speech must be tempered, so that freedom does not turn into insult, nor levity into flattery or fear.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dearest Heinrich, Michael Schlatter, a man deeply learned in both divine and human letters, has repeatedly asked me to commend him to you; which I have recently promised to do in a letter to him, knowing that all the best are otherwise most commendable to you. He has indeed persuaded himself that by my testimony he will become more commendable to your humanity and to the other brothers who are there. Therefore, I did not want to fail the man's trust, since his learning and piety in Christ are worthy of being cherished and supported by all truly pious people. If my authority will be of little value to you, perhaps the familiarity that has existed between you and him for some years now, when you both diligently studied Greek letters in Zürich, will make up for it, certainly with great praise and no less increase of fruit. This brother of ours is indeed in a place where many oppose the truth, soon to rebuild an altar and soon also to perform sacred rites. They are already inquiring about some priest, whom, once they have found, they will soon begin their impiety, these ill-disposed men. If this happens, which he entirely fears will happen, it will be next that he will be forced either to share his annual pension, which barely suffices for him, with the priest or to completely change his place, which makes the good man in need of both advice and help. I would like you to assist him in such a way that he feels that some consolation has come to him through my recommendation, especially if you ever learn that our Michael has been removed from the preaching office, which is likely, then at least show that humanity which you are accustomed to against all. He will need another position, which allows him to sustain the necessities of life with his wife and children.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and may the best and greatest God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>On the eve of the Circumcision of Christ, as the year 1532 was just at the door.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and the whole family in my words, wishing them to celebrate this Christmas and many others as happily as possible, with all my heart, and your studies to flourish with eternal praise and glory, which may the gods grant you to increase by shaping and forging for the progress of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>To the learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most eloquent preacher of the divine word in Zürich, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
