      <p>Greetings. I would have responded to your previous letters, had not the departure of Mr. Bassefontani kept me in suspense. For he had confirmed in one or two letters that he would come to Zürich, and I had promised that I would also travel there out of a desire to see you. There are many things, my dear Bullinger, which cannot be entrusted to letters, especially by me, about which I wish to speak more freely with you at some point. However, I would not want you to think me so foolish as to wish to compete as a novice with a veteran or unarmed with an armed man. Therefore, I will always regard you and others like you as teachers. I owe you a great deal for informing me about German affairs, the outcome of which you fear no less than I do. See if there is any way I can repay the favor. Forgive the brevity of the letter. I wrote this just before mounting my horse. You know that the Sienese territory has been pacified by the emperor's army, which returned hastily to Naples.</p>
      <p>Our forces in Piedmont have taken the city of Cuneo, a place of no small importance, capturing or killing all those who were in its garrison. Thus, blood and calamities are everywhere. I do not wish to reopen my wound by recalling the disaster at Thérouanne. The commander and a good part of those who fell (fighting bravely and vigorously) were either related to me by blood or closer kinship, and some were also bound to me by duty and friendship. There are serious negotiations about peace between the Turkish and Persian kings. The fleet of the former set sail from Constantinople on June 2nd under the command of Dragut. Farewell. In great haste, Chur, July 10th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Jean Du Fraisse, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
