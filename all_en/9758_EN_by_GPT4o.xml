      <p>S. The day before yesterday, the very sad news reached us that your city has more than half burned down suddenly, and that the fire also reached your house, but fortunately did not harm you much. And because you too have become a participant in this public calamity, I believe you are more disturbed than you would have wanted and could have described this sad event in the letter you sent me.</p>
      <p>However, I ask you to describe to me the true story of yourself, especially because of those who tell different stories and speculate variously about this fire. I believe that not only you but also we are being admonished from heaven to repentance and true conversion to God, and the Lord will not abandon those who think they have perished completely, provided they diligently call upon the Lord. It will be your duty, above all, to encourage the afflicted fearlessly and steadfastly to have good hope in God, to patience, etc. If you are strong and fearless in spirit, your steadfastness will encourage many. Believe me, my dear Tobias, beloved brother, I grieve for your situation from the heart and pray to the Lord to comfort and restore you all.</p>
      <p>Our neighbors are preparing for war, intending to lead a legion into France; it is not clear enough for what purpose, except perhaps to slaughter the remnants of the faithful. The living just avenger lives, to whom I commit this matter, beseeching him to comfort and preserve his own.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all the pious men and our friends, whom you will greet in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, very hastily, July 30, 1574. All of ours greet you and yours, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my kind lord and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
