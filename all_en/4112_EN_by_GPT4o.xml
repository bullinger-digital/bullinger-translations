      <p>Greetings. At present, I do not have much to write, except that the Duke of Savoy has canceled the day of the assembly set in Neuchâtel for our people, citing illness and occupations, and has not set another date in the meantime. Our people would like him to postpone everything until the Greek calends, yet they wonder what this cancellation means; for it is said that he is gathering an army, indeed he already has it ready in Piedmont. What the outcome will be, the Lord knows; may He be with us.</p>
      <p>He writes otherwise very kindly to our people.</p>
      <p>I am returning Fabricius's letters to you and thank you for sharing them. From France, we have nothing except that the cardinals are contemplating only this one thing: that Geneva should be destroyed. May the Lord thwart their plans and preserve His church.</p>
      <p>We hear that there are some disturbances among the people of Trier for the sake of religion; however, we do not have a certain account. If you have anything, please share it with us.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their kindest regards to you, Diesbach, Haller, Hagius, Tremp, who is almost at death's door. Give our regards to all of yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 24, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his honorable lord and compatriot. Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
