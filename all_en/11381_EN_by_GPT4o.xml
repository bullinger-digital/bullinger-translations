    <p xml:id="regest1">We have heard with sorrow that he is being asked to accept the doctoral degree and thus act against his well-founded conviction; the people of Zurich support him in resigning from his position rather than obeying, as otherwise not only his reputation but also the freedom of the Church would suffer. It is not really about the titles - concessions could be conceivable in this matter - but about an oligarchic rule of the university over the Church, which contradicts the stance of Paul and the practices of the Early Church and would lead to the decline of the Christian community, even if better men were leading the school than in Basel at the beginning of the Reformation; if Grynäus does not give in and perhaps even has to leave the city, God will support him. They suggest that he present the issue of titles to the council and ask for free exercise of his office or otherwise for dismissal; he should also warn against placing the supervision of the Church in the hands of a few. Since Myconius, Markus [Bertschi], and the other [pastors] are equally at risk, they should also explain to the council that they cannot subordinate themselves to the university and would therefore ask for their dismissal; in this case, they would account to their congregation and entrust them to God, but otherwise be gladly obedient. Should the council still not relent, God will punish the proud. To avoid unrest, the people of Zurich write to Grynäus personally, but he may show the letter at his discretion; they would also be willing to temporarily accommodate him and his colleagues. Greetings and an exhortation to fearlessness.</p>

      <p>We have heard with the greatest sorrow that the patrons of titles have progressed in their audacity to the point where they demand that you, who have so far stood against them along with your fellow reformers as a man, become a doctor yourself. This means that you would testify against yourself in front of the entire church and destroy and overturn with your actions what you have solidly constructed with sound reasoning before the senate and selected learned men. Thus, you would confirm their wicked counsel with your deed for posterity, while in the meantime stripping yourself of all your authority among present men, indeed offering yourself as defeated and mocked by adversaries, and to be reproached by friends. But thanks be to the Lord, who in His mercy suggested to you that it is better to lay down your office than to obey cunning and rash edicts. We too would see it necessary to do the same if the same were demanded of us. For you see what the ultimate end of this fate of yours will be, namely the injury to your name and reputation, which you have hitherto enjoyed as most intact and innocent among all good people, and above all the oppression of Christian liberty and ecclesiastical judgment.</p>
      <p>For it is not about the titles of doctors or masters here, which, where, when, and by whom they were born, what benefit they have brought to the church, what loss, or how conveniently the church could do without them, and whether a good man could accept them for the time being and for the opportunity of doing better. Perhaps here something could be dispensed with and some concession made to custom, if, I say, in this way you do not aid the malevolent and their evil counsels at all, but can more conveniently use your ministry among troublesome men in the church and dispense the gifts entrusted to you by the Lord to those who do not have them. However, it is more about the confirmation of certain very bad affections, indeed about an oligarchy, that is, about the domination of the school over the church of Christ and over the preachers of the word. This is far removed from all sound reason, from the customs of the early and purer church, from the example of the most holy men, when even Paul wants to be judged by the church and those sitting, Paul, I say, the doctor of the Gentiles. Nor do we think that among any sacred historians there is any ancient church that was ever subject to the school. The schools were indeed enclosures of disciples, especially seminaries of churchmen and certain members or portions of the church, and those who were called from them to greater things, that is, to ecclesiastical ministries, were ministers of the church, not lords, nor was the judgment of the church in their hands, but, as we have just said, in the hands of the church and those sitting. But if at this time the heads of your school were the best men, which the Lord knows what they are like, it is nevertheless the worst and most dangerous example to entrust all judgment, all authority over ecclesiastical matters to those few. We have seen even in Basel what kind of people sometimes ruled the school, how much trouble they caused to the growing gospel. We can also conjecture that Satan is not so barren of such offspring that it is undoubtedly necessary to expect certain ruin for the Christian republic if the judgment of the church, which is the spirit, and the right and liberty of the church are handed over to a few. Therefore, no good, prudent, pious, and Christian man can approve and confirm such an institution by his deed, and for this reason, you too must rather lay down your office or even change the city itself than admit what is connected with such great danger to the church and such great disgrace. We know indeed that this counsel is quite harsh; yet on the other hand, we do not ignore that the Lord, if you entrust yourself and the business of His church to His own protection and act here with a sincere mind, will not fail you and will give you a happier outcome than we could have wished for you.</p>
      <p>Now concerning the manner and way of laying down the office or retaining it with the safety of the republic of Christ and all good people, this is what we thought to suggest to you. Since you did not usurp this office by your own authority, but received the function when called by the magistrate, we think the whole matter should be referred to the senate in such a way that you approach them, plainly and freely explain the matter of the titles, where and by whom and when they were born, what they have brought to the church, how unnecessary they are and not even of great benefit, etc., and therefore pray that they do not allow you to be burdened with titles; you wish to serve the Basel church faithfully in the Lord, if it is permitted to you as freely as it has been so far; if not, you ask for your dismissal from them with their good grace. And here we think it should be added gravely how dangerous it is to place the right, liberty, judgment, and ecclesiastical discipline in the hands of a few. By religion and faith in God, in the church, and the people of Basel, you cannot and will not do this. The Lord will show a place and people who will appreciate faithful labor and diligence with a grateful and fair mind.</p>
      <p>And since, whether Grynäus is overcome and forced to leave or to concede to unjust and pernicious institutions, the same danger awaits Myconius, Markus [Bertschi], and all others who wish the church's affairs to be safe, we judge that now the forces should be joined and that it can be done in time, so that with the same mind and purpose they too approach the senate in this very cause and also express their opinion on the titles and governance of the school and church, and that they cannot approve those decrees and institutions of the university either by consent or by word or deed, and therefore they too ask for the opportunity to leave, wherever the Lord may call them. Finally, they will address the church, so that it too may know the reasons for their actions, at the same time exhorting them to continue in the truth they have recognized, so that they commend them to the Lord and themselves also to the prayers and grace of the church. Unless perhaps the senate sees it otherwise at this time, for you will obey it with an even mind in this matter, as you wish for the tranquility and integrity of the republic, not for disturbances.</p>
      <p>If the magistrate sees this, if he has any soundness, he will depart from his purpose and retain you and the whole church intact. If not, your deed will have excuse and praise before God and men. Meanwhile, let some rejoice and triumph with Aman-like pride. The Lord, however, is the one who judges justly, who resists the proud, gives grace to the humble. As no one escapes Him, so no one deceives Him. He will destroy, as is His ancient custom, all those who, overcome by the affection of the flesh, disturb the house of the Lord. You also know, brothers, that saying of the Lord: "He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." Those who now strive to please men will at some point please neither God nor men, nor even the wicked themselves always.</p>
      <p>And because it seemed that this matter should be settled without commotion and complaints, we decided to write this counsel to you alone, yet in such a way that you may share it with whomever you wish and with those among whom you believe it will be valued. For we do not ignore that our name is unpleasant to some. May the Lord be with you with His spirit and lead this matter to the glory of His name and the benefit of His church. This we will undoubtedly obtain from Him with faithful and constant prayers. Amen. But if it will be necessary to leave the soil after being dismissed by them, we offer you, brothers, ourselves and all that we are and can do, until it pleases the Lord to restore you to His ministry, to which you have been called.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and act fearlessly in the business of our Lord, so that when the judge comes to judge the world by fire, you may feel refreshment in Him. Amen.</p>
