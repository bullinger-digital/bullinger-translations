      <p>Most honorable and esteemed Lord.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received yesterday's letter from my lord Coignet. Now, as he was compelled to ride, he ordered me to write this to you and to send the speech given by my lord Beza, and to greet you in his name. Farewell and again farewell, and consider me your most obedient servant.</p>
      <p>At Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on the 20th of September, 1561. Your most obedient, Jean Boutin.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
