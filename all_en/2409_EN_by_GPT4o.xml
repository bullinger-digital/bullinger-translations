      <p>Then I write, most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, when the opportunity of messengers presents itself; otherwise, you would see my letters more frequently, as I love and respect you so much. To your letters, which you recently gave to my messenger to be delivered, although they were very abundant, there are few things to which I must respond.</p>
      <p>The prince postpones the journey to Ferdinand. Molinaeus will leave the day after tomorrow, although after asking for permission to depart, he regretted it and tried to stay; such is the man.</p>
      <p>God knows how much I grieve for his situation, and I have never abandoned him; but he completely refuses to follow the advice of friends. You wrote about these two matters, and I have responded.</p>
      <p>Perhaps together with Molinaeus or not long after, I am compelled to return to Strasbourg for the cause of Christ; you will know later and praise it, I am sure. On this occasion, I hope to have some Latin works printed either in Strasbourg or Basel. It is certain that on my return I wish to visit that good Bullinger without a doubt.</p>
      <p>Since I do not have time to write to Galitius now, I beg you to inform him as soon as possible that I recently obtained from the prince what he wished for his son, that he be admitted to the new school established in Stuttgart, from where later, although a foreigner, he will be admitted to a stipend; the prince, I say, most graciously granted it. I will write about where and when he should send the boy.</p>
      <p>On the same day, I obtained two hundred florins to be distributed among the poorer English exiles, who were sent to Strasbourg a few days ago. I hope consideration will be given to those who are with you, and that the prince will give more. To whom I wish you to convey my greetings in my name and promise solemnly that I will not fail them. On the same day, his highness increased something for me, not asking, to my old condition, and furthermore gave me the enjoyment of an excellent vineyard, which is within the walls and formerly belonged to the Augustinian monks, producing excellent and plentiful wine, which has increased the envy of many against me. In summary: I now enjoy greater happiness with this prince than ever before, thanks be to God. You will hear in person that we indeed have a good brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Count Georg arrived, who spoke much with me, as we happened to be hunting. He asked me, I say, asked me well twice, to write to you that he wishes you very well, and since you have dedicated a book to him and he has given nothing so far, he does not want you to go away without a gift. And when I replied with what I know you would want to be said on your behalf in such a matter, he insisted that he would not allow it, but would do something, I know not what. He sends you his most loving greetings. When I come to Strasbourg, I will write whether I will stay there long or indeed in Basel, so that you can write back to me. I beg you, send this to Mr. Bassaf[ontaneum]. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church. Pray for me with everyone. TÃ¼bingen, 28th September 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>The people of Ulm, having cast aside their fear of the Emperor, have finally decided to restore their churches. They are now anxiously seeking pastors for towns and villages; they had long ago rejected the Interimists from the main church, thanks be to God. All of Austria recently petitioned Ferdinand for at least communion under both kinds; I have a copy of the supplication. The king responded that he would deliberate and did not dare to deny it outright.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
