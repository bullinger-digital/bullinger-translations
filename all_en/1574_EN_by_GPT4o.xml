      <p>Greetings. Most humane and in every way most excellent man, the reason I have not written to you for a long time is that I do not wish to trouble you with my trifles while you are engaged in serious and important matters. But even now I regret this prolixity, although necessity compels me to be more lengthy. However, I will omit prefaces and other interjections, content with a single narrative, simple and true. First, Master Johannes Metzperger, that brother from Augsburg, has left the church to which he was appointed by us and has returned to St. Gallen, weary of our Rhaetia, because his dearly beloved wife was taken from him by death there. Therefore, that church is seeking another preacher who is not unsuitable. For they are people who think highly of themselves and disdain to accept just anyone. The same Metzperger sent us from St. Gallen two others, formerly colleagues in Augsburg, to be appointed by us to churches somewhere, and specifically to his own. Although we like them (especially the elder one, who was with you, a man both pious and learned, and now in great need), mindful of our promise and wishing to satisfy your request, we did not want to send them anywhere in our Confederation, but to wait for the one recommended by you and to commend the one you send to that church (which is in the Rhine Valley with us).</p>
      <p>Therefore, send him to us immediately if you wish, or write back with this messenger what the matter is. For we have replied to those two that we have written to you before, and therefore cannot send others until we receive a response from you. You will understand the rest. But so you know: in our Confederation, neither the bishop, I mean the Roman one, nor ours nor anyone else has the power to confer parishes and appoint parish priests; but the power to accept or reject parish priests lies entirely with each individual church. I tell you this so you know that we act only by request with the communities, not by command. If, therefore, the one sent by you comes, we will ask the community for him; the authority to accept him or not will be with that church. I will add this, which I know you will hear unwillingly: there are many churches in our Confederation, both of the pope and of Christ, which have long lacked a parish priest, and the blind and greedy do not grieve over it. We complain about this daily, sometimes even before the assembled lords of the Three Leagues; but, as they say, we tell the story to a deaf man. - Our Vergerius, when he was recently hurrying to Zurich, passing through here, took with him Johannes Andreae Paravicini here and there, a man certainly not inelegant in learning nor unsuitable. He was elected and appointed preacher of the divine word by the church of Caspan (which is in the Valtellina, where he is from), to which they have now begun to adhere. He, I say, when he was here at the fair of St. Paul with Vergerius, said he had come to us to clear his church and himself of the mark of schism, which some were branding them with for no other reason than that they had received Camillus Renatus, who had fled to them, into their community, a man alien to all heresy, miserable and in need of help, and not trivially adorned with letters. Therefore, he asked us, who had already heard him, for letters by which he might be approved and confirmed as orthodox to his church. We, having heard the man's defense and his plainly Christian confession of faith, wanting to hear more from him than he had said, so that we might approve him in all things, examined the man a little more attentively. We found him not a little infected with the heresies of Sabellius and Helvidius, since he was unwilling to confess or accept the Trinity and the distinction of those persons of the deity, nor the perpetual virginity of the divine Mary. He did indeed say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (words also found in the Gospel) were one God, but that the three distinct persons were not handed down to us in the scriptures. And he conceded that the Lord's mother Mary conceived and gave birth to the Lord Jesus as a virgin; but that it could not be proved from the scriptures that she remained a virgin even after that birth, and therefore he omitted it as a curious and superfluous matter, not wanting to inquire into it, as it was of no concern to Christians. Not yet finished: he was unwilling to admit that our souls live after the death of the body, although we could not extract anything certain from him on this point; for when asked, he would ask in turn, always inquiring (as if wanting to drive a nail with a nail) what the soul was.</p>
      <p>He distinguished, I don't know what, between the soul and the mind. The latter, indeed, he said did not perish, but as for the soul, he did not know what it was; therefore, he could not affirm anything about it. You can judge the rest, as they say, from the lion by its claws. Father Comander, Johannes Ponticella, and I (for the other brothers had not yet arrived, and he and Vergerius said they could not wait longer) pronounced that he, unwilling to confess or be taught these things, was by no means to be approved. Vergerius thought he should be confirmed, for he was a learned man, of honest life, from a noble and powerful family, dear to his church, suitable for teaching; he would soon return to the right path and not adhere to those articles permanently.</p>
      <p>He said he would deal with him about changing his opinion, only we should commend the man to his church; if we did not, we would incur great hatred from all the pious of that church, and many such words, as he often does, repeated with many words to the point of satiety. We considered that those good things the man had would not result in gain, but in detriment to orthodox piety, for, as the saying of the mime goes, the better he is in art, the worse he is; therefore, we stood firm in our opinion. Seeing that we could not be moved from our place, they immediately set out for Zurich, as if to act against us. Vergerius, more fervent, wrote a rather long letter to our synod from the road: it appeared that we, who preach in Chur, were aiming for some kind of superiority among the preachers, that we were dragging all cases and matters that happen in the Confederation throughout the year to Chur and wanted them to be dealt with and judged there; which certainly his Italian brothers would not allow, nor would he consent to, that some of ours (meaning the Churians) should establish some kind of primacy and make a certain church, as it were, greater than others and the first seat; let the brothers beware, and many such words of a disturbed and agitated mind.</p>
      <p>What reason he has for doing this besides the aforementioned, please understand: Vergerius, more than once in the name of his Italians, asked that they be allowed to hold synods and chapters separately without us, without other native ecclesiastics in the Three Leagues, because of the diversity of language and the difficulties of travel. Not only we Churians, but all who preach the gospel in the Confederation, refused. After this, Vergerius, for the third time this winter, accused one of our ministers of being an Anabaptist and a papist. We, acting more leniently in the case, because that minister was praised to us by certain testimonies of the pious and truly learned, displeased Vergerius. Therefore, impatient of delay, he asked us to allow him and other Italians to dispute and deal with him. We Churians refused, but rather ordered that they come here to Chur, where other brothers might also gather; there the matter would be known by all. This would also be safer for the Italians, for many threaten them with exile; let them act together with us. This displeased Vergerius. Would that you knew how the Italians never cease to quarrel with us over trifles, which all the churches of Christ hold! Would that Vergerius were quieter and did not always seek knots in a bulrush and remembered that: It is better to be idle than to do nothing! Let him persuade himself that the sky will not fall, even if he, another Atlas, does not support it with his shoulders! What do you want? That I should love smoke-sellers? I tell you all this candidly, to provoke your judgment, whether you also think we erred in not wanting to receive into our fellowship a man unwilling to confess those three persons of the deity, nor the perpetual virginity of the Virgin Mary, nor freely assert the life of souls. Such things seemed to us like a paved road and an open window for more heresies to be secretly introduced. Farewell, most excellent man. Father Comander, Johannes Ponticella, who commends himself to you, a man certainly of integrity, bid you farewell greatly. Our lord vicar Bartholom√§us Castelmur has died. No news here. From Chur, on the 23rd day of February in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Heinrich Bullinger in every way.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
