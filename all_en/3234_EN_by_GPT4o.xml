      <p>Honorable, well-learned sir and godfather, knowing that the bearer of this letter appeared before us here in Chur and sought our advice on a matter according to the contents of the enclosed note, to which we have responded with appropriate counsel, as this note indicates, yet subject to your correction, as you are better informed on these matters than we are. However, we believe we have given him a reasonable answer, about which he or anyone else should have no complaint. If, however, it does not meet with your approval, our request and plea to you is that you keep it in your hands; otherwise, if it seems good to you, let the bearer of this letter know, so that he knows how to proceed. He himself will report to you further orally. His request is, if it were possible for him, to bring his wife into the church in the territory of our gracious lords of Zürich. Our request to you is that you advise him on what you think is the best course of action, and if it is not possible for you, at least provide him with guidance on how to proceed further according to the circumstances. With this, we commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur on the 5th of July, in the year of our Lord 1557. Hans Schmid, your always willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich, his kind lord and godfather, to respond.</p>
